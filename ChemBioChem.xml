         <title>Prelabeling Expansion Single&#8208;Molecule Localization Microscopy with Minimal Linkage Error</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keeping it all together: Single&#8208;molecule expansion microscopy can reach a resolution on the molecular scale that is challenged by labeling density and linkage error. We introduce a biotinylizable peptide tag and gel&#8208;linkable fluorescent streptavidin that enable a fixed 5&#8208;nm linkage between a fluorophore and a protein of interest in a cell.







Abstract
Expansion microscopy combined with single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (ExSMLM) has a potential for approaching molecular resolution. However, ExSMLM faces multiple challenges such as loss of fluorophores and proteins during polymerization, digestion or denaturation, and an increase in linkage error arising from the distance between the fluorophore and the target molecule. Here, we introduce a trifunctional streptavidin to link the target, fluorophore and gel matrix via a biotinylizable peptide tag. The resultant ExSMLM images of vimentin filaments demonstrated high labeling efficiency and a minimal linkage error of &#8764;5&#8197;nm. Our ExSMLM provides a simple and practical means for fluorescence imaging with molecular resolution.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Semi&#8208;synthesis Enables Efficient Production of Isotopically Labeled &#945;&#8208;Synuclein with Site&#8208;Specific Tyrosine Phosphorylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several strategies for producing &#945;&#8208;synuclein phosphorylated at Tyr39 (&#945;S&#8208;pY39) are compared, and the value of a chemoenzymatic strategy with one&#8208;pot ligation is demonstrated, in particular for producing 15N&#8208;labeled protein for NMR studies.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) can affect the normal function and pathology of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;S), an amyloid&#8208;fibril&#8208;forming protein linked to Parkinson's disease. Phosphorylation of &#945;S Tyr39 has recently been found to display a dose&#8208;dependent effect on fibril formation kinetics and to alter the morphology of the fibrils. Existing methods to access site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated &#945;S for biochemical studies include total or semi&#8208;synthesis by native chemical ligation (NCL) as well as chemoenzymatic methods to phosphorylate peptides, followed by NCL. Here, we investigated a streamlined method to produce large quantities of phosphorylated &#945;S by co&#8208;expressing a kinase with a protein fragment in Escherichia coli. We also introduced the use of methyl thioglycolate (MTG) to enable one&#8208;pot NCL and desulfurization. We compare our optimized methods to previous reports and show that we can achieve the highest yields of site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated protein through chemoenzymatic methods using MTG, and that our strategy is uniquely well suited to producing 15N&#8208;labeled, phosphorylated protein for NMR studies.

         <title>Targeting the Surface of the Protein 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 by Ultrasmall (1.5&#8197;nm) Gold Nanoparticles Carrying the Specific Peptide CRaf</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tiny, but targeted: The protein 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 is targeted by 18 CRaf peptide ligands on the surface of an ultrasmall gold nanoparticle (ca. 115 gold atoms). ITC and fluorescence polarization spectroscopy demonstrate an efficient supramolecular binding between nanoparticle and protein. The easy uptake of nanoparticles by cells opens up the possibility of targeting proteins inside cells.







Abstract
The surface of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles with an average diameter of 1.55&#8197;nm was conjugated with a 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 protein&#8208;binding peptide derived from CRaf. Each particle carries 18 CRaf peptides, leading to an overall stoichiometry of Au(115)Craf(18). The binding to the protein 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 was probed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and fluorescence polarization spectroscopy (FP). The dissociation constant (KD) was measured as 5.0&#8197;&#956;M by ITC and 0.9&#8197;&#956;M by FP, which was close to the affinity of dissolved CRaf to 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963;. In contrast to dissolved CRaf, which alone did not enter HeLa cells, CRAF&#8208;conjugated gold nanoparticles were well taken up by HeLa cells, opening the opportunity to target the protein inside a cell.

         <title>Remote Water&#8208;Mediated Proton Transfer Triggers Inter&#8208;Cu Electron Transfer: Nitrite Reduction Activation in Copper&#8208;Containing Nitrite Reductase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going for the triple: Copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase catalyzes the biological conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide, in which the driving force for electron transfer from T1Cu to T2Cu comes from the remote water&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton transfer from Glu113 to an intermediate H2O or from Lys128 to His260.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase (CuNiR) catalyzes the biological conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide; key long&#8208;range electron/proton transfers are involved in the catalysis. However, the details of the electron&#8208;/proton&#8208;transfer mechanism are still unknown. In particular, the driving force of the electron transfer from the type&#8208;1 copper (T1Cu) site to the type&#8208;2 copper (T2Cu) site is ambiguous. Here, we explored the two possible proton&#8208;transfer channels, the high&#8208;pH proton channel and the primary proton channel, by using two&#8208;layered ONIOM calculations. Our calculation results reveal that the driving force for electron transfer from T1Cu to T2Cu comes from a remote water&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer mechanism. In the high&#8208;pH proton channel, the water&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton transfer occurs from Glu113 to an intermediate water molecule, whereas in the primary channel, the transfer is from Lys128 to His260. Subsequently, the two channels employ another two or three distinct proton&#8208;transfer steps to deliver the proton to the nitrite substrate at the T2Cu site. These findings explain the detailed proton&#8208;/electron&#8208;transfer mechanisms of copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase and could extend our understanding of the diverse proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer mechanisms in complicated proteins.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Free Synthesis of Selenoproteins in High Yield and Purity for Selective Protein Tagging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
34Se&#8208;lective protein tagging: Cell&#8208;free protein synthesis is used to produce selenoproteins in high yield and purity. Selenocysteine has long been recognized as offering an exquisitely reactive chemical handle for chemical modifications of proteins, and we show that the alkylation of solvent&#8208;exposed selenol groups with a chloro&#8208;alkyl group proceeds quickly under conditions that leaves cysteine residues unchanged.







Abstract
The selenol group of selenocysteine is much more nucleophilic than the thiol group of cysteine. Selenocysteine residues in proteins thus offer reactive points for rapid post&#8208;translational modification. Herein, we show that selenoproteins can be expressed in high yield and purity by cell&#8208;free protein synthesis by global substitution of cysteine by selenocysteine. Complete alkylation of solvent&#8208;exposed selenocysteine residues was achieved in 10 minutes with 4&#8208;chloromethylene dipicolinic acid (4Cl&#8208;MDPA) under conditions that left cysteine residues unchanged even after overnight incubation. GdIII&#8722;GdIII distances measured by double electron&#8211;electron resonance (DEER) experiments of maltose binding protein (MBP) containing two selenocysteine residues tagged with 4Cl&#8208;MDPA&#8208;GdIII were indistinguishable from GdIII&#8722;GdIII distances measured of MBP containing cysteine reacted with 4Br&#8208;MDPA tags.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selenol group of selenocysteine is much more nucleophilic than the thiol group of cysteine. Selenocysteine residues in proteins thus offer reactive points for rapid post&#8208;translational modification. Herein, we show that selenoproteins can be expressed in high yield and purity by cell&#8208;free protein synthesis by global substitution of cysteine by selenocysteine. Complete alkylation of solvent&#8208;exposed selenocysteine residues was achieved in 10 minutes with 4&#8208;chloromethylene dipicolinic acid (4Cl&#8208;MDPA) under conditions that left cysteine residues unchanged even after overnight incubation. Gd&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;Gd&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; distances measured by double electron&#8211;electron resonance (DEER) experiments of maltose binding protein (MBP) containing two selenocysteine residues tagged with 4Cl&#8208;MDPA&#8208;Gd&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; were indistinguishable from Gd&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;Gd&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; distances measured of MBP containing cysteine reacted with 4Br&#8208;MDPA tags.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>The development of metal&#8208;based anticancer drugs has been hampered, among other reasons, by their lack of selectivity for cancer cells. In a recent article, Zou and co&#8208;workers presented the successful intracellular activation of organogold(I) complexes for potential cancer treatment through Pd(II)&#8208;mediated transmetallation, overcoming some off&#8208;target activity of novel gold&#8208;based drugs. This unique strategy builds the perfect bridge between metallodrugs usage and bioorthogonal intracellular catalysis for more advanced and selective therapies. Such an approach will hopefully pave the way for forthcoming studies in medicinal inorganic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;stage hydrocarbon conjugation and cyclization in synthetic peptides and proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional S&#8208;alkylation of cysteine relies upon using activated electrophiles. Here we demonstrate high yielding and selective S&#8208;alkylation and S&#8208;lipidation of cysteines in unprotected synthetic peptides and proteins using weak electrophiles and a Zn2+ promoter. Linear or branched iodoalkanes can S&#8208;alkylate cysteine in an unprotected 38&#8208;residue Myc peptide fragment and in a 91&#8208;residue mini&#8208;protein Omomyc, highlighting selective late&#8208;stage synthetic modifications. Metal&#8208;assisted cysteine alkylation is also effective for incorporating dehydroalanine into unprotected peptides and for peptide cyclization via aliphatic thioether&#8208;crosslinks, including customising macrocycles to stabilize helical peptides for enhanced uptake and delivery to proteins inside cells. Chemoselective and efficient late&#8208;stage Zn2+&#8208;promoted cysteine alkylation in unprotected peptides and proteins promises many useful applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenoxy Radical Reactivity of Nucleic Acids: Practical Implications for Biotinylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme&#8208;catalyzed phenoxy radical biotinylation, an increasingly important tool in biotechnology and molecular biology applications, is here shown to label guanosine bases in RNA, but not in DNA, under defined conditions. Remarkably, common fluorescein conjugates of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides are found to undergo facile biotinylation on fluorescein with retention of fluorescence. This convenient observation points to a variety of practical applications of peroxidase&#8208;catalyzed chemistry for analysis of DNA conjugates in vitro and in cells.







Abstract
Recent advances in peroxidase&#8208;mediated biotin tyramide (BT) signal amplification technology have resulted in high&#8208;resolution and subcellular compartment&#8208;specific mapping of protein and RNA localization. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the presence of H2O2 is known to activate phenolic compounds for phenoxy radical reaction with nucleic acids, where biotinylation by BT is a practical example. BT reactivity with RNA and DNA is not understood in detail. We report that BT phenoxy radicals react in a sequence&#8208;independent manner with guanosine bases in RNA. In contrast, DNA reactivity with BT cannot be detected by our methods under the same conditions. Remarkably, we show that fluorescein conjugates DNA rapidly and selectively reacts with BT phenoxy radicals, allowing convenient and practical biotinylation of DNA on fluorescein with retention of fluorescence.

         <title>The Peculiar Case of the Hyper&#8208;thermostable Pyrimidine Nucleoside Phosphorylase from Thermus thermophilus**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What? The pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase from Thermus thermophilus is an outlier among its peers. The enzyme is extremely stable and performs remarkably well in near&#8208;boiling, cosolvent&#8208;heavy media, but an apparent inhibition by nucleobases renders its performance in preparative applications rather subpar.







Abstract
The poor solubility of many nucleosides and nucleobases in aqueous solution demands harsh reaction conditions (base, heat, cosolvent) in nucleoside phosphorylase&#8208;catalyzed processes to facilitate substrate loading beyond the low millimolar range. This, in turn, requires enzymes that can withstand these conditions. Herein, we report that the pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase from Thermus thermophilus is active over an exceptionally broad pH (4&#8211;10), temperature (up to 100&#8201;&#176;C) and cosolvent space (up to 80&#8201;% (v/v) nonaqueous medium), and displays tremendous stability under harsh reaction conditions with predicted total turnover numbers of more than 106 for various pyrimidine nucleosides. However, its use as a biocatalyst for preparative applications is critically limited due to its inhibition by nucleobases at low concentrations, which is unprecedented among nonspecific pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylases.

         <title>Chemical Labeling of Protein 4&#8242;&#8208;Phosphopantetheinylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally diverse chemical probes have been used to label protein 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheinylation. Herein, we review how CoA analogs could be incorporated by highly promiscuous phosphopantetheinyl transferases (PPTases) and used for in&#8197;situ labeling of the membrane proteins fused with acceptor tags. These cell&#8208;permeable pantetheine analogs facilitated the metabolic labeling of the endogenous substrates in both bacterial and mammalian cells.







Abstract
Nature uses a diverse array of protein post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) to regulate protein structure, activity, localization, and function. Among them, protein 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheinylation derived from coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential PTM for the biosynthesis of fatty acids, polyketides, and nonribosomal peptides in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. To explore its functions, various chemical probes mimicking the natural structure of 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheinylation have been developed. In this minireview, we summarize these chemical probes and describe their applications in direct and metabolic labeling of proteins in bacterial and mammalian cells.

         <title>Metal Ion Promiscuity and Structure of 2,3&#8208;Dihydroxybenzoic Acid Decarboxylase of Aspergillus oryzae</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzoic acid decarboxylases have been explored as efficient biocatalysts for the (de)carboxylation of electron&#8208;rich (hetero)aromatics. As members of the amidohydrolase superfamily, these enzymes share considerable structural and mechanistic features including the requirement of a divalent metal ion for catalysis. SEC&#8208;coupled ICPMS/MS measurements as well as crystal structure&#8208;based quantum chemical calculations revealed that two different metal ions (Mn2+ and Mg2+) can be embedded as catalytically active species in the active site of 2,3&#8208;dihydroxybenzoic acid decarboxylase from Aspergillus oryzae. The ability to utilise both Mn2+ and Mg2+ is illustrated by the two differently coloured half&#8208;spheres in the active centre of the enzyme. More information can be found in the communication by F. Himo, S.&#8197;M. Gl&#252;ck et&#8197;al.

         <title>Directed Evolution of a Cp*RhIII&#8208;Linked Biohybrid Catalyst Based on a Screening Platform with Affinity Purification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising way to enable abiotic C(sp2)&#8722;H bond functionalization in a protein matrix is by directed evolution of a biohybrid catalyst harboring a transition metal catalyst. The catalytic activity of Cp*RhIII&#8208;linked nitrobindin (NB) was improved through iterative cycles of directed evolution including conjugation of a Cp*RhIII cofactor as represented by an old&#8208;style lottery wheel in the cover feature artwork. A best evolved &#8220;prize&#8208;winning&#8221; Cp*Rh&#8208;linked NB variant has 4.9&#8208;fold enhanced activity for cycloaddition reactions of acetophenone oximes with alkynes. More information can be found in the full paper by A. Onoda, T. Hayashi, et&#8197;al.

         <title>Challenges of Using Expansion Microscopy for Super&#8208;resolved Imaging of Cellular Organelles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seeing the hidden: In expansion microscopy (ExM) subcellular structures are imaged in isotropically expanded fixed samples, consequently allowing enlarged subcellular structures that would otherwise be hidden to standard microscopy to be resolved. Upon comparison of the expansion factors of different cellular compartments in cells within the same gel, we found significant differences in expansion factors of a factor of above 2. More information can be found in the full paper by K. Reglinski et&#8197;al.

         <title>Effect of methionine sulfoxide on the synthesis and purification of aggregation&#8208;prone peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A two&#8208;step synthesis for methionine&#8208;containing hydrophobic and/or aggregation&#8208;prone peptides is presented that takes advantage of the reversibility of methionine oxidation. The use of polar methionine sulfoxide as a building block in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis improves the synthesis quality and yields of the crude peptide with significantly improved solubility compared to the reduced species. This facilitates the otherwise often laborious peptide purification by high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography. The subsequent reduction proceeds quantitatively. This approach has been optimised with the methionine&#8208;rich Tar&#8208;DNA&#8208;binding protein 43 (307&#8208;347), but is also more generally applicable, as demonstrated with the syntheses of human calcitonin and two aggregation&#8208;prone peptides from the human prion protein.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorophosphonates on&#8208;Demand: A General and Simplified Approach Toward Fluorophosphonate Synthesis</title>

         <dc:description>Herein we report a general and simplified synthesis of fluorophosphonates directly from p&#8208;nitrophenylphosphonates. This FP on&#8208;Demand reaction is mediated by a commercially available polymer&#8208;supported fluoride reagent, which produces a variety (25 examples) of fluorophosphonates in high yields while only requiring reagent filtration for pure fluorophosphonate isolation. This reaction protocol facilitates rapid profiling of serine hydrolases with diverse and novel sets of activated phosphonates with differential proteome reactivity. Moreover, slight modification of the procedure into&#160;a reaction&#8208;to&#8208;assay format has enabled additional screening efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Control of Gelatin Hydrogel Stiffness using DNA Crosslinkers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomaterials with dynamically tunable properties are critical for a range of applications in regenerative medicine and basic biology. In this work, we show the reversible control of gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel stiffness through the use of DNA crosslinkers. We replaced some of the inter&#8208;GelMA crosslinks with double&#8208;stranded DNA, allowing for their removal via toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement. The crosslinks could be restored by adding fresh dsDNA with complementary handles to the hydrogel. The elastic modulus (G&#8217;) of the hydrogels could be tuned between 500 and 1000 Pa, reversibly, over two cycles without degradation of performance. By functionalizing the gels with a second DNA strand, it was possible to control the crosslink density and a model ligand in an orthogonal fashion with two different displacement strands. Our results demonstrate the potential for DNA to reversibly control both stiffness and ligand presentation in a protein&#8208;based hydrogel, and will be useful for teasing apart the spatiotemporal behavior of encapsulated cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Assay for the Detection of Hydrogen Peroxide by Estimating Enzyme Promiscuous Activity in the Perhydrolysis Reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For availability and atom economy, hydrogen peroxide is an ideal oxidant. Due to its diverse roles, the lack of a fast and selective method for hydrogen peroxide detection is a major limitation. Therefore, we have developed an efficient assay for the detection of hydrogen peroxide based on enzyme promiscuity with p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters as substrates.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide is an ideal oxidant in view of its availability, atom economy, or green aspects. Furthermore, it is produced by the cell mitochondria and plays a meaningful role in controlling physiological processes, but its unregulated production leads to the destruction of organs. Due to its diverse roles, a fast and selective method for hydrogen peroxide detection is the major limitation to preventing the negative effects caused by its excess. Therefore, we aimed to develop an efficient assay for the detection of H2O2. For this purpose, we combined the enzymatic method for the detection of hydrogen peroxide with the estimation of the promiscuity of various enzymes. We estimated the activity of an enzyme in the reaction of p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters with hydrogen peroxide resulting in the formation of peracid. To our knowledge, there is no example of a simple, multi&#8208;sensor demonstrating the promiscuous activity of an enzyme and detecting hydrogen peroxide in aqueous media.

         <title>Targeting TRIM Proteins: A quest towards drugging an emerging protein class</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ubiquitination machinery regulates several fundamental biological processes from protein homeostasis to a wide variety of cellular signalling pathways. As a consequence, its dysregulation is linked to diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and autoimmunity. With this review, we aim to highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting E3 ligases with a special focus on an emerging class of RING ligases, named Tri&#8208;Partite Motif (TRIM) proteins, whose role as targets for drug development is currently gaining pharmaceutical attention. TRIM proteins exert their catalytic activity as scaffolds involved in many protein&#8208;protein interactions, whose multi&#8208;domains and adapter&#8208;like nature make their druggability very challenging. Here we report an overview of the current understanding of this class of single polypeptide RING E3 ligases and discuss potential targeting options.</dc:description>

         <title>Fragment&#8208;based nuclear magnetic resonance screen against a Regulator of G Protein Signaling identifies a binding &#8220;hot spot&#8221;</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulator of G Protein Signaling (RGS) proteins have attracted attention as a result of their primary role in directing the specificity as well as temporal and spatial aspects of G protein coupled receptor signaling. In addition, alterations in RGS protein expression have been observed in a number of disease states, including certain cancers. RGS17 is of particular interest as&#160;it has been demonstrated that while RGS17 is normally expressed primarily in the central nervous system, it is found to be inappropriately expressed in lung, prostate, breast, cervical, and hepatocellular carcinomas. Overexpression of RGS17 leads to dysfunction in inhibitory G protein signaling and an overproduction of&#160;cAMP, which in turn alters the transcription patterns of proteins known to promote various cancer types. Suppressing RGS17 expression with RNAi&#160;has been found to decrease tumorigenesis and sufficiently prevents cancer cell migration, leading to the hypothesis that inhibiting&#160;RGS17 function could be useful in anticancer therapies. Here, we identified fragments capable of binding the RGS homology (RH) domain of RGS17 using an NMR&#160;fragment&#8208;based screening approach. By chemical shift mapping of the&#160;  15  N/  1  H&#8208;heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of the backbone&#8208;assigned  15  N&#8208;labeled RGS17&#8208;RH, we determined the fragment binding sites to be distant from the G&#945; interface. Thus, our study identifies a putative fragment binding site on RGS17 that was previously unknown.</dc:description>

         <title>An Economical High&#8208;Throughput &#8220;FP&#8208;Tag&#8221; Assay for Screening Glycosyltransferase Inhibitors**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High performance, low cost: A wash&#8208;free, low&#8208;cost fluorescent&#8208;polarization&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput assay has been developed for O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase. Such an assay is &#8220;catalytic&#8221;, thus only needing minimal amounts of enzymes and could potentially identify inhibitors targeting both the acceptor and donor binding&#8208;sites.







Abstract
O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is involved in many cellular processes, and selective OGT inhibitors are valuable tools to investigate O&#8208;GlcNAcylation functions, and could potentially lead to therapeutics. However, high&#8208;throughput OGT assays that are suitable for large&#8208;scale HTS and can identify inhibitors targeting both acceptor, donor sites, and allosteric binding&#8208;sites are still lacking. Here, we report the development of a high&#8208;throughput &#8220;FP&#8208;Tag&#8221; OGT assay with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a low&#8208;cost and superior &#8220;FP&#8208;Tag&#8221;. With this assay, 2&#8208;methyleurotinone was identified as a low&#8208;micromolar OGT inhibitor. This type of assay with BSA as &#8220;FP&#8208;Tag&#8221; would find more applications with other glycosyltransferases.

         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;electrophilic yet compact, the rigid &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactone (MeLac) warhead creates new opportunities to probe the live&#8208;cell proteome. The MeLac probe reacts with five types of nucleophile on all seven classes of enzymes. Protein structures show reacting residues in red and the probe in blue. On the upper left, a protein directs the tethering of an affinity ligand (yellow) to the probe. More information can be found in the full paper by X. Yao et&#8197;al.

The front cover picture shows a bacterial cell interfaced with an electrochemical setup, driven by renewable energy, and drifting among constellations of biocompatible chemical catalysts. In their minireview, D.&#8197;W. Domaille and K.&#8197;N. Stewart look at the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technology to alter cellular metabolic profiles with electrochemistry, photochemistry, and biocompatible chemical catalysis. In particular, emphasis is placed on how to combine live microbes with abiotic catalysts to expand the yield and scope of products available from biosynthetic processes.

         <dc:description>The bacterium strain  Ideonella sakaiensis  201&#8208;F6 is able to hydrolyze low&#8208;crystallinity PET films a 30&#176;C due to two enzymes named PETase and MHETase. Since its discovery, many efforts have been dedicated to the elucidation of the structure and features of those two enzymes and various authors have highlighted the necessity to optimize both the substrate binding site and the global structure, in order to enhance the stability and catalytic activity of these PET biocatalysts with the purpose to make it more suitable for industrial applications. In this review, strategies adopted by different research groups to deeply investigate the structure and the functionality on both PETase and MHETase are described, emphasizing the advantages provided by the use of computational methods to complement and drive experiments. Subsequently, the modifications implemented with protein engineering are discussed. The versatility of the enzymes secreted by  Ideonella sakaiensis  enables the prediction that they will find several applications in the disposal of PET debris, encouraging to prioritize the efforts in this prolific research field.</dc:description>

         <title>Biochemical and Structural Characterization of an Unusual and Naturally Split Class 3 Intein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 2, Page 364-373, January 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Split happens: Analysis of metagenomics data led to the identification of the first class 3 split intein. Bioinformatics studies, biochemical characterization, protein crystallography and mutational analysis revealed a high affinity of the intein fragments, mechanistic roles of key residues and identified the AceL NrdHF intein as a promising intein for biotechnological applications.







Abstract
Split inteins are indispensable tools for protein engineering because their ligation and cleavage reactions enable unique modifications of the polypeptide backbone. Three different classes of inteins have been identified according to the nature of the covalent intermediates resulting from the acyl rearrangements in the multistep protein&#8208;splicing pathway. Class 3 inteins employ a characteristic internal cysteine for a branched thioester intermediate. A bioinformatic database search of non&#8208;redundant protein sequences revealed the absence of split variants in 1701 class 3 inteins. We have discovered the first reported split class 3 intein in a metagenomics data set and report its biochemical, mechanistic and structural analysis. The AceL NrdHF intein exhibits low sequence conservation with other inteins and marked deviations in residues at conserved key positions, including a variation of the typical class&#8208;3 WCT triplet motif. Nevertheless, functional analysis confirmed the class 3 mechanism of the intein and revealed excellent splicing yields within a few minutes over a wide range of conditions and with barely detectable cleavage side reactions. A high&#8208;resolution crystal structure of the AceL NrdHF precursor and a mutagenesis study explained the importance and roles of several residues at the key positions. Tolerated substitutions in the flanking extein residues and a high affinity between the split intein fragments further underline the intein's future potential as a ligation tool.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Split happens&lt;/b&gt;: Analysis of metagenomics data led to the identification of the first class 3 split intein. Bioinformatics studies, biochemical characterization, protein crystallography and mutational analysis revealed a high affinity of the intein fragments, mechanistic roles of key residues and identified the AceL NrdHF intein as a promising intein for biotechnological applications.

         <title>Exploring Epigenetic Marks by Analysis of Noncovalent Interactions</title>

Activate or silence? Epigenetic regulation by methylation or acetylation of histone H3 has been investigated by DFT (BLYPD3/dev2&#8208;TZVPP) using a model consisting of a DNA double strand containing three base pairs and a sequence of three amino acids of the histone&#8216;s tail.







Abstract
Epigenetic marks are modest chemical modifications on DNA and histone proteins that regulate the activation or silencing of genes through modulation of the intermolecular interactions between the DNA strands and the protein machinery. The process is complex and not always well understood. One of the systems studied in greater detail is the epigenetic mark on H3K9: lysine 9 of histone 3. The degree of methylation or acetylation of this histone is linked to silencing or activation of the corresponding gene, but it is not clear which effect each mark has in gene expression. We shed light on this particular methylation process by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. First, we built a model consisting of a DNA double strand containing three base pairs and a sequence of three amino acids of the histone's tail. Then, we computed the modulation introduced into the intermolecular interactions by each epigenetic modification: from mono&#8208; to trimethylation and acetylation. The calculations show that whereas acetylation and trimethylation result in a reduction of the DNA&#8208;peptide interaction; non&#8208;, mono&#8208;, and dimethylation increase the intermolecular interactions. Such observations compare well with the findings reported in the literature, and highlight the correlation between the balance of intermolecular forces and biological properties, simultaneously advancing quantum&#8208;mechanical studies of large biochemical systems at molecular level through the use of DFT methods.

         <title>Fungal Epithiodiketopiperazines Carrying &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Polysulfide Bridges from Penicillium steckii YE, and Their Chemical Interconversion</title>

Chemical and functional diversity: Multiple new and known cytotoxic epithiodiketopiperazines containing &#945;,&#946;&#8208;polysulfide bridges were produced by a Penicillium sp. isolated from a black band layer of a coral sample. These analogues originated from the same gene cluster but demonstrated nonenzymatic interconversions to afford chemical diversity.







Abstract
Some fungal epithiodiketopiperazine alkaloids display &#945;,&#946;&#8208;polysulfide bridges alongside diverse structural variations. However, the logic of their chemical diversity has rarely been explored. Here, we report the identification of three new (2, 3, 8) and five known (1, 4&#8211;7) epithiodiketopiperazines of this subtype from a marine&#8208;derived Penicillium sp. The structure elucidation was supported by multiple spectroscopic analyses. Importantly, we observed multiple nonenzymatic interconversions of these analogues in aqueous solutions and organic solvents. Furthermore, the same biosynthetic origin of these compounds was supported by one mined gene cluster. The dominant analogue (1) demonstrated selective cytotoxicity to androgen&#8208;sensitive prostate cancer cells and HIF&#8208;depleted colorectal cells and mild antiaging activities, linking the bioactivity to oxidative stress. These results provide crucial insight into the formation of fungal epithiodiketopiperazines through chemical interconversions.

         <title>Short RNA Universal Coding for Topological Transformation Nano&#8208;barcoding Application</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 2, Page 392-397, January 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
One for all: Topological transformation nano&#8208;barcoding technology (TNT) associated with a universal coding system was proved to be effective in profiling short RNA fragments including clinical gene mutants. It is possible to diagnose short genetic biomarkers in one go with one TNT system by making a universal code without designing each probe material.







Abstract
With the advent of innovative genomic discovery toolkits such as RT&#8208;PCR, genetic information can be quickly decrypted, and this has resulted in significant progress in overcoming diseases. However, RT&#8208;PCR has the serious problem of frequent errors, and the demand for a new gene diagnostic system is emerging. Herein, we propose a universal coding system for the effective detection of short single&#8208;stranded DNA or RNA by using a topological transformation&#8208;based nano&#8208;barcoding technique (TNT). Our goal was to develop a dedicated diagnostic device that unifies the other gene groups, thus resulting in minimum testing. In a universal coding system consisting of two separate circulation structures, different gene groups become generalized into specific single genes with the same sequence by a strand&#8208;displacement reaction and are then amplified, eventually being quickly detected in one TNT system. Simple gene diagnostic systems like this make high&#8208;speed, point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostic technologies, and we are very confident that these will provide clinical gene detection in the near future.

H2O2 to 1O2 to&#8230; The formation of singlet oxygen from hydrogen peroxide by heme peroxidases and peroxygenases, but not catalases, is shown by fluorescence spectroscopy. The most active peroxidase, based on kinetic analysis using the fluorescent trap singlet&#8208;oxygen sensor green, was applied in a chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of ascaridole.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen is a reactive oxygen species undesired in living cells but a rare and valuable reagent in chemical synthesis. We present a fluorescence spectroscopic analysis of the singlet&#8208;oxygen formation activity of commercial peroxidases and novel peroxygenases. Singlet&#8208;oxygen sensor green (SOSG) is used as fluorogenic singlet oxygen trap. Establishing a kinetic model for the reaction cascade to the fluorescent SOSG endoperoxide permits a kinetic analysis of enzymatic singlet&#8208;oxygen formation. All peroxidases and peroxygenases show singlet&#8208;oxygen formation. No singlet oxygen activity could be found for any catalase under investigation. Substrate inhibition is observed for all reactive enzymes. The commercial dye&#8208;decolorizing peroxidase industrially used for dairy bleaching shows the highest singlet&#8208;oxygen activity and the lowest inhibition. This enzyme was immobilized on a textile carrier and successfully applied for a chemical synthesis. Here, ascaridole was synthesized via enzymatically produced singlet oxygen.

         <title>Structural Cues for Understanding eEF1A2 Moonlighting</title>

Beyond translation elongation: The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the G protein eEF1A2, purified from rabbit skeletal muscle and solved as a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimer, plus complementary bioinformatic and modeling work help understand the effect of mutations responsible for severe neurodevelopmental disorders in children, inform about the locations of two membrane anchoring sites per monomer, and contribute to unraveling the subtleties of the intricate eEF1A2 interactome.







Abstract
Spontaneous mutations in the EEF1A2 gene cause epilepsy and severe neurological disabilities in children. The crystal structure of eEF1A2 protein purified from rabbit skeletal muscle reveals a post&#8208;translationally modified dimer that provides information about the sites of interaction with numerous binding partners, including itself, and maps these mutations onto the dimer and tetramer interfaces. The spatial locations of the side chain carboxylates of Glu301 and Glu374, to which phosphatidylethanolamine is uniquely attached via an amide bond, define the anchoring points of eEF1A2 to cellular membranes and interorganellar membrane contact sites. Additional bioinformatic and molecular modeling results provide novel structural insight into the demonstrated binding of eEF1A2 to SH3 domains, the common MAPK docking groove, filamentous actin, and phosphatidylinositol&#8208;4 kinase III&#946;. In this new light, the role of eEF1A2 as an ancient, multifaceted, and articulated G protein at the crossroads of autophagy, oncogenesis and viral replication appears very distant from the &#8220;canonical&#8221; one of delivering aminoacyl&#8208;tRNAs to the ribosome that has dominated the scene and much of the thinking for many decades.

         <title>Multivalent, Stabilized Mannose&#8208;6&#8208;Phosphates for the Targeted Delivery of Toll&#8208;Like Receptor Ligands and Peptide Antigens</title>

Enhancing the immune response: Two mannose&#8208;6&#8208;C&#8208;phosphonate (M6Po) building blocks have been synthesized that can be incorporated into a conjugate by a &#8220;post&#8208;assembly&#8221; click or an online SPPS approach to improve endosomal trafficking of vaccines. The generated M6Po conjugates, which were also equipped with a TLR7 ligand, were able to enhance the immune response by activation and maturation of dendritic cells.







Abstract
Mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (M6P) is recognized by the mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate receptor and plays an important role in the transport of cargo to the endosomes, making it an attractive tool to improve endosomal trafficking of vaccines. We describe herein the assembly of peptide antigen conjugates carrying clusters of mannose&#8208;6&#8208;C&#8208;phosphonates (M6Po). The M6Po's are stable M6P mimics that are resistant to cleavage of the phosphate group by endogenous phosphatases. Two different strategies for the incorporation of the M6Po clusters in the conjugate have been developed: the first relies on a &#8220;post&#8208;assembly&#8221; click approach employing an M6Po bearing an alkyne functionality; the second hinges on an M6Po C&#8208;glycoside amino acid building block that can be used in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. The generated conjugates were further equipped with a TLR7 ligand to stimulate dendritic cell (DC) maturation. While antigen presentation is hindered by the presence of the M6Po clusters, the incorporation of the M6Po clusters leads to increased activation of DCs, thus demonstrating their potential in improving vaccine adjuvanticity by intraendosomally active TLR ligands.

         <title>19F NMR&#8208;Based Fragment Screening for 14 Different Biologically Active RNAs and 10 DNA and Protein Counter&#8208;Screens</title>

Checking out RNA druggability by NMR: Fourteen RNAs have been screened and ten DNA and proteins were counter&#8208;screened to show that fragment libraries can differentiate between different RNA targets with up to 15&#8208;fold selectivity.







Abstract
We report here the nuclear magnetic resonance 19F screening of 14 RNA targets with different secondary and tertiary structure to systematically assess the druggability of RNAs. Our RNA targets include representative bacterial riboswitches that naturally bind with nanomolar affinity and high specificity to cellular metabolites of low molecular weight. Based on counter&#8208;screens against five DNAs and five proteins, we can show that RNA can be specifically targeted. To demonstrate the quality of the initial fragment library that has been designed for easy follow&#8208;up chemistry, we further show how to increase binding affinity from an initial fragment hit by chemistry that links the identified fragment to the intercalator acridine. Thus, we achieve low&#8208;micromolar binding affinity without losing binding specificity between two different terminator structures.

Simple and selective: A standing challenge in modern drug development is to simplify synthetic routes to complex molecules. Capitalizing on their exquisite selectivity, biocatalysts provide a complementary solution to traditional chemical synthesis. This viewpoint highlights the strategic application of biocatalyst to enable efficient access to complex drug molecules.







Abstract
Biocatalysis is a continuously expanding subfield in chemical biology. Herein, I describe two categories of biocatalysts, the LEGO&#8208;brick&#8208;like and game&#8208;console&#8208;like type, both of which can streamline the synthetic routes to therapeutics. A multi&#8208;disciplinary approach to expand the biocatalytic toolkit will open up opportunities to develop new therapeutics.

Hidden gems: Despite the recent advances in phosphoproteomics, a chemically labile subset of the phosphoproteome has remained &#8220;hidden&#8221; for a long time. Here we discuss current search efforts and future directions.







Abstract
Protein phosphorylation is one of the most studied post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs). Despite the remarkable advances in phosphoproteomics, a chemically less&#8208;stable subset of the phosphosites, which we call the crypto&#8208;phosphoproteome, has remained underexplored due to technological challenges. In this Viewpoint, we briefly summarize the current understanding of these elusive protein phosphorylations and identify the missing pieces for future studies.

Disease diagnosis and prognosis through the detection of genetic biomarkers occupy an important part in molecular biology. Considering the thermodynamics of the strand&#8208;displacement reaction, we studied a system that can convert various miRNAs into a code that makes the detection system work. The cover feature reflects this discovery and shows that miRNAs in various sequences are transformed into the universal code and act as the key to operating a topological transformation nanobarcoding system that specializes in target detection. More information can be found in the full paper by S.&#8197;H. Um et&#8197;al.

The cover feature picture shows a pop&#8208;art illustration of the pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, which produces the infamous toxin, gliotoxin. Using targeted gene deletion, in silico studies and in vitro enzyme assays, we could elucidate a key late&#8208;stage step in the biosynthesis of gliotoxin. A single cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, GliF, is capable of catalyzing a N&#8208;heterocyclization reaction to form the hydroindole ring scaffold of gliotoxin.

Unclouding (some of) the moonlighting functions of eEF1A2: Spontaneous mutations in the EEF1A2 gene are increasingly being recognized as a source of epilepsy and severe neurological disabilities in children. The crystal structure of eEF1A2 protein purified from rabbit skeletal muscle reveals the spatial locations of the side&#8208;chain carboxylates of Glu301 and Glu374, to which phosphatidylethanolamine is uniquely attached via an amide bond, thereby defining the anchoring points of an eEF1A2 dimer to cellular membranes. In this new light, the role of eEF1A2 as an ancient, multifaceted, and articulated G&#8197;protein at the crossroads of autophagy, oncogenesis, and viral replication appears very distant from the &#8220;canonical&#8221; one of delivering aminoacyl&#8208;tRNAs to the ribosome that has dominated the scene and much of the thinking for many decades.

Going greener: Enantioenriched sulfoxides can be synthesized by exploiting the new reductive enzymes Msr and Dms or using classical oxidative enzymes in the presence of unconventional solvents in a greener and more sustainable way.







Abstract
Sulfoxides are a class of organic compounds that find wide application in medicinal and organic chemistry. Several biocatalytic approaches have been developed to synthesise enantioenriched sulfoxides, mainly by exploiting oxidative enzymes. Recently, the use of reductive enzymes such as Msr and Dms has emerged as a new, alternative method to obtain enantiopure sulfoxides from racemic mixtures. In parallel, novel oxidative approaches, employing nonclassical solvents such as ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs), have been developed as greener and more sustainable biocatalytic synthetic pathways. This minireview aims highlights the recent advances made in the biocatalytic synthesis of enantioenriched sulfoxides by employing such unconventional approaches.

         <title>On the Case of the Misplaced Hydrogens</title>

The position of a hydrogen in a short hydrogen bond (SHB) is indicative of the bond strength. Yet, few techniques can locate a hydrogen atom in either canonical, or unusually strong, low&#8208;barrier hydrogen bonds. This has led to discrepancies among simulations and biochemical studies. We review two examples of SHB&#8208;containing proteins to gain insights into the energetic role of these bonds.







Abstract
Few other elements play a more central role in biology than hydrogen. The interactions, bonding and movement of hydrogen atoms are central to biological catalysis, structure and function. Yet owing to the elusive nature of a single hydrogen atom few experimental and computational techniques can precisely determine its location. This is exemplified in short hydrogen bonds (SHBs) where the location of the hydrogen atom is indicative of the underlying strength of the bonds, which can vary from 1&#8211;5&#8197;kcal/mol in canonical hydrogen bonds, to an almost covalent nature in single&#8208;well hydrogen bonds. Owing to the often&#8208;times inferred position of hydrogen, the role of SHBs in biology has remained highly contested and debated. This has also led to discrepancies in computational, biochemical and structural studies of proteins thought to use SHBs in performing chemistry and stabilizing interactions. Herein, we discuss in detail two distinct examples, namely the conserved catalytic triad and the photoreceptor, photoactive yellow protein, where studies of these SHB&#8208;containing systems have permitted contextualization of the role these unique hydrogen bonds play in biology.

This has also led to discrepancies in computational, biochemical and structural studies of proteins thought to use SHBs in performing chemistry and stabilizing interactions. Herein, we discuss in detail two distinct examples, namely the conserved catalytic triad and the photoreceptor, photoactive yellow protein, where studies of these SHB&#8208;containing systems have permitted contextualization of the role these unique hydrogen bonds play in biology.&lt;/p&gt;

Listen up! This minreview focuses on the development of and design strategies for activatable small&#8208;molecule PA probes by covering four main points: 1) reaction&#8208;cleavage; 2) metal ion chelation; 3) photoswitch, and 4) protonation&#8208;deprotonation.







Abstract
Photoacoustic (PA) probes have been developed very quickly and applied in broad areas in recent years. Most of them are constructed based on organic dyes with intrinsic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption properties. To increase PA contrast and improve imaging resolution and the sensitivity of detection, various methods for the design of PA probes have been developed. This minireview mainly focuses on the development and design strategies of activatable small&#8208;molecule PA probes in four aspects: reaction&#8208;cleavage, metal ion chelation, photoswitch, and protonation&#8208;deprotonation. It highlights some key points of designing PA probes corresponding to their properties and applications. The challenges and perspectives for small&#8208;molecule PA probes are also discussed.

         <title>PR10/Bet v1&#8208;like Proteins as Novel Contributors to Plant Biochemical Diversity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 2, Page 264-287, January 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
From allergens to enzymes: The PR10/Bet v1&#8208;like protein family includes notorious plant allergens and members that were initially described as antimicrobial defense proteins. Structural studies reveal a large hydrophobic central cavity that binds ligands including phytohormones, flavonoids, and alkaloids. Recent studies implicate PR10/Bet v1&#8208;like proteins in plant biochemistry and reveal them as key tools for synthetic biology applications.







Abstract
Pathogenesis&#8208;related (PR) proteins constitute a broad class of plant proteins with analogues found throughout nature from bacteria to higher eukaryotes. PR proteins were first noted in plants as part of the hypersensitive response, but have since been assigned an array of biological roles. The PR10/Bet v1&#8208;like proteins are a subset of PR proteins characterized by an ability to bind a wide range of lipophilic ligands, uniquely positioning them as contributors to specialized biosynthetic pathways. PR10/Bet v1&#8208;like proteins participate in the production of plant alkaloids and phenolics including flavonoids, both as general binding proteins and in special cases as catalysts. Owing initially to the perceived allergenic properties of PR10/Bet v1&#8208;like proteins, many were studied at the structural level to elucidate the basis for ligand binding. These studies provided a foundation for more recent efforts to understand higher&#8208;level structural order and how PR10/Bet v1&#8208;like proteins catalyse key reactions in plant pathways. Synthetic biology aimed at reconstituting plant&#8208;specialized metabolism in microorganisms uses knowledge of these proteins to fine&#8208;tune performance in new systems.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclization in Gliotoxin Biosynthesis is Catalyzed by a Distinct Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenase</title>

Odd skills: Mutational analysis, in silico studies, and in&#8197;vitro reconstitution revealed that GliF from A. fumigatus is a novel cytochrome P450 monooxygenase catalyzing an unprecedented N&#8208;heterocyclization reaction to form the hydroindole ring scaffold of the important virulence factor gliotoxin.







Abstract
Gliotoxin and related epidithiodiketopiperazines (ETP) from diverse fungi feature highly functionalized hydroindole scaffolds with an array of medicinally and ecologically relevant activities. Mutation analysis, heterologous reconstitution, and biotransformation experiments revealed that a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (GliF) from the human&#8208;pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus plays a key role in the formation of the complex heterocycle. In vitro assays using a biosynthetic precursor from a blocked mutant showed that GliF is specific to ETPs and catalyzes an unprecedented heterocyclization reaction that cannot be emulated with current synthetic methods. In silico analyses indicate that this rare biotransformation takes place in related ETP biosynthetic pathways.

         <title>Covalently Mercurated Molecular Beacon for Discriminating the Canonical Nucleobases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 2, Page 354-358, January 15, 2021. </description>

It&#8242;s all about the base: A covalently mercurated molecular beacon, in which a 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8208;mercuri&#8208;6&#8208;methylaniline acts as a functional unit, has been developed for discriminating canonical nucleobases. The discrimination is based on the different affinities between the functional unit and different opposite nucleobases, and is detected based on the fluorescence intensities of the molecular beacon.







Abstract
A highly nucleobase&#8208;discriminating metalated nucleoside analogue, 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8208;mercuri&#8208;6&#8208;methylaniline, was incorporated into an oligonucleotide molecular beacon. Fluorescence emission spectra were measured after the addition of four different complementary strands, in which the nucleobase opposite the metalated analogue varies. The fluorescence results showed a clear binding selectivity at room temperature, in the order G&gt;T&gt;C&gt;A. The selectivity is based on the different affinities between the metalated nucleoside analogue and the canonical nucleobases. The synthesized probe is capable of robust discrimination between the two purine as well as the two pyrimidine bases by fluorescence at room temperature, and more sophisticated temperature analysis allows clear separation of every canonical nucleobase. The probe would, hence, be a suitable method for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms.

         <title>Selective Covalent Targeting of Anti&#8208;apoptotic BFL&#8208;1 by a Sulfonium&#8208;Tethered Peptide</title>

Cysteine stabilizers: Sulfonium&#8208;tethered peptide inhibitors, which were constructed by a facile bis&#8208;alkylation strategy between cysteine and methionine, could increase peptides&#8217; enzymatic stability, enhance cyclized peptide's cellular uptake, and selectively target anti&#8208;apoptotic protein BFL&#8208;1 to inhibit BFL&#8208;1 over&#8208;expressed cancer cell lines.







Abstract
Anti&#8208;apoptotic B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL&#8208;2) family proteins are proven targets for human cancers. Targeting the BH3&#8208;binding pockets of these anti&#8208;apoptotic proteins could reactivate apoptosis in BCL&#8208;2&#8208;depedent cancers. BFL&#8208;1 is a BCL&#8208;2 family protein overexpressed in various chemoresistant cancers. A unique cysteine at the binding interface of the BH3 and BFL&#8208;1 was previously proven to be an intriguing targeting site to irreversibly inhibit BFL&#8208;1 functions with stabilized cyclic peptide bearing a covalent warhead. Recently, we developed a sulfonium&#8208;tethered peptide cyclization strategy to construct peptide ligands that could selectively and efficiently react with the cysteine(s) of target proteins near the interacting interface. Using this method, we constructed a BFL&#8208;1 peptide inhibitor, B4&#8208;MC, that could selectively conjugate with BFL&#8208;1 both in&#8197;vitro and in cell. B4&#8208;MC showed good cellular uptake, colocalized with BFL&#8208;1 on mitochondria, and showed obvious growth inhibition of BFL&#8208;1 over&#8208;expressed cancer cell lines.

Recently, we developed a sulfonium&#8208;tethered peptide cyclization strategy to construct peptide ligands that could selectively and efficiently react with the cysteine(s) of target proteins near the interacting interface. Using this method, we constructed a BFL&#8208;1 peptide inhibitor, B4&#8208;MC, that could selectively conjugate with BFL&#8208;1 both in&#8197;vitro and in cell. B4&#8208;MC showed good cellular uptake, colocalized with BFL&#8208;1 on mitochondria, and showed obvious growth inhibition of BFL&#8208;1 over&#8208;expressed cancer cell lines.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tryptophan Analogues with Fixed Side&#8208;Chain Orientation: Expanding the Scope</title>

Immobile indole stays put: Conformationally locked side&#8208;chain rotamers of tryptophan were obtained by a general &#946;&#8208;indoylation method. The new type of &#946;&#8208;indoyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids allow systematic optimization of the &#946;&#8208;indole group orientation in different peptide environments. Four ghrelin receptor inverse agonists containing stereoisomeric &#946;&#8208;indoylated &#945;&#8208;amino acids span a broad range of activities.







Abstract
A generalized synthetic strategy is proposed here for the synthesis of asymmetric &#946;&#8208;indoylated amino acids by 8&#8208;aminoquinoline (8AQ)&#8208;directed C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization of suitably protected precursors. Peptides containing one of the four stereoisomers of (indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;3&#8208;phenylalanine at position 2 of the parent peptide KwFwLL&#8208;NH2 (w=d&#8208;Trp) cover a wide range of activities as ghrelin receptor inverse agonists, among them the most active described until now. This application exemplarily shows how &#946;&#8208;indoylated amino acids can be used for the systematic variation of the position of an indole group in a bioactive peptide.

Double vision: A &#8220;three&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; multifunctional probe was designed by integrating the Bcl&#8208;2/Mcl&#8208;1 binding ligand, a fluorescent reporter group and a photoreactive group into the same scaffold, and further applied for protein profiling and bioimaging of both Bcl&#8208;2 and Mcl&#8208;1 simultaneously in&#8197;situ.







Abstract
Bcl&#8208;2 and Mcl&#8208;1, the two arms of the anti&#8208;apoptotic Bcl&#8208;2 family proteins, have been identified as key regulators of apoptosis and effective therapeutic targets of cancer. However, no small&#8208;molecular probe is capable of profiling and visualizing both Bcl&#8208;2 and Mcl&#8208;1 simultaneously in&#8197;situ. Herein, we report a multifunctional molecular probe (BnN3&#8208;OPD&#8208;Alk) by a &#8220;three&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; molecular designing strategy, which integrated the Bcl&#8208;2/Mcl&#8208;1 binding ligand, fluorescent reporter group and photoreactive group azido into the same scaffold. BnN3&#8208;OPD&#8208;Alk exhibited sub&#8208;micromolar affinities to Bcl&#8208;2/Mcl&#8208;1 and bright green self&#8208;fluorescence. It was then successfully applied for Bcl&#8208;2/Mcl&#8208;1 labeling, capturing, enriching, and bioimaging both in&#8197;vitro and in cells. This strategy could facilitate the precise early diagnosis and effective therapy of dual Bcl&#8208;2/Mcl&#8208;1&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Evaluation of i&#8208;Motif Formation in the Serotonin Transporter&#8208;Linked Polymorphic Region</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 2, Page 349-353, January 15, 2021. </description>

Regulating transport: i&#8208;Motifs are secondary DNA structures that seem to have a role in transcription regulation. Here we show the formation of i&#8208;motifs in two allelic variants within the promotor region of the serotonin transporter. Polymorphisms within this region have been linked to neuropsychiatric disorders, and we highlights i&#8208;motif formation as a potential regulatory mechanism for the serotonin transporter.







Abstract
Neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) arise from a complex set of genetic and environmental factors. The serotonin transporter (SERT) is a key regulator of synaptic serotonin (5&#8208;HT), and its inhibition is an important pharmacological target for treating MDD. The SERT&#8208;linked polymorphic region (5&#8208;HTTLPR) contains two major variants (short and long) that have been implicated in modulating susceptibility to MDD by altering the level of expression of SERT. Both variants contain C&#8208;rich repeats that conform to consensus i&#8208;motif folding sequences. i&#8208;Motifs are quadruplex DNA structures that have been proposed to have a role in transcription regulation. With spectroscopic techniques, we demonstrate that both alleles are able to form i&#8208;motifs at acidic pH, and at neutral pH under conditions of molecular crowding. This highlights the potential for i&#8208;motif formation to contribute to transcriptional regulation of the serotonin transporter, with a potential role in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.

         <title>A Pyrimido&#8208;Quinoxaline Fused Heterocycle Lights Up Transfer RNA upon Binding at the Mg2+ Binding Site</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 2, Page 359-363, January 15, 2021. </description>

Lighting up: We have developed a pyrimido&#8208;quinoxaline fused, highly fluorescent, water&#8208;soluble small molecule with a piperazine tail that can bind tRNA in the central region (overlapping the Mg2+ binding site) and cause a fluorescence enhancement. This binding complements the area of negative electrostatic potential created by 3D tRNA folding.







Abstract
Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are fundamental molecules in cellular translation. In this study we have highlighted a fluorescence&#8208;based perceptive approach for tRNAs by using a quinoxaline small molecule. We have synthesised a water&#8208;soluble fluorescent pyrimido&#8208;quinoxaline&#8208;fused heterocycle containing a mandatory piperazine tail (DS1) with a large Stokes shift (&#8764;160&#8197;nm). The interaction between DS1 and tRNA results in significant fluorescence enhancement of the molecule with Kd&#8764;5&#8197;&#956;M and multiple binding sites. Our work reveals that the DS1 binding site overlaps with the specific Mg2+ ion binding site in the D loop of tRNA. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the molecule inhibited Pb2+&#8208;induced cleavage of yeast tRNAPhe in the D loop. In competitive binding assays, the fluorescence of DS1&#8208;tRNA complex is quenched by a known tRNA&#8208;binder, tobramycin. This indicates the displacement of DS1 and, indeed, a substantiation of specific binding at the site of tertiary interaction in the central region of tRNA. The ability of compound DS1 to bind tRNA with a higher affinity compared to DNA and single&#8208;stranded RNA offers a promising approach to developing tRNA&#8208;based biomarker diagnostics in the future.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Transaminase&#8208;Catalyzed Biocatalytic Cascade for Efficient Asymmetric Synthesis of l&#8208;Phosphinothricin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 2, Page 345-348, January 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The herbicide phosphinothricin (PPT) is widely used, but current commercial PPT is a racemic mixture in which the inactive d&#8208;form is harmful to the environment. As nonenzymatic synthesis is complex and costly, we have developed a biocatalytic cascade for l&#8208;PPT catalyzed by a single transaminase that is high yielding (&gt;90&#8201;%) within 24&#8197;hours and gives a high ee (&gt;99&#8201;%).







Abstract
A single&#8208;transaminase&#8208;catalyzed biocatalytic cascade was developed by employing the desired biocatalyst, ATA&#8208;117&#8208;Rd11, that showed high activity toward 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;[(hydroxy)(methyl)phosphinoyl] butyric acid (PPO) and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate, and low activity against pyruvate. The cascade successfully promotes a highly asymmetric amination reaction for the synthesis of l&#8208;phosphinothricin (l&#8208;PPT) with high conversion (&gt;95&#8201;%) and&gt;99&#8201;% ee. In a scale&#8208;up experiment, using 10&#8197;kg pre&#8208;frozen E. coli cells harboring ATA&#8208;117&#8208;Rd11 as catalyst, 80&#8197;kg PPO was converted to &#8776;70&#8197;kg l&#8208;PPT after 24&#8197;hours with a high ee value (&gt;99&#8201;%).

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution DNA Dual&#8208;rulers Reveal a New Intermediate State in Ribosomal Frameshifting</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ribosomal frameshifting is an important pathway used by many viruses for protein synthesis, which involves mRNA translocations of various numbers of nucleotides. Resolving the mRNA positions with sub&#8208;nucleotide precision will provide critical mechanistic information that is difficult to obtain with the current techniques. We report the method of high&#8208;resolution DNA rulers with sub&#8208;nucleotide precision and the discovery of new frameshifting intermediate states on the mRNA containing GA 7 G motif. Two intermediate states were observed with the aid of fusidic acid, one at the &#8220;0&#8221; reading frame and the other near the &#8220;&#8208;1&#8221; reading frame, in contrast to the &#8220;&#8208;2&#8221; and &#8220;&#8208;1&#8221; frameshifting products in the absence of the antibiotic. We termed the new near&#8208;&#8220;&#8208;1&#8221; intermediate as the Post(&#8208;1*) state, because it was shifted by approximately half a nucleotide compared to the normal &#8220;&#8208;1&#8221; reading frame at the 5&#8217;&#8208;end. This indicates a ribosome conformation that is different from the conventional model of three reading frames. Our work reveals uniquely precise mRNA motions and subtle conformational changes that will complement structural and fluorescence studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Subcellular localisation of a quinoline&#8208;containing fluorescent cyclometallated Ir(III) complex in Plasmodium falciparum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fluorescent analogue of a previously synthesised  N,N  &#8208;chelated Ir(III) complex was prepared by the coordination of the organic ligand to an extrinsic bis(2&#8208;phenylpyridine)iridium(III) fluorophore. This cyclometallated Ir(III) complex in itself displays good, micromolar activity against the chloroquine&#8208;sensitive NF54 strain of  Plasmodium falciparum.  Live&#8208;cell confocal microscopy found negligible localisation of the fluorescent complex within the digestive vacuole of the parasite, eliminating the haem detoxification pathway as a potential mechanism of action. Similarly, no localisation of the complex within the parasitic nucleus was found, suggesting that this complex likely does not interfere with the DNA replication process. A substantial saturation of fluorescence from the complex was found near phospholipid structures such as the plasma and nuclear membranes but not in neutral lipid bodies. This indicates that an association with these membranes, or organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or branched mitochondrion, could be essential to the efficacies of these types of antimalarial compounds.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrrole&#8211;imidazole (PI) polyamides, which target specific DNA sequences, have been studied as a class of DNA minor&#8208;groove binding molecules. To investigate the potential of the compounds for cancer treatment, PI polyamides were conjugated with DNA alkylating agents, such as seco&#8208;CBI and chlorambucil. DNA&#8208;alkylating PI polyamides have attracted attention because of their sequence&#8208;specific alkylating activities, which contribute to reducing the severe side effects of current DNA damaging drugs. Many of these types of conjugates have been developed as new candidates for anticancer drugs. Here, we review the recent progress into research on DNA&#8208;alkylating PI polyamides and their sequence&#8208;specific action on targets associated with cancer development.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation, Structure, Biosynthesis and Bioactivity of Glidobactin&#8208;like Proteasome Inhibitors from Photorhabdus laumondii</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The glidobactin&#8208;like natural products (GLNPs) glidobactin A and cepafungin I have been reported to be potent proteasome inhibitors and are regarded as promising candidates for anti&#8208;cancer drug development. Their biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC)  plu1881&#8722;1877  is present in entomopathogenic  Photorhabdus laumondii  but silent under standard laboratory conditions. Here we show the largest subset of GLNPs, which are produced and identified after activation of the silent BGC in the native host and following heterologous expression of the BGC in  E. coli  , respectively. The chemical diversity results from a relaxed substrate specificity and flexible product release in the assembly line of GLNPs. Crystal structure analysis of the yeast proteasome in complex with new GLNPs suggests that the degree of unsaturation and the length of the aliphatic tail are critical for their bioactivity. The results in this study provide the basis to engineer the BGC for the generation of new GLNPs and to optimize these natural products resulting in potential drugs for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand binding to dynamically populated G&#8208;quadruplex DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several small molecule ligands specifically bind and stabilize G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) nucleic acid structures, which are considered as promising therapeutic targets. G4s are polymorphic structures with varying stability and their formation is dynamic. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of ligand binding to dynamically populated human telomere G4 DNA, using the bisquinolinium based ligand Phen&#8208;DC3 and a combination of single&#8208;molecule FRET microscopy, ensemble FRET and CD spectroscopy. Different cations are used to tune G4 polymorphism and folding dynamics. We find that ligand binding occurs to pre&#8208;folded G4 structures and that Phen&#8208;DC3 also induces G4 folding from unfolded single&#8208;strands. Following ligand binding to dynamically populated G4s, the DNA undergoes pronounced conformational redistributions, which do not involve direct ligand&#8208;induced G4 conformational interconversion. In contrast, the redistribution is driven by ligand&#8208;induced G4 folding and trapping of dynamically populated short&#8208;lived conformational states. Thus, ligand&#8208;induced stabilization does not necessarily require initial presence of stably folded G4s.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis and Biological Applications of O&#8208;GlcNAcylated Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All human cells use O&#8208;GlcNAc protein modifications (  O  &#8208;linked  N  &#8208;acetylglucosamine) to rapidly adapt to changing nutrient and stress conditions through signaling, epigenetic, and proteostasis mechanisms. A key challenge for biologists to define precise roles for specific  O  &#8208;GlcNAc sites is synthetic access to homogenous isoforms of  O  &#8208;GlcNAc proteins, a result of the non&#8208;genetically templated, transient, and heterogeneous nature of  O  &#8208;GlcNAc modifications. Toward a solution, this Review details the state of the art of two strategies for  O  &#8208;GlcNAc protein modification: advances in &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221;  O  &#8208;GlcNAc peptide synthesis and direct &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; installation of  O  &#8208;GlcNAc on full proteins. We also describe key applications of synthetic  O  &#8208;GlcNAc peptide and protein tools as therapeutics, biophysical structure&#8208;function studies, biomarkers, and as disease mechanistic probes to advance translational  O  &#8208;GlcNAc biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Cleavage of an RNA Model Compound by an Arylmercury Complex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A water&#8208;soluble arylmercury complex has been synthesized and its ability to catalyze the cleavage of the phosphodiester linkage of the RNA model compound adenylyl&#8208;3&#180;,5&#180;&#8208;(2&#180;,3&#180;&#8208;O&#8208;methyleneadenosine) assessed over a pH range of 3&#8212;8.5 and a catalyst concentration range of 0&#8212;7 mM. In the presence of 1 mM catalyst, the observed pH&#8212;rate profile featured a new pH&#8208;independent region between pH 6 and 7, the catalyzed reaction being as much as 8&#8208;fold faster than the background reaction. At pH 7, the acceleration increased linearly from 3&#8208; to 17&#8208;fold on increasing the catalyst concentration from 1 to 7 mM. The linear dependence indicates a relatively low affinity of the catalyst for the substrate and, hence, potential for considerable improvement on tethering to an appropriate targeting group, such as an oligonucleotide.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled, Programmable DNA Nanodevices for Biological and Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It all began with 2D and 3D designs, but now DNA nanotechnology along with DNA origami has expanded into diverse areas of application like scaffolds for nanoscale matter organization, bioimaging, super&#8208;resolution imaging, therapeutics delivery, etc. This review covers design principles in DNA nanotechnology, bio&#8208; and biomedical applications and provides a perspective for future ventures in DNA nanotechnology.







Abstract
The broad field of structural DNA nanotechnology has diverged into various areas of applications ranging from computing, photonics, synthetic biology, and biosensing to in&#8208;vivo bioimaging and therapeutic delivery, to name but a few. Though the field began to exploit DNA to build various nanoscale architectures, it has now taken a new path to diverge from structural DNA nanotechnology to functional or applied DNA nanotechnology. More recently a third sub&#8208;branch has emerged&#8208;biologically oriented DNA nanotechnology, which seeks to explore the functionalities of combinatorial DNA devices in various biological systems. In this review, we summarize the key developments in DNA nanotechnology revealing a current trend that merges the functionality of DNA devices with the specificity of biomolecules to access a range of functions in biological systems. This review seeks to provide a perspective on the evolution and biological applications of DNA nanotechnology, where the integration of DNA structures with biomolecules can now uncover phenomena of interest to biologists and biomedical scientists. Finally, we conclude with the challenges, limitations, and perspectives of DNA nanodevices in fundamental and applied research.

         <title>SynBio&#8208;SynChem Approaches to Diversifying the Pacidamycins through the Exploitation of an Observed Pictet&#8208;Spengler Reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond the natural: We demonstrate the importance of the N terminus to pacidamycin bioactivity. Incorporating meta&#8208;tyrosine at the N&#8208;terminal facilitates diversification of pacidamycins enabling use of Pictet&#8208;Spengler chemistry and may enable the attenuation of compound activity.







Abstract
A nonenzymatic Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction has been postulated to give rise to a subset of naturally occurring uridyl peptide antibiotics (UPAs). Here, using a combination of strain engineering and synthetic chemistry, we demonstrate that Pictet&#8208;Spengler chemistry may be employed to generate even greater diversity in the UPAs. We use an engineered strain to afford access to meta&#8208;tyrosine containing pacidamycin 4. Pictet&#8208;Spengler diversification of this compound using a small series of aryl&#8208;aldehydes was achieved with some derivatives affording remarkable diastereomeric control.

         <title>Trypsiligase&#8208;Catalyzed Labeling of Proteins on Living Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent fusion proteins: Herein, we describe a biocatalytic approach for the site&#8208;specific bioconjugation of cell&#8208;surface bound proteins by trypsiligase. The reactions are fast, irreversible, without side reactions and completely nontoxic to living cells. Importantly, recognition of the target membrane protein by trypsiligase only requires the introduction of a simple dipeptide sequence at its N terminus.







Abstract
Fluorescent fusion proteins are powerful tools for studying biological processes in living cells, but universal application is limited due to the voluminous size of those tags, which might have an impact on the folding, localization or even the biological function of the target protein. The designed biocatalyst trypsiligase enables site&#8208;directed linkage of small&#8208;sized fluorescence dyes on the N&#8197;terminus of integral target proteins located in the outer membrane of living cells through a stable native peptide bond. The function of the approach was tested by using the examples of covalent derivatization of the transmembrane proteins CD147 as well as the EGF receptor, both presented on human HeLa cells. Specific trypsiligase recognition of the site of linkage was mediated by the dipeptide sequence Arg&#8208;His added to the proteins&#8217; native N&#8197;termini, pointing outside the cell membrane. The labeling procedure takes only about 5 minutes, as demonstrated for couplings of the fluorescence dye tetramethyl rhodamine and the affinity label biotin as well.

         <title>Artificial organelles: towards adding or restoring intracellular activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compartmentalization is one of the main characteristics that defines living systems. Creating a physically separated microenvironment allows nature a better control over biological processes, as is clearly specified by the role of organelles in living cells. Inspired by this phenomenon, researchers have developed a range of different approaches to create artificial organelles; compartments with catalytic activity that add new function to living cells.&#160; In this review we will discuss three complementary lines of investigation. First, orthogonal chemistry approaches are discussed which are based on the incorporation of catalytically active transition metal&#8208;containing nanoparticles in living cells. The second approach involves the usage of premade hybrid nanoreactors which show transient function when taken up by living cells. The third approach utilizes mostly genetic engineering methods to create bio&#8208;based structures that can be ultimately integrated with the cell&#8217;s genome to make them constitutively active. The current state of the art and the scope and limitations of the field will be highlighted with selected examples from the three approaches.</dc:description>

We systematically investigated the use of high&#8208;performance reversed&#8208;phase flash chromatography (HPFC) to rapidly purify laboratory&#8208;scale quantities of crude, synthetic peptides and chemically modified insulins. We demonstrated these methods for a diverse set of peptides, including short, medium&#8208;length, and long peptides. Depending on the purity profile of the peptide, HPFC can be used either as the sole purification method, or as a pre&#8208;purification method prior to a final HPLC purification. Furthermore, HPFC is suitable for purification of peptides that are not fully in solution. We provide guidelines for the HPFC of synthetic peptides and small proteins, including choice of columns, eluents, and gradients. We believe that HPFC is a valuable alternative to HPLC purification of peptides and small proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>SP3&#8208;FAIMS chemoproteomics for high coverage profiling of the human cysteinome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemoproteomics has enabled the rapid and proteome&#8208;wide discovery of functional, redox&#8208;sensitive, and ligandable cysteine residues. Despite widespread adoption and considerable advances in both sample preparation workflows and MS instrumentation, chemoproteomics experiments still typically only identify a small fraction of all cysteines encoded by the human genome. Here, we develop an optimized sample preparation workflow that combines enhanced peptide labeling with single&#8208;pot, solid phase&#8208;enhanced sample&#8208;preparation (SP3) to improve the recovery of biotinylated peptides, including from small sample sizes. By combining this improved workflow with online high&#8208;field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) separation of labelled peptides, we achieve unprecedented coverage of &gt;14,000 unique cysteines in a single shot 70 min experiment. Showcasing the wide utility of the SP3&#8208;FAIMS chemoproteomic method, we find that it is also compatible with competitive small molecule screening by isotopic tandem orthogonal activity&#8208;based protein profiling (isoTOP&#8208;ABPP). In aggregate our analysis of 18 samples from 7 cell lines identified 34,225 total unique cysteines using only ~28 h of instrument time. The comprehensive spectral library and improved coverage provided by the SP3&#8208;FAIMS chemoproteomics method will provide the technical foundation for future studies aimed at deciphering the functions and druggability of the human cysteineome.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The C&#945; absolute configuration of the constituent amino acids in microbial nonribosomal peptides is typically determined using Marfey&#8217;s method after total hydrolysis of the peptide. A structural elucidation challenge arises when both D/L&#8208; enantiomeric configurations of an amino acid are encountered. Determining the actual position of each amino acid enantiomer within the peptide sequence typically requires laborious approaches based on peptide partial hydrolysis or even the total synthesis of the possible diastereomers. Herein, an alternative solution is discussed based on the homogeneous backbone chirality which governs all peptides biosynthesized by a common nonribosomal peptide synthetase.

         <title>Tagged benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones as novel activity&#8208;based probes for serine proteases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) are valuable chemical tools for profiling enzymes. They have been particularly useful in the study of proteases. ABPs rely on electrophilic scaffolds that covalently modify the target enzymes. Ideally, these can be made in a fast and uncomplicated manner. We here explore alkyne substituted benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones as ABPs for serine proteases, because they are covalent inhibitors of serine proteases and their synthesis is very straightforward. We here show that alkyne&#8208;tagged benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones can be used in 2&#8208;step bioorthogonal tandem labeling procedures or prior functionalized with a biotin or fluorophore. We demonstrate that these reagents can be used for labeling and identifying various serine proteases. Therefore, we expect that tagged benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones will offer easy synthesizable tools for profiling of serine proteases.</dc:description>

         <title>IsPETase represents a novel biocatalyst for poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) hydrolysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is one of the most widely used synthetic polyesters but also a main cause of plastic pollution. Since the chemical degradation of PET would be uneconomical and rather burdensome, considerable efforts have been devoted to exploring enzymatic processes for the disposal of PET waste. Many PET hydrolyzing enzymes have been consecutively reported in recent decades, some of which demonstrate excellent potential for industrial applications. This review sets out to summarize the investigation status of  Is  PETase, a cutinase&#8208;like enzyme from  I. sakaiensis  possessing ability to degrade the crystalline PET, and to gain further insight into the structure&#8208;function relationship of  Is  PETase. Benefiting from the continuing identification of novel cutinase&#8208;like proteins and growing availability of the engineered  Is  PETase, we may anticipate future developments in this type of enzyme would generate suitable biocatalyst for industrial use.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats&#8208;associated protein 9 endonuclease (CRISPR&#8208;Cas9) and the nuclease&#8208;deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) systems have revolutionized the capability of precise genome engineering and regulation. Inducible CRISPR&#8208;dCas9&#8208;based transcriptional systems have been rapidly developed to conditionally control the genetic manipulation. Current strategies mainly focus on conditional control of gRNA function and dCas9 protein utilizing exogenous and endogenous triggers, including external light, small molecules, synthetic and intracellular oligonucleotides. These strategies have established novel platforms for spatiotemporal regulation of genome activation and repression, epigenome editing and so on. Here we summarize the recent progresses of conditionally controlling the CRISPR&#8208;dCas9 transcriptional systems via gRNA modulation and dCas9 protein engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>RNA cleaving DNA Thresholder Controlled by Concentrations of miRNA Cancer Marker</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligonucleotide gene therapy (OGT) agents suppress specific mRNAs in cells and thus reduce expression of targeted genes. The ability to unambiguously distinguish cancer from healthy cells can solve the low selectivity problem of OGT agents. Cancer RNA markers are expressed in both healthy and cancer cells with higher expression level in cancer cells. Here we designed a DNA&#8208;based construct, named DNA thresholder (DTh) that cleaves targeted RNA only at high concentrations of cancer marker RNA demonstrating delay at low marker concentrations. The RNA cleaving activity can be adjusted within one order of magnitude of the cancer marker RNA concentration by simple redesigning ThD. Importantly, DTh recognizes cancer marker RNA, while cleaving other targeted RNA, which offers a possibility to suppress vital genes exclusively in cancer cells thus triggering their death. DTh is a prototype of computation&#8208;inspired molecular device for controlling gene expression and cancer treatment  .</dc:description>

         <title>A High&#8208;Throughput Screening Method for the Directed Evolution of Hydroxynitrile Lyase towards Cyanohydrin Synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Making biohydrocyanation measurable: Hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) catalyze the enantioselective cleavage/formation of cyanohydrins. However, current methods for determining hydrocyanation are not suitable for mass screening of mutants for protein engineering of these biocatalysts. We demonstrate herein a chromogenic high&#8208;throughput screening method for cyanohydrin synthesis that is validated by either substrate profiling or the directed evolution of HNLs.







Abstract
Chiral cyanohydrins are useful intermediates in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. In nature, hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) are a kind of elegant tool for enantioselective hydrocyanation of carbonyl compounds. However, currently available methods for demonstrating hydrocyanation are still stalled at precise, but low&#8208;throughput, GC or HPLC analyses. Herein, we report a chromogenic high&#8208;throughput screening (HTS) method that is feasible for the cyanohydrin synthesis reaction. This method was highly anti&#8208;interference and sensitive, and could be used to directly profile the substrate scope of HNLs either in cell&#8208;free extract or fermentation clear broth. This HTS method was also validated by generating new variants of PcHNL5 that presented higher catalytic efficiency and stronger acidic tolerance in variant libraries.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Making biohydrocyanation measurable&lt;/b&gt;: Hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) catalyze the enantioselective cleavage/formation of cyanohydrins. However, current methods for determining hydrocyanation are not suitable for mass screening of mutants for protein engineering of these biocatalysts. We demonstrate herein a chromogenic high&#8208;throughput screening method for cyanohydrin synthesis that is validated by either substrate profiling or the directed evolution of HNLs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral cyanohydrins are useful intermediates in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. In nature, hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) are a kind of elegant tool for enantioselective hydrocyanation of carbonyl compounds. However, currently available methods for demonstrating hydrocyanation are still stalled at precise, but low&#8208;throughput, GC or HPLC analyses. Herein, we report a chromogenic high&#8208;throughput screening (HTS) method that is feasible for the cyanohydrin synthesis reaction. This method was highly anti&#8208;interference and sensitive, and could be used to directly profile the substrate scope of HNLs either in cell&#8208;free extract or fermentation clear broth. This HTS method was also validated by generating new variants of &lt;i&gt;Pc&lt;/i&gt;HNL5 that presented higher catalytic efficiency and stronger acidic tolerance in variant libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

A cool look at hot spots: A review of different intracellular thermometry techniques reveals the multidisciplinary approaches within the field. Recent developments have made these promising tools for biological studies, including the potential to investigate the energy flow and cost associated with amyloid&#8208;&#946; 42 (A&#946;42) aggregation, a prevailing characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract
Temperature is a fundamental physical parameter that influences biological processes in living cells. Hence, intracellular temperature mapping can be used to derive useful information reflective of thermodynamic properties and cellular behaviour. Herein, existing publications on different thermometry systems, focusing on those that employ fluorescence&#8208;based techniques, are reviewed. From developments based on fluorescent proteins and inorganic molecules to metal nanoclusters and fluorescent polymers, the general findings of intracellular measurements from different research groups are discussed. Furthermore, the contradiction of mitochondrial thermogenesis and nuclear&#8208;cytoplasmic temperature differences to current thermodynamic understanding are highlighted. Lastly, intracellular thermometry is proposed as a tool to quantify the energy flow and cost associated with amyloid&#8208;&#946;42 (A&#946;42) aggregation, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.

         <title>Photoregulation of gene expression with ligand&#8208;modified caged siRNAs through host/guest interaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small interfering RNA (siRNA) can effectively silence target gene through Argonate 2 (Ago2) induced RNA interference (RNAi). It is very important to control siRNA activity in spatial and temporal mode. Among different masking strategies, the photocaging strategy can be used to regulate gene expression through light irradiation with spatiotemporal and dose&#8208;dependent resolution. Many different caging strategies and caging groups have been reported for light&#8208;activated siRNA gene silencing. Herein, we describe a novel caging strategy that increases the blocking effect of RISC complex formation/process through host/guest (including ligand/receptor) interactions, thereby enhancing the inhibition of caged siRNA activity until light&#8208;activation. This strategy can be used as a general approach to design caged siRNAs for the photomodulation of many gene silencing.</dc:description>

         <title>The antimicrobial peptide Gad&#8208;1 clears Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms under cystic fibrosis conditions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is an emerging health issue and leads to a premature death. CF is a hereditary disease that creates thick mucus in the lungs that are prone to bacterial biofilm formation, specifically  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  biofilms. These biofilms are very difficult to treat because many of them have antibiotic resistance that is worsened by the presence of extracellular DNA (eDNA). eDNA helps to stabilize biofilms and can bind antimicrobial compounds to lessen their effects. The metallo&#8208;antimicrobial peptide Gaduscidin&#8208;1 (Gad&#8208;1) eradicates established  P. aeruginosa  biofilms through a combination of modes of action that include nuclease activity that can cleave eDNA in biofilms. In addition, Gad&#8208;1 exhibited synergistic activity when used with the antibiotics kanamycin and ciprofloxacin, making Gad&#8208;1 a new lead compound for potential treatment of bacterial biofilms in CF patients.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable hairpin structures formed by xylose based nucleic acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Xenobiology explores synthetic nucleic acid polymers as alternative carriers of genetic information to expand the central dogma. The xylo&#8208; and deoxyxylo&#8208;nucleic acids (XyNA and dXyNA), containing 3&#8217; epimers of riboses and deoxyriboses, are considered as potential candidates for an orthogonal system. In this study, thermal and spectroscopic analysis show that XyNA and dXyNA form stable hairpins. The dXyNA hairpin structure determined by NMR spectroscopy contains a flexible loop that locks the stem in a stable ladder&#8208;like duplex with marginal right&#8208;handed helicity. Reduced flexibility of the dXyNA duplex observed in the stem of the hairpin demonstrates that folding of dXyNA yields more stable structures as described so far.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for site&#8208;specific labeling of receptor proteins on surfaces of living cells using genetically encoded peptide tags</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence microscopic imaging allows investigations of receptor proteins within their biological context. A key challenge is to enable site&#8208;specific incorporation of reporter moieties into proteins without interfering with biological functions or cellular networks. Small peptide tags offer the opportunity to combine inducible labeling with small tag sizes that avoid receptor perturbation. Herein, we review the current state of live cell labeling of peptide&#8208;tagged cell surface proteins. Considering the importance as targets in medicinal chemistry, we focus on important membrane receptors such as G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). We discuss peptide tags that i) are subject to enzyme&#8208;mediated modification reactions, ii) guide complementation of reporter proteins, iii) form coiled&#8208;coil complexes, iv) interact with metal complexes, and discuss methods relying on binding of ligands with the protein of interest. Given own contributions in the field, we place emphasis on peptide&#8208;templated labeling chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Isopenicillin N Synthase: Crystallographic Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) is a nonheme iron oxidase (NHIO) which catalyses cyclisation of tripeptide &#948;&#8208;(  l  &#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminoadipoyl)&#8208;  l  &#8208;cysteinyl&#8208;  d  &#8208;valine (ACV) to bicyclic isopenicillin N (IPN). Over the last 25 years, crystallography has shed considerable light on the mechanism of IPNS catalysis. The first crystal structure, for apo&#8208;IPNS with Mn bound in place of iron at the active site, reported in 1995, was also the first structure for a member of the wider NHIO family. This was followed by the anaerobic enzyme&#8208;substrate complex IPNS&#8208;Fe&#8208;ACV (1997), this complex plus nitric oxide as a surrogate for co&#8208;substrate dioxygen (1997), and an enzyme product complex (1999). Since then, crystallography has been used to probe many aspects of the IPNS reaction mechanism, by crystallising the protein with a diversity of substrate analogues and triggering the oxidative reaction using elevated oxygen pressures to force the gaseous co&#8208;substrate throughout protein crystals and maximise synchronicity of turnover  in crystallo  . In this way, X&#8208;ray structures have been elucidated for a range of complexes closely related to and/or directly derived from key intermediates in the catalytic cycle, answering numerous mechanistic questions that had arisen from solution&#8208;phase experiments, and posing many new ones. The results of these crystallographic studies have in turn informed computational experiments which have brought further insight. These combined crystallographic and computational investigations augment and extend the results of earlier spectroscopic analyses and solution phase studies of IPNS turnover, to enrich our understanding of this important protein and the wider NHIO enzyme family.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into mechanism of action and peptide&#8208;membrane interactions of Aib&#8208;rich peptides: multi&#8208;technique experimental and theoretical analysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increase in resistant bacterial strains necessitates the identification of new antimicrobial molecules. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are an attractive option because of evidence that bacteria cannot easily develop resistance to AMPs. The peptaibols, a class of naturally&#8208;occurring AMPs, have shown particular promise as antimicrobial drugs, but their development has been hindered because their mechanism of action is not clearly understood. To explore how peptaibols might interact with membranes, circular dichroism (CD), vibrational circular dichroism (VCD), linear dichroism (LD), Raman spectroscopy, Raman optical activity (ROA), neutron reflectivity and molecular dynamics simulations have been used to study a small library of peptaibol mimics, Aib&#8208;rich peptides. All studied peptides quickly partitioned and oriented in membranes,&#160; and we found evidence of chiral interactions between the phospholipids and membrane&#8208;embedded peptides. The protocols presented in this paper open new ground by showing how chiro&#8208;optical spectroscopies can throw light on the mechanism of action of AMPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Amphiphilic Aminoglycoside Probes for Study of Transfection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this communication, we report on the characterization of amphiphilic aminoglycoside conjugates containing luminophores with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties as transfection reagents. These inherently luminescent transfection vectors are capable of binding plasmid DNA via electrostatic interactions; binding results in an emission &#8220;on&#8221; signal due to restriction of intramolecular motion of the luminophore core. The luminescent cationic amphiphiles effectively transferred plasmid DNA into mammalian cells (HeLa, HEK 293T), as proven by expression of a red fluorescent protein marker. The morphologies of the aggregates were investigated by microscopy as well as &#950;&#8208;potential and dynamic light scattering measurements. The transfection efficiencies using luminescent cationic amphiphiles were similar to that of the gold standard transfection reagent Lipofectamine &#174;  2000.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization Driven by Base Stacking</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers, relying on reversible intermolecular interactions, promise a wide range of applications, including optoelectronic and self&#8208;healing materials, biomedical delivery materials,  etc  . Among potential molecular candidates, DNA strands act as an excellent platform. DNA has a well&#8208;established secondary structure (double helix) and its intermolecular interactions can be readily thermodynamically engineered and kinetically controlled. Extensive studies have demonstrated that a various DNA motifs can polymerize/assemble into large polymers with different topology, geometry, and dimensionalities. Most of the reported polymerization is driven by hybridization of DNA strands. Herein, we report a novel system of DNA supramolecular polymerization that is driven by DNA base stacking. The polymerization has been confirmed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We believe that this work will expand the toolbox for DNA supramolecular polymerization and would, with further development, increase further control of DNA supramolecular polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Post&#8208;glycosylation Modification of Sugar Moieties in Kanamycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kanamycin A is the major 2&#8208;deoxystreptamine (2DOS)&#8208;containing aminoglycoside antibiotic produced by&#160;Streptomyces kanamyceticus. The 2DOS moiety is linked with 6&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;glucose (6ADG) at O&#8208;4 and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;glucose at O&#8208;6. Because the 6ADG moiety is derived from&#160;d&#8208;glucosamine (GlcN), deamination at C&#8208;2 and introduction of C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2&#160;are required in the biosynthesis. A dehydrogenase KanQ and an aminotransferase KanB are presumed to be responsible for the introduction of C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2, although the substrates have not been identified. Here, we examined the substrate specificity of KanQ to better understand the biosynthetic pathway. It was found that KanQ oxidized kanamycin C more efficiently than the 3''&#8208;deamino derivative. Furthermore, substrate specificity of an oxygenase KanJ, which is responsible for deamination at C&#8208;2 of the GlcN moiety, was examined, and the crystal structure of KanJ was determined. It was found that C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2&#160;is important for&#160;substrate&#160;recognition by KanJ. Thus, the modification of the GlcN moiety occurs after pseudotrisaccharide formation, followed by the introduction of C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2&#160;by KanQ/KanB and deamination at C&#8208;2 by KanJ.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of an allosteric ligand binding site in SMYD3 lysine methyltransferase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SMYD3 is a multifunctional epigenetic enzyme with lysine methyl transferase activity and various interaction partners. It is implicated in the pathophysiology of cancers but with an unclear mechanism. To discover tool compounds for clarifying its biochemistry and potential as a therapeutic target, a set of drug&#8208;like compounds was screened using a biosensor&#8208;based competition assay. Diperodon was identified as an allosteric ligand. The (  R  )&#8208;and (  S  )&#8208;enantiomers of the racemic drug were isolated and their affinities determined (  K  D  &gt; = 42 and 84 &#956;M). Co&#8208;crystallization revealed that both enantiomers bind to a previously unidentified allosteric site in the C&#8208;terminal protein binding domain, consistent with its weak inhibitory effect. No competition between diperodon and HSP90 (a known SMYD3 interaction partner) was observed although HSP90&#8208;SMYD3 binding was confirmed (  K  D  = 13 &#956;M). The allosteric site appears to be druggable and suitable for exploration of non&#8208;catalytic SMYD3 functions and therapeutics with new mechanisms of action.</dc:description>

         <title>An Artificial Cofactor Catalyzing the Baylis&#8208;Hillman Reaction using Designed Streptavidin as Protein Host</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An artificial cofactor based on an organocatalyst embedded in a protein was used to conduct the Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction in a buffered system. As protein host, we chose streptavidin, since it can be easily crystallized and thereby supports the design process. The protein host around the cofactor was rationally designed on the basis of high&#8208;resolution crystal structures obtained after each variation of the amino acid sequence. Additionally, DFT&#8208;calculated intermediates and transition states were used to rationalize the observed activity. Finally, repeated cycles of structure determination and redesign led to a system with up to one order of magnitude increase in activity over the bare cofactor and to the most active proteinogenic catalyst for the Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction known today.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cyanine&#8208;Bridged Somatostatin Hybrid Probe for Multimodal SSTR2 Imaging in Vitro and in Vivo: Synthesis and Evaluation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional cyanine dyes: Multimodal imaging agents can be built up based on an asymmetric cyanine dye connecting the radionuclide and targeting unit. Insertion of a cyanine dye into the clinically approved radiopharmaceutical 68Ga&#8208;DOTATATE allowed the identification of cancer tissue in&#8197;vivo and ex vivo by using radionuclear and fluorescence imaging.







Abstract
Multimodal imaging probes have attracted the interest of ongoing research, for example, for the surgical removal of tumors. Modular synthesis approaches allow the construction of hybrid probes consisting of a radiotracer, a fluorophore and a targeting unit. We present the synthesis of a new asymmetric bifunctional cyanine dye that can be used as a structural and functional linker for the construction of such hybrid probes. 68Ga&#8208;DOTATATE, a well&#8208;characterized radiopeptide targeting the overexpressed somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) in neuroendocrine tumors, was labeled with our cyanine dye, thus providing additional information along with the data obtained from the radiotracer. We tested the SSTR2&#8208;targeting and imaging properties of the resulting probe 68Ga&#8208;DOTA&#8208;ICC&#8208;TATE in&#8197;vitro and in a tumor xenograft mouse model. Despite the close proximity between dye and pharmacophore, we observed a high binding affinity towards SSTR2 as well as elevated uptake in SSTR2&#8208;overexpressing tumors in the positron emission tomography (PET) scan and histological examination.

         <title>Pyrene Tags for the Detection of Carbohydrates by Label&#8208;Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation Mass Spectrometry**

Gie it LALDI! The derivatisation of (bio)molecules with laser desorption/ionisation (LDI) enhancers allows their selective detection by label&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (LALDI&#8208;MS). We have developed and characterised pyrene&#8208;based LDI enhancers (LALDI tags) for the labelling and LALDI&#8208;MS analysis of reducing carbohydrates, highlighting the compatibility of LALDI&#8208;MS with complex biological samples.







Abstract
Matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (MALDI&#8208;MS) is widely used for the analysis of biomolecules. Label&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (LALDI&#8208;MS) is a matrix&#8208;free variant of MALDI&#8208;MS, in which only analytes covalently attached to a laser desorption/ionisation (LDI) enhancer are detected. LALDI&#8208;MS has shown promise in overcoming the limitations of MALDI&#8208;MS in terms of sample preparation and MS analysis. In this work, we have developed a series of pyrene&#8208;based LDI reagents (LALDI tags) that can be used for labelling and LALDI&#8208;MS analysis of reducing carbohydrates from complex (biological) samples without the need for additional chemical derivatisation or purification. We have systematically explored the suitability of four pyrene&#8208;based LDI enhancers and three aldehyde&#8208;reactive handles, optimised sample preparation, and demonstrated the use of LALDI tags for the detection of lactose. We have also exemplified the potential of LALDI tags for labelling carbohydrates in biological samples by direct detection of lactose in cow's milk. These results demonstrate that LALDI&#8208;MS is a promising technique for the analysis of reducing carbohydrates in biological samples, and pave the way for the development of LALDI&#8208;MS for glycomics and diagnostics.

         <title>Recent advances in two&#8208;photon AIEgens and its application in biological systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two photon fluorescence imaging technology has the advantages of high light stability, small light damage and high spatial&#8208;temporal resolution, which is a powerful biological analysis method.&#160;However, due to the high concentration or aggregation state of traditional organic light&#8208;emitting molecules, the fluorescence intensity is easy to reduce or completely disappear, and is not conducive to its optimal application. The concept of aggregation induced luminescence (AIE) provides a solution to solve the problem of aggregation induced luminescence quenching (ACQ), and realizes the high fluorescence quantum yield of luminescent molecules in the aggregation state. In addition, two&#8208;photon absorption property can be readily improved by just increase loading contents of AIE fluorogen&#160;(AIEgen). Therefore, the design and preparation of two&#8208;photon fluorescence probe based on AIEgen&#160;to achieve high&#8208;efficiency fluorescence imaging in vitro / in vivo has become a major research hotspot.&#160;This review aims to summarize the highlight representative two&#8208;photon AIEgens based on triphenylamine, tetraphenylethene,&#160;quinoline, naphthalene&#160;and the other new structures&#160;in the past five years, and discuss their great potential in bioimaging applications.</dc:description>

         <title>How To Quantify a Genetic Firewall? A Polarity&#8208;Based Metric for Genetic Code Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantifying the distance: If two organisms operate under different genetic codes, how likely is that they could still properly interpret each other's genes? We introduce a versatile metric to quantify the distance between the different genetic codes. It can calculate the distance (dissimilarity) between genetic codes and can be applied with the 20 canonical but also noncanonical amino acids.







Abstract
Genetic code engineering aims to produce organisms that translate genetic information in a different way from that prescribed by the standard genetic code. This endeavor could eventually lead to genetic isolation, where an organism that operates under a different genetic code will not be able to transfer functional genes with other living species, thereby standing behind a genetic firewall. It is not clear however, how distinct the code should be, or how to measure the distance. We have developed a metric (&#916;code) where we assigned polarity indices (clog&#8197;D7) to amino acids to calculate the distances between pairs of genetic codes. We then calculated the distance between a set of 204 genetic codes, including the 24 known distinct natural codes, 11 extreme&#8208;distance codes created computationally, nine theoretical special purpose codes from literature and 160 codes in which canonical amino acids were replaced by noncanonical chemical analogues. The metric can be used for building strategies towards creating semantically alienated organisms, and testing the strength of genetic firewalls. This metric provides the basis for a map of the genetic codes that could guide future efforts towards novel biochemical worlds, biosafety and deep barcoding applications.

         <title>Release of Soybean Isoflavones by Using a &#946;&#8208;Glucosidase from Alicyclobacillus herbarius</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tough guy: Enzymatic characterisation showed that a &#946;&#8208;glycosidase from Alicyclobacillus herbarius was stable over a broad range of pH values and temperatures, also exhibiting excellent tolerance to sugars and organic solvents, specially to ethanol. The enzyme was applied in the hydrolysis of isoflavone glucosides in an ethanolic extract of soy flour with outstanding results.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Glucosidases are used in the food industry to hydrolyse glycosidic bonds in complex sugars, with enzymes sourced from extremophiles better able to tolerate the process conditions. In this work, a novel &#946;&#8208;glycosidase from the acidophilic organism Alicyclobacillus herbarius was cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). AheGH1 was stable over a broad range of pH values (5&#8211;11) and temperatures (4&#8211;55&#8201;&#176;C). The enzyme exhibited excellent tolerance to fructose and good tolerance to glucose, retaining 65&#8201;% activity in the presence of 10&#8201;% (w/v) glucose. It also tolerated organic solvents, some of which appeared to have a stimulating effect, in particular ethanol with a 1.7&#8208;fold increase in activity at 10&#8201;% (v/v). The enzyme was then applied for the cleavage of isoflavone from isoflavone glucosides in an ethanolic extract of soy flour, to produce soy isoflavones, which constitute a valuable food supplement, full conversion was achieved within 15&#8197;min at 30&#8201;&#176;C.

It also tolerated organic solvents, some of which appeared to have a stimulating effect, in particular ethanol with a 1.7&#8208;fold increase in activity at 10&#8201;% (&lt;i&gt;v/v&lt;/i&gt;). The enzyme was then applied for the cleavage of isoflavone from isoflavone glucosides in an ethanolic extract of soy flour, to produce soy isoflavones, which constitute a valuable food supplement, full conversion was achieved within 15&#8197;min at 30&#8201;&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Advanced Understanding of the Electron Transfer Pathway of Cytochrome P450s</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile P450s catalyze various reactions upon acquiring electrons from redox partners. Electrons transferred from the cofactor to heme are of central importance to P450 action, but the route electrons travel remains unveiled. This issue might be probed under the guidance of recent structural studies of self&#8208;sufficient P450s.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450s are heme&#8208;thiolate enzymes that participate in carbon source assimilation, natural compound biosynthesis and xenobiotic metabolism in all kingdoms of life. P450s can catalyze various reactions by using a wide range of organic compounds, thus exhibiting great potential in biotechnological applications. The catalytic reactions of P450s are driven by electron equivalents that are sourced from pyridine nucleotides and delivered by cognate or matching redox partners (RPs). The electron transfer (ET) route from RPs to P450s involves one or more redox center&#8208;containing domains. As the rate of ET is one of the main determinants of P450 efficacy, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the P450 ET pathway should increase our knowledge of these important enzymes and benefit their further applications. Here, the various P450 RP systems along with current understanding of their ET routes will be reviewed. Notably, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art structural studies of the two main types of self&#8208;sufficient P450 will also be summarized.

         <title>Tetrahedral DNA Nanoconjugates for Simultaneous Measurement of Telomerase Activity and miRNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seeing dots and AuNPs: Tetrahedral DNA nanoconjugates have been constructed from DNA, peptides, gold nanoparticles and carbon nanodots. Target telomerase and miRNA can achieve strand displacement of corresponding DNA strands with quenched fluorescence reporters. The as&#8208;prepared biosystem is suitable for the simultaneous sensing and imaging of the dual biomarkers for diagnostics purposes.







Abstract
In this study, a tetrahedral DNA nanostructure was first self&#8208;assembled; this was then conjugated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and carbon nanodots (CDs). The fabricated nanocomposites allow simultaneous analysis of telomerase activity and miRNA with dual fluorescence channels. By further introducing an iRGD peptide sequence, the nanoconjuates can be conveniently transferred inside living cells for in&#8197;situ imaging. The analytical performances and anti&#8208;jamming capabilities are excellent. Meanwhile, the materials are highly biocompatible for intracellular applications. Therefore, the proposed biosystem shows great promise as a powerful tool for quantitative analysis of the dual biomarkers. The strategy can also be further exploited as a versatile platform for in&#8197;situ detection of many other targets for early disease diagnosis.

         <title>Expanding the Toolbox of R&#8208;Selective Amine Transaminases by Identification and Characterization of New Members</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diversifying: The toolbox of R&#8208;selective amine transaminases (ATAs) has been expanded by an ATA containing a motif characteristic for d&#8208;ATAs, two ATAs with a shortened/missing N&#8208;terminal helix and the first ATA with known structure from a Gram&#8208;negative bacterium. Their active site charges vary significantly compared to known ATAs correlating with their diverging substrate scope.







Abstract
Amine transaminases (ATAs) are used to synthesize enantiomerically pure amines, which are building blocks for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. R&#8208;selective ATAs belong to the fold type IV PLP&#8208;dependent enzymes, and different sequence&#8208;, structure&#8208; and substrate scope&#8208;based features have been identified in the past decade. However, our knowledge is still restricted due to the limited number of characterized (R)&#8208;ATAs, with additional bias towards fungal origin. We aimed to expand the toolbox of (R)&#8208;ATAs and contribute to the understanding of this enzyme subfamily. We identified and characterized four new (R)&#8208;ATAs. The ATA from Exophiala sideris contains a motif characteristic for d&#8208;ATAs, which was previously believed to be a disqualifying factor for (R)&#8208;ATA activity. The crystal structure of the ATA from Shinella is the first from a Gram&#8208;negative bacterium. The ATAs from Pseudonocardia acaciae and Tetrasphaera japonica are the first characterized (R)&#8208;ATAs with a shortened/missing N&#8208;terminal helix. The active&#8208;site charges vary significantly between the new and known ATAs, correlating with their diverging substrate scope.

         <title>Peptide vectors carry pyrene to cell organelles allowing real&#8208;time quantification of free radicals in mitochondria by time&#8208;resolved fluorescence microscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Real time quantification of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS) in cells is of paramount importance as they are essential for cellular functions. Their excessive formation contributes to the dysfunction of cells and organisms ultimately leading to cell death. As ROS are mostly produced at the mitochondria, we have synthesized a fluorescent probe able to reach this organelle to detect and quantify, in real time, the variation of ROS by time&#8208;resolved microfluorimetry. The new probes are based on the long fluorescence lifetime of pyrene butyric acid (PBA). Two PBA isomers, attached at their 1&#8208; or 2&#8208; positions to a peptide vector to target mitochondria, were compared and were shown to allow the measurement of free radical species and oxygen, but not non&#8208;radical species such as H  2  O  2  .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>G&#8208;Quadruplex (GQ) and  i&#8208;  motif structures are the paradigmatic examples of non&#8208;classical tetra&#8208;stranded nucleic acids having multifarious biological functions and widespread applications in therapeutics and material science. Recently, the tetraplexes emerged as the promising ant  i&#8208;  cancer targets due to their structural robustness, gene&#8208;regulatory roles, and predominant distribution at the specific loci of the oncogenes. However, it is arguable whether  i&#8208;  motif evolves in the complementary single&#8208;stranded region after GQ&#8208;formation in its opposite strand and  vice versa  . In this review, we addressed the prerequisites and significance of simultaneous and/or mutually exclusive formation of GQ and  i&#8208;  motif structures at the complementary and sequential positions in the duplex under cellular milieu. We discussed how their dynamic interplay poises cellular homeostasis and exacerbates carcinogenesis. The review revealed invaluable insights on the spatiotemporal formation of GQ and  i&#8208;  motifs that could be harnessed to design different types of reporter systems and diagnostic platform for potential bioanalytical and therapeutic intervention.</dc:description>

         <title>Comparative biochemistry of four polyester (PET) hydrolases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The potential of bioprocessing in a circular plastic economy has strongly stimulated research in enzymatic degradation of different synthetic polymers.

         <title>The Perturbed Free Energy Landscape: Linking Ligand Binding to Biomolecular Folding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effects of ligand binding on biomolecular conformation are crucial in drug design, enzyme mechanisms, regulation of gene expression, and other biological processes. Descriptive models; &#8220;lock and key&#8221;, &#8220;induced fit&#8221;, and &#8220;conformational selection&#8221; are common ways to interpret such interactions. Another historical model, linked equilibria, proposes that the Free Energy Landscape (FEL) is perturbed by the addition of ligand binding energy for the bound population of biomolecules. This principle leads to a unified, quantitative theory of ligand&#8208;induced conformational change, building upon the FEL concept. We call the map of binding free energy over biomolecular conformational space the &#8220;binding affinity landscape&#8221; (BAL). The perturbed FEL predicts/explains ligand&#8208;induced conformational changes conforming to all common descriptive models. We review recent experimental and computational studies that exemplify the perturbed FEL, with emphasis on RNA. This way of understanding ligand&#8208;induced conformational dynamics motivates new experimental and theoretical approaches to ligand design, structural biology and systems biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Incorporation of Clickable Unnatural Amino Acids Enables Rapid and Biocompatible Labeling of Proteins in Vitro and in Bacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids (uAAs) bearing a bioorthogonal group has enabled the attachment &#8211; typically at a single site or at a few sites per protein &#8211; of chemical groups at precise locations for protein and biomaterial labeling, conjugation, and functionalization. Here, we report the evolution of chromosomal  Methanocaldococcus jannaschii  tyrosyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (aaRS) for the alkyne&#8208;bearing uAA, 4&#8208;propargyloxy&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine (pPR), with ~30&#8208;fold increased production of green fluorescent protein containing 3 instances of pPR compared with a previously described  M. jannaschii  derived aaRS for pPR, when expressed from a single chromosomal copy. We show that when expressed from multi&#8208;copy plasmids, the evolved aaRSs enable the production &#8211; using a genomically recoded  Escherichia coli  and the non&#8208;recoded BL21  E. coli  strain &#8211; of elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs) containing multiple pPR residues in high yields. We further show that the multi&#8208;site incorporation of pPR in ELPs facilitates the rapid, robust, and non&#8208;toxic fluorescent labeling of these proteins in bacteria. The evolved variants described in this work can be utilized to produce a variety of protein and biomaterial conjugates and to create efficient minimal tags for protein labeling.</dc:description>

         <title>Quadruplex&#8208;Templated and Catalyzed Ligation of Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA catalytic system templated and catalyzed by quadruplexes. This system can create new opportunities for chemical reactions requiring harsh experimental conditions unsuitable for DNA duplex&#8208;templated systems. The quadruplex&#8208;templated system might represent initial DNA catalytic reaction involved in primordial evolution.







Abstract
Template&#8208;guided chemical reactions between nucleic acid strands are an important process in biomedical research. However, almost all of these reactions employ an oligonucleotide&#8208;templated approach that is based on the double&#8208;helix alignment. The moderate stability of the double helix makes this approach unsuitable for many chemical reactions, so alternative nucleic acid alignment mechanisms, demonstrating higher thermal and chemical stability, are desirable. Earlier, we described a noncovalent coupling mechanism between DNA strands through a quadruplex&#8208;and&#8208;Mg2+ connection (QMC). QMC is based on G&#8208;quadruplexes and allows unusually stable and specific interactions. Herein, a novel catalytic nucleic acid reaction, based on QMC, is described. This approach uses G&#8208;tetrads as a structural and recognition element without employing Watson&#8208;Crick complementarity rules at any stage of substrate/catalyst formation or interaction between them. Quadruplex&#8208;templated ligation can be achieved through the self&#8208;ligation of two nucleic acid strands, or through a quadruplex catalyst, which forms a G&#8208;triplex and specifically connects the strands. The process is extraordinarily robust and efficient. For instance, the ligation of carbodiimide&#8208;activated substrates can proceed in boiling solutions, and complete ligation is demonstrated within a minute. The quadruplex&#8208;templated and catalyzed reactions will create new opportunities for chemical reactions requiring harsh experimental conditions.

         <title>Simplified Monopalmitoyl Toll&#8208;like Receptor 2 Ligand Mini&#8208;UPam for Self&#8208;Adjuvanting Neoantigen&#8208;Based Synthetic Cancer Vaccines</title>

         <dc:description>
Less lipophilic ligands: A novel TLR2 ligand has been designed and synthesized to be subsequently conjugated with synthetic peptides containing clinically relevant neoepitopes. By treating HEK&#8208;TLR2 cells, human moDCs and antigen specific human T&#8208;cells with these new constructs, the immunogenic potential of the new TLR2 ligand and the conjugation of TLR ligands with neoepitopes was assessed.







Abstract
Synthetic vaccines, based on antigenic peptides that comprise MHC&#8722;I and MHC&#8208;II T&#8208;cell epitopes expressed by tumors, show great promise for the immunotherapy of cancer. For optimal immunogenicity, the synthetic peptides (SPs) should be adjuvanted with suitable immunostimulatory additives. Previously, we have shown that improved immunogenicity in&#8197;vivo is obtained with vaccine modalities in which an SP is covalently connected to an adjuvanting moiety, typically a ligand to Toll&#8208;like receptor 2 (TLR2). SPs were covalently attached to UPam, which is a derivative of the classic TLR2 ligand Pam3CysSK4. A disadvantage of the triply palmitoylated UPam is its high lipophilicity, which precludes universal adoption of this adjuvant for covalent modification of various antigenic peptides as it renders the synthetic vaccine insoluble in several cases. Here, we report a novel conjugatable TLR2 ligand, mini&#8208;UPam, which contains only one palmitoyl chain, rather than three, and therefore has less impact on the solubility and other physicochemical properties of a synthetic peptide. In this study, we used SPs that contain the clinically relevant neoepitopes identified in a melanoma patient who completely recovered after T&#8208;cell therapy. Homogeneous mini&#8208;UPam&#8208;SP conjugates have been prepared in good yields by stepwise solid&#8208;phase synthesis that employed a mini&#8208;UPam building block pre&#8208;prepared in solution and the standard set of Fmoc&#8208;amino acids. The immunogenicity of the novel mini&#8208;UPam&#8208;SP conjugates was demonstrated by using the cancer patient's T&#8208;cells.

         <title>Ferritin as a Platform for Creating Antiviral Mosaic Nanocages: Prospects for Treating COVID&#8208;19</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tackling bottlenecks: Antibody&#8208;dependent enhancement of infection and low or narrow efficacy against strains of a virus are two bottlenecks to antibody therapy and vaccines. To tackle them, I propose using ferritin to develop novel antiviral mosaic nanocages that could deliver a cocktail of antibodies, nanobodies, or a combination of therapeutics, deceive a virus, or elicit a broad neutralizing antibody response.







Abstract
Infectious diseases are a continues threat to human health and the economy worldwide. The latest example is the global pandemic of COVID&#8208;19 caused by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Antibody therapy and vaccines are promising approaches to treat the disease; however, they have bottlenecks: they might have low efficacy or narrow breadth due to the continuous emergence of new strains of the virus or antibodies could cause antibody&#8208;dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. To address these bottlenecks, I propose the use of 24&#8208;meric ferritin for the synthesis of mosaic nanocages to deliver a cocktail of antibodies or nanobodies alone or in combination with another therapeutic, like a nucleotide analogue, to mimic the viral entry process and deceive the virus, or to develop mosaic vaccines. I argue that available data showing the effectiveness of ferritin&#8208;antibody conjugates in targeting specific cells and ferritin&#8208;haemagglutinin nanocages in developing influenza vaccines strongly support my proposals.

&lt;p&gt;Infectious diseases are a continues threat to human health and the economy worldwide. The latest example is the global pandemic of COVID&#8208;19 caused by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Antibody therapy and vaccines are promising approaches to treat the disease; however, they have bottlenecks: they might have low efficacy or narrow breadth due to the continuous emergence of new strains of the virus or antibodies could cause antibody&#8208;dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. To address these bottlenecks, I propose the use of 24&#8208;meric ferritin for the synthesis of mosaic nanocages to deliver a cocktail of antibodies or nanobodies alone or in combination with another therapeutic, like a nucleotide analogue, to mimic the viral entry process and deceive the virus, or to develop mosaic vaccines. I argue that available data showing the effectiveness of ferritin&#8208;antibody conjugates in targeting specific cells and ferritin&#8208;haemagglutinin nanocages in developing influenza vaccines strongly support my proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Site&#8208;Directed Mutagenesis of Modular Polyketide Synthase Ketoreductase Domains for Altered Stereochemical Control</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Steering synthesis: Type&#8197;I polyketide synthase ketoreductases (KRs) have been probed by mutagenesis to enforce stereochemical control. Work has focused on isolated KRs excised from megasynthases with diffusible substrates. Herein, we provide an overview of the mutagenesis experiments performed to date for systematic comparison. This information could be harnessed to fine&#8208;tune the creation of polyketide products through engineered biosynthesis.







Abstract
Bacterial modular type&#8197;I polyketide synthases (PKSs) are complex multidomain assembly line proteins that produce a range of pharmaceutically relevant molecules with a high degree of stereochemical control. Due to their colinear properties, they have been considerable targets for rational biosynthetic pathway engineering. Among the domains harbored within these complex assembly lines, ketoreductase (KR) domains have been extensively studied with the goal of altering their stereoselectivity by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, as they confer much of the stereochemical complexity present in pharmaceutically active reduced polyketide scaffolds. Here we review all efforts to date to perform site&#8208;directed mutagenesis on PKS KRs, most of which have been done in the context of excised KR domains on model diffusible substrates such as &#946;&#8208;keto N&#8208;acetyl cysteamine thioesters. We also discuss the challenges around translating the findings of these studies to alter stereocontrol in the context of a complex multidomain enzymatic assembly line.

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin Encapsulation of Synthetic AHLs: Drug Delivery Implications and Quorum&#8208;Quenching Exploits</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution solution: Synthetic AHL analogues (SAHLAs) have demonstrated efficacy as quorum sensing inhibitors by receptor antagonism. However, like native AHLs, these compounds are poorly soluble.

Abstract
Many bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, regulate phenotypic switching in a population density&#8208;dependent manner through a phenomenon known as quorum sensing (QS). For Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, QS relies on the synthesis, transmission, and perception of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight signal molecules that are predominantly N&#8208;acyl&#8208;l&#8208;homoserine lactones (AHLs). Efforts to disrupt AHL&#8208;mediated QS have largely focused on the development of synthetic AHL analogues (SAHLAs) that are structurally similar to native AHLs. However, like AHLs, these molecules tend to be hydrophobic and are poorly soluble under aqueous conditions. Water&#8208;soluble macrocycles, such as cyclodextrins (CDs), that encapsulate hydrophobic guests have long been used by both the agricultural and pharmaceutical industries to overcome the solubility issues associated with hydrophobic compounds of interest. Conveniently, CDs have also demonstrated anti&#8208;AHL&#8208;mediated QS effects. Here, using fluorescence spectroscopy, NMR spectrometry, and mass spectrometry, we evaluate the affinity of SAHLAs, as well as their hydrolysis products, for &#946;&#8208;CD inclusion. We also evaluated the ability of these complexes to inhibit wild&#8208;type P. aeruginosa virulence in a Caenorhabditis elegans host infection study, for the first time. Our efforts confirm the potential of &#946;&#8208;CDs for the improved delivery of SAHLAs at the host/microbial interface, expanding the utility of this approach as a strategy for probing and controlling QS.

         <title>Ligand Induced Cu(II) Transport restricts Cancer and Mycobacterial Growth: Towards a Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Select Ion Channel Scaffold</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic channels with high ion&#8208;selectivity are attractive drug targets for diseases involving ion dysregulation. Achieving selective transport of divalent ions is highly challenging due their high hydration energies. A small tripeptide amphiphilic scaffold installed with a pybox ligand selectively transports Cu(II) ions across membranes. The peptide forms stable dimeric pores in the membrane and transports ions via a Cu 2+ /H + antiport mechanism. The ligand&#8208;induced excellent Cu(II) selectivity as well as high membrane permeability of the peptide is exploited to promote cancer cell death. The peptide&#8217;s ability to restrict mycobacterial growth serves as seeds to evolve antibacterial strategies centered on selectively modulating ion homeostasis in pathogens. This simple peptide can potentially function as a universal, yet versatile, scaffold wherein the ion&#8208;selectivity can be precisely controlled by modifying the ligand at the C&#8208;terminus.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Antibody Fragment Conjugates for Reversible Staining in Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugates. We present a novel strategy for the efficient and site&#8208;specific generation of nanobody&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugates in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry by Tub&#8208;tag&#8208;mediated conjugation. We show a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept that these conjugates can readily be used for reversible staining in confocal fluorescence microscopy.







Abstract
Antibody conjugates have taken a great leap forward as tools in basic and applied molecular life sciences that was enabled by the development of chemoselective reactions for the site&#8208;specific modification of proteins. Antibody&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugates combine the antibody's target specificity with the reversible, sequence&#8208;encoded binding properties of oligonucleotides like DNAs or peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), allowing sequential imaging of large numbers of targets in a single specimen. In this report, we use the Tub&#8208;tag&#174; technology in combination with Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition for the site&#8208;specific conjugation of single DNA and PNA strands to an eGFP&#8208;binding nanobody. We show binding of the conjugate to recombinant eGFP and subsequent sequence&#8208;specific annealing of fluorescently labelled imager strands. Furthermore, we reversibly stain eGFP&#8208;tagged proteins in human cells, thus demonstrating the suitability of our conjugation strategy to generate antibody&#8208;oligonucleotides for reversible immunofluorescence imaging.

         <title>Metabolic Glycoengineering with Azide&#8208; and Alkene&#8208;Modified Hexosamines: Quantification of Sialic Acid Levels</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Where do the sugars go? This is the question when synthetic monosaccharide derivatives are added to the culture medium of cells during metabolic glycoengineering (MGE). We studied the effect of MGE on cellular sialic acid levels and found marked differences between the cell interior and the cell surface.







Abstract
Metabolic glycoengineering (MGE) is an established method to incorporate chemical reporter groups into cellular glycans for subsequent bioorthogonal labeling. The method has found broad application for the visualization and isolation of glycans allowing their biological roles to be probed. Furthermore, targeting of drugs to cancer cells that present high concentrations of sialic acids on their surface is an attractive approach. We report the application of a labeling reaction using 1,2&#8208;diamino&#8208;4,5&#8208;methylenedioxybenzene for the quantification of sialic acid derivates after MGE with various azide&#8208; and alkene&#8208;modified ManNAc, GlcNAc, and GalNAc derivatives. We followed the time course of sialic acid production and were able to detect sialic acids modified with the chemical reporter group &#8211; not only after addition of ManNAc derivatives to the cell culture. A cyclopropane&#8208;modified ManNAc derivative, being a model for the corresponding cyclopropene analog, which undergoes fast inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines, resulted in the highest incorporation efficiency. Furthermore, we investigated whether feeding the cells with natural and unnatural ManNAc derivative results in increased levels of sialic acids and found that this is strongly dependent on the investigated cell type and cell fraction. For HEK 293T cells, a strong increase in free sialic acids in the cell interior was found, whereas cell&#8208;surface sialic acid levels are only moderately increased.

Furthermore, we investigated whether feeding the cells with natural and unnatural ManNAc derivative results in increased levels of sialic acids and found that this is strongly dependent on the investigated cell type and cell fraction. For HEK 293T cells, a strong increase in free sialic acids in the cell interior was found, whereas cell&#8208;surface sialic acid levels are only moderately increased.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Superior Proton&#8208;Transfer Catalytic Promiscuity of Cytochrome&#8197;c in Self&#8208;Organized Media</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vintage and versatile: A catalytic property of cyt&#8197;c towards proton transfer reactions occurs only in membrane&#8208;mimetic media and mostly proceeds through the involvement of His18 in the case of ferricytochrome&#8197;c. This result strengthens the previous claim of promiscuous biocatalytic property of early developed protein/enzymes in evolutionary processes, and exemplifies emergent behavioural properties of biomolecules in response to their surroundings.







Abstract
Evolutionarily elderly proteins commonly feature greater catalytic promiscuity. Cytochrome&#8197;c is among the first set of proteins in evolution to have known prospects in electron transport and peroxidative properties. Here, we report that cyt&#8197;c is also a proficient proton&#8208;transfer catalyst and enhances the Kemp elimination (KE; model reaction to show proton transfer catalytic property) by &#8764;750&#8208;fold on self&#8208;organized systems like micelles and vesicles. The self&#8208;organized systems mimic the mitochondrial environment in&#8197;vitro for cyt&#8197;c. Using an array of biophysical and biochemical mutational assays, both acid&#8211;base and redox mechanistic pathways have been explored. The histidine moiety close to hemin group (His18) is mainly responsible for proton abstraction to promote the concerted E2 pathway for KE catalysis when cyt&#8197;c is in its oxidized form; this has also been confirmed by a H18A mutant of cyt&#8197;c. However, the redox pathway is predominant under reducing conditions in the presence of dithiothreitol over the pH range 6&#8211;7.4. Interestingly, we found almost 750&#8208;fold enhanced KE catalysis by cyt&#8197;c compared to aqueous buffer. Overall, in addition to providing mechanistic insights, the data reveal an unprecedented catalytic property of cyt&#8197;c that could be of high importance in an evolutionary perspective considering its role in delineating the phylogenic tree and also towards generating programmable designer biocatalysts.

         <title>The Antibacterial Drug Candidate SBC3 is a Potent Inhibitor of Bacterial Thioredoxin Reductase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver lining: Antibiotic resistance jeopardizes the effective treatment of infectious diseases and represents an increasing threat to public health. We discovered that the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene 1,3&#8208;dibenzyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diphenylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene silver(I) acetate (SBC3) is a potent inhibitor of bacterial thioredoxin reductase that proved to be highly effective against resistant Gram&#8208;negative nosocomial isolates.







Abstract
Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem for public health and associated with increasing economic costs and mortality rates. Silver and silver&#8208;related compounds have been used for centuries due to their antimicrobial properties. In this work, we show that 1,3&#8208;dibenzyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene silver(I) acetate/NHC*&#8208;Ag&#8208;OAc (SBC3) is a reversible, high affinity inhibitor of E. coli thioredoxin reductase (TrxR; Ki=10.8&#177;1.2&#8197;nM). Minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) tests with different E. coli and P. aeruginosa strains demonstrated that SBC3 can efficiently inhibit bacterial cell growth, especially in combination with established antibiotics like gentamicin. Our results show that SBC3 is a promising antibiotic drug candidate targeting bacterial TrxR.

         <title>Engineered Microbes for Producing Anticholinergics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Smolke group recently developed yeast strains producing the tropane alkaloids scopolamine and hyoscyamine to enable a possible alternative supply of these compounds by metabolic engineering. Such a tour&#8208;de&#8208;force notably required the identification of a missing enzyme of the pathway, invalidation of yeast endogenous genes and relocation of enzymes to restore a synthesis activity.







Abstract
The tropane alkaloids (TAs) hyoscyamine and scopolamine function as acetylcholine receptor antagonists and are used clinically as parasympatholytics to treat neuromuscular disorders in humans. While TAs are synthesized in a small subset of plant families, these specialized metabolites are only accumulated in limited quantities in plant organs. The complex chemical structures of these compounds make their industrial production by chemical synthesis very challenging, Therefore, the supply of these TAs still relies on intensive farming of Duboisia shrubs in tropical countries. Many adverse factors such as climate fluctuations and pandemics can thus influence annual world production. Based on the landmark microbial production of the antimalarial semi&#8208;synthetic artemisinin, the Smolke group recently developed a yeast cell factory capable of de novo synthesizing hyoscyamine and scopolamine, thus paving the way for an alternative production of these compounds.

         <title>Use of copper as a trigger for in vivo activity of E. coli laccase CueO: A simple tool for biosynthetic purposes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Laccases belong to multi&#8208;copper oxidases that catalyze oxidation of various electron&#8208;rich substrates with concomitant reduction of molecular oxygen to water. The multicopper oxidase/laccase CueO of  Escherichia coli  is responsible for the oxidation of Cu1+  to less harmful Cu2+  in the periplasm. CueO possesses a relatively broad substrate spectrum as laccase, and its activity is enhanced by copper excess. The aim of this study was to trigger CueO activity  in vivo  for the use in biocatalysis. Herein, the addition of 5 mM CuSO  4  was proven effective in triggering CueO activity at need with minor toxic effects on  E. coli  cells. Cu&#8208;treated  E. coli  cells were able to convert several phenolic compounds to the corresponding dimers. Finally, the endogenous CueO activity was applied to a four steps cascade, in which coniferyl alcohol was converted to the valuable plant lignan (&#8208;)&#8208;matairesinol.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Phenolic Glycolipids for application in diagnostic tests&#160; for leprosy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) diagnostic tests for rapid detection of individuals infected with  Mycobacterium leprae  (  M. leprae)  , the causative pathogen of leprosy, represent efficient tools to guide therapeutic and prophylactic treatment strategies in leprosy control programs, thus positively contributing to clinical outcome and reduction of transmission of this infectious disease. Levels of antibodies directed against the  M. leprae  &#8208;specific phenolic glycolipid I (PGL&#8208;I) closely correlate with an individual&#8217;s bacterial load and higher risk of developing leprosy. We here describe the assembly of a set of PGL glycans carrying the characteristic phenol aglycon and featuring different methylation patterns. The PGL trisaccharides were applied to construct neoglycoproteins that were used to detect anti&#8208;PGL IgM antibodies in leprosy patients. ELISAs and quantitative lateral flow assays based on up&#8208;converting nanoparticles (UCP&#8208;LFAs) showed that the generated PGL&#8208;I and PGL&#8208;II trisaccharide neoglycoconjugates can be applied for the detection of anti  M. leprae  IgM antibodies in POC tests.</dc:description>

Micelles, rods, and worms: Photo&#8208;PISA was used to develop a new approach to FNA&#8208;polymer nanoparticles that exhibit a high&#8208;density display of FNA strands. The 3D structures of our two FNAs conferred higher nuclease resistance, greater cellular uptake efficiency, and increased bioactivity. We envision that this strategy could be expanded to other FNAs to solve critical issues.







Abstract
Functional nucleic acids (FNAs) are garnering tremendous interest owing to their high modularity and unique bioactivity. Three&#8208;dimensional FNAs have been developed to overcome the issues of nuclease degradation and limited cell uptake. We have developed a new facile approach to the synthesis of multiple three&#8208;dimensional FNA nanostructures by harnessing photo&#8208;polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. Sgc8 aptamer and CpG oligonucleotide were modified as macro chain&#8208;transfer reagents to mediate in&#8197;situ polymerization and self&#8208;assembly. Diverse structures, including micelles, rods, and short worms, afford these two FNAs afford these two FNAs with higher nuclease resistance in serum serum, greater cellular uptake efficiency, and increased bioactivity.

         <title>A Methionine Chemical Shift Based Order Parameter Characterizing Global Protein Dynamics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near or far: The solution 13C&#8208;NMR chemical shifts of methione methyl groups in a protein are linearly correlated with the values calculated from rigid X&#8208;ray models. The protein dependent slope provides an order parameter for the network of dynamic interactions connecting motions of distant residues.







Abstract
Coupling of side chain dynamics over long distances is an important component of allostery. Methionine side chains show the largest intrinsic flexibility among methyl&#8208;containing residues but the actual degree of conformational averaging depends on the proximity and mobility of neighboring residues. The 13C NMR chemical shifts of the methyl groups of methionine residues located at long distances in the same protein show a similar scaling with respect to the values predicted from the static X&#8208;ray structure by quantum methods. This results in a good linear correlation between calculated and observed chemical shifts. The slope is protein dependent and ranges from zero for the highly flexible calmodulin to 0.7 for the much more rigid calcineurin catalytic domain. The linear correlation is indicative of a similar level of side&#8208;chain conformational averaging over long distances, and the slope of the correlation line can be interpreted as an order parameter of the global side&#8208;chain flexibility.

         <title>Structure of the O&#8208;Antigen and the Lipid&#8197;A from the Lipopolysaccharide of Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 51191</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain&#8208;specific features: Characterization of the lipopolysaccharide from F. nucleatum ssp. animalis ATCC 51191 revealed a novel O&#8208;antigen structure for bacterial LPS [&#8594;4)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;GlcpNAcA&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;GlcpNAc3NAlaA&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;FucpNAc4NR&#8208;(1&#8594;], and a bis&#8208;phosphorylated hexa&#8208;acylated lipid&#8197;A moiety. These data showed that F. nucleatum ATCC 51191 has a novel O&#8208;antigen, and pave the way towards understanding the immunological perception of this macromolecule.







Abstract
Fusobacterium nucleatum is a common member of the oral microbiota. However, this symbiont has been found to play an active role in disease development. As a Gram&#8208;negative bacterium, F. nucleatum has a protective outer membrane layer whose external leaflet is mainly composed of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs). LPSs play a crucial role in the interaction between bacteria and the host immune system. Here, we characterised the structure of the O&#8208;antigen and lipid&#8197;A from F. nucleatum ssp. animalis ATCC 51191 by using a combination of GC&#8208;MS, MALDI and NMR techniques. The results revealed a novel repeat of the O&#8208;antigen structure of the LPS, [&#8594;4)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;GlcpNAcA&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;GlcpNAc3NAlaA&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;FucpNAc4NR&#8208;(1&#8594;], (R=acetylated 60&#8201;%), and a bis&#8208;phosphorylated hexa&#8208;acylated lipid&#8197;A moiety. Taken together these data showed that F. nucleatum ATCC 51191 has a distinct LPS which might differentially influence recognition by immune cells.

         <title>Discovery and Engineering of a Novel Baeyer&#8208;Villiger Monooxygenase with High Normal Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;controllable synthesis: Regioselectivity is essential in Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenase&#8208;mediated regiodivergent conversions of asymmetric ketones to generate esters in organic synthesis. A novel normal&#8208;preferring BVMO from Gordonia sihwensis with superior regioselectivity (97&#8201;:&#8201;3) was identified, engineered, and employed to efficiently synthesize 9&#8208;(nonanoyloxy)nonanoic acid from 10&#8208;ketostearic acid derived from renewable plant oils.







Abstract
Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) are remarkable biocatalysts for the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of ketones to generate esters or lactones. The regioselectivity of BVMOs is essential for determining the ratio of the two regioisomeric products (&#8220;normal&#8221; and &#8220;abnormal&#8221;) when catalyzing asymmetric ketone substrates. Starting from a known normal&#8208;preferring BVMO sequence from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (PpBVMO), a novel BVMO from Gordonia sihwensis (GsBVMO) with higher normal regioselectivity (up to 97/3) was identified. Furthermore, protein engineering increased the specificity constant (kcat/KM) 8.9&#8208;fold to 484&#8197;s&#8722;1&#8201;mM&#8722;1 for 10&#8208;ketostearic acid derived from oleic acid. Consequently, by using the variant GsBVMOC308L as an efficient biocatalyst, 10&#8208;ketostearic acid was efficiently transformed into 9&#8208;(nonanoyloxy)nonanoic acid, with a space&#8208;time yield of 60.5&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;d&#8722;1. This study showed that the mutant with higher regioselectivity and catalytic efficiency could be applied to prepare medium&#8208;chain &#969;&#8208;hydroxy fatty acids through biotransformation of long&#8208;chain aliphatic keto acids derived from renewable plant oils.

         <title>On the Use of Side&#8208;Chain NMR Relaxation Data to Derive Structural and Dynamical Information on Proteins: A Case Study Using Hen Lysozyme</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different techniques, same answer: The application of S2 order&#8208;parameter restraining molecular dynamics simulations to the protein HEWL shows that this technique is able to produce a conformational ensemble compatible with experimentally derived side&#8208;chain order parameters and demonstrate that side chains on the protein surface are highly dynamic.







Abstract
Values of 
 and 
 order parameters derived from NMR relaxation measurements on proteins cannot be used straightforwardly to determine protein structure because they cannot be related to a single protein structure, but are defined in terms of an average over a conformational ensemble. Molecular dynamics simulation can generate a conformational ensemble and thus can be used to restrain 
 and 
 order parameters towards experimentally derived target values 
(exp) and 
(exp). Application of 
 and 
 order&#8208;parameter restraining MD simulation to bond vectors in 63 side chains of the protein hen egg white lysozyme using 51 
(exp) target values and 28 
(exp) target values shows that a conformational ensemble compatible with the experimentally derived data can be obtained by using this technique. It is observed that 
 order&#8208;parameter restraining of C&#8722;H bonds in methyl groups is less reliable than 
 order&#8208;parameter restraining because of the possibly less valid assumptions and approximations used to derive experimental 
(exp) values from NMR relaxation measurements and the necessity to adopt the assumption of uniform rotational motion of methyl C&#8722;H bonds around their symmetry axis and of the independence of these motions from each other. The restrained simulations demonstrate that side chains on the protein surface are highly dynamic.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Different techniques, same answer&lt;/b&gt;: The application of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; order&#8208;parameter restraining molecular dynamics simulations to the protein HEWL shows that this technique is able to produce a conformational ensemble compatible with experimentally derived side&#8208;chain order parameters and demonstrate that side chains on the protein surface are highly dynamic.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values of 
 and 
 order parameters derived from NMR relaxation measurements on proteins cannot be used straightforwardly to determine protein structure because they cannot be related to a single protein structure, but are defined in terms of an average over a conformational ensemble. Molecular dynamics simulation can generate a conformational ensemble and thus can be used to restrain 
 and 
 order parameters towards experimentally derived target values 
(exp) and 
(exp). Application of 
 and 
 order&#8208;parameter restraining MD simulation to bond vectors in 63 side chains of the protein hen egg white lysozyme using 51 
(exp) target values and 28 
(exp) target values shows that a conformational ensemble compatible with the experimentally derived data can be obtained by using this technique. It is observed that 
 order&#8208;parameter restraining of C&#8722;H bonds in methyl groups is less reliable than 
 order&#8208;parameter restraining because of the possibly less valid assumptions and approximations used to derive experimental 
(exp) values from NMR relaxation measurements and the necessity to adopt the assumption of uniform rotational motion of methyl C&#8722;H bonds around their symmetry axis and of the independence of these motions from each other. The restrained simulations demonstrate that side chains on the protein surface are highly dynamic. Any hydrogen bonds they form and that appear in any of four different crystal structures, are fluctuating with short lifetimes in solution.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Activity&#8208;based profiling of bile salt hydrolysis in the human gut microbiome with beta&#8208;lactam or acrylamide&#8208;based probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial bile salt hydrolases (BSHs) found in the intestine catalyze the deconjugation of taurine&#8208; and glycine&#8208;linked bile salts produced in the liver. The resulting bile salts are biological detergents and are critical in aiding lipophilic nutrient digestion. Thereby, the activity of BSHs in the gut microbiome is directly linked to human metabolism and overall health. Bile salt metabolism has also been associated with disease phenotypes such as liver and colorectal cancer. In order to reshape the gut microbiome to optimize bile salt metabolism, tools to characterize and quantify these processes must exist to enable a much&#8208;improved understanding of how metabolism goes awry in the face of disease, and how it can be improved through an altered lifestyle and environment. Furthermore, it is necessary to attribute metabolic activity to specific members and BSHs within the microbiome. To this end, we have developed activity&#8208;based probes with two different reactive groups to target bile salt hydrolases. These probes bind similarly to the authentic bile salt substrates, and we demonstrate enzyme labeling of active bile salt hydrolases using purified protein, cell lysates, and in human stool.</dc:description>

         <title>Similar but Still Different: Which Amino Acid Residues Are Responsible for Varying Activities in Type&#8208;III Copper Enzymes?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cause and effect: The mode of action of PPOs is still elusive. Here, we summarize the current understanding of the amino acids located around the dicopper active center and the mutations that were applied to these residues that control the substrate selectivity and activity of PPOs, and thereby decide whether a PPO reacts as a tyrosinase or a catechol oxidase.







Abstract
Type&#8208;III copper enzymes like polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) are ubiquitous among organisms and play a significant role in the formation of pigments. PPOs comprise different enzyme groups, including tyrosinases (TYRs) and catechol oxidases (COs). TYRs catalyze the o&#8208;hydroxylation of monophenols and the oxidation of o&#8208;diphenols to the corresponding o&#8208;quinones (EC&#8197;1.14.18.1). In contrast, COs only catalyze the oxidation of o&#8208;diphenols to the corresponding o&#8208;quinones (EC&#8197;1.10.3.1). To date (August 2020), 102 PDB entries encompassing 18 different proteins from 16 organisms and several mutants have been reported, identifying key residues for tyrosinase activity. The structural similarity between TYRs and COs, especially within and around the active center, complicates the elucidation of their modes of action on a structural basis. However, mutagenesis studies illuminate residues that influence the two activities and show that crystallography on its own cannot elucidate the enzymatic activity mode. Several amino acid residues around the dicopper active center have been proposed to play an essential role in the two different activities. Herein, we critically review the role of all residues identified so far that putatively affect the two activities of PPOs.

         <title>Efficient Editing of Silver Nanoclusters by Changing Simply One Cytosine in a DNA Template</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Let me introduce you: By introducing and moving one cytosine in spacer of emitter domain, a simple strategy was constructed to regulate the emissive colors of AgNCs, thereby extending the library of DNA templatse for synthesizing diverse DNA/AgNCs.







Abstract
DNA with genetic information was edited to regulate and repair the structure and function of a protein. In DNA nanotechnology, DNA with programmable information can be designed to edit the fluorescence intensity and emissive colors of DNA&#8208;stabilized silver nanoclusters (DNA/AgNCs). By introducing and moving one cytosine in the spacer of the emitter domain, we have built up a simple strategy to regulate the excitation and emission wavelengths of AgNCs. When replacing thymine in the spacer of the emitter with one cytosine, the expected excitation and emission change do not occur. However, after moving the introduced cytosine, DNA templates produce AgNCs with extremely different excitation and emission wavelengths from those of the initial template, leading to a template for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissive species with the highest fluorescence intensity. The formation of AgNCs induces the DNA template into condensed secondary structure based on an altered migration rate in PAGE. The simple strategy of moving one cytosine in a spacer in the emitter domain can enrich the library of templates for synthesizing diverse DNA/AgNCs and has great potential in bioimaging and probe design.

         <title>The Charged Linker Modulates the Conformations and Molecular Interactions of Hsp90</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Open wide: The charged linker connecting the N&#8208;terminal and middle domains of Hsp90 contains two segments with transient secondary structure that interact dynamically with strand &#946;8 of the NTD. As a consequence, this element partially detaches and exposes a hydrophobic site that mediates binding to the p53 client. Our results disclose additional roles of the NTD&#8722;MD linker.







Abstract
The molecular chaperone Hsp90 supports the functional activity of specific substrate proteins (clients). For client processing, the Hsp90 dimer undergoes a series of ATP&#8208;driven conformational rearrangements. Flexible linkers connecting the three domains of Hsp90 are crucial to enable dynamic arrangements. The long charged linker connecting the N&#8208;terminal (NTD) and middle (MD) domains exhibits additional functions in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. The structural basis for these functions remains unclear. Here, we characterize the conformation and dynamics of the linker and NTD&#8722;MD domain interactions by NMR spectroscopy. Our results reveal two regions in the linker that are dynamic and exhibit secondary structure conformation. We show that these regions mediate transient interactions with strand &#946;8 of the NTD. As a consequence, this strand detaches and exposes a hydrophobic surface patch, which enables binding to the p53 client. We propose that the charged linker plays an important regulatory role by coupling the Hsp90 NTD&#8722;MD arrangement with the accessibility of a client binding site on the NTD.

         <title>Optical Biosensors for Virus Detection: Prospects for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2/COVID&#8208;19</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast facts at the frontline: Optical biosensors have led to significant advancements in virus detection and imaging capabilities. Coupled with advanced instrumentation, they have enabled higher sensitivities while increasing the rate at which samples can be tested. These techniques can be developed into point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) diagnostics for viral detection and are promising alternatives to detect COVID&#8208;19.







Abstract
The recent pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) has caused huge worldwide disruption due to the lack of available testing locations and equipment. The use of optical techniques for viral detection has flourished in the past 15&#8197;years, providing more reliable, inexpensive, and accurate detection methods. In the current minireview, optical phenomena including fluorescence, surface plasmons, surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), and colorimetry are discussed in the context of detecting virus pathogens. The sensitivity of a viral detection method can be dramatically improved by using materials that exhibit surface plasmons or SERS, but often this requires advanced instrumentation for detection. Although fluorescence and colorimetry lack high sensitivity, they show promise as point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics because of their relatively less complicated instrumentation, ease of use, lower costs, and the fact that they do not require nucleic acid amplification. The advantages and disadvantages of each optical detection method are presented, and prospects for applying optical biosensors in COVID&#8208;19 detection are discussed.

         <title>Engineered sortases in peptide and protein chemistry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transpeptidase sortase A of  Staphylococcus aureus  (Sa&#8208;SrtA) is a valuable tool in protein chemistry. The native enzyme anchors surface proteins containing a highly conserved LPxTG sorting motif to a terminal glycine residue of the peptidoglycan layer in gram&#8208;positive bacteria. This reaction is exploited for sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML), allowing the site&#8208;specific linkage of synthetic peptides and recombinant proteins by a native peptide bond. However, the moderate catalytic efficiency and specificity of Sa&#8208;SrtA fueled the development of new biocatalysts for SML, including the screening of sortase A variants form microorganisms other than  S. aureus  and the directed protein evolution of the Sa&#8208;SrtA enzyme itself. Novel display platforms and screening formats were developed to isolate sortases with altered properties from mutant libraries. This has yielded sortases with strongly enhanced catalytic activity and enzymes recognizing new sorting motifs as substrates. This mini review focuses on recent advances in the field of directed sortase evolution and applications of these tailor&#8208;made enzymes in biochemistry</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Hot&#8208;Spot Analysis of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Receptor Binding Domain/ACE2 Complex**

Too hot to handle: Many coronavirus therapeutics in development target the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, including a protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI) between the spike protein receptor&#8208;binding domain and ACE2, a protein on the surface of many human cells. We used computational approaches to predict hot&#8208;spot residues between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RBD and ACE2 to illuminate the molecular underpinnings of this critical PPI.







Abstract
Infection and replication of SARS CoV&#8208;2 (the virus that causes COVID&#8208;19) requires entry to the interior of host cells. In humans, a protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI) between the SARS CoV&#8208;2 receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) and the extracellular peptidase domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells in the lower respiratory tract is an initial step in the entry pathway. Inhibition of the SARS CoV&#8208;2 RBD/ACE2 PPI is currently being evaluated as a target for therapeutic and/or prophylactic intervention. However, relatively little is known about the molecular underpinnings of this complex. Employing multiple computational platforms, we predicted &#8220;hot&#8208;spot&#8221; residues in a positive&#8208;control PPI (PMI/MDM2) and the CoV&#8208;2 RBD/ACE2 complex. Computational alanine scanning mutagenesis was performed to predict changes in Gibbs&#8217; free energy that are associated with mutating residues at the positive control (PMI/MDM2) or SARS RBD/ACE2 binding interface to alanine. Additionally, we used the Adaptive Poisson&#8208;Boltzmann Solver to calculate macromolecular electrostatic surfaces at the interface of the positive&#8208;control PPI and SARS CoV&#8208;2/ACE2 PPI. Finally, a comparative analysis of hot&#8208;spot residues for SARS&#8208;CoV and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, in complex with ACE2, is provided. Collectively, this study illuminates predicted hot&#8208;spot residues, and clusters, at the SARS CoV&#8208;2 RBD/ACE2 binding interface, potentially guiding the development of reagents capable of disrupting this complex and halting COVID&#8208;19.

CDA&#8208;Luc: The M. tuberculosis cyclic dinucleotide phosphodiesterase, CnpB, is leveraged to establish a coupled enzyme assay that facilitates high&#8208;throughput quantification of the bacterial signaling molecule 3&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP. This assay can be carried out in 96&#8208;well plate format and read out by a standard luminescence plate reader, thereby replacing conventional LC&#8208;MS&#8208;based quantification assays.







Abstract
Cyclic dinucleotide signaling systems, which are found ubiquitously throughout nature, allow organisms to rapidly and dynamically sense and respond to alterations in their environments. In recent years, the second messenger, cyclic di&#8208;(3&#8217;,5&#8217;)&#8208;adenosine monophosphate (c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP), has been identified as an essential signaling molecule in a diverse array of bacterial genera. We and others have shown that defects in c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP homeostasis result in severe physiological defects and virulence attenuation in many bacterial species. Despite significant advancements in the field, there is still a major gap in the understanding of the environmental and cellular factors that influence c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP dynamics due to a lack of tools to sensitively and rapidly monitor changes in c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP levels. To address this limitation, we describe here the development of a luciferase&#8208;based coupled enzyme assay that leverages the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, CnpB, for the sensitive and high&#8208;throughput quantification of 3&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP. We also demonstrate the utility of this approach for the quantification of the cyclic oligonucleotide&#8208;based anti&#8208;phage signaling system (CBASS) effector, 3&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cGAMP. These findings establish CDA&#8208;Luc as a more affordable and sensitive alternative to conventional c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP detection tools with broad utility for the study of bacterial cyclic dinucleotide physiology.

         <title>A MIF&#8208;Derived Cyclopeptide that Inhibits MIF Binding and Atherogenic Signaling via the Chemokine Receptor CXCR2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The specific targeting of the interaction between the atypical chemokine MIF and its receptor CXCR2, and its atherosclerosis&#8208;promoting activity in a tailored peptide&#8208;based approach is illustrated. Based on a structure&#8211;activity analysis of short N&#8208;like loop&#8208;derived MIF peptides, the cyclic MIF peptide analogue MIF(cyclo10) was identified as a promising candidate that blocks MIF/CXCR2 and counteracts MIF's inflammatory and pro&#8208;atherogenic activity.







Abstract
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an inflammatory cytokine and atypical chemokine with a key role in inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis. Key atherogenic functions of MIF are mediated by noncognate interaction with the chemokine receptor CXCR2. The MIF N&#8208;like loop comprising the sequence 47&#8211;56 is an important structural determinant of the MIF/CXCR2 interface and MIF(47&#8211;56) blocks atherogenic MIF activities. However, the mechanism and critical structure&#8211;activity information within this sequence have remained elusive. Here, we show that MIF(47&#8211;56) directly binds to CXCR2 to compete with MIF receptor activation. By using alanine scanning, essential and dispensable residues were identified. Moreover, MIF(cyclo10), a designed cyclized variant of MIF(47&#8211;56), inhibited key inflammatory and atherogenic MIF activities in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo/ex vivo, and exhibited strongly improved resistance to proteolytic degradation in human plasma in&#8197;vitro, thus suggesting that it could serve as a promising basis for MIF&#8208;derived anti&#8208;atherosclerotic peptides.

         <title>CYP154C5 Regioselectivity in Steroid Hydroxylation Explored by Substrate Modifications and Protein Engineering**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Changes in selectivity: Using substrate and protein engineering based on key residues and functional groups, the regioselectivity of the bacterial cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP154C5 in the hydroxylation of different steroids was altered. Apart from 16&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation, steroid products containing hydroxy groups in 15&#945; and 21 position were formed.







Abstract
CYP154C5 from Nocardia farcinica is a P450 monooxygenase able to hydroxylate a range of steroids with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity at the 16&#945;&#8208;position. Using protein engineering and substrate modifications based on the crystal structure of CYP154C5, an altered regioselectivity of the enzyme in steroid hydroxylation had been achieved. Thus, conversion of progesterone by mutant CYP154C5 F92A resulted in formation of the corresponding 21&#8208;hydroxylated product 11&#8208;deoxycorticosterone in addition to 16&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation. Using MD simulation, this altered regioselectivity appeared to result from an alternative binding mode of the steroid in the active site of mutant F92A. MD simulation further suggested that the entrance of water to the active site caused higher uncoupling in this mutant. Moreover, exclusive 15&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation was observed for wild&#8208;type CYP154C5 in the conversion of 5&#945;&#8208;androstan&#8208;3&#8208;one, lacking an oxy&#8208;functional group at C17. Overall, our data give valuable insight into the structure&#8211;function relationship of this cytochrome P450 monooxygenase for steroid hydroxylation.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Changes in selectivity&lt;/b&gt;: Using substrate and protein engineering based on key residues and functional groups, the regioselectivity of the bacterial cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP154C5 in the hydroxylation of different steroids was altered. Apart from 16&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation, steroid products containing hydroxy groups in 15&#945; and 21 position were formed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CYP154C5 from &lt;i&gt;Nocardia farcinica&lt;/i&gt; is a P450 monooxygenase able to hydroxylate a range of steroids with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity at the 16&#945;&#8208;position. Using protein engineering and substrate modifications based on the crystal structure of CYP154C5, an altered regioselectivity of the enzyme in steroid hydroxylation had been achieved. Thus, conversion of progesterone by mutant CYP154C5 F92A resulted in formation of the corresponding 21&#8208;hydroxylated product 11&#8208;deoxycorticosterone in addition to 16&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation. Using MD simulation, this altered regioselectivity appeared to result from an alternative binding mode of the steroid in the active site of mutant F92A. MD simulation further suggested that the entrance of water to the active site caused higher uncoupling in this mutant. Moreover, exclusive 15&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation was observed for wild&#8208;type CYP154C5 in the conversion of 5&#945;&#8208;androstan&#8208;3&#8208;one, lacking an oxy&#8208;functional group at C17. Overall, our data give valuable insight into the structure&#8211;function relationship of this cytochrome P450 monooxygenase for steroid hydroxylation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Characterization of New DNA Aptamers for Anti&#8208;HIV&#8208;1 Reverse Transcriptase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA aptamers are the new approach for anti&#8208;HIV&#8208;1 RT. These aptamers were isolated by the use of a DNA library complexed to WT HIV&#8208;1 RT. The selected DNA aptamers showed an inhibitory effect on the polymerase reaction of HIV&#8208;1 RTs (WT and KY mutant). NMR spectroscopy showed that the aptamer induced a conformational change in HIV&#8208;1 RT&#8242;s structure.







Abstract
HIV&#8208;1 RT is a necessary enzyme for retroviral replication, which is the main target for antiviral therapy against AIDS. Effective anti&#8208;HIV&#8208;1 RT drugs are divided into two groups; nucleoside inhibitors (NRTI) and non&#8208;nucleoside inhibitors (NNRTI), which inhibit DNA polymerase. In this study, new DNA aptamers were isolated as anti&#8208;HIV&#8208;1 RT inhibitors. The selected DNA aptamer (WT62) presented with high affinity and inhibition against wild&#8208;type (WT) HIV&#8208;1 RT and gave a KD value of 75.10&#177;0.29&#8197;nM and an IC50 value of 84.81&#177;8.54&#8197;nM. Moreover, WT62 decreased the DNA polymerase function of K103&#8197;N/Y181&#8197;C double mutant (KY) HIV&#8208;1 RT by around 80&#8201;%. Furthermore, the ITC results showed that this aptamer has small binding enthalpies with both WT and KY HIV&#8208;1 RTs through which the complex might form a hydrophobic interaction or noncovalent bonding. The NMR result also suggested that the WT62 aptamer could bind with both WT and KY mutant HIV&#8208;1 RTs at the connection domain.

         <title>Millisecond Allosteric Dynamics of Activated Ras Reproduced with a Slowly Hydrolyzable GTP Analogue</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slowly does it: The correlated internal motions of GTP&#947;S&#8208;bound Ras have been quantified using relaxation dispersion NMR spectroscopy with site&#8208;specific details, demonstrating its accurate preservation of the physiological dynamics network critical for the binding of allosteric ligands.







Abstract
The millisecond timescale dynamics of activated Ras transiently sample a low&#8208;populated conformational state that has distinct surface property from the major state and represents a promising target for binding of small&#8208;molecule compounds. To avoid the complications of hydrolysis, dynamics and other properties of active Ras have so far been routinely investigated by using non&#8208;hydrolyzable GTP analogues, which, however, were previously reported to alter both the kinetics and distribution of the conformational exchange. In this study, we quantitatively measured and validated the internal dynamics of Ras complexed with a slowly hydrolyzable GTP analogue, GTP&#947;S, which increases the lifetime of active Ras by 23 times relative to that of native GTP. It was found that GTP&#947;S, in addition to its better mimicking of the exchange kinetics than the commonly used non&#8208;hydrolyzable analogues GppNHp and GppCH2p, can rigorously reproduce the natural dynamics network in active Ras, thus indicating its fitness for use in the development of allosteric inhibitors.

         <title>Biological Relevance of RGD&#8208;Integrin Subtype&#8208;Specific Ligands in Cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Specific ligands for the right integrin in the right tumor: RGD&#8208;integrins &#945;v&#946;3 and &#945;5&#946;1 are the most studied in cancer. Despite similarities in extracellular matrix recognition, integrin expression and function can differ from one tumor to another. Ligands highly selective for each subtype represent a breakthrough to understand their particularities and to specifically address their respective functions in tumors.







Abstract
Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane proteins able to connect cells with the micro&#8208;environment. They represent a family of receptors involved in almost all the hallmarks of cancer. Integrins recognizing the Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp (RGD) peptide in their natural extracellular matrix ligands have been particularly investigated as tumoral therapeutic targets. In the last 30&#8197;years, intense research has been dedicated to designing specific RGD&#8208;like ligands able to discriminate selectively the different RGD&#8208;recognizing integrins. Chemists&#8242; efforts have led to the proposition of modified peptide or peptidomimetic libraries to be used for tumor targeting and/or tumor imaging. Here we review, from the biological point of view, the rationale underlying the need to clearly delineate each RGD&#8208;integrin subtype by selective tools. We describe the complex roles of RGD&#8208;integrins (mainly the most studied &#945;v&#946;3 and &#945;5&#946;1 integrins) in tumors, the steps towards selective ligands and the current usefulness of such ligands. Although the impact of integrins in cancer is well acknowledged, the biological characteristics of each integrin subtype in a specific tumor are far from being completely resolved. Selective ligands might help us to reconsider integrins as therapeutic targets in specific clinical settings.

         <title>Antimicrobial and Anticancer Properties of Synthetic Peptides Derived from the Wasp Parachartergus fraternus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Agelaia&#8208;MPI and protonectin are antimicrobial peptides isolated from the wasp  Parachartergus fraternus  that show antimicrobial and neuroactive activities. Previously, two analogues of these peptides, neuroVAL and protonectin&#8208;F were designed to reduce nonspecific toxicity and improve potency. Here, the three&#8208;dimensional structures of neuroVAL, protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were determined using circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic and hemolytic activities were tested for the parent peptides and analogues. All peptides showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, with agelaia&#8208;MPI being the most active. Protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were found to be toxic to cancerous and non&#8208;cancerous cell lines. Internalization experiments revealed that these peptides accumulate inside both cell types. By contrast, neuroVAL was nontoxic to all tested cells and was able to enter cells without accumulating. In summary, neuroVAL has potential as a non&#8208;toxic cell penetrating peptide, while protonectin&#8208;F needs further modification to realize its potential as an antitumor peptide.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Dioxane and Morpholino Nucleotide Analogues: Syntheses and RNA&#8208;Hybridization Properties</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards synthetic oligonucleotides: Starting from the 4&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;modified ribose derivative (1), synthetic routes to two novel nucleoside analogues with dioxane and morpholine central scaffolds were developed and realized in two diastereomeric series. The final phosphoramidites were incorporated into an artificial RNA double strand, and the thermal stabilities were determined by melting temperature analysis.







Abstract
A novel class of nucleotide analogues with a dioxane ring as central scaffold has been developed. Synthetic routes in two diastereomeric series were realized, and the final thymidine analogues were synthesized with common functionalities for the automated oligonucleotide synthesis. The chemical space of the initially derived nucleotides was expanded by changing the central dioxane to analogous morpholine derivatives. This opens up the possibility for further derivatization by attaching different substituents at the morpholine nitrogen. The novel nucleotide building blocks were incorporated into double&#8208;stranded RNA sequences, and their hybridization properties investigated by melting&#8208;temperature analysis. Both scaffolds, dioxanes and morpholines, had an equal impact on double&#8208;strand stability, but Tm values differed depending on the chirality in the six&#8208;membered ring.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Towards synthetic oligonucleotides&lt;/b&gt;: Starting from the 4&#8217;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;modified ribose derivative (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), synthetic routes to two novel nucleoside analogues with dioxane and morpholine central scaffolds were developed and realized in two diastereomeric series. The final phosphoramidites were incorporated into an artificial RNA double strand, and the thermal stabilities were determined by melting temperature analysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel class of nucleotide analogues with a dioxane ring as central scaffold has been developed. Synthetic routes in two diastereomeric series were realized, and the final thymidine analogues were synthesized with common functionalities for the automated oligonucleotide synthesis. The chemical space of the initially derived nucleotides was expanded by changing the central dioxane to analogous morpholine derivatives. This opens up the possibility for further derivatization by attaching different substituents at the morpholine nitrogen. The novel nucleotide building blocks were incorporated into double&#8208;stranded RNA sequences, and their hybridization properties investigated by melting&#8208;temperature analysis. Both scaffolds, dioxanes and morpholines, had an equal impact on double&#8208;strand stability, but &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; values differed depending on the chirality in the six&#8208;membered ring.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Regulation of Lipid Bilayer Ion Permeability by Antibacterial Polymethyloxazoline&#8208;Polyethyleneimine Copolymers</title>

Coming through: The black lipid membrane technique was used to investigate the membrane&#8208;permeabilization abilities of a series of amphiphilic antimicrobial polymers. The most potent antibacterial polymer induces step&#8208;like current behavior typical for an ion&#8208;channel.







Abstract
Amphiphilic antimicrobial polymers display activity against the outer bacterial cell membrane, triggering various physiological effects. We investigated the regulation of ion transport across the lipid bilayer to understand differences in biological activity for a series of amphiphilic polymethyloxazoline &#8211; polyethyleneimine copolymers. The results confirmed that the tested structures were able to increase the permeability of the lipid bilayer (LB) membrane or its rupture. Black lipid membrane (BLM) experiments show that the triggered conductance profile and its character is strongly correlated with the polymer structure and zeta potential. The polymer exhibiting the highest antimicrobial activity promotes ion transport by using a unique mechanism and step&#8208;like characteristics with well&#8208;defined discreet openings and closings. The molecule was incorporated into the membrane in a reproducible way, and the observed channel&#8208;like activity could be responsible for the antibacterial activity of this molecule.

         <title>Microenvironment&#8208;Sensitive Fluorescent Ligand Binds Ascaris Telomere Antiparallel G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA with Blue&#8208;Shift and Enhanced Emission</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective G4 DNA ligands: We report a novel microenvironment&#8208;sensitive fluorescent ligand (Q1) that shows selectivity to ascaris telomere antiparallel G4 DNA ASC20 through enhanced fluorescence intensity along with about 18&#8197;nm blue&#8208;shifted properties. The detailed interactions of Q1 with ASC20 G4 DNA are illustrated, and the results demonstrate that Q1 mainly binds at the terminals of ASC20 through an end&#8208;stacking mode.







Abstract
The development of small molecules that can selectively target G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNAs has drawn considerable attention due to their unique physiological and pathological functions. However, only a few molecules have been found to selectively bind a particular G4 DNA structure. We have developed a fluorescence ligand Q1, a molecular scaffold with a carbazole&#8211;pyridine core bridged by a phenylboronic acid side chain, that acts as a selective ascaris telomere antiparallel G4 DNA ASC20 ligand with about 18&#8197;nm blue&#8208;shifted and enhanced fluorescence intensity. Photophysical properties revealed that Q1 was sensitive to the microenvironment and gave the best selectivity to ASC20 with an equilibrium binding constant Ka=6.04&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence studies also demonstrated that Q1 showed a longer fluorescence lifetime in the presence of ASC20. The binding characteristics of Q1 with ASC20 were shown in detail in a fluorescent intercalator displacement (FID) assay, a 2&#8208;Ap titration experiment and by molecular docking. Ligand Q1 could adopt an appropriate pose at terminal G&#8208;quartets of ASC20 through multiple interactions including &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between aromatic rings; this led to strong fluorescence enhancement. In addition, a co&#8208;staining image showed that Q1 is mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. Accordingly, this work provides insights for the development of ligands that selectively targeting a specific G4 DNA structure.

         <title>Quinone Methide&#8208;Based Organophosphate Hydrolases Inhibitors: Trans Proximity Labelers versus Cis Labeling Activity&#8208;Based Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Internal affairs: Phosphoester substrates that release electrophilic quinone&#8208;methides were applied as activity&#8208;based probes in three phosphotriesterases that differ in mechanism and level of activity. Their substrates&#8242; reactivity, and mode of labeling, were systematically investigated with the aim of achieving specific cis labeling rather than trans.







Abstract
Quinone methide (QM) chemistry is widely applied including in enzyme inhibitors. Typically, enzyme&#8208;mediated bond breaking releases a phenol product that rearranges into an electrophilic QM that in turn covalently modifies protein side chains. However, the factors that govern the reactivity of QM&#8208;based inhibitors and their mode of inhibition have not been systematically explored. Foremost, enzyme inactivation might occur in cis, whereby a QM molecule inactivates the very same enzyme molecule that released it, or by trans if the released QMs diffuse away and inactivate other enzyme molecules. We examined QM&#8208;based inhibitors for enzymes exhibiting phosphoester hydrolase activity. We tested different phenolic substituents and benzylic leaving groups, thereby modulating the rates of enzymatic hydrolysis, phenolate&#8208;to&#8208;QM rearrangement, and the electrophilicity of the resulting QM. By developing assays that distinguish between cis and trans inhibition, we have identified certain combinations of leaving groups and phenyl substituents that lead to inhibition in the cis mode, while other combinations gave trans inhibition. Our results suggest that cis&#8208;acting QM&#8208;based substrates could be used as activity&#8208;based probes to identify various phospho&#8208; and phosphono&#8208;ester hydrolases, and potentially other hydrolases.

         <title>Stepwise Strategy for One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Single&#8208;Stranded DNA Rings from Multiple Short Fragments</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One at a time, please: Large, circular, single&#8208;stranded DNAs (up to 452&#8208;nt sizes) have been efficiently prepared from multiple linear, single&#8208;stranded short DNA fragments by using T4 DNA ligase through sequential addition of different sets of splints in a one&#8208;pot reaction. The lengths of splints and the order of splint addition were optimized to obtain a satisfying yield of c&#8208;ssDNA products. This method is convenient and practical, and benefits the development of DNA nanotechnology and bioscience.







Abstract
Cyclic rings of single&#8208;stranded (ss) DNA have various unique properties, but wider applications have been hampered by their poor availability. This paper reports a convenient one&#8208;pot method in which these rings are efficiently synthesized by using T4 DNA ligase through convergent cyclization of easily available short DNA fragments. The key to the present method is to separate all the splint oligonucleotides into several sets, and add each set sequentially at an appropriate interval to the solutions containing all the short DNA fragments. Compared with simple one&#8208;pot strategies involving simultaneous addition of all the splints at the beginning of the reaction, both the selectivity and the yields of target ssDNA rings are greatly improved. This convergent method is especially useful for preparing large&#8208;sized rings that are otherwise hard to obtain. By starting from six short DNA fragments (71&#8211;82&#8197;nt), prepared by a DNA synthesizer, a ssDNA ring of 452&#8208;nt size was synthesized in 35&#8197;mol&#8201;% yield and in high selectivity. Satisfactorily pure DNA rings were obtainable simply by treating the crude products with exonuclease.

Distinguished kinases: We describe the design, engineering and characterisation of a fluorescent peptide biosensor derived from 6&#8208;phosphofructokinase, that reports on CDK6 kinase activity in&#8197;vitro and in lung cancer cell extracts. Implementation of this biosensor in mesothelioma cell lines derived from patients highlights differences between CDK6 kinase activity and closely related CDK4 kinase activity.







Abstract
CDK6 kinase regulates cell&#8208;cycle progression in G1, together with CDK4, but has cell&#8208;, tissue&#8208; and developmentally distinct functions associated with transcription, angiogenesis and metabolism. Although CDK6 makes an attractive cancer biomarker and target, there are no means of assessing its activity in a complex environment. In this study, we describe the design, engineering and characterisation of a fluorescent peptide biosensor derived from 6&#8208;phosphofructokinase that reports on CDK6 kinase activity through sensitive changes in fluorescence intensity. This biosensor can report on CDK6 activity in a dose&#8208;dependent fashion, thereby enabling quantification of differences in kinase activity in complex and physiologically relevant environments. Further implementation of this biosensor in different lung and melanoma cell lines, as well as in mesothelioma cell lines derived from patients together with a CDK4 biosensor highlighted differences in kinase activity between CDK6 and CDK4 kinase. This work demonstrates the utility of these selective tools for monitoring two closely related kinases comparatively and simultaneously in the same samples, thereby offering attractive perspectives for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

         <title>An Animal Able To Tolerate D2O</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anhydrobiosis allows two&#8208;step organismal H2O to D2O replacement in the nematode P. superbus, as well as its survival. It is thus the first animal species shown to reproduce in 99.9&#8201;% D2O. In silico structural analyses reveal that its water channel protein is an aquaglyceroporin, whose larger pore might help explain successful organismal influx of D2O.







Abstract
It is possible to gain a deeper insight into the role of water in biology by using physicochemical variant molecules, such as deuterium oxide (D2O); however, D2O is toxic to multicellular organisms in high concentrations. By using a unique desiccation&#8208;rehydration process, we demonstrate that the anhydrobiotic nematode Panagrolaimus superbus is able to tolerate and proliferate in 99&#8201;% D2O. Moreover, we analysed P. superbus&#8217; water&#8208;channel protein (aquaporin; AQP), which is associated with dehydration/rehydration, by comparing its primary structure and modelling its tertiary structure in silico. Our data evidence that P. superbus&#8217; AQP is an aquaglyceroporin, a class of water channel known to display a wider pore; this helps to explain the rapid and successful organismal influx of D2O into this species. This is the first demonstration of an animal able to withstand high D2O levels, thus paving a way for the investigation of the effects D2O on higher levels of biological organization.

         <title>Genetic Incorporation of Selenotyrosine Significantly Improves Enzymatic Activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzyme catalysts. To facilitate enzyme design, mechanistic studies and minimize structural perturbation in the active site, here we report the genetic incorporation of a novel unnatural amino acid selenotyrosine (SeHF), which has single atom replacement in comparison to tyrosine. The  Agrobacterium radiobacter  phosphotriesterase (  ar  PTE) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12&#8208;fold increase in  k  cat  and 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in  k  cat  /  K  m  at pH 7.0.  Molecular dynamics simulation  shows that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism. Our method represents a new approach for designing enzymes with enhanced activities.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>RNA molecules can fold into complex two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional shapes that are critical for their function. Chemical probes have long been utilized to interrogate RNA structure and are now considered invaluable resources in the goal of relating structure to function. Recently, the power of deep sequencing and careful chemical probe design have merged, permitting researchers to obtain a holistic understanding of how RNA structure can be utilized to control RNA biology transcriptome&#8208;wide. Within this review, we outline the recent advancements in chemical probe design for interrogating RNA structures inside cells and discuss the recent advances in our understanding of RNA biology through the lens of chemical probing.</dc:description>
