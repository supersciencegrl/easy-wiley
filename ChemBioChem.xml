         <title>Titration of Apparent In&#8208;Cellula Affinities of Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using fluorescent probes, we estimate at the cellular level the fraction of Bait molecules bound by Prey molecules in a quantitative yeast&#8208;two hybrid assay. A titration&#8208;like analysis of flow cytometer data permits the extraction of the apparent in&#8208;cellula dissociation constant.







Abstract
A genetic assay permits simultaneous quantification of two interacting proteins and their bound fraction at the single&#8208;cell level using flow cytometry. Apparent in&#8208;cellula affinities of protein&#8208;protein interactions can be extracted from the acquired data through a titration&#8208;like analysis. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated on a diverse set of interactions with proteins from different families and organisms and with in&#8208;vitro dissociation constants ranging from picomolar to micromolar.

         <title>Oxidative stress in cancer therapy: Friend or enemy?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excessive cellular oxidative stress is widely perceived as a key factor in pathophysiological conditions and cancer development. Healthy cells use several mechanisms to maintain intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and overall redox homeostasis to avoid damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids. Cancer cells, in contrast, exhibit elevated ROS levels and upregulated protective antioxidant pathways. Counterintuitively, such elevated oxidative stress and enhanced antioxidant defence mechanisms in cancer cells provide a therapeutic opportunity for the development of drugs with different anticancer mechanisms of action (MoA). In this review, oxidative stress and the role of ROS in cells are described. The tumour&#8208;suppressive and tumour&#8208;promotive functions of ROS are discussed to compare these two different therapeutic strategies (increasing or decreasing ROS to fight cancer). Clinically approved drugs with demonstrated oxidative stress anticancer MoAs are highlighted before describing examples of metal&#8208;based anticancer drug candidates causing oxidative stress in cancer cells  via  novel MoAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular determinants for carbocation cyclisation in bacterial monoterpene synthases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monoterpene synthases are often promiscuous enzymes, yielding product mixtures rather than pure compounds due to the nature of the branched reaction mechanism involving reactive carbocations. Two previously identified bacterial monoterpene synthases, a linalool synthase (bLinS) and a cineole synthase (bCinS), produce nearly pure linalool and cineole from geranyl diphosphate respectively. We used a combined experimental and computational approach to identify critical residues involved in bacterial monoterpenoid synthesis. Phe77 is essential for bCinS activity, guiding the linear carbocation intermediate towards the formation of the cyclic &#945;&#8208;terpinyl intermediate; removal of the aromatic ring results in variants that produce acyclic products only. Computational chemistry confirmed the importance of Phe77 in carbocation stabilisation. Phe74, Phe78 and Phe179 are involved in maintaining the active site shape in bCinS without a specific role for the aromatic ring. Phe295 in bLinS, and the equivalent Ala301 in bCinS, are essential for linalool and cineole formation respectively. Where Phe295 places steric constraints on the carbocation intermediates, Ala301 is essential for bCinS initial cyclisation and activity. Our multidisciplinary approach gives unique insights into how carefully placed amino acid residues in the active site can direct carbocations down specific paths, by placing steric constraints or offering stabilisation via cation&#8208;&#960; interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Serum Compatible Spermine&#8208;based Cationic Lipids with Non&#8208;identical Hydrocarbon Tails Mediate High Transfection Efficiency</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cationic lipids are widely used as non&#8208;viral synthetic vectors for gene delivery as a safer alternative to viral vectors. In this work, a library of L&#8208;shaped spermine&#8208;based cationic lipids with identical and non&#8208;identical hydrophobic chains having variable carbon length (from C10 to C18) was designed and synthesized. These lipids were characterized and the structure&#8208;activity relationships of these compounds were determined for DNA binding and transfection ability when formulated as cationic liposomes. The liposomes were then used successfully for the transfection of HEK293T, HeLa, PC3, H460, HepG2, SH&#8208;SY5Y and Calu&#8217;3 cell lines. The transfection efficiency of lipids with non&#8208;identical hydrocarbon chains was greater than the identical analog. These reagents exhibited superior efficiency to the commercial reagent, Lipofectamine3000, under both serum&#8208;free and 10&#8211;40% serum conditions in HEK293T, HeLa and H460 cell lines. The lipids were also not toxic to the tested cells. The results suggested that L&#8208;shaped spermine&#8208;based cationic lipids with non&#8208;identical hydrocarbon tails could serve as an efficient and safe non&#8208;viral vector gene carrier for further  in vivo  studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Enzymology for Diagnostics: Profiling Alkaline Phosphatase Activity in Clinical Samples</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 1, January 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule enzymology can be used to profile heterogeneous enzyme activity in clinical samples. A diluted sample is mixed with a substrate, and the mixture is loaded to a microwell array. The change in fluorescence over time in wells containing an enzyme is used to quantify the enzyme activity, resulting in a distinct fingerprint for the target enzyme. This fingerprint is used for the quantification of multiple enzyme isotypes in the sample.







Abstract
Enzymes can be used as biomarkers for a variety of diseases. However, profiling enzyme activity in clinical samples is challenging due to the heterogeneity in enzyme activity, and the low abundance of the target enzyme in biofluids. Single&#8208;molecule methods can overcome these challenges by providing information on the distribution of enzyme activities in a sample. Here, we describe the concept of using the single&#8208;molecule enzymology (SME) method to analyze enzymatic activity in clinical samples. We present recent work focused on measuring alkaline phosphatase isotypes in serum samples using SME. Future work will involve improving and simplifying this technology, and applying it to other enzymes for diagnostics.

&lt;p&gt;Enzymes can be used as biomarkers for a variety of diseases. However, profiling enzyme activity in clinical samples is challenging due to the heterogeneity in enzyme activity, and the low abundance of the target enzyme in biofluids. Single-molecule methods can overcome these challenges by providing information on the distribution of enzyme activities in a sample. Here, we describe the concept of using the single-molecule enzymology (SME) method to analyze enzymatic activity in clinical samples. We present recent work focused on measuring alkaline phosphatase isotypes in serum samples using SME. Future work will involve improving and simplifying this technology, and applying it to other enzymes for diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peptides Derived from Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor B Show Potent Binding to Neuropilin&#8208;1</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 1, January 5, 2022. </description>

VEGF&#8208;B binds to the b1 domain of neuropilin&#8208;1. VEGF&#8208;B&#8208;derived peptides show potent binding to neuropilin&#8208;1 (KD=0.13 to 9.55&#8197;&#956;M) and inhibit binding of VEGF&#8208;A in a cell&#8208;based assay (IC50=0.3 to 2.0&#8197;&#956;M). Peptide lipidation increased binding and plasma half&#8208;lives.







Abstract
Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) regulate significant pathways in angiogenesis, myocardial and neuronal protection, metabolism, and cancer progression. The VEGF&#8208;B growth factor is involved in cell survival, anti&#8208;apoptotic and antioxidant mechanisms, through binding to VEGF receptor 1 and neuropilin&#8208;1 (NRP1). We employed surface plasmon resonance technology and X&#8208;ray crystallography to analyse the molecular basis of the interaction between VEGF&#8208;B and the b1 domain of NRP1, and developed VEGF&#8208;B C&#8208;terminus derived peptides to be used as chemical tools for studying VEGF&#8208;B &#8208; NRP1 related pathways. Peptide lipidation was used as a means to stabilise the peptides. VEGF&#8208;B&#8208;derived peptides containing a C&#8208;terminal arginine show potent binding to NRP1&#8208;b1. Peptide lipidation increased binding residence time and improved plasma stability. A crystal structure of a peptide with NRP1 demonstrated that VEGF&#8208;B peptides bind at the canonical C&#8208;terminal arginine binding site. VEGF&#8208;B C&#8208;terminus imparts higher affinity for NRP1 than the corresponding VEGF&#8208;A165 region. This tight binding may impact on the activity and selectivity of the full&#8208;length protein. The VEGF&#8208;B167 derived peptides were more effective than VEGF&#8208;A165 peptides in blocking functional phosphorylation events. Blockers of VEGF&#8208;B function have potential applications in diabetes and non&#8208;alcoholic fatty liver disease.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Removable Photocaging Groups Accepted by MjMAT Variant: Structural Basis and Compatibility with DNA and RNA Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 1, January 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered MAT (methionine adenosyltransferase) exhibits remarkable activity on methionine analogues with red&#8208;shifted ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl (ONB)&#8208;derivatives and is compatible with methyltransferases from thermophilic and mesophilic organisms. This enables photo&#8208;deprotection of modified DNA by visible light. The crystal structure reveals details about substrate accommodation.







Abstract
Methylation and demethylation of DNA, RNA and proteins constitutes a major regulatory mechanism in epigenetic processes. Investigations would benefit from the ability to install photo&#8208;cleavable groups at methyltransferase target sites that block interactions with reader proteins until removed by non&#8208;damaging light in the visible spectrum. Engineered methionine adenosyltransferases (MATs) have been exploited in cascade reactions with methyltransferases (MTases) to modify biomolecules with non&#8208;natural groups, including first evidence for accepting photo&#8208;cleavable groups. We show that an engineered MAT from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (PC&#8208;MjMAT) is 308&#8208;fold more efficient at converting ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;(ONB)&#8208;homocysteine than the wildtype enzyme. PC&#8208;MjMAT is active over a broad range of temperatures and compatible with MTases from mesophilic organisms. We solved the crystal structures of wildtype and PC&#8208;MjMAT in complex with AdoONB and a red&#8208;shifted derivative thereof. These structures reveal that aromatic stacking interactions within the ligands are key to accommodating the photocaging groups in PC&#8208;MjMAT. The enlargement of the binding pocket eliminates steric clashes to enable AdoMet analogue binding. Importantly, PC&#8208;MjMAT exhibits remarkable activity on methionine analogues with red&#8208;shifted ONB&#8208;derivatives enabling photo&#8208;deprotection of modified DNA by visible light.

         <title>Defluorination Capability of l&#8208;2&#8208;Haloacid Dehalogenases in the HAD&#8208;Like Hydrolase Superfamily Correlates with Active Site Compactness</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 1, January 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
You have to come close if you want a reaction: Several members of the haloacid dehalogenase&#8208;like hydrolases superfamily were found to break carbon&#8208;fluorine bonds. The only features that differentiate between them and other family members unable to achieve this feat were small changes in distance between selected active site residues and protein dynamics leading to tighter interactions between protein and halogen.







Abstract
l&#8208;2&#8208;Haloacid dehalogenases, industrially and environmentally important enzymes that catalyse cleavage of the carbon&#8208;halogen bond in S&#8208;2&#8208;halocarboxylic acids, were known to hydrolyse chlorinated, brominated and iodinated substrates but no activity towards fluorinated compounds had been reported. A screen for novel dehalogenase activities revealed four l&#8208;2&#8208;haloacid dehalogenases capable of defluorination. We now report crystal structures for two of these enzymes, Bpro0530 and Rha0230, as well as for the related proteins PA0810 and RSc1362, which hydrolyse chloroacetate but not fluoroacetate, all at &#8764;2.2&#8197;&#197; resolution. Overall structure and active sites of these enzymes are highly similar. In molecular dynamics (MD) calculations, only the defluorinating enzymes sample more compact conformations, which in turn allow more effective interactions with the small fluorine atom. Structural constraints, based on X&#8208;ray structures and MD calculations, correctly predict the defluorination activity of the homologous enzyme ST2570.

         <title>Xanthopsin&#8208;Like Systems via Site&#8208;Specific Click&#8208;Functionalization of a Retinoic Acid Binding Protein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 1, January 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman adducts can be employed in the irreversible site&#8208;specific and diastereoselective click&#8208;functionalization of a lysine residue buried into a lipophilic binding pocket. This research opens the way to the preparation of synthetic proteins structurally reminiscent of xanthopsin eubacterial photoreceptors, potentially useful for both optogenetic and &#8220;lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;molecule&#8221; tools.







Abstract
The use of light&#8208;responsive proteins to control both living or synthetic cells, is at the core of the expanding fields of optogenetics and synthetic biology. It is thus apparent that a richer reaction toolbox for the preparation of such systems is of fundamental importance. Here, we provide a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle demonstration that Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman adducts can be employed to perform a facile site&#8208;specific, irreversible and diastereoselective click&#8208;functionalization of a lysine residue buried into a lipophilic binding pocket and yielding an unnatural chromophore with an extended &#960;&#8208;system. In doing so we effectively open the path to the in&#8197;vitro preparation of a library of synthetic proteins structurally reminiscent of xanthopsin eubacterial photoreceptors. We argue that such a library, made of variable unnatural chromophores inserted in an easy&#8208;to&#8208;mutate and crystallize retinoic acid transporter, significantly expand the scope of the recently introduced rhodopsin mimics as both optogenetic and &#8220;lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;molecule&#8221; tools.

         <title>Target&#8208;Mediated 5&#8217;&#8208;Exonuclease Digestion of DNA Aptamers with RecJ to Modulate Rolling Circle Amplification for Biosensing</title>

         <dc:description>
Protect and detect: a real&#8208;time fluorescence assay is demonstrated based on target&#8208;mediated protection of aptamers from 5&#8242;&#8208;exonuclease digestion by RecJ followed by introduction of a circular template and phi29 DNA polymerase to initiate rolling circle amplification, providing low picomolar detection limits for a protein (thrombin) and a small molecule (OTA) target.







Abstract
We report a new method for biosensing based on the target&#8208;mediated resistance of DNA aptamers against 5&#8217;&#8208;exonuclease digestion, allowing them to act as primers for rolling circle amplification (RCA). A target&#8208;bound DNA strand containing an aptamer region on the 5&#8217;&#8208;end and a primer region on the 3&#8217;&#8208;end is protected from 5&#8217;&#8208;exonuclease digestion by RecJ exonuclease in a target&#8208;dependent manner. As the protected aptamer is at the 5&#8217;&#8208;end, the exposed primer on the 3&#8217;&#8208;end can participate in RCA in the presence of a circular template to generate a turn&#8208;on sensor. Without target, RecJ digests the primer and prevents RCA from occurring, allowing quantitative fluorescence detection of both thrombin, a protein, and ochratoxin A (OTA), a small molecule, at picomolar concentrations.

         <title>Optochemical Control of Bacterial Gene Expression: Novel Photocaged Compounds for Different Promoter Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 1, January 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel optochemical tools for controlling gene expression in E. coli were investigated. Six photocaged carbohydrates with redshifted absorption and a photocaged salicylic acid derivative were synthesized, photochemically characterized and applied in&#8197;vivo for light&#8208;mediated target gene expression. The potential challenges during the establishment of a new optochemically controllable system and sufficient solutions are discussed in detail.







Abstract
Photocaged compounds are applied for implementing precise, optochemical control of gene expression in bacteria. To broaden the scope of UV&#8208;light&#8208;responsive inducer molecules, six photocaged carbohydrates were synthesized and photochemically characterized, with the absorption exhibiting a red&#8208;shift. Their differing linkage through ether, carbonate, and carbamate bonds revealed that carbonate and carbamate bonds are convenient. Subsequently, those compounds were successfully applied in&#8197;vivo for controlling gene expression in E. coli via blue light illumination. Furthermore, benzoate&#8208;based expression systems were subjected to light control by establishing a novel photocaged salicylic acid derivative. Besides its synthesis and in&#8197;vitro characterization, we demonstrate the challenging choice of a suitable promoter system for light&#8208;controlled gene expression in E. coli. We illustrate various bottlenecks during both photocaged inducer synthesis and in&#8197;vivo application and possibilities to overcome them. These findings pave the way towards novel caged inducer&#8208;dependent systems for wavelength&#8208;selective gene expression.

         <title>Urea and Acetamide Rich Solutions Circumvent the Strand Inhibition Problem to Allow Multiple Rounds of DNA and RNA Copying</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 1, January 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copying of nucleic acids under prebiotic conditions has been hard to achieve because of a problem known as strand inhibition. This problem can be overcome using solvents composed of molecules abundant in the early Earth, allowing for multiple rounds of information transfer of DNA and RNA duplexes under simulated prebiotic conditions through temperature and hydration cycles.







Abstract
For decades prebiotic chemists have attempted to achieve replication of RNA under prebiotic conditions with only limited success. One of the long&#8208;recognized impediments to achieving true replication of a duplex (copying of both strands) is the so&#8208;called strand inhibition problem. Specifically, while the two strands of an RNA (or DNA) duplex can be separated by heating, upon cooling the strands of a duplex will reanneal before mononucleotide or oligonucleotide substrates can bind to the individual strands. Here we demonstrate that a class of plausible prebiotic solvents, when coupled with thermal cycling and varying levels of hydration, circumvents the strand inhibition problem, and allows multiple rounds of information transfer from both strands of a duplex (replication). Replication was achieved by simultaneous ligation of oligomers that bind to their templates with the aid of the solvents. The solvents used consisted of concentrated solutions of urea and acetamide in water (UAcW), components that were likely abundant on the early Earth. The UAcW solvent system favors the annealing of shorter strands over the re&#8208;annealing of long strands, thereby circumventing strand inhibition. We observed an improvement of DNA and RNA replication yields by a factor of 100&#215; over aqueous buffer. Information transfer in the UAcW solvent system is robust, being achieved for a range of solvent component ratios, various drying conditions, and in the absence or presence of added salts.

         <title>Forward Chemical Genetic Screen for Oxygen&#8208;Dependent Cytotoxins Uncovers New Covalent Fragments that Target GPX4</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 1, January 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of propiolamide&#8208;based GPX4 inhibitors was discovered in an unbiased screen of 930 electrophilic fragments under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We show that the novel GPX4 inhibitors displayed normoxia&#8208;selective toxicity, which can be expanded to canonical ferroptosis inducers in three different cell lines. This underscores the importance of tumor oxygenation when developing GPX4 inhibitors for therapeutic use.







Abstract
The identification of growth inhibitory compounds with the ability to selectively target the cellular oxygenation state may be of therapeutic interest. Here, a phenotypic screen of a&#8197;covalent fragment library revealed diverse compounds containing propiolamide warheads with selective toxicity for liver cancer cells in normoxic conditions. Target identification and validation through CETSA and direct pulldown experiments demonstrated that several compounds target glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4 (GPX4) and induce ferroptotic cell death. Although being an oxidative cell death mechanism, ferroptosis can be induced also under hypoxic conditions. Prompted by the selective toxicity discovered in the screen, we mapped the oxygen&#8208;dependence of several ferroptosis&#8208;inducing compounds across three different cell lines. These studies revealed combinations with notable reductions in sensitivity under hypoxic conditions. These observations are mechanistically interesting and may be relevant for the use of ferroptosis&#8208;inducers as anti&#8208;cancer agents.

         <title>An Advanced &#8216;clickECM&#8217; That Can be Modified by the Inverse&#8208;Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 1, January 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metabolic glycoengineering was employed to incorporate dienophiles (terminal alkenes and a cyclopropene) into the extracellular matrix (ECM) of adipose&#8208;derived stem cells (ASCs). A subsequent inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reaction allowed the equipment of the ECM with bioactive molecules, opening numerous applications.







Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) represents the natural environment of cells in tissue and therefore is a promising biomaterial in a variety of applications. Depending on the purpose, it is necessary to equip the ECM with specific addressable functional groups for further modification with bioactive molecules, for controllable cross&#8208;linking and/or covalent binding to surfaces. Metabolic glycoengineering (MGE) enables the specific modification of the ECM with such functional groups without affecting the native structure of the ECM. In a previous approach (S.&#8197;M. Ruff, S. Keller, D.&#8197;E. Wieland, V. Wittmann, G.&#8197;E.&#8197;M. Tovar, M. Bach, P.&#8197;J. Kluger, Acta Biomater. 2017, 52, 159&#8211;170), we demonstrated the modification of an ECM with azido groups, which can be addressed by bioorthogonal copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Here, we demonstrate the modification of an ECM with dienophiles (terminal alkenes, cyclopropene), which can be addressed by an inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reaction. This reaction is cell friendly as there are no cytotoxic catalysts needed. We show the equipment of the ECM with a bioactive molecule (enzyme) and prove that the functional groups do not influence cellular behavior.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metabolic glycoengineering&lt;/b&gt; was employed to incorporate dienophiles (terminal alkenes and a cyclopropene) into the extracellular matrix (ECM) of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). A subsequent inverse-electron-demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reaction allowed the equipment of the ECM with bioactive molecules, opening numerous applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extracellular matrix (ECM) represents the natural environment of cells in tissue and therefore is a promising biomaterial in a variety of applications. Depending on the purpose, it is necessary to equip the ECM with specific addressable functional groups for further modification with bioactive molecules, for controllable cross-linking and/or covalent binding to surfaces. Metabolic glycoengineering (MGE) enables the specific modification of the ECM with such functional groups without affecting the native structure of the ECM. In a previous approach (S.&#8197;M. Ruff, S. Keller, D.&#8197;E. Wieland, V. Wittmann, G.&#8197;E.&#8197;M. Tovar, M. Bach, P.&#8197;J. Kluger, &lt;i&gt;Acta Biomater&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;b&gt;2017&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;52&lt;/i&gt;, 159&#8211;170), we demonstrated the modification of an ECM with azido groups, which can be addressed by bioorthogonal copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Here, we demonstrate the modification of an ECM with dienophiles (terminal alkenes, cyclopropene), which can be addressed by an inverse-electron-demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reaction. This reaction is cell friendly as there are no cytotoxic catalysts needed. We show the equipment of the ECM with a bioactive molecule (enzyme) and prove that the functional groups do not influence cellular behavior. Thus, this new material has great potential for use as a biomaterial, which can be individually modified in a wide range of applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Head&#8208;to&#8208;Head Comparison of Selected Extra&#8208; and Intracellular CO&#8208;Releasing Molecules on Their CO&#8208;Releasing and Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Properties</title>

         <dc:description>
The beneficial anti&#8208;inflammatory effects of carbon monoxide were studied using differently triggered CO&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs). In particular, some acyloxy&#8208;Fe(CO)3 complexes acting as enzyme&#8208;triggered CORMs showed pronounced cellular effects regardless of whether CO release was intra&#8208; or extracellular.







Abstract
Over the past decade, a variety of carbon monoxide releasing molecules (CORMs) have been developed and tested. Some CORMs spontaneously release CO once in solution, while others require a trigger mechanism to release the bound CO from its molecular complex. The modulation of biological systems by CORMs depends largely on the spatiotemporal release of CO, which likely differs among the different types of CORMs. In spontaneously releasing CORMs, CO is released extracellularly and crosses the cell membrane to interact with intracellular targets. Other CORMs can directly release CO intracellularly, which may be a more efficient method to modulate biological systems. In the present study, we compared the efficacy of extracellular and intracellular CO&#8208;releasing CORMs that either release CO spontaneously or require an enzymatic trigger. The efficacy of such CORMs to modulate HO&#8208;1 and VCAM&#8208;1 expression in TNF&#8208;&#945;&#8208;stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was evaluated.

         <title>Structures of the Human SPAK and OSR1 Conserved C&#8208;Terminal (CCT) Domains**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 1, January 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inhibition of SPAK and OSR1 kinases binding to their upstream WNK kinases has been identified as a plausible strategy for inhibiting the WNK&#8208;activation of SPAK and OSR1 kinases. To facilitate the discovery of SPAK and OSR1 kinase inhibitors as potential therapeutics, we report the crystal structures of the highly conserved C&#8208;terminal domains of human SPAK and OSR1, which mediate the binding to, and activation, by their upstream WNK kinases.







Abstract
STE20/SPS1&#8208;related proline/alanine&#8208;rich kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress responsive 1 (OSR1) kinase are two serine/threonine protein kinases that regulate the function of ion co&#8208;transporters through phosphorylation. The highly conserved C&#8208;terminal (CCT) domains of SPAK and OSR1 bind to RFx[V/I] peptide sequences from their upstream &#8216;With No Lysine Kinases (WNKs), facilitating their activation via phosphorylation. Thus, the inhibition of SPAK and OSR1 binding, via their CCT domains, to WNK kinases is a plausible strategy for inhibiting SPAK and OSR1 kinases. To facilitate structure&#8208;guided drug design of such inhibitors, we expressed and purified human SPAK and OSR1 CCT domains and solved their crystal structures. Interestingly, these crystal structures show a highly conserved primary pocket adjacent to a flexible secondary pocket. We also employed a biophysical strategy and determined the affinity of SPAK and OSR1 CCT domains to short peptides derived from WNK4 and NKCC1. Together, this work provides a platform that facilitates the design of CCT domain specific small molecule binders that inhibit SPAK&#8208; and OSR1&#8208;activation by WNK kinases, and these could be useful in treating hypertension and ischemic stroke.

         <dc:description>
As academia and industry push the boundaries of chemical biology more and more from basic science into impacting human health, we asked experts in the field what uniquely positions chemical biology as a translational science, how and when to maximize its potential, and where the field is headed. We also reflect personally on how chemical biology has impacted our careers in industry and academia.

Oxygen is a central player in most aspects of life &#8211; without it, many life&#8208;giving processes will drag to a halt. Remarkably, some cell death mechanisms also require the presence of oxygen. In their study, Cordon et&#8197;al. show how oxygen&#8208;deprivation impedes the execution of ferroptosis in cancer cells. Ferroptosis is an oxidative cell death process that ultimately leads to oxidation and destruction of lipid membranes. The findings underscore the importance of understanding the role of oxygen when developing anticancer treatments. The graphic was created with assistance from Lise Balsby and Astrid Friis Reitzel (Aarhus University). More information can be found in the Full Paper by T.&#8197;B. Poulsen et&#8197;al.

         <title>&#8220;A Study in Yellow&#8221;: Investigations in the Stereoselectivity of Ene&#8208;Reductases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 1, January 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Elementary, Watson!&#8221; The recent efforts to investigate and understand the stereochemical course of the asymmetric bioreduction of C=C bonds mediated by ene&#8208;reductases are reviewed, covering the literature of the last two decades. A general binding model is presented and successful approaches to stereodivergent reductions are discussed with representative examples.







Abstract
Ene&#8208;reductases from the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) superfamily are a well&#8208;known and efficient biocatalytic alternative for the asymmetric reduction of C=C bonds. Considering the broad variety of substituents that can be tolerated, and the excellent stereoselectivities achieved, it is apparent why these enzymes are so appealing for preparative and industrial applications. Different classes of C=C bonds activated by at least one electron&#8208;withdrawing group have been shown to be accepted by these versatile biocatalysts in the last decades, affording a vast range of chiral intermediates employed in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, flavours, fragrances and fine chemicals. In order to access both enantiomers of reduced products, stereodivergent pairs of OYEs are desirable, but their natural occurrence is limited. The detailed knowledge of the stereochemical course of the reaction can uncover alternative strategies to orient the selectivity via mutagenesis, evolution, and substrate engineering. An overview of the ongoing studies on OYE&#8208;mediated bioreductions will be provided, with particular focus on stereochemical investigations by deuterium labelling.

         <title>The Chemistry behind ThiC Rearrangement</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 1, January 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
ThiC rearrangement is one of the most significant and sophisticated processes of pyrimidine biosynthesis, which has triggered the interest of numerous scientists from both chemistry and biology. In this Minireview, we briefly summarize most of the current processes in the elucidation of the chemistry behind this fascinating transformation, including the responsible enzyme and its structural details.







Abstract
Thiamine (vitamin&#8197;B1) is crucial for life and plays a central role in metabolism. It contains thiazole and pyrimidine moieties that are constructed independently and then assembled together to generate thiamine phosphate. The study of the thiazole moiety is relatively clear, but deciphering the mechanistic enzymology of thiamine pyrimidine is more difficult. This review aims to summarize the recent research progress on ThiC rearrangement, mainly including the mechanism, related enzymes, and genes involved in the rearrangement.

Surprising diversity: The aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases from E. coli have been extensively explored, and a surprising number of amino acid substrates have been described. This comprehensive review catalogues all known substrates for these enzymes and highlights trends and novel applications.







Abstract
In this comprehensive review, I focus on the twenty E.&#8197;coli aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases and their ability to charge non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) onto tRNAs. The promiscuity of these enzymes has been harnessed for diverse applications including understanding and engineering of protein function, creation of organisms with an expanded genetic code, and the synthesis of diverse peptide libraries for drug discovery. The review catalogues the structures of all known ncAA substrates for each of the 20 E.&#8197;coli aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases, including ncAA substrates for engineered versions of these enzymes. Drawing from the structures in the list, I highlight trends and novel opportunities for further exploitation of these ncAAs in the engineering of protein function, synthetic biology, and in drug discovery.

         <title>Engineering of a Plant Isoprenyl Diphosphate Synthase for Development of Irregular Coupling Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 1, January 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A side activity of a regular isoprenyl diphosphate synthase results in two non&#8208;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail terpene structures. For one of them, a cyclobutane planococcyl diphosphate, this is the first example of an efficient enzymatic synthesis. Rational design of the protein allowed for a considerable increase of the irregular activity. The engineered enzyme can be implicated in the sustainable production of insect pheromones for environment&#8208;friendly pest control.







Abstract
We performed mutagenesis on a regular isoprenyl diphosphate synthase (IDS), neryl diphosphate synthase from Solanum lycopersicum (SlNPPS), that has a structurally related analogue performing non&#8208;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail coupling of two dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) units, lavandulyl diphosphate synthase from Lavandula x intermedia (LiLPPS). Wild&#8208;type SlNPPS catalyses regular coupling of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and DMAPP in cis&#8208;orientation resulting in the formation of neryl diphosphate. However, if the enzyme is fed with DMAPP only, it is able to catalyse the coupling of two DMAPP units and synthesizes two irregular monoterpene diphosphates; their structures were elucidated by the NMR analysis of their dephosphorylation products. One of the alcohols is lavandulol. The second compound is the trans&#8208;isomer of planococcol, the first example of an irregular cyclobutane monoterpene with this stereochemical configuration. The irregular activity of SlNPPS constitutes 0.4&#8201;% of its regular activity and is revealed only if the enzyme is supplied with DMAPP in the absence of IPP. The exchange of asparagine 88 for histidine considerably enhanced the non&#8208;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail coupling. While still only observed in the absence of IPP, irregular activity of the mutant reaches 13.1&#8201;% of its regular activity. The obtained results prove that regular IDS are promising starting points for protein engineering aiming at the development of irregular activities and leading to novel monoterpene structures.

         <title>New Insights into Tolytoxin Effect in Human Cancer Cells: Apoptosis Induction and the Relevance of Hydroxyl Substitution of Its Macrolide Cycle on Compound Potency</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 1, January 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scytophycins are actin&#8208;binding macrolides with a high potency on cancer cell lines, however, the cellular fate after scytophycin treatment is not known. We show that scytophycins induce apoptosis, an essential feature of anticancer drugs. We also demonstrate substituents on the macrolide cycle affect the compound potency which was not previously considered. Thus, scytophycins are strong candidates for targeted drug delivery and structure&#8208;activity studies.







Abstract
Scytophycins, including tolytoxin, represent a class of actin disrupting macrolides with strong antiproliferative effects on human cells. Despite intense research, little attention has been paid to scytophycin&#8208;induced cell death or the structural features affecting its potency. We show that tolytoxin and its natural analogue, 7&#8208;O&#8208;methylscytophycin B, lacking the hydroxyl substitution in its macrolactone ring, differ substantially in their cytotoxic effect. Both compounds increase the level of caspases 3/7, which are the main executioner proteases during apoptosis, in HeLa wild&#8208;type (WT) cells. However, no caspase activity was detected in HeLa cells lacking Bax/Bak proteins crucial for caspase activation via the mitochondrial pathway. Obtained data strongly suggests that scytophycins are capable of inducing mitochondria&#8208;dependent apoptosis. These findings encourage further research in structure&#8208;activity relationships in scytophycins and highlight the potential of these compounds in targeted drug delivery.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scytophycins, including tolytoxin, represent a class of actin disrupting macrolides with strong antiproliferative effects on human cells. Despite intense research, little attention has been paid to scytophycin-induced cell death or the structural features affecting its potency. We show that tolytoxin and its natural analogue, 7-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methylscytophycin B, lacking the hydroxyl substitution in its macrolactone ring, differ substantially in their cytotoxic effect. Both compounds increase the level of caspases 3/7, which are the main executioner proteases during apoptosis, in HeLa wild-type (WT) cells. However, no caspase activity was detected in HeLa cells lacking Bax/Bak proteins crucial for caspase activation via the mitochondrial pathway. Obtained data strongly suggests that scytophycins are capable of inducing mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. These findings encourage further research in structure-activity relationships in scytophycins and highlight the potential of these compounds in targeted drug delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of a Stable Isostere of Malonyllysine**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 1, January 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermal&#8208;induced decarboxylation property of lysine malonylation may impose potential challenges to its study. Our study demonstrated that malonyltetrazole&#8208;modified lysine outstands as a stable bioisostere of malonyllysine to address such challenges. Enzymology data also verified that malonyl and malonyltetrazole share similar molecular interaction surfaces for receptor recognition.







Abstract
Lysine malonylation is a recently characterized post&#8208;translational modification involved in the regulation of energy metabolism and gene expression. One unique feature of this post&#8208;translational modification is its potential susceptibility to decarboxylation, which poses possible challenges to its study. As a step towards addressing these challenges, we report the synthesis and evaluation of a stable isostere of malonyllysine. First, we find that synthetic substitution of the malonyl group with a tetrazole isostere results in amino acid's resistant to thermal decarboxylation. Next, we demonstrate that protected variants of this amino acid are readily incorporated into peptides. Finally, we show that tetrazole isosteres of malonyllysine can be recognized by anti&#8208;malonyllysine antibodies and histone deacylases, validating their ability to mimic features of the endogenous lysine modification. Overall, this study establishes a new chemical strategy for stably mimicking a metabolite&#8208;derived post&#8208;translational modification, providing a foothold for tool development and functional analyses.

         <dc:description>
A useful fluorinated NMR probe: &#945;&#8208;Quaternarized (R)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine (&#945;&#8208;TfmAla) is a good tool for providing convenient and accurate 19F NMR&#8208;based monitoring of trypsin proteolytic activity and increases resistance towards pepsin degradation.







Abstract
Fluorinated non&#8208;natural amino acids are useful tools for improving the bioavailability of peptides but can also serve as fluorinated probes in 19F NMR&#8208;based enzymatic assays. We report herein that the use of the non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;quaternarized (R)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine ((R)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;TfmAla) provides convenient and accurate monitoring of trypsin proteolytic activity and increases resistance towards pepsin degradation.

         <title>Protein recognition&#8208;initiated exponential amplification reaction (PRIEAR) and its application in clinical diagnosis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The isothermal exponential amplification technology have rarely been fabricated as the universal sensing platform for the detection of various proteins. To broaden its application, we here developed a strategy named protein recognition&#8208;initiated exponential amplification reaction (PRIEAR) using protein recognition to induce the DNA assembly which converts protein recognition events into ssDNA amplicons and combining two&#8208;stage amplification to achieve exponential amplification technology. Taking advantage of this principle, diverse biomarkers can be quantified at sub&#8208;picomolar concentrations in the homogenous manner, making the PRIEAR suitable for clinical practice. Therefore, this strategy can expand the powerful isothermal exponential amplification technology to protein targets and thus provide a new toolbox into the clinical and biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving structural stability and anticoagulant activity of a thrombin binding aptamer by aromatic modifications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The thrombin binding aptamer (TBA) is a 15&#8208;mer DNA oligonucleotide (5&#8217;&#8208;GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG&#8208;3&#8217;), that can form a stable intramolecular antiparallel chair&#8208;like G&#8208;quadruplex structure. This aptamer shows anticoagulant properties by interacting with one of the two anion binding sites of thrombin, namely the fibrinogen&#8208;recognition exosite. Here, we demonstrate that terminal modification of TBA with aromatic fragments such as coumarin, pyrene and perylene diimide (PDI), improves the G&#8208;quadruplex stability. The large aromatic surface of these dyes can &#960;&#8208;&#960; stack to the G&#8208;quadruplex or to each other, thereby stabilizing the aptamer. With respect to the original TBA, monoPDI&#8208;functionalized TBA exhibited the most remarkable improvement in melting temperature (&#916;T  m  &#8776; +18 &#176;C) and displayed enhanced anticoagulant activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate Profiling of Anion Methyltransferases for Promiscuous Synthesis of S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine Analogs from Haloalkanes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;natural analogs of the ubiquitous co&#8208;substrate S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) are difficult to access, but useful for the enzymatic functionalization of various molecules with high selectivity. We investigated the promiscuous synthesis of SAM analogs in the anion methyltransferase enzyme family. Several promiscuous enzymes have been identified that synthesize non&#8208;natural co&#8208;substrates from cheap and readily available haloalkanes. This opens new avenues for selective alkylation chemistry.







Abstract
Biocatalytic alkylation reactions can be performed with high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity using S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent methyltransferases (MTs) and SAM analogs. Currently, however, this methodology is limited in application due to the rather laborious protocols to access SAM analogs. It has recently been shown that halide methyltransferases (HMTs) enable synthesis and recycling of SAM analogs with readily available haloalkanes as starting material. Here we expand this work by using substrate profiling of the anion MT enzyme family to explore promiscuous SAM analog synthesis. Our study shows that anion MTs are in general very promiscuous with respect to the alkyl chain as well as the halide leaving group. Substrate profiling further suggests that promiscuous anion MTs cluster in sequence space. Next to iodoalkanes, cheaper, less toxic, and more available bromoalkanes have been converted and several haloalkanes bearing short alkyl groups, alkyl rings, and functional groups such as alkene, alkyne and aromatic moieties are accepted as substrates. Further, we applied the SAM analogs as electrophiles in enzyme&#8208;catalyzed regioselective pyrazole allylation with 3&#8208;bromopropene as starting material.

         <title>Engineered bacterial flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenases for the regiospecific hydroxylation of polycyclic phenols</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>4&#8208;Hydroxyphenylacetate 3&#8208;hydroxylase (4HPA3H), a flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase from  E. coli  that catalyzes the hydroxylation of monophenols to catechols, was modified by rational re&#8208;design to convert also more bulky substrates, especially phenolic natural products like phenylpropanoids, flavones or coumarins. Selected amino acid positions in the binding pocket of 4HPA3H were exchanged by residues from the homologous protein from  Pseudomonas aeruginosa, yielding variants with improved conversion of spacious substrates such as the flavonoid naringenin or the alkaloid mimetic 2&#8208;hydroxycarbazole. Reactions were followed by an adapted Fe(III)&#8208;catechol chromogenic assay selective for the products. Especially substitution of the residue Y301 facilitated modulation of substrate specificity: introduction of non&#8208;aromatic but hydrophobic (iso)leucine resulted in the preference of the substrate ferulic acid (having a guaiacyl (guajacyl) moiety, part of the vanilloid motif) over unsubstituted monophenols. The in vivo (whole&#8208;cell biocatalysts) and in vitro (three&#8208;enzyme cascade) transformations of substrates by 4HPA3H and its optimized variants was strictly regiospecific and proceeded without generation of by&#8208;products.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering the ligand specificity of the human galectin&#8208;1 by incorporation of tryptophan analogs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Galectin&#8208;1 is a &#946;&#8208;galactoside&#8208;binding lectin with manifold biological functions. A single tryptophan residue (W68) in its carbohydrate binding site plays a major role in ligand binding and is highly conserved among galectins. To fine tune galectin&#8208;1 specificity, we introduced several non&#8208;canonical tryptophan analogs at this position of human galectin&#8208;1 and analyzed the resulting variants using glycan microarrays. Two variants containing 7&#8208;azatryptophan and 7&#8208;fluorotryptophan showed a reduced affinity for 3&#8217;&#8208;sulfated oligosaccharides. Their interaction with different ligands was further analyzed by fluorescence polarization competition assay. Using molecular modeling we provide structural clues that the change in affinities comes from modulated interactions and solvation patterns. Thus, we show that the introduction of subtle atomic mutations in the ligand binding site of galectin&#8208;1 is an attractive approach for fine&#8208;tuning its interactions with different ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Modern strategies for the diversification of the supply of natural compounds &#8208; the case of alkaloid painkillers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plant&#8208;derived natural compounds are used for treating diseases since the beginning of humankind. The supply of many plant&#8208;derived natural compounds for medicinal purposes, such as thebaine, morphine, and codeine, is, nowadays, majorly dependent on opium poppy crop harvesting. This dependency puts an extra risk factor in ensuring the supply chain because crops are highly susceptible to environmental factors. Emerging technologies, such as biocatalysis, might help to solve this problem, by diversifying the sources of supply of these compounds. Here we review the first committed step in the production of alkaloid painkillers, the production of S&#8208;norcoclaurine, and the enzymes involved. The improvement of these enzymes can be carried out by experimental directed evolution and rational design strategies, supported by computational methods, to create variants that produce the S&#8208;norcoclaurine precursor for alkaloid painkillers in heterologous organisms, meeting the pharmaceutical industry standards and needs without depending on opium poppy crops.</dc:description>

         <title>Semi&#8208;rational Engineering of a Promiscuous Fatty Acid Hydratase for Alteration of Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semi&#8208;rational mutant library of a promiscuous fatty acid hydrtatase (FA&#8208;HY1) revealed several mutants, which exhibited an impressive shift of regioselectivity towards eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) substrate. While the wild&#8208;type enzyme produces a mixture of two hydroxy fatty acid regioisomers at a ratio of 63&#8201;:&#8201;37 (12&#8208;OH&#8201;:&#8201;15&#8208;OH), six mutants were able to form exclusively a single hydroxy fatty acid regioisomer (15&#8208;OH).







Abstract
Fatty acid hydratases (FAHs) catalyze regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective hydration of unsaturated fatty acids to produce hydroxy fatty acids. Fatty acid hydratase&#8208;1 (FA&#8208;HY1) from Lactobacillus Acidophilus is the most promiscuous and regiodiverse FAH identified so far. Here, we engineered binding site residues of FA&#8208;HY1 (S393, S395, S218 and P380) by semi&#8208;rational protein engineering to alter regioselectivity. Although it was not possible to obtain a completely new type of regioselectivity with our mutant libraries, a significant shift of regioselectivity was observed towards cis&#8208;5, cis&#8208;8, cis&#8208;11, cis&#8208;14, cis&#8208;17&#8208;eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). We identified mutants (S393/S395 mutants) with excellent regioselectivity, generating a single hydroxy fatty acid product from EPA (15&#8208;OH product), which is advantageous from application perspective. This result is impressive given that wild&#8208;type FA&#8208;HY1 produces a mixture of 12&#8208;OH and 15&#8208;OH products at 63&#8201;:&#8201;37 ratio (12&#8208;OH&#8201;:&#8201;15&#8208;OH). Moreover, our results indicate that native FA&#8208;HY1 is at its limit in terms of promiscuity and regiospecificity, thus it may not be possible to diversify its product portfolio with active site engineering. This behavior of FA&#8208;HY1 is unlike its orthologue, fatty acid hydratase&#8208;2 (FA&#8208;HY2; 58&#8201;% sequence identity to FA&#8208;HY1), which has been shown earlier to exhibit significant promiscuity and regioselectivity changes by a few active site mutations. Our reverse engineering from FA&#8208;HY1 to FA&#8208;HY2 further demonstrates this conclusion.

         <title>Rational Design of a Cu Chelator That Mitigates Cu&#8208;Induced ROS Production by Amyloid Beta</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally designed mixed Cu chelator mitigates Cu&#8722;A&#946; induced reactive oxygen species formation by redox silencing and radical scavenging. The presence of oxidized amino acids in A&#946; correlates to their role in the entatic state.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease severely perturbs transition metal homeostasis in the brain leading to the accumulation of excess metals in extracellular and intraneuronal locations. The amyloid beta protein binds these transition metals, ultimately causing severe oxidative stress in the brain. Metal chelation therapy is an approach to sequester metals from amyloid beta and relieve the oxidative stress. Here we have designed a mixed N/O donor Cu chelator inspired by the proposed ligand set of Cu in amyloid beta. We demonstrate that the chelator effectively removes Cu from amyloid beta and suppresses reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by redox silencing and radical scavenging both in&#8197;vitro and in cellulo. The impact of ROS on the extent of oxidation of the different aggregated forms of the peptide is studied by mass spectrometry, which, along with other ROS assays, shows that the oligomers are pro&#8208;oxidants in nature. The aliphatic Leu34, which was previously unobserved, has been identified as a new oxidation site.

An alkynyl&#8208;functionalized long&#8208;chain fatty acid&#8208;based sulfonyl fluoride chemical probe was developed for covalent targeting, activity profiling, proteomic identification, and inhibitor evaluation of diverse classes of fatty acid&#8208;associated proteins in living cells.







Abstract
Fatty acids play fundamental structural, metabolic, functional, and signaling roles in all biological systems. Altered fatty acid levels and metabolism have been associated with many pathological conditions. Chemical probes have greatly facilitated biological studies on fatty acids. Herein, we report the development and characterization of an alkynyl&#8208;functionalized long&#8208;chain fatty acid&#8208;based sulfonyl fluoride probe for covalent labelling, enrichment, and identification of fatty acid&#8208;associated proteins in living cells. Our quantitative chemical proteomics show that this sulfonyl fluoride probe targets diverse classes of fatty acid&#8208;associated proteins including many metabolic serine hydrolases that are known to be involved in fatty acid metabolism and modification. We further validate that the probe covalently modifies the catalytically or functionally essential serine or tyrosine residues of its target proteins and enables evaluation of their inhibitors. The sulfonyl fluoride&#8208;based chemical probe thus represents a new tool for profiling the expression and activity of fatty acid&#8208;associated proteins in living cells.

         <title>Extension of the Terpene Chemical Space: the Very First Biosynthetic Steps</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to a unique biosynthetic scheme, the diversification of terpene structure could be envisioned through the structural modification of the two universal common terpene precursors IPP and DMAPP. This minireview covers the synthesis, the use as prenyl transferase substrates, and the synthetic application of IPP and DMAPP homologues developed for diversifying the terpene chemical space.







Abstract
The structural diversity of terpenes is particularly notable and many studies are carried out to increase it further. In the terpene biosynthetic pathway this diversity is accessible from only two common precursors, i.&#8201;e. isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Methods recently developed (e.&#8201;g. the Terpene Mini Path) have allowed DMAPP and IPP to be obtained from a two&#8208;step enzymatic conversion of industrially available isopentenol (IOH) and dimethylallyl alcohol (DMAOH) into their corresponding diphosphates. Easily available IOH and DMAOH analogues then offer quick access to modified terpenoids thus avoiding the tedious chemical synthesis of unnatural diphosphates. The aim of this minireview is to cover the literature devoted to the use of these analogues for widening the accessible terpene chemical space.

         <title>Asymmetrically Substituted m&#8208;Terphenyl Phosphates Inhibit the Transcription Factor STAT5a</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetry is overrated: Stafia&#8208;1, the first selective inhibitor of the transcription factor STAT5a, is a symmetrically substituted m&#8208;terphenyl phosphate that binds to an unsymmetrical protein binding pocket. We present synthetic methodology for generating asymmetrically substituted m&#8208;terphenyl phosphate&#8208;based STAT5a inhibitors, which give insights into structure&#8208;activity relationships.







Abstract
We recently presented Stafia&#8208;1 as the first chemical entity that inhibits the transcription factor STAT5a with selectivity over the highly homologous STAT5b. Stafia&#8208;1, which was identified from a series of symmetrically substituted m&#8208;terphenyl phosphates, binds to the interface between the SH2 domain and the linker domain of STAT5a. Here, we outline a synthetic strategy for the synthesis of asymmetrically substituted m&#8208;terphenyl phosphates, which can be tailored to address their asymmetric STAT5a binding site in a more specific manner. The asymmetrically substituted m&#8208;terphenyl phosphate with the highest activity against STAT5a was converted to a phosphatase&#8208;stable monofluoromethylene phosphonate. The synthetic methodology and activity analysis described here provide first insights into the structure&#8208;activity relationships of m&#8208;terphenyl phosphates for use as selective STAT5a inhibitors.

         <title>Monitoring the Response of Multiple Signal Network Components to Acute Chemo&#8208;Optogenetic Perturbations in Living Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical perturbation method is presented that allows parallel readout of multiple fluorescence&#8208;based response kinetics in individual, living cells. The method is used to uncover control mechanisms in cell contraction and their misregulation in disease.







Abstract
Cells process information via signal networks that typically involve multiple components which are interconnected by feedback loops. The combination of acute optogenetic perturbations and microscopy&#8208;based fluorescent response readouts enables the direct investigation of causal links in such networks. However, due to overlaps in spectra of photosensitive and fluorescent proteins, current approaches that combine these methods are limited. Here, we present an improved chemo&#8208;optogenetic approach that is based on switch&#8208;like perturbations induced by a single, local pulse of UV light. We show that this approach can be combined with parallel monitoring of multiple fluorescent readouts to directly uncover relations between signal network components. We present the application of this technique to directly investigate feedback&#8208;controlled regulation in the cell contraction signal network that includes GEF&#8208;H1, Rho and Myosin, and functional interactions of this network with tumor relevant RhoA G17 mutants.

         <title>Toward an Orthogonal Protein Lysine Acylation and Deacylation System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An orthogonal lysine acylation and deacylation (OKAD) system, which potentially could precisely dissect the biological consequence of an individual acetylation or deacetylation event in living cells, was rationally designed through genetically encoding artificially designed acylated lysine analogues and reshaping the substrate specificity of a bacterial protein deacetylase.







Abstract
Lysine acetylation is one of the most basic molecular mechanisms to mediate protein functions in living organisms, and its abnormal regulation has been linked to many diseases. The drug development associated to this process is of great significance but severely hindered by the complex interplay of lysine acetylation and deacetylation in thousands of proteins, and we reasoned that targeting a specific protein acetylation or deacetylation event instead of the related enzymes should be a feasible solution to this issue. Toward this goal, we devised an orthogonal lysine acylation and deacylation (OKAD) system, which potentially could precisely dissect the biological consequence of an individual acetylation or deacetylation event in living cells. The system includes a genetically encoded acylated lysine (PhOAcK) that is not a substrate of endogenous deacetylases, and an evolved sirtuin (CobB2/CobB3) that displays PhOAcK deacylase activities as well as reduced deacetylase activities. We believe the strategy introduced here holds potential for future in&#8208;depth biological applications.

         <title>Bioinorganic Chemistry of Zinc in Relation to the Immune System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc's role in human immunity has been extensively covered from a biological perspective. The structural, thermodynamic, and inorganic chemistry of zinc in relation to proteins and pathways of the immune system has received less attention and is the topic of the present review.







Abstract
Zinc is well&#8208;known to have a central role in human inflammation and immunity and is itself an anti&#8208;inflammatory and antiviral agent. Despite its massively documented role in such processes, the underlying chemistry of zinc in relation to specific proteins and pathways of the immune system has not received much focus. This short review provides an overview of this topic, with emphasis on the structures of key proteins, zinc coordination chemistry, and probable mechanisms involved in zinc&#8208;based immunity, with some focus points for future chemical and biological research.

         <title>Enzymatic Beacons for Specific Sensing of Dilute Nucleic Acid**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic beacons, or E&#8208;beacons, have been prepared by hedgehog catalyzed bioconjugation and shown to function as turn&#8208;on biosensors with single&#8208;base pair mismatch specificity using SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as a sample target.







Abstract
Enzymatic beacons, or E&#8208;beacons, are 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 bioconjugates of the nanoluciferase enzyme linked covalently at its C&#8208;terminus to hairpin forming ssDNA equipped with a dark quencher. We prepared E&#8208;beacons biocatalytically using HhC, the promiscuous Hedgehog C&#8208;terminal protein&#8208;cholesterol ligase. HhC attached nanoluciferase site&#8208;specifically to mono&#8208;sterylated hairpin oligonucleotides, called steramers. Three E&#8208;beacon dark quenchers were evaluated: Iowa Black, Onyx&#8208;A, and dabcyl. Each quencher enabled sensitive, sequence&#8208;specific nucleic acid detection through enhanced E&#8208;beacon bioluminescence upon target hybridization. We assembled prototype dabcyl&#8208;quenched E&#8208;beacons specific for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Targeting the E484 codon of the virus Spike protein, E&#8208;beacons (80&#215;10&#8722;12&#8197;M) reported wild&#8208;type SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleic acid at &#8805;1&#215;10&#8722;9&#8197;M by increased bioluminescence of 8&#8208;fold. E&#8208;beacon prepared for the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 E484K variant functioned with similar sensitivity. Both E&#8208;beacons could discriminate their target from the E484Q mutation of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Kappa variant. Along with mismatch specificity, E&#8208;beacons are two to three orders of magnitude more sensitive than synthetic molecular beacons.

         <title>Creation of an Engineered Amide Synthetase Biocatalyst by the Rational Separation of a Two&#8208;Step Nitrile Synthetase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

Rational engineering of the ATP&#8208;dependent biocatalyst QueC converts a nitrile synthetase to an amide synthetase.







Abstract
The synthesis of amides through acid and amine coupling is one of the most commonly used reactions in medicinal chemistry, yet still requires atom&#8208;inefficient coupling reagents. There is a current demand to develop greener, biocatalytic approaches to amide bond formation. The nitrile synthetase (NS) enzymes are a small family of ATP&#8208;dependent enzymes which catalyse the transformation of a carboxylic acid into the corresponding nitrile via an amide intermediate. The Bacillus subtilis QueC (BsQueC) is an NS involved in the synthesis of 7&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine (CDG) natural products. Through sequence homology and structural analysis of BsQueC we identified three highly conserved residues, which could potentially play important roles in NS substrate binding and catalysis. Rational engineering led to the creation of a NS K163A/R204A biocatalyst that converts the CDG acid into the primary amide, but does not proceed to the nitrile. This study suggests that NSs could be further developed for coupling agent&#8208;free, amide&#8208;forming biocatalysts.

         <title>Toward Engineered Biosynthesis of Drugs in Human Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of programming human cells to produce antibiotics in&#8197;situ by transfecting cells with a heterologous biosynthetic gene packaged in a viral vector, is demonstrated. The cytochrome P450 gene fma&#8208;P450 from the antimicrobial fumagillin biosynthetic pathway in Aspergillus fumigatus was introduced to HeLa cells to enable these human cells to biosynthesize a cytotoxic natural product from a nontoxic precursor.







Abstract
Biosynthetic genes are not only responsible for the formation of bioactive substances but also suited for other applications including gene therapy. To test the feasibility of human cells producing antibiotics in&#8197;situ when provided with a heterologous biosynthetic gene, we focused on cytochrome P450, the class of enzymes important in conferring bioactivity to natural product precursors. We selected Fma&#8208;P450 that plays a central role in the fumagillin antimicrobial biosynthesis in Aspergillus fumigatus to examine fungal metabolite production by HeLa cells that express fma&#8208;P450 heterologously. Here we show that HeLa cells harboring fma&#8208;P450 can biosynthesize 5&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;trans&#8208;bergamoten and cytotoxic 5&#8208;epi&#8208;demethoxyfumagillol when supplemented with the nontoxic precursor &#946;&#8208;trans&#8208;bergamotene. While the production level was insufficient to effect cell death, we demonstrate that programming human cells to autogenerate antibiotics by introducing a heterologous biosynthetic gene is feasible.

         <title>Selective immobilization of his&#8208;tagged phosphomannose isomerase on Ni chelated nanoparticles with good reusability and activity.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this paper, self&#8208;stable precipitation polymerization was used to prepare the enzyme&#8208;immobilized microsphere composite. Phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) with His&#8208;tag was successfully immobilized on Ni  2+  charged pyridine&#8208;derived particles. The maximum amount of PMI immobilized on such particles was ~ 184 mg/g. Compared with the free enzymes, the activity of the immobilized enzymes has been significantly improved. In addition, the immoblized enzymes showed a much better thermostability than free enzymes. At the same time, the immobilized enzymes can be reused for multiple reaction cycles. We have observed that the enzyme activity did not decrease significantly after 6 cycles of repeating usages. We conclude that the pyridine&#8208;derived particles can be used to selectively immobilize His&#8208;tagged enzymes, which can couple the enzyme purification and catalysis steps and improve the efficiency of enzyme&#8208;catalyzed industrial processes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Proteins directly participate in tremendous physiological processes and mediate a variety of cellular functions. However, precise manipulation of proteins with predefined relative position and stoichiometry for understanding protein&#8208;protein interactions and guiding cellular behaviors are still challenging. With superior programmability of DNA molecules, DNA origami technology is able to construct arbitrary nanostructures that can accurately control the arrangement of proteins with various functionalities to solve these problems. Herein, starting from the classification of DNA origami nanostructures and the category of assembled proteins, we summarize the existing DNA origami&#8208;based protein manipulation systems (PMSs), review the advances on the regulation of their functions, and discuss their applications in cellular behavior modulation and disease therapy. Moreover, the limitations and potential directions of DNA origami&#8208;based PMSs are also presented, which may offer guidance for rational construction and ingenious application.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>( S )&#8208; 3&#8208;Cyclopentyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypropanenitrile is the key precursor for the synthesis of ruxolitinib. The bioreduction of 3&#8208;cyclopentyl&#8208;3&#8208;ketopropanenitrile ( 1a ) offers an attractive method to access this important compound. A carbonyl reductase (PhADH) from Paraburkholderia hospita catalyzed the reduction of 1a giving the ( S )&#8208;alcohol ( 1b ) with 85% ee. Rational engineering of PhADH resulted in a double mutant H93C/A139L, which enhanced the enantioselectivity from 85% to &gt;98%, as well as a 6.3&#8208;fold improvement in the specific activity. The bioreduction of 1a was performed at 200 g/L (1.5 M) substrate concentration, leading to isolation of ( S )&#8208; 1b in 91% yield. Similarly, using this mutant enzyme 3&#8208;cyclohexyl&#8208;3&#8208;ketopropanenitrile ( 2a) and 3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3&#8208;ketopropanenitrile ( 3a ) were reduced at high concentration affording the corresponding alcohols in &gt;99% ee, and 90% and 92% yield, respectively.

         <title>Enhanced Immunostimulatory Activity of Covalent DNA Dendrons</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent DNA dendrons bearing multivalent immunostimulatory CpG oligonucleotides (ODNs) have been developed. The DNA dendrons were more resistant to nuclease degradation than linear ODNs, and they enhanced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from RAW264.7 cells as the number of immunostimulatory branches increased, suggesting that they could induce immune response through the activation of TLR9.







Abstract
The present study focused on the design and synthesis of covalent DNA dendrons bearing multivalent cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs) that can stimulate the immune system through the activation of TLR9. These dendrons were synthesized using branching trebler phosphoramidite containing three identical protecting groups that enabled the simultaneous synthesis of multiple strands on a single molecule. Compared with linear ODNs, covalent DNA dendrons were found to be more resistant to nuclease degradation and were more efficiently taken up by macrophage&#8208;like RAW264.7 cells. Cellular uptake was suggested to be mediated by macrophage scavenger receptors. The covalent DNA dendrons composed of multivalent immunostimulatory branches enhanced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines TNF&#8208;&#945; and IL&#8208;6 from RAW264.7 cells, and 9&#8208;branched DNA dendrons showed the highest enhancement. Given their enhanced efficacy, we expect covalent DNA dendrons to be useful structures of oligonucleotide medicines.

         <title>Controlling Protein Enrichment in Lipid Sponge Phase Droplets using SNAP&#8208;tag Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All cells use organized lipid compartments to facilitate specific biological functions. Membrane&#8208;bound organelles create defined spatial environments that favor unique chemical reactions while isolating incompatible biological processes. Despite the fundamental role of cellular organelles, there is a scarcity of methods for preparing functional artificial lipid&#8208;based compartments. Here, we demonstrate a robust bioconjugation system for sequestering proteins into zwitterionic lipid sponge phase droplets. Incorporation of benzylguanine (BG)&#8208;modified phospholipids that form stable covalent linkages with an O6&#8208;methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (SNAP&#8208;tag) fusion protein enables programmable control of protein capture. We show that this methodology can be used to anchor hydrophilic proteins at the lipid&#8208;aqueous interface, concentrating them within an accessible but protected chemical environment. SNAP&#8208;tag technology enables the integration of proteins that regulate complex biological functions in lipid sponge phase droplets, and should facilitate the development of advanced lipid&#8208;based artificial organelles.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Hydrogel Nanoparticles: Synthetic Antibodies for Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecularly imprinted polymer hydrogel nanoparticles have great potential as materials of the future in nanomedicine. We show that these synthetic antibodies can compete seriously with their biological counterparts for immunostaining of cell glycans and protein biomarkers, for targeted drug delivery, and as therapeutic agents for inhibiting cancer cell proliferation.







Abstract
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide and according to the World Health Organization (WHO) accounted for 10 million deaths in 2020. Promising theranostic (therapy and diagnostic) agents in the treatment of cancer are nanomaterials, which have come to the forefront because of their small size approaching those of protein complexes in the human body, and of their easy functionalization giving access to nanocomposite materials with diverse functions (fluorescence, magnetic, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, etc.), and improved biocompatibility. Among them, affinity nanoparticles, often decorated with highly specific targeting ligands such as antibodies, aptamers, lectins and peptides, have enabled enhanced binding and exquisite recognition of biomarkers overexpressed in cancer cells. In this review, we describe an emerging class of targeting ligands, molecularly imprinted polymer hydrogel nanoparticles for their application in the early detection of disease, with the aim to improve diagnosis and treatment.

         <title>Prebiotic Membranes and Micelles Do Not Inhibit Peptide Formation During Dehydration</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dried dispersions of decanoic acid vesicles produce stacks of membranes. In the presence of the dried membranes, serine&#8208;ethyl&#8208;esters are converted into dipeptides at a rate that is at least as fast as in the absence of membranes. Our results enhance the plausibility that protocells (which would have colocalized membranes, RNA, and peptides) could have developed in evaporating environments on the prebiotic Earth.







Abstract
Cycles of dehydration and rehydration could have enabled formation of peptides and RNA in otherwise unfavorable conditions on the early Earth. Development of the first protocells would have hinged upon colocalization of these biopolymers with fatty acid membranes. Using atomic force microscopy, we find that a prebiotic fatty acid (decanoic acid) forms stacks of membranes after dehydration. Using LC&#8208;MS&#8208;MS (liquid chromatography&#8208;tandem mass spectrometry) with isotope internal standards, we measure the rate of formation of serine dipeptides. We find that dipeptides form during dehydration at moderate temperatures (55&#8201;&#176;C) at least as fast in the presence of decanoic acid membranes as in the absence of membranes. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that protocells could have formed within evaporating environments on the early Earth.

         <title>Fluorobenzene Nucleobase Analogues for Triplex&#8208;Forming Peptide Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,4&#8208;Difluorobenzene as a nonpolar isosteric analogue of uridine nucleobase in peptide nucleic acid forms a Hoogsteen base triplet with adenosine&#8208;uridine base pair in double helical RNA. The stability and selectivity of modified triplets suggest that 2,4&#8208;difluorobenzene uses fluorine and C&#8722;H groups in non&#8208;canonical hydrogen bonding similar to natural uridine&#8208;adenosine&#8208;uridine base triplets.







Abstract
2,4&#8208;Difluorotoluene is a nonpolar isostere of thymidine that has been used as a powerful mechanistic probe to study the role of hydrogen bonding in nucleic acid recognition and interactions with polymerases. In the present study, we evaluated five fluorinated benzenes as nucleobase analogues in peptide nucleic acids designed for triple helical recognition of double helical RNA. We found that analogues having para and ortho fluorine substitution patterns (as in 2,4&#8208;difluorotoluene) selectively stabilized Hoogsteen triplets with U&#8722;A base pairs. The results were consistent with attractive electrostatic interactions akin to non&#8208;canonical F to H&#8722;N and C&#8722;H to N hydrogen bonding. The fluorinated nucleobases were not able to stabilize Hoogsteen&#8208;like triplets with pyrimidines in either G&#8722;C or A&#8722;U base pairs. Our results illustrate the ability of fluorine to engage in non&#8208;canonical base pairing and provide insights into triple helical recognition of RNA.

We found that analogues having &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; fluorine substitution patterns (as in 2,4-difluorotoluene) selectively stabilized Hoogsteen triplets with U&#8722;A base pairs. The results were consistent with attractive electrostatic interactions akin to non-canonical F to H&#8722;N and C&#8722;H to N hydrogen bonding. The fluorinated nucleobases were not able to stabilize Hoogsteen-like triplets with pyrimidines in either G&#8722;C or A&#8722;U base pairs. Our results illustrate the ability of fluorine to engage in non-canonical base pairing and provide insights into triple helical recognition of RNA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Twelve novel hybridized 4&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)quinolines (6&#8211;8), were synthesized at 77&#8211;95&#8201;% yields by a regioselective copper&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), and characterized by NMR spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) analysis. Subsequently, photophysical properties, BSA&#8208; and HSA&#8208;binding experiments, and molecular docking studies for the new series 6&#8211;8 were performed. These are discussed, and compared with similar compounds from recent research.

The synthesis, structural analysis, and evaluation of the photophysical properties of twelve novel 2&#8208;aryl(heteroaryl)&#8208;6&#8208;(4&#8208;alkyl(aryl)&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)quinolines (6&#8208;8), where aryl(heteroaryl)=Ph, 4&#8208;Me&#8208;C6H4, 4&#8208;F&#8208;C6H4 and 2&#8208; furyl; 4&#8208;alkyl(aryl)=&#8722;CH2OH, &#8722;(CH2)5CH3 and Ph, are reported. Hybrid scaffolds 6&#8211;8 were synthesized at 77&#8211;95&#8201;% yields by regioselective copper&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction of unpublished 6&#8208;azido&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)quinolines (2) with selected terminal alkynes (3&#8211;5). Azido intermediates 2 were obtained from the reaction of 6&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)quinolines (1) and sodium azide at good yields (78&#8211;87&#8201;%). Compounds 6&#8211;8 were structurally fully characterized by 1H&#8722;, 13C&#8722; and 19F&#8722; and 1H&#8722;13C 2D&#8208;NMR (HSQC, HMBC) spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) and HRMS analysis. Moreover, the photophysical properties, DNA&#8208; and HSA&#8208;binding experiments (bio&#8208;interactions), and molecular docking studies for compounds 6&#8211;8 were performed. These are discussed and compared with similar compounds from recent research.

         <title>A Conformationally Stable Acyclic &#946;&#8208;Hairpin Scaffold Tolerating the Incorporation of Poorly &#946;&#8208;Sheet&#8208;Prone Amino Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

Open but tight: Combining the d&#8208;Pro&#8208;l&#8208;Pro type II&#8242; &#946;&#8208;turn motif with cross&#8208;strand Trp/Lys(Arg) interactions leads to a conformationally and thermally highly stable &#946;&#8208;hairpin that is not sensitive to the type of residues occupying the upper face. This &#946;&#8208;hairpin scaffold is suited to accommodate a variety of amino acids, including poorly &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;prone ones, and it does not require backbone cyclization







Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;hairpin is a structural element of native proteins, but it is also a useful artificial scaffold for finding lead compounds to convert into peptidomimetics or non&#8208;peptide structures for drug discovery. Since linear peptides are synthetically more easily accessible than cyclic ones, but are structurally less well&#8208;defined, we propose XWXWXpPXK(/R)X(R) as an acyclic but still rigid &#946;&#8208;hairpin scaffold that is robust enough to accommodate different types of side chains, regardless of the secondary&#8208;structure propensity of the X residues. The high conformational stability of the scaffold results from tight contacts between cross&#8208;strand cationic and aromatic side chains, combined with the strong tendency of the d&#8208;Pro&#8208;l&#8208;Pro dipeptide to induce a type II&#8242; &#946;&#8208;turn. To demonstrate the robustness of the scaffold, we elucidated the NMR structures and performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a series of peptides displaying mainly non&#8208;&#946;&#8208;branched, poorly &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;prone residues at the X positions. Both the NMR and MD data confirm that our acyclic &#946;&#8208;hairpin scaffold is highly versatile as regards the amino&#8208;acid composition of the &#946;&#8208;sheet face opposite to the cationic&#8722;aromatic one.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;enzyme Cascade for the Biosynthesis of AICA Ribonucleoside Di&#8208; and Triphosphate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of AICA (5&#8242;&#8208;aminoimidazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxamide) nucleotides, the pharmaceutically active metabolites of AICA based drugs, was explored in this study. In an enzymatic cascade, a phosphoribosyl transferase is combined with two different polyphosphate kinases to selectively produce AICA ribonucleoside di&#8208; or triphosphate, respectively.







Abstract
AICA (5&#8242;&#8208;aminoimidazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxamide) ribonucleotides with different phosphorylation levels are the pharmaceutically active metabolites of AICA nucleoside&#8208;based drugs. The chemical synthesis of AICA ribonucleotides with defined phosphorylation is challenging and expensive. In this study, we describe two enzymatic cascades to synthesize AICA derivatives with defined phosphorylation levels from the corresponding nucleobase and the co&#8208;substrate phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate. The cascades are composed of an adenine phosphoribosyltransferase from Escherichia coli (EcAPT) and different polyphosphate kinases: polyphosphate kinase from Acinetobacter johnsonii (AjPPK), and polyphosphate kinase from Meiothermus ruber (MrPPK). The role of the EcAPT is to bind the nucleobase to the sugar moiety, while the kinases are responsible for further phosphorylation of the nucleotide to produce the desired phosphorylated AICA ribonucleotide. The selected enzymes were characterized, and conditions were established for two enzymatic cascades. The diphosphorylated AICA ribonucleotide derivative ZDP, synthesized from the cascade EcAPT/AjPPK, was produced with a conversion up to 91&#8201;%. The EcAPT/MrPPK cascade yielded ZTP with conversion up to 65&#8201;% with ZDP as a side product.

         <title>Exploring Dihydroflavonol&#8208;4&#8208;Reductase Reactivity and Selectivity by QM/MM&#8208;MD Simulations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dihydroflavonol&#8208;4&#8208;reductase catalysis of dihydroflavonols into leucoanthocyanidins is promoted by access to near&#8208;attack conformers (NAC) by lowering the activation barrier (&#9653;G&#8800;). The frequency of sampling of these metastable pre&#8208;reactive states is an important factor influencing DFR selectivity, which reduces the dihydroquercetin substrate faster than dihydrokaempferol.







Abstract
Flavonoids are secondary metabolites ubiquitously found in plants. Their antioxidant properties make them highly interesting natural compounds for use in pharmacology. Therefore, unravelling the mechanisms of flavonoid biosynthesis is an important challenge. Among all the enzymes involved in this biosynthetic pathway, dihydroflavonol&#8208;4&#8208;reductase (DFR) plays a key role in the production of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins. Here, we provide new information on the mechanism of action of this enzyme by using QM/MM&#8208;MD simulations applied to both dihydroquercetin (DHQ) and dihydrokaempferol (DHK) substrates.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dihydroflavonol-4-reductase&lt;/b&gt; catalysis of dihydroflavonols into leucoanthocyanidins is promoted by access to near-attack conformers (NAC) by lowering the activation barrier (&#9653;G&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt;). The frequency of sampling of these metastable pre-reactive states is an important factor influencing DFR selectivity, which reduces the dihydroquercetin substrate faster than dihydrokaempferol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flavonoids are secondary metabolites ubiquitously found in plants. Their antioxidant properties make them highly interesting natural compounds for use in pharmacology. Therefore, unravelling the mechanisms of flavonoid biosynthesis is an important challenge. Among all the enzymes involved in this biosynthetic pathway, dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (DFR) plays a key role in the production of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins. Here, we provide new information on the mechanism of action of this enzyme by using QM/MM-MD simulations applied to both dihydroquercetin (DHQ) and dihydrokaempferol (DHK) substrates. The consideration of these very similar compounds shed light on the major role played by the enzyme on the stabilization of the transition state but also on the activation of the substrate before the reaction through near-attack conformer effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

One scaffold &#8211; different organelle sensors: The structure&#8208;organelle relationship (SOR) of an important synthetic intermediate targeting the nucleus and its transformation into other pH&#8208;activable fluorescent probes is demonstrated. The fluorescent probes were synthesized using a single synthetic route. As shown in the cover picture, the assembly line illustrates that a common synthetic intermediate (rectangle shape) was transformed into another molecule (triangle or hexagonal shape) in a one&#8208;step reaction to target specific cell organelles in live microglial cells. The common intermediate targets the cell nucleus, the cationic probe targets mitochondria, whereas the amine&#8208;containing probe with pH&#8208;activable property targets acidic lysosomes. The graphic was created by Ryann Davis. More information can be found in the Communication by G. Chopra et&#8197;al.

The three nitrogenase isoenzymes: The molybdenum (Mo) nitrogenase, the vanadium (V) nitrogenase and the iron (Fe)&#8208;only nitrogenase, here depicted as superheroes, have a unique spectrum of activities for the reduction of molecular nitrogen (N2), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The cover feature (created by Ehmad Chehrghani Bozcheloe) summarizes this minireview: the Mo nitrogenase has the highest activity for the reduction of molecular nitrogen (N2), the V nitrogenase for the reduction of CO and the Fe&#8208;only nitrogenase for the reduction of CO2.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Free Multi&#8208;Enzyme Synthesis and Purification of Uridine Diphosphate Galactose</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic platform was developed for the synthesis of UDP&#8208;Gal from low&#8208;cost and readily available precursors. The overall process was optimized for efficiency by bypassing time&#8208;consuming and expensive enzyme purification steps followed by a scale&#8208;up into a 1&#8197;L bioreactor. Here, within 23&#8197;h, a total of 23.4&#8197;g/L of UDP&#8208;galactose were produced. Costs for substrates per gram of UDP&#8208;Gal synthesized were 0.26&#8197;&#8364;/g.







Abstract
High costs and low availability of UDP&#8208;galactose hampers the enzymatic synthesis of valuable oligosaccharides such as human milk oligosaccharides. Here, we report the development of a platform for the scalable, biocatalytic synthesis and purification of UDP&#8208;galactose. UDP&#8208;galactose was produced with a titer of 48&#8197;mM (27.2&#8197;g/L) in a small&#8208;scale batch process (200&#8197;&#956;L) within 24&#8197;h using 0.02 genzyme/gproduct. Through in&#8208;situ ATP regeneration, the amount of ATP (0.6&#8197;mM) supplemented was around 240&#8208;fold lower than the stoichiometric equivalent required to achieve the final product yield. Chromatographic purification using porous graphic carbon adsorbent yielded UDP&#8208;galactose with a purity of 92&#8201;%. The synthesis was transferred to 1&#8197;L preparative scale production in a stirred tank bioreactor. To further reduce the synthesis costs here, the supernatant of cell lysates was used bypassing expensive purification of enzymes. Here, 23.4&#8197;g/L UDP&#8208;galactose were produced within 23&#8197;h with a synthesis yield of 71&#8201;% and a biocatalyst load of 0.05 gtotal_protein/gproduct. The costs for substrates per gram of UDP&#8208;galactose synthesized were around 0.26&#8197;&#8364;/g.

         <title>Modeling&#8208;Assisted Design of Thermostable Benzaldehyde Lyases from Rhodococcus erythropolis for Continuous Production of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Ketones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The right tool can do the trick: A novel thermostable benzaldehyde lyase from Rhodococcus erythropolis was identified using the computer&#8208;assisted prediction tool Tome, and two variants with altered active sites were constructed based on homology models. All new enzyme variants showed significantly increased thermostability compared with the only experimentally confirmed benzaldehyde lyase from Pseudomonas fluorescens to date. The enzyme variants showed different substrate specificities and different activities in the presence of a range of co&#8208;solvents. The most stable variant was then immobilized and used for continuous production of enantiopure benzoin. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K.&#8197;S. Rabe et&#8197;al.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The soluble methane monooxygenase receives electrons from NADH via its reductase MmoC for oxidation of methane, which is itself an attractive C1 building block for a future bioeconomy. Herein, we present the biochemical and spectroscopic insights into the reductase from the marine  Methylomonas methanica  MC09. The presence of a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and [2Fe2S] cluster as its prosthetic group were revealed by reconstitution experiments, iron determination and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. As a true halo&#8208;tolerant enzyme, MmoC still showed 50% of its specific activity at 2 M NaCl. We showed, that the MmoC produced only trace amounts of superoxide, but mainly hydrogen peroxide during uncoupled turnover reactions. The characterization of a highly active reductase is an important step for a future biotechnological application of a halo&#8208;tolerant sMMO.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of amino acid substitutions on 70S ribosomal binding, cellular uptake, and antimicrobial activity of oncocin Onc112</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proline&#8208;rich antimicrobial peptides (PrAMPs) are promising candidates for the treatment of infections caused by high&#8208;priority human pathogens. Their mode of action consists of (I) passive diffusion across the outer membrane, (II) active transport through the inner membrane, and (III) inhibition of protein biosynthesis by blocking the exit tunnel of the 70S ribosome. We tested whether  in vitro  data on ribosomal binding and bacterial uptake could predict the antibacterial activity of PrAMPs against Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Ribosomal binding and bacterial uptake rates were measured for 47 derivatives of PrAMP Onc112 and compared to the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of each peptide. Ribosomal binding was evaluated for ribosome extracts from four Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Bacterial uptake was assessed by quantifying each peptide in the medium supernatants of bacterial cultures. Oncocin analogs with a higher net positive charge appeared to be more active, although their ribosome binding and uptake rates were not necessarily better than for Onc112. The data suggests a complex mode of action influenced by further factors improving or reducing the antibacterial activity, including diffusion through membranes, transport mechanism, secondary targets, off&#8208;target binding, intracellular distribution, and membrane effects. Relying only on  in vitro  binding and uptake data may not be sufficient for the rational development of more active analogs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Enzyme Stringency Masks the Multispecificity of a Lyngbyatoxin (Indolactam Alkaloid) Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indolactam alkaloids are potentially valuable molecular tools for modulating the activity of protein kinase C. In an attempt to generate novel lyngbyatoxin (LTX) variants, we mutated the A&#8208;domain of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase, LtxA, in an engineered E.&#8197;coli strain expressing the cyanobacterial LTX pathway. The mutations resulted in the differential production of valine&#8208;, isoleucine&#8208;, and leucine&#8208;derived pathway products.







Abstract
Indolactam alkaloids are activators of protein kinase C (PKC) and are of pharmacological interest for the treatment of pathologies involving PKC dysregulation. The marine cyanobacterial nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) pathway for lyngbyatoxin biosynthesis, which we previously expressed in E.&#8197;coli, was studied for its amenability towards the biosynthesis of indolactam variants. Modification of culture conditions for our E.&#8197;coli heterologous expression host and analysis of pathway products suggested the native lyngbyatoxin pathway NRPS does possess a degree of relaxed specificity. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of two positions within the adenylation domain (A&#8208;domain) substrate&#8208;binding pocket was performed, resulting in an alteration of substrate preference between valine, isoleucine, and leucine. We observed relative congruence of in&#8197;vitro substrate activation by the LtxA NRPS to in&#8197;vivo product formation. While there was a preference for isoleucine over leucine, the substitution of alternative tailoring domains may unveil the true in&#8197;vivo effects of the mutations introduced herein.

         <title>Substrate Enolate Intermediate and Mimic Captured in the Active Site of Streptomyces coelicolor Methylmalonyl&#8208;CoA Epimerase**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising route to novel polyketides is through malonyl&#8208;CoA synthetases generating non&#8208;natural extender units. Yet, synthetases make extenders with (2R) stereocenters and polyketide synthases accept (2S). Engineered methylmalonyl&#8208;CoA epimerases can overcome this incompatibility. Here we solve structures of methylmalonyl&#8208;CoA epimerase to examine the catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity determinants and find some unexpected interactions.







Abstract
Methylmalonyl&#8208;CoA epimerase (MMCE) is proposed to use general acid&#8208;base catalysis, but the proposed catalytic glutamic acids are highly asymmetrical in the active site unlike many other racemases. To gain insight into the puzzling relationships between catalytic mechanism, structure, and substrate preference, we solved Streptomyces coelicolor MMCE structures with substrate or 2&#8208;nitropropionyl&#8208;CoA, an intermediate/transition state analogue. Both ligand bound structures have a planar methylmalonate/2&#8208;nitropropionyl moiety indicating a deprotonated C2 with &#8805;4&#8197;&#197; distances to either catalytic acid. Both glutamates interact with the carboxylate/nitro group, either directly or through other residues. This suggests the proposed catalytic acids sequentially catalyze proton shifts between C2 and carboxylate of the substrate with an enolate intermediate. In addition, our structures provide a platform to design mutations for expanding substrate scope to support combinatorial biosynthesis.

         <title>The Catalytic Mechanism of Pdx2 Glutaminase Driven by a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu Triad: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 was studied with atomic detail employing the computational ONIOM hybrid QM/MM methodology. The results show that the catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 occurs in six steps that can be divided into four stages. These results can be used for the synthesis of new transition state analogue inhibitors capable of inhibiting Pdx2 and impair diseases like Malaria and Tuberculosis.







Abstract
The catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 was studied with atomic detail employing the computational ONIOM hybrid QM/MM methodology. Pdx2 employs a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu catalytic triad to deaminate glutamine to glutamate and ammonia &#8211; the source of the nitrogen of pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP). This enzyme is, therefore, a rate&#8208;limiting step in the PLP biosynthetic pathway of Malaria and Tuberculosis pathogens that rely on this mechanism to obtain PLP. For this reason, Pdx2 is considered a novel and promising drug target to treat these diseases. The results obtained show that the catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 occurs in six steps that can be divided into four stages: (i)&#8197;activation of Cys87, (ii)&#8197;deamination of glutamine with the formation of the glutamyl&#8208;thioester intermediate, (iii)&#8197;hydrolysis of the formed intermediate, and (iv)&#8197;enzymatic turnover. The kinetic data available in the literature (19.1&#8211;19.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) agree very well with the calculated free energy barrier of the hydrolytic step (18.2&#8197;kcal.mol&#8722;11), which is the rate&#8208;limiting step of the catalytic process when substrate is readily available in the active site. This catalytic mechanism differs from other known amidases in three main points: i)&#8197;it requires the activation of the nucleophile Cys87 to a thiolate; ii)&#8197;the hydrolysis occurs in a single step and therefore does not require the formation of a second tetrahedral reaction intermediate, as it is proposed, and iii) Glu198 does not have a direct role in the catalytic process. Together, these results can be used for the synthesis of new transition state analogue inhibitors capable of inhibiting Pdx2 and impair diseases like Malaria and Tuberculosis.

         <title>Novel Quinic Acid Glycerates from Tussilago farfara Inhibit Polypeptide GalNAc&#8208;Transferase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of quinic acid&#8208;caffeic acid conjugate isolated from T.&#8197;farfara, was found to inhibit the activity of GalNAc&#8208;T2.







Abstract
The discovery of a bioactive inhibitor tool for human polypeptide N&#8208;acetylgalactosaminyl transferases (GalNAc&#8208;Ts), the initiating enzyme for mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;glycosylation, remains challenging. In the present study, we identified an array of quinic acid derivatives, including four new glycerates (1&#8211;4) from Tussilago farfara, a traditional Chinese medicinal plant, as active inhibitors of GalNAc&#8208;T2 using a combined screening approach with a cell&#8208;based T2&#8208;specific sensor and purified enzyme assay. These inhibitors dose&#8208;dependently inhibited human GalNAc&#8208;T2 but did not affect O&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), the other type of glycosyltransferase. Importantly, they are not cytotoxic and retain inhibitory activity in cells lacking elongated O&#8208;glycans, which are eliminated by the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tool. A structure&#8208;activity relationship study unveiled a novel quinic acid&#8208;caffeic acid conjugate pharmacophore that directs inhibition. Overall, these new natural product inhibitors could serve as a basis for developing an inhibitor tool for GalNAc&#8208;T2.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A novel class&lt;/b&gt; of quinic acid-caffeic acid conjugate isolated from &lt;i&gt;T.&#8197;farfara&lt;/i&gt;, was found to inhibit the activity of GalNAc-T2.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of a bioactive inhibitor tool for human polypeptide &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylgalactosaminyl transferases (GalNAc-Ts), the initiating enzyme for mucin-type &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glycosylation, remains challenging. In the present study, we identified an array of quinic acid derivatives, including four new glycerates (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) from &lt;i&gt;Tussilago farfara&lt;/i&gt;, a traditional Chinese medicinal plant, as active inhibitors of GalNAc-T2 using a combined screening approach with a cell-based T2-specific sensor and purified enzyme assay. These inhibitors dose-dependently inhibited human GalNAc-T2 but did not affect &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-linked &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), the other type of glycosyltransferase. Importantly, they are not cytotoxic and retain inhibitory activity in cells lacking elongated &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glycans, which are eliminated by the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tool. A structure-activity relationship study unveiled a novel quinic acid-caffeic acid conjugate pharmacophore that directs inhibition. Overall, these new natural product inhibitors could serve as a basis for developing an inhibitor tool for GalNAc-T2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Specialized Dehydrogenase Provides l&#8208;Phenyllactate for FR900359 Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dehydrogenase FrsC is involved in biosynthesis of the Gq protein inhibiting natural product FR900359. Here, we biochemically characterized FrsC, catalyzing the formation of l&#8208;phenyllactate, and its subsequent incorporation into the FR assembly line followed by epimerization. A detailed bioinformatic analysis revealed that FrsC has evolved from primary metabolic enzymes to a specialized reductase accepting only aromatic substrates.







Abstract
d&#8208;Phenyllactate (PLA) is a component of the selective Gq protein inhibitor and nonribosomal cyclic depsipeptide FR900359 (FR). Here we report a detailed biochemical investigation of PLA biosynthesis and its incorporation into the natural product FR. The enzyme FrsC, member of the lactate/malate dehydrogenase superfamily, was shown to catalyze the formation of l&#8208;PLA from phenylpyruvate. FrsC was kinetically characterized and its substrate specificity determined. Incorporation of l&#8208;PLA was probed by assaying the adenylation domain FrsE&#8208;A3 and feeding studies with a Chromobacterium vaccinii &#916;frsC mutant, confirming preferred activation of l&#8208;PLA followed by on&#8208;line epimerization to d&#8208;PLA. Finally, detailed bioinformatic analyses of FrsC revealed its close relation to malate dehydrogenases from primary metabolism and suggest extensions in the substrate binding loop to be responsible for its adaptation to accepting larger aromatic substrates with high specificity.

         <title>Ni2+ Catalyzed Cleavage of TrpLE&#8208;Fused Small Transmembrane Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequence&#8208;specific nickel&#8208;assisted cleavage (SNAC) of TrpLE&#8208;fused transmembrane (TM) peptides avoids the usage of toxic cyanogen bromide and produces small TM peptides in a highly efficient way under mild conditions.







Abstract
In addition to a membrane anchor, the transmembrane domain (TMD) of single&#8208;pass transmembrane proteins (SPTMPs) recently has shown essential roles in the cross&#8208;membrane activity or receptor assembly/clustering. However, these small TMD peptides are generally hydrophobic and dynamic, difficult to be expressed and purified. Here, we have integrated the power of TrpLE fusion protein and a sequence&#8208;specific nickel&#8208;assisted cleavage (SNAC)&#8208;tag to produce small TMD peptides in a highly efficient way under mild conditions, which uses Ni2+ as the cleavage reagent, avoiding the usage of toxic cyanogen bromide (CNBr). Furthermore, this method simplifies the downstream protein purification and reconstitution. Two representative TMDs, including the Spike&#8208;TMD from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS2), were successfully produced with high&#8208;quality nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. Therefore, our study provides a more efficient and practical approach for general structural characterization of the small TM proteins.

         <title>Characterization of Structure and Dynamics of the Guanidine&#8208;II Riboswitch from Escherichia coli by NMR Spectroscopy and Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering (SAXS)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gdn&#8208;II riboswitch aptamer from E.&#8197;coli with wild&#8208;type and loop&#8208;mutated constructs were investigated in the context of ligand interactions. Based on NMR spectroscopy and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) data, previous crystal structures were confirmed, and an intermolecular ligand binding mechanism with the P1 loop as interaction interface instead of the postulated (intramolecular) P1&#8208;P2 kissing loop was found.







Abstract
Riboswitches are regulatory RNA elements that undergo functionally important allosteric conformational switching upon binding of specific ligands. The here investigated guanidine&#8208;II riboswitch binds the small cation, guanidinium, and forms a kissing loop&#8208;loop interaction between its P1 and P2 hairpins. We investigated the structural changes to support previous studies regarding the binding mechanism. Using NMR spectroscopy, we confirmed the structure as observed in crystal structures and we characterized the kissing loop interaction upon addition of Mg2+ and ligand for the riboswitch aptamer from Escherichia coli. We further investigated closely related mutant constructs providing further insight into functional differences between the two (different) hairpins P1 and P2. Formation of intermolecular interactions were probed by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and NMR DOSY data. All data are consistent and show the formation of oligomeric states of the riboswitch induced by Mg2+ and ligand binding.

         <title>Sulfation Pattern Dependent Iron(III) Mediated Interleukin&#8208;8 Glycan Binding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of hyaluronan sulfation degree and metal ion on interleukin&#8208;8 binding was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and surface characterizations.







Abstract
Cytokines such as interleukin&#8208;8 activate the immune system during infection and interact with sulfated glycosaminoglycans with specific sulfation patterns. In some cases, these interactions are mediated by metal ion binding which can be used to tune surface&#8208;based glycan&#8208;protein interactions. We evaluated the effect of both hyaluronan sulfation degree and Fe3+ on interleukin&#8208;8 binding by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and surface characterizations. Our results show that sulfation degree and metal ion interactions have a synergistic effect in tuning the electrochemical response of the glycated surfaces to the cytokine.

         <title>Identification and Analysis of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster for the Indolizidine Alkaloid Iminimycin in Streptomyces griseus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic gene cluster for iminimycin, an indolizidine alkaloid with a 6&#8208;5&#8208;3 tricyclic system containing an iminium cation from Streptomyces griseus, was identified. It has 22 genes, including four genes encoding polyketide synthases, which consist of eight modules. Inactivation of seven tailoring enzyme&#8208;encoding genes and structural elucidation of compounds accumulated in the mutants provided important insights into iminimycin biosynthesis.







Abstract
Indolizidine alkaloids, which have versatile bioactivities, are produced by various organisms. Although the biosynthesis of some indolizidine alkaloids has been studied, the enzymatic machinery for their biosynthesis in Streptomyces remains elusive. Here, we report the identification and analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster for iminimycin, an indolizidine alkaloid with a 6&#8208;5&#8208;3 tricyclic system containing an iminium cation from Streptomyces griseus. The gene cluster has 22 genes, including four genes encoding polyketide synthases (PKSs), which consist of eight modules in total. In&#8197;vitro analysis of the first module revealed that its acyltransferase domain selects malonyl&#8208;CoA, although predicted to select methylmalonyl&#8208;CoA. Inactivation of seven tailoring enzyme&#8208;encoding genes and structural elucidation of four compounds accumulated in mutants provided important insights into iminimycin biosynthesis, although some of these compounds appeared to be shunt products. This study expands our knowledge of the biosynthetic machinery of indolizidine alkaloids and the enzymatic chemistry of PKS.

     alt="Identification and Analysis of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster for the Indolizidine Alkaloid Iminimycin in Streptomyces griseus"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The biosynthetic gene&lt;/b&gt; cluster for iminimycin, an indolizidine alkaloid with a 6-5-3 tricyclic system containing an iminium cation from &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces griseus&lt;/i&gt;, was identified. It has 22 genes, including four genes encoding polyketide synthases, which consist of eight modules. Inactivation of seven tailoring enzyme-encoding genes and structural elucidation of compounds accumulated in the mutants provided important insights into iminimycin biosynthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indolizidine alkaloids, which have versatile bioactivities, are produced by various organisms. Although the biosynthesis of some indolizidine alkaloids has been studied, the enzymatic machinery for their biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; remains elusive. Here, we report the identification and analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster for iminimycin, an indolizidine alkaloid with a 6-5-3 tricyclic system containing an iminium cation from &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces griseus&lt;/i&gt;. The gene cluster has 22 genes, including four genes encoding polyketide synthases (PKSs), which consist of eight modules in total. &lt;i&gt;In&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; analysis of the first module revealed that its acyltransferase domain selects malonyl-CoA, although predicted to select methylmalonyl-CoA. Inactivation of seven tailoring enzyme-encoding genes and structural elucidation of four compounds accumulated in mutants provided important insights into iminimycin biosynthesis, although some of these compounds appeared to be shunt products. This study expands our knowledge of the biosynthetic machinery of indolizidine alkaloids and the enzymatic chemistry of PKS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selection of M2+&#8208;independent RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes with Sidechains Mimicking Arginine and Lysine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sequence&#8208;specific cleavage of RNA by nucleic acid catalysts in the absence of a divalent metal cation (M  2+  ) has remained an important goal in biomimicry with potential therapeutic applications. Given the lack of functional group diversity in canonical nucleotides, modified nucleotides with amino acid&#8208;like side chains were used to enhance self&#8208;cleavage rates at a single embedded ribonucleoside site. Previous works relied on three functional groups: an amine, a guanidine and an imidazole ensconced on three different nucleosides. However, to date, few studies have systematically addressed the necessity of all three modifications, as the value of any single modified nucleoside is contextualized at the outset of selection. Herein, we report on the use of only two modified dNTPs, excluding an imidazole, i.e. 5&#8208;(3&#8208;guanidinoallyl)&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;dUTP (dU  ga  TP) and 5&#8208;aminoallyl&#8208;2'&#8208;dCTP (dC  aa  TP), to select  in&#8208;vitro  self&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes that cleave in the absence of M  2+  in a pH&#8208;independent fashion. Cleavage shows biphasic kinetics with rate constants that are significantly higher than in unmodified DNAzymes and compare favorably to certain DNAzymes involving an imidazole. This work is the first report of a M2+&#8208;independent DNAzyme with two cationic modifications; as such it shows appreciable self&#8208;cleaving activity in the absence of an imidazole modification.</dc:description>

         <title>The Small Open Reading Frame&#8208;Encoded Peptides: Advances in Methodologies and Functional Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small open reading frames (sORFs) were historically annotated as noncoding or even junk sequences. Accumulating evidence suggests the existence of sORFs&#8208;encoded peptides (SEPs). Here we discuss the latest advances in methodologies for identifying SEPs with mass spectrometry, as well as the progress on functional studies of SEPs.







Abstract
Small open reading frames (sORFs) are an important class of genes with less than 100 codons. They were historically annotated as noncoding or even junk sequences. In recent years, accumulating evidence suggests that sORFs could encode a considerable number of polypeptides, many of which play important roles in both physiology and disease pathology. However, it has been technically challenging to directly detect sORF&#8208;encoded peptides (SEPs). Here, we discuss the latest advances in methodologies for identifying SEPs with mass spectrometry, as well as the progress on functional studies of SEPs.

         <title>Deep Sequencing of a Systematic Peptide Library Reveals Conformationally&#8208;Constrained Protein Interface Peptides that Disrupt a Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disrupting protein&#8208;protein interactions is difficult due to the large and flat interaction surfaces of the binding partners. We utilized high throughput oligonucleotide synthesis, peptide phage display library construction, affinity selection, and deep sequencing to show a peptide library encompassing a binding partner in a protein&#8208;protein interaction can serve as a source of peptides that mimic the interface and provide a starting point for developing inhibitors that block the interface.







Abstract
Disrupting protein&#8208;protein interactions is difficult due to the large and flat interaction surfaces of the binding partners. The BLIP and BLIP&#8208;II proteins are unrelated in sequence and structure and yet each potently inhibit &#946;&#8208;lactamases. High&#8208;throughput oligonucleotide synthesis was used to construct a 12,470&#8208;member library containing overlapping linear and cyclic peptides ranging in size from 6 to 21 amino acids that scan through the sequences of BLIP and BLIP&#8208;II. Phage display affinity selections and deep sequencing revealed that, despite the differences in interaction surfaces with &#946;&#8208;lactamases, rapid enrichment of consensus peptide regions originating from both BLIP and BLIP&#8208;II contact residues in the binding interface occurred. BLIP and BLIP&#8208;II peptides that were enriched by affinity selection were shown to bind &#946;&#8208;lactamases and disrupt the BLIP/&#946;&#8208;lactamase interaction. The results suggest that peptides that bind at and disrupt PPI interfaces can be identified through systematic peptide library construction, affinity selection, and deep sequencing.

         <title>Incorporation and Utility of a Responsive Ribonucleoside Analogue in Probing the Conformation of a Viral RNA Motif by Fluorescence and 19F NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

Design, synthesis and incorporation of an environment&#8208;sensitive ribonucleoside analogue, which serves as a two&#8208;channel biophysical platform to investigate RNA structure and recognition by fluorescence and 19F NMR spectroscopy techniques are described.







Abstract
Development of versatile probes that can enable the study of different conformations and recognition properties of therapeutic nucleic acid motifs by complementing biophysical techniques can greatly aid nucleic acid analysis and therapy. Here, we report the design, synthesis and incorporation of an environment&#8208;sensitive ribonucleoside analogue, which serves as a two&#8208;channel biophysical platform to investigate RNA structure and recognition by fluorescence and 19F NMR spectroscopy techniques. The nucleoside analogue is based on a 5&#8208;fluorobenzofuran&#8208;uracil core and its fluorescence and 19F NMR chemical shifts are highly sensitive to changes in solvent polarity and viscosity. Notably, the modified ribonucleotide and phosphoramidite substrates can be efficiently incorporated into RNA oligonucleotides (ONs) by in&#8197;vitro transcription and standard solid&#8208;phase ON synthesis protocol, respectively. Fluorescence and 19F readouts of the nucleoside incorporated into model RNA ONs are sensitive to the neighbouring base environment. The responsiveness of the probe was aptly utilized in detecting and quantifying the metal ion&#8208;induced conformational change in an internal ribosome entry site RNA motif of hepatitis C virus, which is an important therapeutic target. Taken together, our probe is a good addition to the nucleic acid analysis toolbox with the advantage that it can be used to study nucleic acid conformation and recognition simultaneously by two biophysical techniques.

         <title>Oligo Pools as an Affordable Source of Synthetic DNA for Cost&#8208;Effective Library Construction in Protein&#8208; and Metabolic Pathway Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of large variant libraries is critical for rational protein engineering, directed evolution, and protein de novo design, but is constrained by the relatively high cost of DNA synthesis. Here, we consolidate methods that allow using array&#8208;synthesized oligo pools as DNA input &#8211; a cheap but error&#8208;prone source of DNA.







Abstract
The construction of custom libraries is critical for rational protein engineering and directed evolution. Array&#8208;synthesized oligo pools of thousands of user&#8208;defined sequences (up to &#8764;350&#8197;bases in length) have emerged as a low&#8208;cost commercially available source of DNA. These pools cost &#8804;10&#8201;% (depending on error rate and length) of other commercial sources of custom DNA, and this significant cost difference can determine whether an enzyme engineering project can be realized on a given research budget. However, while being cheap, oligo pools do suffer from a low concentration of individual oligos and relatively high error rates. Several powerful techniques that specifically make use of oligo pools have been developed and proven valuable or even essential for next&#8208;generation protein and pathway engineering strategies, such as sequence&#8208;function mapping, enzyme minimization, or de&#8208;novo design. Here we consolidate the knowledge on these techniques and their applications to facilitate the use of oligo pools within the protein engineering community.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The construction&lt;/b&gt; of large variant libraries is critical for rational protein engineering, directed evolution, and protein &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; design, but is constrained by the relatively high cost of DNA synthesis. Here, we consolidate methods that allow using array-synthesized oligo pools as DNA input &#8211; a cheap but error-prone source of DNA.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The construction of custom libraries is critical for rational protein engineering and directed evolution. Array-synthesized oligo pools of thousands of user-defined sequences (up to &#8764;350&#8197;bases in length) have emerged as a low-cost commercially available source of DNA. These pools cost &#8804;10&#8201;% (depending on error rate and length) of other commercial sources of custom DNA, and this significant cost difference can determine whether an enzyme engineering project can be realized on a given research budget. However, while being cheap, oligo pools do suffer from a low concentration of individual oligos and relatively high error rates. Several powerful techniques that specifically make use of oligo pools have been developed and proven valuable or even essential for next-generation protein and pathway engineering strategies, such as sequence-function mapping, enzyme minimization, or &lt;i&gt;de-novo&lt;/i&gt; design. Here we consolidate the knowledge on these techniques and their applications to facilitate the use of oligo pools within the protein engineering community.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mammalian Chemical Genomics towards Identifying Targets and Elucidating Modes&#8208;of&#8208;Action of Bioactive Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical genomic screens using shRNA or CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA libraries in mammalian cultured cells play central roles in identifying modes of action of bioactive compounds. In this review, recent advances of chemical genomic approaches in mammalian cultured cells to identify the molecular target, modes of action, and synthetic lethal pathways of compounds of interest, with a focus on recent examples including our results are discussed.







Abstract
The step of identifying target molecules and elucidating the mode of action of bioactive compounds is a major bottleneck for drug discovery from phenotypic screening. Genetic screening for genes that affect drug sensitivity or phenotypes of mammalian cultured cells is a powerful tool to obtain clues to their modes of action. Chemical genomic screening systems for comprehensively identifying such genes or genetic pathways have been established using shRNA libraries for RNA interference&#8208;mediated mRNA knockdown or sgRNA libraries for CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated gene knockout. The combination of chemical genomic screening in mammalian cells with other approaches such as biochemical searches for target molecules, phenotypic profiling, and yeast genetics provides a systematic way to elucidate the mode of action by converging various pieces of information regarding target molecules, target pathways, and synthetic lethal pathways.

         <title>Quantitative Standards of 4&#8208;O acetyl and 9&#8208;O acetyl N&#8208;acetyl Neuraminic Acid for the Analysis of Plasma and Serum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;Acetyl neuraminic acid (sialic acid, Neu5Ac) is one of a large, diverse family of nine&#8208;carbon monosaccharides that play roles in many biological functions such as immune response. Neu5Ac has previously been identified as a potential biomarker for the presence and pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and cancer. More recent research has highlighted acetylated sialic acid derivatives specifically Neu5,9Ac 2 as biomarkers for oral and breast cancers, but advances in analysis have been hampered due to a lack of commercially available quantitative standards. We report here the synthesis of 9&#8208; O &#8208;acetyl and 4&#8208; O &#8208;acetyl sialic acids (Neu5,9Ac 2 and Neu4,5Ac 2 ) with optimisation of previously reported synthetic routes. Neu5,9Ac 2 was synthesised in 1 step in 68% yield. Neu4,5Ac 2 was synthesised in 4 steps in 39% overall yield. Synthesis was followed by analysis of these standards via quantitative NMR (QNMR). Their utilisation for the identification and quantification of specific acetylated sialic acid derivatives in biological samples is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>The Application of Biocatalysis in the Preparation and Resolution of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Adducts and Their Derivatives</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction is an important carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reaction in organic synthesis. A new stereogenic centre is created in this reaction and much effort has been invested over the years into finding methods for the preparation of enantiomerically pure or enantiomerically enriched Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman products. In this review, the contribution of biocatalysis towards achieving this goal is discussed.







Abstract
The Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction affords highly functionalised allylic alcohols containing a new stereogenic centre. These MBH adducts are very versatile and have been transformed into a large range of products, some of which have medicinal potential. Several examples of asymmetric syntheses of MBH adducts have been reported, although a generally applicable method remains to be developed. Biocatalytic approaches for the synthesis and enzymatic kinetic resolution of MBH adducts have been reported, and are discussed in detail in this review. Enzymes able to catalyse the asymmetric MBH reaction have been identified, but selectivity and efficiency have generally been low. Lipases, esterases and nitrile&#8208;converting enzymes have all been successfully applied in the resolution of MBH adducts, with excellent selectivity being realised in most cases.

         <title>Selective Capture of Anti&#8208;N&#8208;glucosylated NTHi Adhesin Peptide Antibodies by a Multivalent Dextran Conjugate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dextran&#8208;based tentacles were decorated with peptide antigens as a way to increase the ability to capture circulating IgM antibodies in multiple sclerosis patient sera as disease biomarkers. A novel peptide&#8208;dextran conjugate bearing multiple copies of a selected epitope of the non&#8208;typeable Haemophilus Influenzae adhesin protein was synthesis and characterized. Immunological experiments provide the proof&#8208;of concept for the identification and capture of specific IgM antibodies in patient sera.







Abstract
Tentacle&#8208;like polymers decorated with several copies of peptide antigens can be interesting tools for increasing the ability to capture circulating antibodies in patient sera, using cooperative effects for stronger avidity. We previously showed that antibodies from multiple sclerosis (MS) patient sera preferentially recognize hyperglucosylated adhesin protein HMW1ct of non&#8208;typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). We selected the C&#8208;terminal HMW1ct(1347&#8211;1354) minimal epitope and prepared the diglucosylated analogue Ac&#8208;KAN(Glc)VTLN(Glc)TTG&#8208;K(N3)&#8208;NH2 to graft a 40&#8197;kDa dextran scaffold modified with glycidyl&#8208;propargyl moieties to perform a copper catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide coupling reaction (CuAAC). Quantitative NMR measurements allowed the characterization of the peptide loading (19.5&#8201;%) on the multivalent dextran conjugate. This novel polymeric structure displayed optimal capturing properties of both IgG and, more interestingly, IgM antibodies in MS sera. Specific antibodies from a representative MS serum, were successfully depleted using a Sepharose resin bearing the new glucosylated multivalent conjugate, as confirmed by ELISA. These results may offer a promising proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the selective purification of high affinity autoantibodies from sera of autoimmune patients, in general, and of specific high affinity antibodies against a minimally glcosylated epitope Asn(Glc) from sera of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, in particular.

         <title>Targeting the Central Pocket of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Lectin LecA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ligand binding pocket for additional pharmacophores in inhibitors of the bacterial lectin and virulence factor LecA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified and successfully targeted, using a suite of modelling, chemical synthesis, and biophysical analyses. The crystal structure of LecA with one ligand targeting this central pocket was solved, and validated the concept.







Abstract
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic ESKAPE pathogen that produces two lectins, LecA and LecB, as part of its large arsenal of virulence factors. Both carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins are central to the initial and later persistent infection processes, i.&#8201;e. bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. The biofilm matrix is a major resistance determinant and protects the bacteria against external threats such as the host immune system or antibiotic treatment. Therefore, the development of drugs against the P. aeruginosa biofilm is of particular interest to restore efficacy of antimicrobials. Carbohydrate&#8208;based inhibitors for LecA and LecB were previously shown to efficiently reduce biofilm formations. Here, we report a new approach for inhibiting LecA with synthetic molecules bridging the established carbohydrate&#8208;binding site and a central cavity located between two LecA protomers of the lectin tetramer. Inspired by in silico design, we synthesized various galactosidic LecA inhibitors with aromatic moieties targeting this central pocket. These compounds reached low micromolar affinities, validated in different biophysical assays. Finally, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed the interactions of this compound class with LecA. This new mode of action paves the way to a novel route towards inhibition of P. aeruginosa biofilms.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; is an opportunistic ESKAPE pathogen that produces two lectins, LecA and LecB, as part of its large arsenal of virulence factors. Both carbohydrate-binding proteins are central to the initial and later persistent infection processes, i.&#8201;e. bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. The biofilm matrix is a major resistance determinant and protects the bacteria against external threats such as the host immune system or antibiotic treatment. Therefore, the development of drugs against the &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; biofilm is of particular interest to restore efficacy of antimicrobials. Carbohydrate-based inhibitors for LecA and LecB were previously shown to efficiently reduce biofilm formations. Here, we report a new approach for inhibiting LecA with synthetic molecules bridging the established carbohydrate-binding site and a central cavity located between two LecA protomers of the lectin tetramer. Inspired by &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; design, we synthesized various galactosidic LecA inhibitors with aromatic moieties targeting this central pocket. These compounds reached low micromolar affinities, validated in different biophysical assays. Finally, X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the interactions of this compound class with LecA. This new mode of action paves the way to a novel route towards inhibition of &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; biofilms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymerase Synthesis of DNA Containing Iodinated Pyrimidine or 7&#8208;Deazapurine Nucleobases and Their Post&#8208;synthetic Modifications through the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodinated pyrimidine or 7&#8208;deazapurine 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates were found to be excellent substrates for DNA polymerases in enzymatic construction of oligonucleotide (ONs) or DNA containing iodinated nucleobases. The post&#8208;synthetic modifications through Suzuki cross&#8208;couplings worked in the terminal positions or single&#8208;stranded ONs but not in internal positions of double&#8208;stranded DNA.







Abstract
All four iodinated 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) derived from 5&#8208;iodouracil, 5&#8208;iodocytosine, 7&#8208;iodo&#8208;7&#8208;deazaadenine and 7&#8208;iodo&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine were prepared and studied as substrates for KOD XL DNA polymerase. All of the nucleotides were readily incorporated by primer extension and by PCR amplification to form DNA containing iodinated nucleobases. Systematic study of the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions with two bulkier arylboronic acids revealed that the 5&#8208;iodopyrimidines were more reactive and gave cross&#8208;coupling products both in the terminal or internal position in single&#8208;stranded oligonucleotides (ssONs) and in the terminal position of double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA), whereas the 7&#8208;iodo&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurines were less reactive and gave cross&#8208;coupling products only in the terminal position. None of the four iodinated bases reacted in an internal position of dsDNA. These findings are useful for the use of the iodinated nucleobases for post&#8208;synthetic modification of DNA with functional groups for various applications.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive and Reversible Nanoassemblies of G&#8208;Triplexes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible dimeric G&#8208;triplex nanoassemblies were developed using a ligand &#8211; an alkaloid of sanguinarine &#8211; as &#8216;glue&#8217;. The glue's adhesivity can be dynamically tuned by prevalent factors including pH, sulfite, O2 and H2O2, to efficiently regulate the G&#8208;triplex nanoassemblies. However, the G&#8208;quadruplex counterpart does not respond to give nanoassemblies. Our work provides new perspectives in developing G&#8208;triplex&#8208;based nanodevices.







Abstract
G&#8208;triplex (G3) structures formed with three consecutive G&#8208;tracts have recently been identified as a new emerging guanine&#8208;rich DNA fold. There could likely be a wide range of biological functions for G3s as occurring for G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures formed with four consecutive G&#8208;tracts. However, in comparison to the many reports on G4 nanoassemblies that organize monomers together in a controllable manner, G3&#8208;favored nanoassemblies have yet to be explored. In this work, we found that a natural alkaloid of sanguinarine can serve as a dynamic ligand glue to reversibly switch the dimeric nanoassemblies of the thrombin binding aptamer G3 (TBA&#8208;G3). The glue planarity was considered to be a crucial factor for realizing this switching. More importantly, external stimuli including pH, sulfite, O2 and H2O2 can be employed as common regulators to easily modulate the glue's adhesivity for constructing and destructing the G3 nanoassemblies as a result of the ligand converting between isoforms. However, this assembly behavior does not occur with the counterpart TBA&#8208;G4. Our work demonstrates that higher&#8208;order G3 nanoassemblies can be reversibly operated by manipulating ligand adhesivity. This provides an alternative understanding of the unique behavior of guanine&#8208;rich sequences and focuses attention on the G3 fold since the nanoassembly event investigated herein might occur in living cells.

         <title>Galacto&#8208;Oligosaccharide Supplementation Modulates Pathogen&#8208;Commensal Competition between Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus salivarius</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of the infant microbiome and how the microbiota is affected by feeding choice has recently gained interest. We designed a two&#8208;species microbiome in which a pathogen, Streptococcus agalactiae, is cultured with a commensal, Streptococcus salivarius. We discovered that the common infant formula supplement, galacto&#8208;oligosaccharides are able to reverse the effects of S. salivarius growth suppression by S. agalactiae.







Abstract
The members of the infant microbiome are governed by feeding method (breastmilk vs. formula). Regardless of the source of nutrition, a competitive growth advantage can be provided to commensals through prebiotics &#8211; either human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) or plant oligosaccharides that are supplemented into formula. To characterize how prebiotics modulate commensal &#8211; pathogen interactions, we have designed and studied a minimal microbiome where a pathogen, Streptococcus agalactiae engages with a commensal, Streptococcus salivarius. We discovered that while S. agalactiae suppresses the growth of S. salivarius via increased lactic acid production, galacto&#8208;oligosaccharides (GOS) supplementation reverses the effect. This result has major implications in characterizing how single species survive in the gut, what niche they occupy, and how they engage with other community members.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimuli&#8208;responsive natural proteins have been widely investigated and show great potential for their application in various fields. This minireview highlights the recent advances in natural proteins with specific stimuli&#8208;responsive characteristics, including temperature, light, force, electric field, and magnetic field.







Abstract
Natural proteins are essential biomacromolecules that fulfill versatile functions in the living organism, such as their usage as cytoskeleton, nutriment transporter, homeostasis controller, catalyzer, or immune guarder. Due to the excellent mechanical properties and good biocompatibility/biodegradability, natural protein&#8208;based biomaterials are well equipped for prospective applications in various fields. Among these natural proteins, stimuli&#8208;responsive proteins can be reversibly and precisely manipulated on demand, rendering the protein&#8208;based biomaterials promising candidates for numerous applications, including disease detection, drug delivery, bio&#8208;sensing, and regenerative medicine. Therefore, we present some typical natural proteins with diverse physical stimuli&#8208;responsive properties, including temperature, light, force, electrical, and magnetic sensing in this review. The structure&#8208;function mechanism of these proteins is discussed in detail. Finally, we give a summary and perspective for the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive proteins.

An NIR&#8208;emitting, highly biocompatible fluorescent probe was successfully developed and utilized for tracking mitochondrial dysfunction in cells via fluorescence confocal microscopy. The probe exhibited excellent biocompatibility and high selectivity for long&#8208;term imaging.







Abstract
An NIR emitting (&#955;em&#8776;730&#8197;nm) cyanine probe ExCy was synthesized in good yields by extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugation length (i.&#8201;e., with furan moiety) to the donor&#8208;accepter system. ExCy exhibited a large Stokes&#8217; shift (&#916;&#955;&#8776;100&#8197;nm) due to strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and high fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;fl&#8776;0.47 in DCM). Due to its low fluorescence in an aqueous environment (&#934;fl&#8776;0.007 in H2O), the probe exhibited the potential of achieving a large fluorescence turn&#8208;on upon entering a hydrophobic cellular environment. Fluorescence confocal microscopy studies revealed that ExCy was readily excitable with a far&#8208;red laser line (i.&#8201;e., 640&#8197;nm) while the corresponding emission was collected in the NIR region. ExCy exhibited excellent selectivity towards live cell mitochondria according to the co&#8208;localization studies. The probe also exhibited high photostability, long&#8208;term imaging ability and wash&#8208;free staining ability, when being applied to live cells. Our studies indicated that the mitochondrial localization of ExCy was dependent on the membrane potential of the mitochondria. ExCy was successfully utilized as a mitochondrial membrane potential dysfunction indicator to visually identify cells with mitochondrial dysfunction via fluorescence confocal microscopy. ExCy was further examined for potential in&#8197;vivo imaging of zebrafish.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Unprotected Dipeptides into Hydrogels: Water&#8208;Channels Make the Difference</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembling behaviour of the distinct stereoisomers of Ile&#8208;Phe and Phe&#8208;Ile was studied in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and found to form hydrogels. Single&#8208;crystal XRD data of the four non&#8208;enantiomeric dipeptides revealed water&#8208;channels as a distinctive feature only for the heterochiral hydrogelator D&#8208;Phe&#8208;L&#8208;Ile.







Abstract
Unprotected dipeptides are attractive building blocks for environmentally friendly hydrogel biomaterials by virtue of their low&#8208;cost and ease of preparation. This work investigates the self&#8208;assembling behaviour of the distinct stereoisomers of Ile&#8208;Phe and Phe&#8208;Ile in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to form hydrogels, using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;IR), circular dichroism (CD), and oscillatory rheometry. Each peptide purity and identity was also confirmed by 1H&#8208; and 13C&#8208;NMR spectroscopy and HPLC&#8208;MS. Finally, single&#8208;crystal XRD data allowed the key interactions responsible for the supramolecular packing into amphipathic layers or water&#8208;channels to be revealed. The presence of the latter in the crystal structure is a distinctive feature of the only gelator of this work that self&#8208;organizes into stable hydrogels, with fast kinetics and the highest elastic modulus amongst its structural isomers and stereoisomers.

         <title>Polyether Cyclization Cascade Alterations in Response to Monensin Polyketide Synthase Mutations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substrate promiscuity of the polyether cyclisation cascade enzymes in monensin biosynthesis in the conversion of redox derivatives of the nascent polyketide chain was studies. The post&#8208;polyketide synthase enzymes were found to have remarkable flexibility. They acted on derivatized polyketide backbones based on the three possible polyketide redox states within two different modules and gave rise to an altered polyether structure.







Abstract
The targeted manipulation of polyketide synthases has in recent years led to numerous new&#8208;to&#8208;nature polyketides. For type&#8197;I polyketide synthases the response of post&#8208;polyketide synthases (PKS) processing enzymes onto the most frequently polyketide backbone manipulations is so far insufficiently studied. In particular, complex processes such as the polyether cyclisation in the biosynthesis of ionophores such as monensin pose interesting objects of research. We present here a study of the substrate promiscuity of the polyether cyclisation cascade enzymes in monensin biosynthesis in the conversion of redox derivatives of the nascent polyketide chain. LC&#8208;HRMS/MS2&#8208;based studies revealed a remarkable flexibility of the post&#8208;PKS enzymes. They acted on derivatized polyketide backbones based on the three possible polyketide redox states within two different modules and gave rise to an altered polyether structure. One of these monensin derivatives was isolated and characterized by 2D&#8208;NMR spectroscopy, crystallography, and bioactivity studies.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembling Properties and Recovery Effects on Damaged Skin Cells of Chemically Synthesized Mannosylerythritol Lipids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembling properties and recovery effects on damaged skin cells using chemically synthesized mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) were investigated. Synthetic and homogeneous MELs exhibited significant self&#8208;assembling properties to form droplets or giant vesicles. In addition, a small difference in the length of the fatty acid chains of the MELs significantly affected their recovery effects on the damaged skin cells.







Abstract
Mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs), which are one of the representative sugar&#8208;based biosurfactants (BSs) produced by microorganisms, have attracted much attention in various fields in the sustainable development goals (SDGs) era. However, they are inseparable mixtures with respect to the chain length of the fatty acids. In this study, self&#8208;assembling properties and structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies of recovery effects on damaged skin cells using chemically synthesized MELs were investigated. It was revealed, for the first time, that synthetic and homogeneous MELs exhibited significant self&#8208;assembling properties to form droplets or giant vesicles. In addition, a small difference in the length of the fatty acid chains of the MELs significantly affected their recovery effects on the damaged skin cells. MELs with medium or longer length alkyl chains exhibited much higher recovery effects than that of C18&#8208;ceramide NP.

         <title>A Modular System for the Rapid Comparison of Different Membrane Anchors for Surface Display on Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highway to optimized surface display: A modular surface display system, employing the SpyCatcher/SpyTag bioconjugation system, is used for rapid comparison of the membrane anchors Lpp&#8208;OmpA, PgsA, INP and AIDA&#8208;I with respect to their performance for surface display of the model passenger cytochrome P450 BM3. The described combinatorial screening method helps to minimize the workload required for identifying the most suitable membrane anchor for a given application.







Abstract
Comparison of different membrane anchor motifs for the surface display of a protein of interest (passenger) is crucial for achieving the best possible performance. However, generating genetic fusions of the passenger to various membrane anchors is time&#8208;consuming. We herein employ a recently developed modular display system, in which the membrane anchor and the passenger are expressed separately and assembled in&#8197;situ via SpyCatcher and SpyTag interaction, to readily combine a model passenger cytochrome P450 BM3 (BM3) with four different membrane anchors (Lpp&#8208;OmpA, PgsA, INP and AIDA&#8208;I). This approach has the significant advantage that passengers and membrane anchors can be freely combined in a modular fashion without the need to generate direct genetic fusion constructs in each case. We demonstrate that the membrane anchors impact not only cell growth and membrane integrity, but also the BM3 surface display capacity and whole&#8208;cell biocatalytic activity. The previously used Lpp&#8208;OmpA as well as PgsA were found to be efficient for the display of BM3 via SpyCatcher/SpyTag interaction. Our strategy can be transferred to other user&#8208;defined anchor and passenger combinations and could thus be used for acceleration and improvement of various applications involving cell surface display.

         <title>New Trends and Future Opportunities in the Enzymatic Formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O bonds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent research on the biocatalytic formation of new C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O is surveyed in this review to provide an overview of the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the field as well as future perspectives.







Abstract
Organic chemistry provides society with fundamental products we use daily. Concerns about the impact that the chemical industry has over the environment is propelling major changes in the way we manufacture chemicals. Biocatalysis offers an alternative to other synthetic approaches as it employs enzymes, Nature's catalysts, to carry out chemical transformations. Enzymes are biodegradable, come from renewable sources, operate under mild reaction conditions, and display high selectivities in the processes they catalyse. As a highly multidisciplinary field, biocatalysis benefits from advances in different areas, and developments in the fields of molecular biology, bioinformatics, and chemical engineering have accelerated the extension of the range of available transformations (E.&#8197;L. Bell et&#8197;al., Nat. Rev. Meth. Prim. 2021, 1, 1&#8211;21). Recently, we surveyed advances in the expansion of the scope of biocatalysis via enzyme discovery and protein engineering (J.&#8197;R. Marshall et&#8197;al., Tetrahedron 2021, 82, 131926). Herein, we focus on novel enzymes currently available to the broad synthetic community for the construction of new C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;O bonds, with the purpose of providing the non&#8208;specialist with new and alternative tools for chiral and sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Rapid Estimation of Membrane Protein Orientation in Liposomes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid fluorescence&#8208;based method for the estimation of membrane protein (MP) orientation in liposomes was developed. For the determination of MP orientation, the fluorescence of site&#8208;specifically labeled mutants was monitored. Outside&#8208;oriented fluorophores are quenched with membrane&#8208;impermeable corresponding quencher, before solubilization of liposomes by detergent, leading to maximal quench. MP orientation corresponds to the ratio of first to full quench.







Abstract
The topological organization of proteins embedded in biological membranes is crucial for the tight interplay between these enzymes and their accessibility to substrates in order to fulfil enzymatic activity. The orientation of a membrane protein reconstituted in artificial membranes depends on many parameters and is hardly predictable. Here, we present a convenient approach to assess this important property independent of the enzymatic activity of the reconstituted protein. Based on cysteine&#8208;specific chemical modification of a target membrane protein with a cyanine fluorophore and a corresponding membrane&#8208;impermeable fluorescence quencher, the novel strategy allows rapid evaluation of the distribution of the two orientations after reconstitution. The assay has been tested for the respiratory complexes bo3 oxidase and ATP synthase of Escherichia coli and the results agree well with other orientation determination approaches. Given the simple procedure, the proposed method is a powerful tool for optimization of reconstitution conditions or quantitative orientation information prior to functional measurements.

         <title>Binding Methylarginines and Methyllysines as Free Amino Acids: A Comparative Study of Multiple Host Classes**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comparative binding studies for three different host classes (calixarenes, acyclic cucurbiturils and other cleft&#8208;like hosts) are presented. Each was studied with multiple methylated arginines and lysines to determine fundamental structure&#8208;function relationships. Molecular modelling was used to gain insight on the preferences of the different hosts.







Abstract
Methylated free amino acids are an important class of targets for host&#8208;guest chemistry that have recognition properties distinct from those of methylated peptides and proteins. We present comparative binding studies for three different host classes that are each studied with multiple methylated arginines and lysines to determine fundamental structure&#8208;function relationships. The hosts studied are all anionic and include three calixarenes, two acyclic cucurbiturils, and two other cleft&#8208;like hosts, a clip and a tweezer. We determined the binding association constants for a panel of methylated amino acids using indicator displacement assays. The acyclic cucurbiturils display stronger binding to the methylated amino acids, and some unique patterns of selectivity. The two other cleft&#8208;like hosts follow two different trends, shallow host (clip) following similar trends to the calixarenes, and the other more closed host (tweezer) binding certain less&#8208;methylated amino acids stronger than their methylated counterparts. Molecular modelling sheds some light on the different preferences of the various hosts. The results identify hosts with new selectivities and with affinities in a range that could be useful for biomedical applications. The overall selectivity patterns are explained by a common framework that considers the geometry, depth of binding pockets, and functional group participation across all host classes.

         <title>Direct Enzymatic Synthesis of Fatty Amines from Renewable Triglycerides and Oils</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct synthesis of primary fatty amines from renewable triglycerides and oils was achieved with an enzyme cascade comprised of a lipase, a carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) and a transaminase (TA). Multiple amines were successfully synthesized in one pot, with analytical yields as high as 97&#8201;%. Moreover, a 75&#8197;mL scale preparative scale reaction was carried out for trilaurin, obtaining 73&#8201;% isolated yield to the corresponding amine.







Abstract
Fatty amines represent an important class of commodity chemicals which have broad applicability in different industries. The synthesis of fatty amines starts from renewable sources such as vegetable oils or animal fats, but the process has multiple drawbacks that compromise the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the synthesis. Herein, we report a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept biocatalytic alternative towards the synthesis of primary fatty amines from renewable triglycerides and oils. By coupling a lipase with a carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) and a transaminase (TA), we have accomplished the direct synthesis of multiple medium and long chain primary fatty amines in one pot with analytical yields as high as 97&#8201;%. We have also performed a 75&#8197;mL preparative scale reaction for the synthesis of laurylamine from trilaurin, obtaining 73&#8201;% isolated yield.

         <title>Discovery of Two Novel Oxidases Using a High&#8208;Throughput Activity Screen</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In search of novel enzymatic activities: Application of a high&#8208;throughput activity screening platform has led to the discovery of two novel enzymes: N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;hexosamine oxidase, a previously orphan enzyme, and a novel type of long&#8208;chain alcohol oxidase, a non&#8208;homologous isofunctional enzyme (NISE) to known enzymes with this activity.







Abstract
Discovery of novel enzymes is a challenging task, yet a crucial one, due to their increasing relevance as chemical catalysts and biotechnological tools. In our work we present a high&#8208;throughput screening approach to discovering novel activities. A screen of 96 putative oxidases with 23 substrates led to the discovery of two new enzymes. The first enzyme, N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;hexosamine oxidase (EC 1.1.3.29) from Ralstonia solanacearum, is a vanillyl alcohol oxidase&#8208;like flavoprotein displaying the highest activity with N&#8208;acetylglucosamine and N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine. Before our discovery of the enzyme, its activity was an orphan one &#8208; experimentally characterized but lacking the link to amino acid sequence. The second enzyme, from an uncultured marine euryarchaeota, is a long&#8208;chain alcohol oxidase (LCAO, EC 1.1.3.20) active with a range of fatty alcohols, with 1&#8208;dodecanol being the preferred substrate. The enzyme displays no sequence similarity to previously characterised LCAOs, and thus is a completely novel representative of a protein with such activity.

         <title>The Chirality of Aggregated Yariv Reagents Correlates with Their AGP&#8208;Binding Ability**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Yariv reagents are a class of tris&#8208;azo dyes, some of which stain and precipitate arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), plant cell wall proteoglycans. These dyes form supramolecular aggregates in solution. In this study, CD spectroscopy revealed that the aggregates exhibit helical chirality. Only those aggregates with right&#8208;handed helicity have a fertile interaction with AGP, while those with left&#8208;handed helicity do not bind. Artwork credit: D. Caianiello and M. Bohne.

         <title>Strong and Specific Recognition of CAG/CTG Repeat DNA (5&#8217;&#8208;dWGCWGCW&#8208;3&#8217;) by a Cyclic Pyrrole&#8208;Imidazole Polyamide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic pyrrole&#8208;imidazole polyamide, which binds to the CAG/CTG repeat sequence with high specificity and affinity, is reported.







Abstract
Abnormally expanded CAG/CTG repeat DNA sequences lead to a variety of neurological diseases, such as Huntington's disease. Here, we synthesized a cyclic pyrrole&#8208;imidazole polyamide (cPIP), which can bind to the minor groove of the CAG/CTG DNA sequence. The double&#8208;stranded DNA melting temperature (Tm) and surface plasmon resonance assays revealed the high binding affinity of the cPIP. In addition, next&#8208;generation sequencing showed that the cPIP had high specificity for its target DNA sequence.

         <title>Scalable and Selective &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Amino Acid Synthesis Catalyzed by Promiscuous l&#8208;Threonine Transaldolase ObiH</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ObiH is an l&#8208;threonine transaldolase which catalyzes the diastereoselective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids. We have demonstrated the synthetic utility of this enzyme through preparative scale reactions to selectively generate a structurally diverse array of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids, as well as downstream functionalization to generate important organic building blocks, such as &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids and &#945;&#8208;keto acids.







Abstract
Enzymes from secondary metabolic pathways possess broad potential for the selective synthesis of complex bioactive molecules. However, the practical application of these enzymes for organic synthesis is dependent on the development of efficient, economical, operationally simple, and well&#8208;characterized systems for preparative scale reactions. We sought to bridge this knowledge gap for the selective biocatalytic synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids, which are important synthetic building blocks. To achieve this goal, we demonstrated the ability of ObiH, an l&#8208;threonine transaldolase, to achieve selective milligram&#8208;scale synthesis of a diverse array of non&#8208;standard amino acids (nsAAs) using a scalable whole cell platform. We show how the initial selectivity of the catalyst is high and how the diastereomeric ratio of products decreases at high conversion due to product re&#8208;entry into the catalytic cycle. ObiH&#8208;catalyzed reactions with a variety of aromatic, aliphatic and heterocyclic aldehydes selectively generated a panel of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids possessing broad functional&#8208;group diversity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ObiH&#8208;generated &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids could be modified through additional transformations to access important motifs, such as &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids and substituted &#945;&#8208;keto acids.

         <title>Varying the Directionality of Protein Catalysts for Aldol and Retro&#8208;Aldol Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein catalysts with varied levels of directionality in usually reversibly catalyzed aldol and retro&#8208;aldol reactions were generated using the same protein scaffold.







Abstract
Natural aldolase enzymes and created retro&#8208;aldolase protein catalysts often catalyze both aldol and retro&#8208;aldol reactions depending on the concentrations of the reactants and the products. Here, we report that the directionality of protein catalysts can be altered by replacing one amino acid. The protein catalyst derived from a scaffold of a previously reported retro&#8208;aldolase catalyst, catalyzed aldol reactions more efficiently than the previously reported retro&#8208;aldolase catalyst. The retro&#8208;aldolase catalyst efficiently catalyzed the retro&#8208;aldol reaction but was less efficient in catalyzing the aldol reaction. The results indicate that protein catalysts with varying levels of directionality in usually reversibly catalyzed aldol and retro&#8208;aldol reactions can be generated from the same protein scaffold.
