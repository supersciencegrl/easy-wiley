         <title>Enzymatic Oxidation of Carbohydrate Byproducts for Use in Formation of Chitosan Hydrogels</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbohydrates, i.e., xylooligosaccharides derived from corn cobs and lactose derived from dairy byproducts, were selectively oxidized using fungal oxidoreductases AbPDH1 (pyranose dehydrogenase from Agaricus bisporus) and FgrGalOx (galactose oxidase from Fusarium graminearum). The resulting oxidized carbohydrates then crosslink chitosan, a crustacean shell biopolymer, to produce bio&#8208;based hydrogels for agricultural or biomedical applications.

Chitosan hydrogels are used in diverse applications ranging from pharmaceuticals and biomedical materials to food and agriculture. This study introduces a biology&#8208;inspired approach to create fully bio&#8208;based hydrogels by combining chitosan with bio&#8208;based di/polycarbonyl crosslinkers produced through the enzymatic oxidation of carbohydrates. Two such crosslinkers, Ox&#8208;XOS and Ox&#8208;Lac, were synthesized by oxidizing carbohydrates: Ox&#8208;XOS was produced by oxidizing xylooligosaccharides (XOS) with pyranose dehydrogenase from Agaricus bisporus (AbPDH1), and Ox&#8208;Lac was produced by oxidizing lactose (Lac) with galactose oxidase from Fusarium graminearum (FgrGalOx). The efficacy of enzymatic oxidation of lactose and XOS was analyzed using liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy, showing high degrees of oxidation, and carbonyl groups were confirmed using ATR&#8208;FTIR and 1H NMR. Compared with unmodified XOS, Ox&#8208;XOS showed a lower reaction temperature towards hexamethylenediamine by differential scanning calorimetry and demonstrated stronger gel formation ability with polyallylamine and chitosan. Rheological measurements showed O(10)$O(10)$&#8211;O(103)$O(10^{3})$ increases in the storage moduli (G&#8242;$G&amp;#x00026;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;prime;$) of chitosan hydrogels formed with Ox&#8208;Lac and Ox&#8208;XOS compared with unmodified lactose and XOS, indicating considerable increases in the hydrogels&#8217; resistance to deformation. These findings demonstrate the potential of enzymatically oxidized carbohydrates as crosslinkers to enhance chitosan hydrogels with potential utility in both high&#8208;value and large&#8208;volume sectors.

         <title>Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Delivery of siRNA by Amphiphilic Nanovectors Self&#8208;Assembled from a Cationic [4]Helicene&#8208;Squalene Ester</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 21, November 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small amphiphilic helicene effectively complexes siRNA, leading to nanoassemblies which transport siRNA to the mitochondria where it silences the protein expression of the mitochondria&#8208;encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene. 

The active delivery of therapeutic nucleic acids with subcellular precision is an open challenge. Herein, a small conjugate molecule, combining a cationic [4]helicene moiety with a lipophilic squalene tail, yields amphiphilic nanoassemblies capable of effectively complexing siRNA within the mitochondria. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept in HCT 116 colorectal cancer cells was evidenced by Western blot for the delivery of siRNA silencing the protein expression of the mitochondria&#8208;encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene.

         <title>Identification of Methylglyoxal Reactive Proteins with Photocaged Glycating Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 21, November 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocaged methylglyoxal (PC&#8208;MGO) derivatives enable studying protein glycation under mild conditions. The active glycating agents can be released in the protein solution by irradiating the sample with UV light. Compared to the earlier reported chemically activated MGO probes, the photocaged probes are more potent. The light triggered release of MGO probes will open opportunities to study glycation with a higher cellular precision.

Methylglyoxal is a highly reactive metabolite that is formed spontaneously in the glycolytic pathway. The side chains of various amino acid residues react with methylglyoxal to form advanced&#8208;glycation end products (AGEs). This enzyme&#8208;independent process introduces post&#8208;translational modifications onto the proteins and it is long thought that the resulting AGEs primarily inhibit proteins. More recent studies have shown that these AGEs can act in signaling and feedback loops and that a large number of proteins react reversibly with methylglyoxal. These findings lead to a renewed interest in methylglyoxal&#8208;induced AGEs and lead to the development of novel tools and methodologies that can be used to identify the modified proteins. Many of studies are nowadays still performed by adding methylglyoxal exogenously, often in a high concentration, despite the high reactivity of methylglyoxal. Herein, new photocaged&#8208;methylglyoxal derivatives are reported that allow the direct release of methylglyoxal in the sample of interest by irradiating the photocaged probe with UV light. It is shown that this labeling approach is more efficient. A far larger number of proteins are labeled with the photocaged probes than with the chemically activated probes. The here reported approach should allow studying in&#8201;situ glycation under physiological more relevant conditions.

         <title>Functional Analysis of Histidine&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Cleaving RNAs Obtained by In Vitro Selection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 21, November 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ribozymes can be nucleic acid medicines given their catalytic activity. We attempted to obtain functional RNAs that mimic ribonuclease A catalytic mechanisms. Functional RNAs with high histidine specificity were obtained, suggesting that histidine acts in active structure formation. These RNAs can be applied as aptazymes with histidine as a cofactor.

Ribozymes, ribonucleic acids with enzymatic functions, have not yet been practically used in nucleic acid medicine, possibly due to their low activity levels. We hypothesized that functional RNAs with high activity can be obtained by mimicking the catalytic reactions of ribonuclease A. We aimed to obtain histidine&#8208;dependent functional RNAs from an RNA library using in vitro selection with L&#8208;histidine. An RNA library with a random sequence of 70 nucleotides was constructed and used. A self&#8208;cleaving RNA (I&#8208;04) with histidine specificity and a rate constant of kobs(I&#8722;04)&#8201;=&#8201;4.6&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3 (min&#8722;1) at pH 5.0 was obtained. Owing to its low activity, reselection was performed. II&#8208;28, obtained on the second selection, showed cleavage activity in the presence of histidine, but not with histidine analogs. The rate constant of II&#8208;28 was kobs(II&#8722;28)&#8201;=&#8201;3.0&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3 (min&#8722;1) at pH 5.0, comparable to that of I&#8208;04. The activity of these molecules, however, is very low and different from that of ribonuclease A. Several histidine&#8208;dependent and divalent metal ion&#8208;independent self&#8208;cleaving RNAs were obtained. The pH profile of the RNAs suggested that histidine was not utilized as a catalytic residue, but histidine was presumed to be working in the formation of the active structure.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Chemical Probes for Labeling tRNAs Containing 2&#8208;Thiouridine (s2U)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 21, November 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemical labeling strategy for tagging specific s2U&#8208;tRNAs is developed by taking advantage of a natural SelU&#8208;mediated tRNA geranylation process, using a two&#8208;step process, azidation&#8208;and&#8208;click&#8208;tagging with fluorescent dyes, namely, ACT&#8208;Flu.

RNA modifications play pivotal roles in numerous cellular processes and human diseases. In addition to the well&#8208;studied methyl&#8208;based modifications, hydrophobic prenyl&#8208;modifications have also been found in many RNA species. Herein, a chemical labeling strategy for tagging specific tRNAs by taking advantage of a natural SelU&#8208;mediated geranylation process is reported. A series of &#8220;clickable&#8221; geranyl&#8208;pyrophosphate analogs is synthesized and two candidates to label 2&#8208;thiouridine (s2U) containing tRNA using a two&#8208;step process, azidation&#8208;and&#8208;click&#8208;tagging with fluorescent dyes, namely ACT&#8208;Flu are identified. This method has also been applied to in&#8208;cell RNA imaging, providing a useful biochemical toolset to further study the biological functions of s2U&#8208;tRNAs and monitor their status in both healthy and diseased cells, since human tRNAs do not have the prenyl group on natural s2U34 modification.

         <title>Development and Validation of a High&#8208;Throughput Screening Assay for the Legionella ADP&#8208;Ribosyl Transferase SdeA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 21, November 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show the optimization and application of a fluorogenic assay to monitor Legionella SdeA activity in a High&#8208;Throughput&#8208;Screening campaign.

Ubiquitination of proteins is one of the most crucial post&#8208;translational modifications in eukaryotic cells, typically involving conjugation of ubiquitin to a lysine residue in a substrate using a three&#8208;enzyme cascade that relies on ATP as energy source. The pathogen Legionella pneumophila, in contrast, employs a totally divergent pathway to ubiquitinate cellular host proteins in an unconventional manner that is crucial for bacterial proliferation. This multistep process is orchestrated by effector proteins from the SidE family which initially use NAD+ to adenosine diphosphate (ADP)&#8208;ribosylate ubiquitin in a mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosyltransferase (mART) domain. The subsequent step relies on SidE phosphodiesterase activity to conjugate phosphoribosyl&#8208;Ubiquitin to serine residues in host substrates. Through these phosphoribosyl&#8208;ubiquitinating events, Legionella is able to gain local control over the host's ubiquitin system and simultaneously evades immune responses. Hence, pursuing new inhibitors which can disrupt these crucial steps in bacterial infection are essential towards further understanding and potentially blocking Legionella infection. Here, we present the application of an &#949;&#8208;NAD+ consumption&#8208;based fluorogenic assay to identify small molecule modulators of the SdeA effector enzyme in a High&#8208;Throughput Screening format, where over 600 compounds were screened. As a result, a potent inhibitor named cephalosporin C Zn2+ salt was discovered showing an IC50 of 221&#8201;nM. To investigate the inhibitory properties more deeply, various cephalosporin analogs were synthesized where variations in charge and carbon length were introduced and their inhibitory efficiencies measured and compared. Our findings suggest that the inhibition is primarily attributed to the presence of the Zn2+ ion, rather than the cephalosporin core. We next compared the inhibitory potential of other bivalent metal ions, illustrating that the zinc ion causes the best inhibition of the Legionella effector.

         <title>DNA Binding Study of a Redox Active Enantiopure Bis(arylimino)acenaphthene (BIAN) Os(II) Bipyridine Complex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 21, November 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a novel dicationic osmium polypyridyl complex featuring the bis(arylimino)acenaphthene ligand demonstrates interesting redox properties. Successful enantiomer resolution reveals that the delta isomer is a strong DNA grove binder.

This work presents the synthesis, characterization, and evaluation of DNA binding for a bis(arylimino)acenaphthene (BIAN) containing Os(II) octahedral dipyridyl complex [Os(dmbpy)2BIAN](An)2 [1](An)2 (dmbpy&#8201;=&#8201;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl, BIAN&#8201;=&#8201;bis(arylimino)acenaphthene, An&#8201;=&#8201;PF6&#8722; or Cl&#8722;). Complex 1 is characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and cyclic voltammetry, which reveal a series of fully reversible redox couples. The visible absorption spectrum is dominated by metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer bands between 400 and 600&#8201;nm, whose assignment is supported by time dependent density functional theory computational studies with solvent corrections. For the first time, chiral discriminating chromatography is used to resolve the &#916;&#8208; and &#923;&#8208;enantiomers of a metal BIAN complex. UV&#8211;visible absorption and circular dichroism measurements reveal significant differences in the binding strength of the enantiomers to double&#8208;stranded natural DNA, with a greater affinity observed for &#916;&#8208;1 (Kb&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;106&#8201;&#8201;M&#8722;1), which is comparable to that observed for other group 8 polypyridyl intercalating species and is supported by the thermal denaturation temperature recorded in the presence of DNA. Linear dichroism confirms that both enantiomeric species bind through the intercalation of the BIAN component. The development of DNA&#8208;binding chiral metal complexes containing redox&#8208;active ligands described in this work offers the potential to expand the activity of therapeutic bioinorganic systems in new directions.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Mediated Base Pairs in Nucleic Acids: Selective Coordination to Natural and Thiocarbonyl&#8208;Modified Cytosines Dependent upon the Oxidation State of Gold</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 21, November 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective coordination of gold ions to mismatched cytosines in nucleic acid duplexes is achieved via oxidation&#8208;state&#8208;dependent interactions. While Au(I) binds to natural cytosine&#8211;cytosine pairs, cytosine thiolation promotes square&#8208;planar coordination with Au(III), offering a structure&#8208;guided approach to redox&#8208;tunable nucleic acid architectures.

Gold&#8208;mediated base pairing in nucleic acids has remained poorly understood, despite structural analogies with mercury and silver ions known to coordinate selectively to mismatched base pairs. Here, the crystal structures of a C&#63743;Au(I)&#63743;C base pair and a C&#63743;G&#63743;Au(I)&#63743;C base triple formed with natural nucleobases are reported. Although solution&#8208;phase thermodynamic analysis of Au(I) coordination is technically unfeasible, structural evidence supports its selective insertion into the base&#160;mismatches. In contrast, duplexes incorporating 2&#8208;thiocytosine form square&#8208;planar complexes with Au(III), and melting temperature analysis shows significant thermal stabilization. The distinct coordination geometries of Au(I) and Au(III) arise from differences in oxidation state and preferred coordination numbers, with Au(I) favoring linear two&#8208;coordinate structures and Au(III) forming square&#8208;planar complexes stabilized by thiocarbonyl donors. These findings establish a structure&#8208;guided strategy for oxidation&#8208;state&#8208;selective metal coordination in nucleic acids, paving the way for the design of metal&#8208;responsive DNA architectures with tunable properties.

         <title>Functionalizing Injectable Hydrogels with Cobalt&#8208;Based Metallacarboranes for Targeted Delivery in Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 21, November 8, 2025. </description>

This study reports a biocompatible HA&#8211;lysine hydrogel loaded with cobalt metallacarborane (CoSAN) for targeted release into triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cells. The system maintains CoSAN cytotoxicity, as confirmed by cell assays and imaging, representing an attractive approach toward a localised TNBC treatment.

Cobalt&#8208;based metallacarboranes have emerged as potential candidates for cancer treatment owing to their unique structural properties. In this study, a biocompatible delivery platform is developed by noncovalently incorporating cobalt metallacarborane (CoSAN) into hyaluronic acid (HA) functionalized with lysine (Lys). HA&#8208;Lys 2 enables the electrostatic interaction of CoSAN while retaining its cytotoxic activity, as confirmed by cellular assays using MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cells. Elemental mapping via energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the successful and homogeneous incorporation of CoSAN to lead HA&#8208;Lys&#8208;CoSAN 3, and the composite is further characterized using diffusion&#8208;ordered nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (DOSY). Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy data demonstrate comparable cellular uptake in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells of free and HA&#8208;loaded CoSAN. Additionally, release studies under physiologically relevant conditions show a sustained release profile over 24&#8201;h with pH dependency to mimic normal and tumor microenvironments. The present study describes a viable method for integrating metallacarboranes into a polymeric drug delivery system without compromising their anticancer properties, thereby advancing their potential for future therapeutic use.

         <title>Cryo&#8208;EM Structures Reveal Nonmirror&#8208;Image Binding of L&#8208; and D&#8208;Peptide Enantiomers at &#945;7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 21, November 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In peptide medicinal chemistry, D&#8208;residues are commonly used to create inverso or retro&#8208;inverso analogs to enhance proteolytic stability and binding affinity of peptides. Here, we present Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy structures of L&#8208; and D&#8208;peptide enantiomers bound to human &#945;7&#8208;nAChR at atomic&#8208;resolution, unveiling a hybrid binding mode&#8212;featuring both chiral inversion and backbone flip&#8212;rather than simple mirror symmetry.

Peptides targeting the &#945;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (&#945;7&#8208;nAChR) hold significant potential for biological research and therapeutic applications. Notably, linear D&#8208;amino acid peptides exhibit higher inhibitory potency against &#945;7&#8208;nAChR and greater proteolytic stability compared to their L&#8208;type counterparts, making them more attractive candidates for both laboratory research and clinical use. However, the molecular basis of D&#8208;peptide binding to &#945;7&#8208;nAChR remains elusive. Herein, cryo&#8208;EM structures of &#945;7&#8208;nAChR is presented in complex with the L&#8208;peptide LKP1794 (2.68&#8201;&#197;) and its D&#8208;peptide enantiomer DKP1794 (2.53&#8201;&#197;), providing the first molecular insights into D&#8208;peptide recognition by &#945;7&#8208;nAChR. Structural analysis reveals that both peptides occupy the orthosteric site of &#945;7&#8208;nAChR. However, their binding poses are not merely mirror images; instead, they adopt a hybrid binding mode that combines mirror symmetry with a flipped peptide backbone orientation. Our structural data uncover a distinct D&#8208;peptide binding mechanism that diverges from the hypothesized retro&#8208;inversion model.

         <title>C&#8208;6&#8208;Modified 2&#8208;F&#8208;Fucose Derivatives as Inhibitors of Fucosyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 21, November 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of C6&#8208;modified guanosine&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;2&#8208;F&#8208;fucose analogs and corresponding prodrugs are designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated as inhibitors of cellular fucosylation. Certain analogs potently inhibit fucosyltransferases (FUT) FUT1, 3, 6, and 9 while showing minimal activity for FUT8, highlighting the potential for selective FUT targeting.

Fluorinated analogs of guanosine&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;&#946;&#8208;L&#8208;fucose (GDP&#8208;Fuc) have received considerable attention for the development of inhibitors of fucosyltransferases (FUTs). These compounds can be recognized by FUTs but do not transfer or transfer slowly the fluorinated fucosyl residue because the electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorine(s) destabilize the oxocarbenium&#8208;like transition state. Fluorinated GDP&#8208;Fuc analogs can also act as feedback inhibitor of the de novo biosynthetic pathway of GDP&#8208;Fuc. To investigate the biological significance of distinct glycoconjugate classes, it is important to develop inhibitors that can selectively target specific FUT enzymes. The design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series of GDP&#8208;2&#8208;F&#8208;Fuc analogs modified at C&#8208;6 of Fuc by various amides and ethers are reported. Corresponding prodrugs are also prepared and examined as potential FUT inhibitors of cellular glycosylation. The findings reveal that two of the inhibitors potently inhibited FUT1, 3, 6, and 9, while displaying minimal activity against FUT8. However, the corresponding prodrugs do not inhibit cellular fucosylation, which is probably due to a lack of GDP&#8208;fucose pyrophosphorylase activity. The results demonstrate that modifications at the C&#8208;6 position of Fuc can confer selectivity, although further investigations of alternative functional groups are required to enhance cellular tolerance and efficacy.

         <title>Synthesis and Incorporation of a pH&#8208;Responsive Nucleoside Into DNA Sequences</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 21, November 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;responsive nucleoside is developed that enables a reversible switch in DNA between paired and unpaired states near physiological pH. This design may provide the framework for sequence&#8208;independent, pH programable DNA motifs, thus paving the way for dynamic DNA nanotechnology applications.

DNA's programable thermodynamics, structural versatility, and ease of synthesis makes it an ideal material for constructing molecular devices. While many biological systems are powered by proton gradients to drive dynamic processes, harnessing pH differences in DNA nanotechnology is possible through pH&#8208;responsive DNA motifs. Existing strategies, however, often depend on strict sequence constraints or nonphysiological pH conditions, limiting their applicability in complex DNA origami structures. In this article, a nucleoside with pH&#8208;sensitive base pairing is developed that reversibly switches its pairing specificity near physiological pH. This unnatural building block is recognized by standard polymerases, and its pairing behavior can be controlled by pH. Characterization of the base pairing properties reveals that duplex stability varies with pH, while canonical sequences remain unaffected. This design enables programable sequence motifs that transition between duplex and single&#8208;stranded DNA in response to pH changes. Our unnatural nucleoside therefore provides a versatile tool for dynamic DNA nanotechnology, with potential applications in DNA nanomachines, biosensing, and targeted drug delivery. Additionally, its physiological pKa may enable general acid&#8211;base catalysis in ribozymes or DNAzymes, analogous to histidine in protein enzymes.

         <title>Rieske Oxygenase&#8208;Catalyzed Biotransformations in Recombinant Cupriavidus necator Fueled by Formate Oxidation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 21, November 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, formatotrophic biotransformations in recombinant Cupriavidus necator catalyzed by Rieske oxygenases (ROs) toward various oxyfunctionalized olefins are demonstrated. The oxidation of formate regenerates NADH, the ROs&#8217; cofactor, essentially fueling the reaction. The formatotrophically cultivated cells performed at the same efficiency as heterotrophically grown cells of the same strain. NDO: naphthalene dioxygenase, CDO: cumene dioxygenase. CBB cycle: Calvin&#8208;Benson&#8208;Bassham cycle.

The use of single carbon (C1) molecules, such as carbon dioxide or formate, is crucial in the transition from a linear, petroleum&#8208;based economy to a circular bioeconomy. Formate can serve as both a carbon and energy source, further enhancing its attractiveness as a feedstock. Cupriavidus necator, a lithoautotrophic microbial chassis strain, provides an opportunity to leverage formate for the synthesis of valuable products. However, its ability to grow on formate and the subsequent coupling of that process to recombinantly produced redox enzymes for the efficient production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added products in a biotransformation has not yet been established. Here, we report the development of a formate&#8208;driven C. necator whole&#8208;cell chassis that recombinantly produces Rieske oxygenases (ROs) and elaborate on possible stress responses of the cells during formatotrophic cultivation. The whole&#8208;cell chassis efficiently catalyzes the oxyfunctionalization of olefins fueled by formate oxidation. For instance, styrene is dihydroxylated to (R)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diol in an excellent 95% yield and with good enantioselectivity (74% ee) under formatotrophic conditions. The product yield and optical purity obtained demonstrate the synthetic usefulness of formate&#8208;fueled whole&#8208;cell bio&#8208;transformations in C. necator.

&lt;p&gt;In this study, formatotrophic biotransformations in recombinant &lt;i&gt;Cupriavidus necator&lt;/i&gt; catalyzed by Rieske oxygenases (ROs) toward various oxyfunctionalized olefins are demonstrated. The oxidation of formate regenerates NADH, the ROs&#8217; cofactor, essentially fueling the reaction. The formatotrophically cultivated cells performed at the same efficiency as heterotrophically grown cells of the same strain. NDO: naphthalene dioxygenase, CDO: cumene dioxygenase. CBB cycle: Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of single carbon (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) molecules, such as carbon dioxide or formate, is crucial in the transition from a linear, petroleum-based economy to a circular bioeconomy. Formate can serve as both a carbon and energy source, further enhancing its attractiveness as a feedstock. &lt;i&gt;Cupriavidus necator&lt;/i&gt;, a lithoautotrophic microbial chassis strain, provides an opportunity to leverage formate for the synthesis of valuable products. However, its ability to grow on formate and the subsequent coupling of that process to recombinantly produced redox enzymes for the efficient production of high-value-added products in a biotransformation has not yet been established. Here, we report the development of a formate-driven &lt;i&gt;C. necator&lt;/i&gt; whole-cell chassis that recombinantly produces Rieske oxygenases (ROs) and elaborate on possible stress responses of the cells during formatotrophic cultivation. The whole-cell chassis efficiently catalyzes the oxyfunctionalization of olefins fueled by formate oxidation. For instance, styrene is dihydroxylated to (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-1-phenylethane-1,2-diol in an excellent 95% yield and with good enantioselectivity (74% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;) under formatotrophic conditions. The product yield and optical purity obtained demonstrate the synthetic usefulness of formate-fueled whole-cell bio-transformations in &lt;i&gt;C. necator&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Poly(ethylene Glycol)&#8208;Based Peptidomimetics (Pegtides) of Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 21, November 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is commonly used to improve the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of therapeutic candidates by conjugation. Here PEG is exploited for peptidomimetic conversion of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), as candidate antibacterial agents, by replacing their polyamide backbone. The pegtides obtained thereby can be readily synthesized from inexpensive starting materials and demonstrate properties commensurate of AMP mimetics.

Cationic amphipathic poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;based polymers are generated with synthetic efficiencies allowing their evaluation as antimicrobial peptide (AMP) mimetics. Accordingly, statistical copolymers with cationic units consistently functionalized with guanyl groups, but different side&#8208;chain lengths, and hydrophobic units displaying long aliphatic, branched, and/or aromatic side chains are produced and tested for their antimicrobial and hemolytic properties. The results obtained indicate that candidates with activities and selectivity commensurate to some AMPs can be obtained and that further development of this novel type of antimicrobial peptidomimetics, pegtides, is warranted for clinical and/or biotechnological applications.

         <title>Aldehyde or Hydrate? Investigation into the Oxidation of 5&#8208;Formylcytosine Derivatives Using a Computational and Experimental Approach</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 21, November 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrate&#8208;mediated oxidation of 5&#8208;formyl nucleobases by the iron(IV)&#8208;oxido complex proceeds via geminal diol intermediates, accelerating hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer and revealing aza&#8208;dependent kinetic and mechanistic pathways.

This study investigates the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl and 5&#8208;formyl nucleobases using an iron(IV)&#8208;oxido complex that mimics the function of TET enzymes. A central question in this context is whether the oxidation of formyl substrates proceeds via the aldehyde or the hydrate form. To investigate the possible different reaction kinetics of these two forms, nucleobases containing a 6&#8208;aza&#8208;moiety are employed, giving rise to significantly more aldehyde hydrate as compared to the unaltered nucleobase. The concentration changes of substrates and products during oxidation were followed with 1H NMR spectroscopy. To analyze the kinetics of the oxidation reactions, a detailed numerical simulation of the stepwise sequential oxidation process is applied. 5&#8208;Hydroxymethyl nucleobases are first oxidized to the respective 5&#8208;formyl derivatives, which exist in equilibrium with their hydrate forms, and then further oxidized to the final 5&#8208;carboxyl nucleobases. The rate constants for 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl nucleobase oxidation show a good correlation with C&#63743;H bond dissociation values. The influence of hydrate formation on sequential oxidation is most prominent in the 6&#8208;aza&#8208;derivatives. The results not only deepen our understanding of substrate oxidation by iron&#8208;oxido species but also pave the way for future studies on related biological oxidation mechanisms.

         <title>A Conversational Large&#8208;Language&#8208;Model Tutor that Accelerates Machine&#8208;Learning Method Development in Routine Bioanalytical Workflows</title>

A structured chatbot assistant supports machine learning model development in bioanalytical chemistry by guiding experimental scientists through each workflow stage using natural language. Built on a general&#8208;purpose large language model and prompt engineering, its structured design and full documentation offer a lightweight, adaptable workflow for creating domain&#8208;specific scientific assistants.

As machine learning (ML) becomes increasingly relevant in experimental chemistry, many scientists face barriers to adoption due to limited training in ML. While AutoML platforms offer powerful capabilities, they lack the instructional scaffolding needed by users without an ML background. To address this gap, a lightweight, conversational assistant is presented that guides users through ML workflow design using plain&#8208;language dialog. Powered by OpenAI's GPT&#8208;4o and deployed via a Gradio interface, the assistant operates under a structured system prompt that simulates pedagogical reasoning. It behaves like a domain&#8208;specific tutor: helping users define ML goals, assess data structure, select models, evaluate metrics, and generate annotated Python code. A complete documentation of the development process is provided, allowing researchers to adapt the system for other domains. Herein, its utility is demonstrated in two representative case studies: 1) image classification of lateral flow immunoassay test strips for diagnostic readout; and 2) regression&#8208;based prediction of liquid chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry retention times from molecular descriptors for small molecules. In both cases, lab members with no ML experience successfully developed working models guided solely by the assistant. By lowering the barrier to ML adoption in data&#8208;rich analytical workflows, this system offers a customizable workflow for building domain&#8208;specific assistants across experimental science.

Hydrogenases catalyze reversible H2 production and are potential models for renewable energy catalysts. Here, the full redox landscape of a group 3 [NiFe]&#8208;hydrogenase from methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus is elucidated, resembling group 1 enzymes. Structural and spectroscopic analyses reveal a catalytic&#8208;ready state with nickel seesaw coordination, enabling intermediate trapping and advancing mechanistic understanding of oxygen&#8208;sensitive [NiFe] enzymes.

         <title>Model&#8208;Based Optimization of Fed&#8208;Batch In Vitro Transcription</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 21, November 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a mathematical model for the enzyme kinetics and solution thermodynamics of the in vitro transcription reaction, new optimized strategies are developed for fed&#8208;batch transcription that can decrease the resource costs of mRNA synthesis while maintaining critical quality attributes for efficacy in vivo.

Recent developments in RNA vaccines and therapeutics have motivated the need for process engineering strategies to optimize the in vitro transcription (IVT) reaction for RNA synthesis. Specifically, practitioners seek to maximize the production of RNA and the incorporation of the 5&#8208;prime cap to the end of each RNA molecule while minimizing the use of expensive reagents. Fed&#8208;batch IVT is a promising technique for achieving these goals but is difficult to optimize by purely experimental means. Herein, a mechanistic model for fed&#8208;batch IVT is developed and it is used to develop optimized fed&#8208;batch protocols to maximize the formation of RNA while controlling concentrations of nucleoside triphosphates. On a model sequence that has been shown to be sensitive to salt concentrations, this approach can produce twice as much RNA as a heuristic approach. In addition, it is observed and characterized for the first time the formation of magnesium phosphate crystals during the IVT reaction. Strategies informed by thermodynamic modeling are developed to prevent this undesired crystallization during fed&#8208;batch IVT. Finally, co&#8208;transcriptional capping is incorporated into the model&#8208;based optimization approach and a strategy to maximize RNA formation is developed while maintaining a high level of 5&#8208;prime cap incorporation and minimizing the use of cap analogs.

&lt;p&gt;Using a mathematical model for the enzyme kinetics and solution thermodynamics of the in vitro transcription reaction, new optimized strategies are developed for fed-batch transcription that can decrease the resource costs of mRNA synthesis while maintaining critical quality attributes for efficacy in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent developments in RNA vaccines and therapeutics have motivated the need for process engineering strategies to optimize the in vitro transcription (IVT) reaction for RNA synthesis. Specifically, practitioners seek to maximize the production of RNA and the incorporation of the 5-prime cap to the end of each RNA molecule while minimizing the use of expensive reagents. Fed-batch IVT is a promising technique for achieving these goals but is difficult to optimize by purely experimental means. Herein, a mechanistic model for fed-batch IVT is developed and it is used to develop optimized fed-batch protocols to maximize the formation of RNA while controlling concentrations of nucleoside triphosphates. On a model sequence that has been shown to be sensitive to salt concentrations, this approach can produce twice as much RNA as a heuristic approach. In addition, it is observed and characterized for the first time the formation of magnesium phosphate crystals during the IVT reaction. Strategies informed by thermodynamic modeling are developed to prevent this undesired crystallization during fed-batch IVT. Finally, co-transcriptional capping is incorporated into the model-based optimization approach and a strategy to maximize RNA formation is developed while maintaining a high level of 5-prime cap incorporation and minimizing the use of cap analogs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Hybridising an Antimicrobial Peptide (AMP) with polyethylene glycol (PEG), to replace the peptide&#8217;s polyamide backbone by PEG, produces a Pegtide as an AMP mimetic. By analogy, the molecules are represented as combining the features of a bird (AMP) and a horse (PEG) in a winged horse (Pegasus) and folded to match the shapes of the Swan, Equuleus and Pegasus constellations, respectively. More details can be found in the Research Article by Marc Devocelle and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.202500258).

         <title>ThiF&#8208;Like Enzyme Chemistry in Primary and Secondary Metabolism</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 21, November 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ThiF&#8208;like enzymes are a widespread protein family found in disparate biosynthetic pathways. They are unified by their use of an NTP to modify a carboxylate, generating an activated species prone to nucleophilic addition. This common intermediate is then targeted by diverse nucleophiles, including persulfide or amino acid side chains, to yield a variety of structural scaffolds. This review highlights the diversity of chemical modifications made by the ThiF&#8208;like enzyme family, ranging from its involvement in the biosynthesis of universal enzyme cofactors to the formation of exotic bioactive RiPP natural product scaffolds.

ThiF&#8208;like proteins are members of the widespread E1&#8208;like enzyme superfamily. The eponymous ThiF enzyme was first described in thiamin biosynthesis as part of Escherichia coli's primary metabolism, and homologous proteins have been subsequently discovered in secondary metabolism. These ThiF&#8208;like enzymes are united in their defining ability to perform nucleotidylation of a carboxyl group to generate an activated, electrophilic intermediate, a feature it shares with the structurally related ubiquitin&#8208;activating enzymes. From here, an array of different nucleophiles are used across distinct biosynthetic pathways to yield diverse structural scaffolds. In this review, we discuss various ThiF&#8208;like enzymes that perform nucleotidylation to facilitate a diverse array of interesting and rare chemistry on different types of substrates, as well as showcase some of the shared structural features.

         <title>Deserts, Rivers, Pools, and Billabongs: Water Features of the Nitrogenase Proteins, and their Functions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 21, November 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the protein surrounding the active site of nitrogenase there is a large anhydrous desert, traversed by two watercourses necessary for the enzyme to convert N2 to NH3. Various pools exist, but their water seems to be stagnant.

This review examines the occurrence and function of water inside the protein that contains the catalytic site of the enzyme nitrogenase. The requirement of 8 protons and 8 electrons to convert N2 to NH3 and the opposing acid&#8212;base character of reactant and product are unique in enzymology. The active site is an unprecedented iron sulfide cluster containing one heterometal, in Mo, V, and Fe isozymes. A key component supporting the complex chemical mechanism is water, which transports multiple exogenous protons, sequentially, and assists the egress of hydrophilic ammonia. Using high&#8208;resolution crystal structures of the nitrogenase isozymes and cryoEM data, I describe and classify all intraprotein water components. A singular property is the occurrence of extensive anhydrous domains that surround the reaction zone of the cofactor. This focuses attention on the proton supply chain, a river, along which protons are transferred by a Grotthuss mechanism from protein surface to cofactor. Another river, in an opposite direction, runs along the pathway for departing NH3. I describe mechanisms for translocation of protons and of NH3 and their use of water and homocitrate. Other water features buried in the proteins include a mechanistically significant single water molecule and featureless water pools.

         <title>Reaction Engineering of In Vitro Natural Product Biosynthesis: Challenges and Strategies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 21, November 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The yield and turnover of in vitro natural product biosynthesis, and even its feasibility, are determined by intermolecular interactions. Reaction engineering allows to improve the performance of such complex biocatalytic systems.

Natural products are widely used as pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, or as active ingredients in food and cosmetics. Their biosynthesis typically involves a series of enzyme&#8208;controlled reactions in dedicated liquid environments. The reconstruction of these multistep transformations under in vitro conditions bears significant potential for technical utilization. However, the concurrent operation of multiple enzymes in a single reaction flask or reactor is often associated with major challenges. Herein, the difficulties in reaching high substrate conversion and product yields with in vitro enzyme cascades are summarized. Furthermore, both established and emerging concepts for improving their performance are discussed.

         <title>Spontaneous Fusion of Aqueous Two&#8208;Phase Droplets: Effect of Coexisting Phospholipids on Stability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adding phospholipid lecithin above the critical micelle concentration to ATPS droplets is reported to significantly slow down the processes of fusion, approaching migration, and merging. These findings highlight a simple yet effective strategy for stabilizing ATPS droplets, providing new insights into how lipid adsorption enhances droplet stability.

The stability of aqueous two&#8208;phase system (ATPS) droplets is a key requirement for extending their utility beyond conventional applications, particularly as minimal models of biological cells and reaction compartments. However, the mechanisms by which their dynamic process in droplet size growth remain poorly understood. In this study, lecithin is demonstrated to effectively stabilize ATPS droplets by modulating two fundamental processes that determine their size evolution: 1) approaching migration driven by thermal motion and inter&#8208;droplet attraction and 2) the coalescence initiation time, defined as the delay between first contact and the onset of merging. Using dextran&#8208;rich droplets dispersed in a polyethylene glycol phase, significant suppression of both processes is shown that occurs only when lecithin concentrations exceed its critical micelle concentration. The findings indicate that lecithin coats droplet surfaces spontaneously to form a membrane&#8208;like layer, thereby reducing inter&#8208;droplet attraction and strongly inhibiting coalescence. This stabilization strategy offers a simple yet powerful means to control droplet dynamics, thereby opening up new possibilities for engineering ATPS droplets as versatile platforms for biochemical reactions and synthetic cell research.

         <title>From Structure to Function: Development of Relaxin&#8208;3 Analogs and their Role in RXFP3 Signaling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines the current understanding of the relaxin&#8208;3/the relaxin family peptide receptor 3 (RXFP3) system and recent developments in peptidomimetics and small&#8208;molecule ligands targeting the system.

Relaxin&#8208;3 is a two&#8208;chain neuropeptide of the insulin/relaxin superfamily and the cognate ligand for the G protein&#8208;coupled receptor RXFP3. Since its discovery, the relaxin&#8208;3/RXFP3 signaling system has emerged as a key regulator of feeding behavior, stress responses, arousal, addiction, and cognitive function. Recent structural studies, including the first cryo&#8208;electron microscopy structures of RXFP3 bound to relaxin&#8208;3 and small molecules, have provided significant insights into ligand&#8211;receptor interactions. Together with mutagenesis and pharmacological studies, these advances have facilitated the design of diverse RXFP3 ligands, ranging from simplified and/or stapled single&#8208;chain analogs of relaxin&#8208;3 to grafted scaffolds and small&#8208;molecule modulators. Such tools have been instrumental for probing relaxin&#8208;3 biology in&#8201;vivo and highlight the system's therapeutic potential for treating anxiety, depression, obesity, binge eating, and alcohol use disorder. However, challenges remain, particularly regarding blood&#8211;brain barrier penetration, receptor subtype selectivity, pharmacokinetic optimization, and safe long&#8208;term modulation. This review summarizes current knowledge of relaxin&#8208;3 structure, receptor interactions, and pharmacology and highlights how advances in peptide chemistry, structural biology, and small&#8208;molecule design are enabling the rational development of RXFP3&#8208;targeted therapeutics.

         <title>A Novel Electrochemical Aptasensors Utilizing AuNW/AuNC/PAA Nanocomposite for Label&#8208;Free Detection of IL&#8208;6 in Human and Mammalian Culture Serum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study reports the development of a novel label&#8208;free electrochemical aptasensor based on a gold nanowire/gold nanocolloid/polyacrylamide (AuNW/AuNC/PAA) nanocomposite platform, enabling sensitive and specific detection of the pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine interleukin&#8208;6 (IL&#8208;6). The aptasensor demonstrates a wide detection range (0.1&#8211;1000&#8201;pg mL&#8722;1), high reproducibility, excellent selectivity, and strong performance in both spiked human serum and mammalian cell culture.

A versatile and highly sensitive sensing platform has been developed by incorporating a nanocomposite of gold nanowire (AuNW), gold nanocolloid (AuNC), and polyacrylamide (PAA) onto the surface of a screen&#8208;printed carbon electrode (SPCE). This innovative approach is designed for the efficient detection of interleukin&#8208;6 (IL&#8208;6) in human serum and mammalian cell culture. The synthesized gold nanocomposite enhanced the SPCE's electrochemical signal via high conductivity, increased the electroactive surface for efficient electron transfer, and enabled thiolated aptamer immobilization through Au&#63743;S bonds. In this regard, the AuNW/AuNC/PAA nanocomposite and thiolated IL&#8208;6 aptamers were used to construct an IL&#8208;6 aptasensor for sensitive and selective detection of IL&#8208;6 using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in 5&#8201;mM [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;/4&#8722; as a redox probe. The fabricated aptasensor demonstrated sensitive detection of IL&#8208;6, with a detection range of 0.1&#8211;1000&#8201;pg mL&#8722;1 and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.1&#8201;pg mL&#8722;1. Moreover, the developed IL&#8208;6 aptasensor exhibited excellent stability, reproducibility, and selectivity. Its applicability was validated by IL&#8208;6 detection in human serum, showing 93.9%&#8211;104.8% recovery. Additionally, IL&#8208;6 levels in cell culture media were tested using both the aptasensor and a commercial ELISA kit, showing only a 1.38% difference, further confirming its reliability.

         <title>A Tetrasaccharide Containing a Galactofuranosyl Determinant of Mucins from Trypanosoma cruzi Inhibits the Parasite Adhesion on Triatoma infestans Rectum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the tetrasaccharide &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Galf(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;2)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Galf(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;4)&#8208;[&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Galp&#8208;(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;6)]&#8208;D&#8208;GlcNAc bearing the Galf(&#946;1&#8211;4)[Galp(&#946;1&#8211;6)]GlcNAc motif, a structural element of Trypanosoma cruzi core&#8208;2 mucin glycans is reported. The &#945;&#8208;benzyl glycoside inhibits epimastigote parasite adhesion to the vector Triatoma infestans rectal ampoule emphasizing this motif as a key adhesion determinant. It also acts as a sialic acid acceptor in TcTS&#8208;catalyzed assays.

Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, is a protozoan parasite transmitted to humans via the feces of blood&#8208;sucking triatomine vectors such as Triatoma infestans. It has been shown that galactofuranose&#8208;containing oligosaccharides present in mucins of T. cruzi are involved in parasite adhesion to the T. infestans rectal ampoule, a key step in the differentiation programme from dividing epimastigote to nondividing mammal&#8208;infective metacyclic forms of the parasite. To further characterize this process, the &#945;&#8208;benzyl glycoside of &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Galf(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;2)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Galf(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;4)&#8208;[&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Galp&#8208;(1&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;6)]&#8208;D&#8208;GlcNAc is synthesized and its alditol derivative is spectroscopically characterized. The tetrasaccharide component of this glycoside is a substructure of the O&#8208;linked pentasaccharide and hexasaccharide structures found in the T. cruzi epimastigote mucins. The tetrasaccharide glycoside inhibits parasite adhesion to the rectal ampoule of T. infestans, suggesting that some or all of the binding capacity of T. cruzi epimastigotes resides within this O&#8208;glycan tetrasaccharide substructure. Since T. cruzi mucin O&#8208;linked glycans are known to be acceptors for T. cruzi trans&#8208;sialidase, it is investigated whether the tetrasaccharide substructure acts as an acceptor substrate for this activity. The successful transfer of sialic acid to the tetrasaccharide glycoside indicates that further elaboration to the pentasaccharide and hexasaccharide structures is not essential for sialic acid transfer.

         <title>Peptide Arginases from Cryptic Pathways Install Ornithine Residues in Uncharacterized Members of Orphan RiPP Families</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of the non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid ornithine into antibiotic peptides has shown potential in influencing antibacterial efficacy. Novel peptide arginases from cryptic ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptide (RiPP) pathways are identified and found to&#160; incorporate ornithine residues into various peptide sequences, complementing the existing peptide arginases and offering new opportunities for drug discovery.

Ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are remarkable natural products with interesting chemical structures and potent bioactivities. RiPP pathways are abundant in all domains of life and harbor a large biosynthetic potential in the form of post&#8208;translationally acting enzymes. A relatively small number of RiPP biosynthetic gene clusters encode peptide arginases, a recently discovered maturase family capable of hydrolyzing arginine residues of RiPP core peptides to ornithines. In this study, members of the peptide arginase family (FlmR and OhkR), which are associated with uncharacterized precursors from orphan RiPP families, are identified. In&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro activity of FlmR and OhkR with the five associated precursor peptides (FlmA1&#8208;3 and OhkA1&#8208;2) is demonstrated and kinetic studies to biochemically characterize the enzymes are performed. Furthermore, in&#8201;silico structural analysis with AlphaFold 3 is used to predict precursor&#8211;arginase complexes, providing insights into how peptide arginases could bind their precursor substrates. In the case of OhkA&#8211;OhkR complexes, this analysis also allows a hypothesis as to which of the arginine residues of the core peptide is modified first, which is confirmed experimentally. This detailed biochemical and structural enzyme characterization is a prerequisite for the application of peptide arginases in peptide&#8208;based drug discovery platforms.

         <title>An Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer Mechanism&#8208;Based Reactive Probe for Ratiometric Fluorescence Detection of Epinephrine in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epinephrine (EPI) or adrenaline is involved in various physiological processes of the sympathetic nervous system and may be linked to the progression of different serious diseases. An excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer mechanism&#8208;based reactive probe has been successfully developed for the selective ratiometric fluorescent detection of EPI in live cells.

Epinephrine (EPI), also known as adrenaline, is involved in various physiological processes of the sympathetic nervous system and may be linked to the progression of different serious diseases, including cancers, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases etc. There is an urgency in developing a fluorescence probe for the detection of EPI. An excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer mechanism (ESIPT)&#8208;based reactive probe HBT&#8208;EPI has been successfully developed for ratiometric fluorescent detection of EPI in physiological conditions. EPI undergoes a cascade of nucleophilic attack at the carbonothioate site of the probe using the secondary amine and &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl group to release the ESIPT&#8208;active 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBT) fluorophore. Thus, a ratiometric fluorescence response is obtained. The probe is highly selective for EPI detection compared to other catecholamine&#8208;based neurotransmitters. A minimum of 1&#8201;&#181;M of EPI can be easily detected using this probe. HBT&#8208;EPI has been successfully demonstrated for ratiometric fluorescence detection of EPI in live cells via confocal imaging.

         <title>Investigation on the Peroxidase&#8208;Like Activity of Co3O4 Nanoparticles Adsorbed with Diverse DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the regulatory effect of diverse DNA on the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of Co3O4 NPs was investigated for the first time, offering a novel perspective for the application of Co3O4 NPs in photometric detection.

In recent years, nanozymes have increasingly attracted the attention of researchers due to their low cost, high stability, and straightforward preparation when compared with natural enzymes. Furthermore, the biocompatibility of nanozymes has been enhanced through surface adsorption, hence broadening their application scope. In this work, Co3O4 nanozyme was adsorbed with diverse DNA, and the catalytic performance was significantly boosted compared with the pure Co3O4 nanozyme. Peroxidase&#8208;like activity assays revealed three key findings. First, the adsorption of single&#8208;stranded DNA proved to be more effective than that of double&#8208;stranded DNA. Second, the 50&#8208;nucleotide single&#8208;stranded DNA sequence yielded the stronger catalytic signal. Ultimately, guanine rich nucleotide exhibited the higher catalytic efficiency in single&#8208;stranded DNA and cytosine&#8208;guanine rich nucleotide exhibited the stronger catalytic efficiency in double&#8208;stranded DNA. The kinetic results of its catalytic activity showed that the catalysis of the adsorbed Co3O4 nanozyme followed the Michaelis&#8211;Menten kinetics. In parallel, the Km value of 50&#8208;nucleotide single&#8208;stranded DNA adsorption was the lowest of diverse DNA, which was 6.11&#8201;mM and 54.8% of the pure Co3O4 nanozyme. These findings establish DNA adsorption as an effective strategy for enhancing the catalytic activity of Co3O4 nanozymes, presenting significant potential for applications in medical diagnostics and antioxidant&#8208;related fields.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Rational Design of a Selective Hydrolase Inhibitor of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus&#8208;2 Nsp3 Macrodomain</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;guided design of a sulfamoyl&#8208;modified analog of GS&#8208;441524 yielded a selective, high&#8208;affinity inhibitor of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 macrodomain Nsp3b. The compound occupies the phosphate&#8208;binding pocket, forming a stabilizing hydrogen&#8208;bond network that enhances binding affinity (K_D&#8201;=&#8201;0.86&#8201;&#956;M). This study establishes sulfamoyl substitution as an effective phosphate bioisostere for rational antiviral macrodomain inhibitor design.

Viral macrodomains, which hydrolyze mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated proteins to evade host immunity, represent emerging antiviral targets, yet their druggability remains underexplored. GS&#8208;441524, the active metabolite of remdesivir, has been identified as an inhibitor of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) macrodomain (Nsp3b). Herein, the structure&#8211;activity relationship governing macrodomain recognition by the ribosylated moiety using a panel of nucleoside analogs, revealing that phosphate configuration and nucleobase identity critically modulate binding affinity. GS&#8208;441524 derivatives exhibit up to 200&#8208;fold higher affinity compared to adenosine&#8208;based ligands. A novel sulfamoyl derivative demonstrates superior inhibitory potency, attributable to its occupation of the phosphate subsite and formation of a stabilizing hydrogen&#8208;bond network. These findings provide molecular insights into Nsp3b&#8211;ligand interactions and establish a rational framework for the development of high&#8208;affinity, structure&#8208;guided inhibitors targeting viral macrodomains.

         <title>Regulation of Supramolecular Interactions: RNA:DNA Folding and Nanopore Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Urea regulates the folding of RNA:DNA hybrids through supramolecular interactions, enhances their structural rigidity, and reduces folding events during nanopore translocation. This significantly improves the signal distinguishability and decoding efficiency for the detection of low&#8208;abundance RNA at the single&#8208;molecule level, providing a novel technical approach for the accurate detection of pathogenic RNA and the analysis of drug metabolism.

The intersection of DNA/RNA nanotechnology and single&#8208;molecule solid&#8208;state nanopore sensing enables precise detection of low&#8208;abundance biomolecules. However, a significant challenge persists that nucleic acid molecules readily fold during nanopore translocation, which gives rise to ambiguous current signatures, reduces the number of usable data points, and compromises detection accuracy. Herein, a recent advancement by the Platnich group is highlighted, wherein urea is employed as a noncovalent modulator to participate in the isothermal assembly of MS2 bacteriophage RNA with DNA barcodes. This modulator stably binds to the RNA:DNA hybrids through supramolecular interactions after removal of free urea by buffer exchange. Nanopore assays showed a &#8776;50% reduction in fold&#8208;shift events in the urea&#8208;treated group. Atomic force microscopy characterization shows that the persistence length of the hybrids is enhanced by &#8776;40%. This strategy provides a new noncovalent regulatory tool for nucleic acid nanotechnology and pushes the nanopore sensing technology toward the precision detection of low&#8208;abundance RNA.

         <title>Isolable Cysteine Sulfenyl Iodide: Stabilization by a Molecular Cradle, Crystal Structure, and Biologically Relevant Reactivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isolable cysteine sulfenyl iodide (Cys&#8211;SI) stabilized by a molecular cradle is reported. X&#8208;ray analysis and reactivity studies reveal hydrolysis to sulfenic acid, electrophilic substitution with indoles, and high reactivity toward amines and dimedone, providing direct evidence for long&#8208;standing proposals on iodine&#8208;mediated protein modification.

Cysteine sulfenyl iodides (Cys&#8211;SIs) have long been recognized as important intermediates in the oxidative modification of cysteine thiols since 1950s, implicated in pathways such as hydrolysis to cysteine sulfenic acid (Cys&#8211;SOH) and electrophilic aromatic substitution with an indole ring of tryptophan to form Cys&#8211;Trp thioether linkages. Despite their proposed significance in both biological and chemical contexts, direct examination of Cys&#8211;SIs has been precluded by their intrinsic instability. Herein, the first isolation of a small&#8208;molecule Cys&#8211;SI, stabilized using a nanosized molecular cradle at the N&#8208;terminus of cysteine, is reported. The structure of the isolable Cys&#8211;SI is determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography, and its reactivity is investigated with a range of nucleophiles. Hydrolysis to Cys&#8211;SOH and reaction with an indole derivative provide direct chemical evidence for long&#8208;standing mechanistic proposals. Furthermore, rapid formation of sulfenamides with amines and high&#8208;yield adduct formation with dimedone, a canonical sulfenic&#8208;acid probe, reveal that Cys&#8211;SI possesses even greater electrophilicity than Cys&#8211;SOH. These results deliver a structurally defined reference for Cys&#8211;SI and inform mechanisms of iodine&#8208;mediated protein oxidation and peptide modification.

These results deliver a structurally defined reference for Cys&#8211;SI and inform mechanisms of iodine-mediated protein oxidation and peptide modification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polyvalent Thioesters as Multifunctional Chemical Anchors: Toward Synthesis of Homo/Hetero Peptide or Miniprotein Multimers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a new method for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of multimeric peptides/miniproteins using polyvalent thioesters as chemical core units, beginning with polyvalent NHS&#8208;esters and employing native chemical ligation (NCL). Moreover, homo/hetero branching multimers were also synthesized by combining reverse thioether ligation with NCL. This modular approach should give access to peptide dendrimers with unique biological implications.

In this work, we develop a platform for multimerizing peptides/miniproteins using various polyvalent thioester cores derived from easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide esters. We employed native chemical ligation to attach multiple copies of peptide/miniprotein around a fixed multi&#8208;armed thioester core in a one&#8208;pot fashion, leading to the first&#8208;generation multimers. Further, using a reverse thioether ligation strategy, we synthesized second&#8208;generation branched homo/hetero multimers. The reactions proceed under an aqueous environment that closely mimics physiological conditions, forming multimeric products with yields ranging from 30% to 90%. The general utility of this strategy is showcased by the synthesis of multimeric linear and bicyclic peptides, bicyclic peptide&#8208;cell penetrating peptide conjugates, and multimeric miniproteins which show picomolar affinity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 receptor binding domain. We believe that this modular approach of generating multimeric molecules should find broad applicability in peptide chemistry and chemical biology.

         <title>Strategies for the Generation of Bispecific Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bispecific antibodies can simultaneously recognize two distinct antigens or epitopes, thereby exhibiting cooperative therapeutic effects in various diseases. This review summarizes the genetic engineering and chemical conjugation strategies that have been developed to facilitate the preparation of bispecific antibodies. The advantages and disadvantages of these methods, as well as the technical challenges that currently remain in the preparation of bispecific antibodies are also discussed.

Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are engineered immunoglobulins that can simultaneously recognize two distinct antigens or two distinct epitopes on the same antigen. They exhibit cooperative therapeutic effects surpassing those of natural monoclonal antibodies, such as bridging the immune cells and tumor cells to stimulate targeted immune response, or blocking codependent signaling pathways. These advantages make them attractive therapeutic reagents for various diseases such as cancers, immunodeficiency syndromes, and ophthalmic disorders. However, the unique structural characteristics of BsAbs pose various challenges to their preparation. In the past few decades, various types of BsAbs have been designed and prepared through genetic engineering or chemical conjugation strategies, many of which have been approved as drugs or entered clinical trials. This review provides a systematic summary of these strategies and their corresponding principles, and focuses on the application of modern genetic engineering and chemical conjugation methods in the generation of BsAbs.

         <title>The APEXTAC System for Ligand&#8208;Guided Proximity Labeling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unbiased identification of drug&#8208;targets in live cells is essential for understanding the mechanism&#8208;of&#8208;action and potential off&#8208;target effects of drugs. Herein, the APEXTAC system, a small&#8208;molecule&#8208;guided proximity labeling platform is introduced based on the APEX2 peroxidase proximity labeling enzyme. This system facilitates rapid live cell target&#8208;ID across numerous targets and molecules, highlighting its potential application to the targeted protein degradation field.&#160;

Unbiased identification of drug&#8208;targets in live cells is essential for understanding the mechanism&#8208;of&#8208;action and potential off&#8208;target effects of drugs. The BioTAC system to measure these effects is previously developed. However, BioTAC has limitations, including lysine&#8208;directed biotinylation chemistry, and relatively long biotin labeling times. Herein, the development of the APEXTAC system, a small molecule guided proximity labeling platform based on the APEX2 peroxidase proximity labeling enzyme, is described as a complementary tool. A head&#8208;to&#8208;head comparison is performed between the APEXTAC system and the BioTAC system for (+)&#8208;JQ1 target&#8208;ID and demonstrated that APEXTAC can label E3&#8208;ligases via their ligands without requiring a proteasome inhibitor which can significantly perturb cell state. The APEXTAC system supports live cell target&#8208;ID across numerous molecules and targets, including components of the protein homeostasis machinery, without degradation of the labeling system, highlighting its potential application to the targeted protein degradation field.

         <title>De Novo Discovery of Bicyclic Competitive Inhibitors of Zika Virus Protease from Peptide&#8211;Bismuth Phage Display Screening</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
De novo peptide inhibitors targeting the Zika virus protease active site are discovered using phage display and Bi(III)&#8208;mediated bicyclization. Competitive elution of bound phages with a boronate inhibitor enriches dibasic peptide sequences that resemble the substrate recognition motif, yielding a micromolar bicyclic inhibitor with high proteolytic stability.

No specific vaccines or therapeutics are currently available for the prevention or treatment of Zika virus infections. The viral protease NS2B&#8208;NS3 is essential for the replication of Zika and other orthoflaviviruses, making it a target for antiviral drug development. Traditional discovery of competitive inhibitors has relied on substrate recognition sequences, typically yielding multibasic peptides. Herein, a de novo strategy is presented for identifying competitive inhibitors using peptide phage display in combination with Bi(III)&#8208;mediated in&#8201;situ formation of bicyclic peptides. In an initial screening, phages displaying a library of randomized peptide&#8208;bismuth bicycles are eluted by interrupting the phage&#8208;target interactions at low pH. This approach yields a small number of peptides biased toward the active site, characterized by dibasic motifs, but only one low&#8208;ranking sequence shows modest inhibitory activity. To enhance specificity, a second screening campaign employs competitive phage elution using the dibasic boronate inhibitor CN&#8208;714 that covalently binds to the catalytically active serine residue S135 of NS2B&#8208;NS3. This strategy enriches a larger pool of competitive inhibitors sharing the characteristic dibasic substrate recognition motif. The most potent peptide&#8208;bismuth bicycle identified and synthesized features a completely novel sequence, exhibits an inhibition constant of 3.9&#8201;&#181;M and displays remarkable proteolytic stability over 24&#8201;h.

The presence of one OG is found, depending on its position in the recognition site, to increase, not affect, or decrease the affinity of the aptamer for its target. In addition, selective OG oxidation is shown to promote the efficient formation of aptamer&#8208;target crosslinks.

The effects of the substitution of a guanine (G) base by the oxidative lesion 8&#8208;oxo&#8208;7,8&#8208;dihydroguanine (OG) on the affinity of the DNA aptamer selected against L&#8208;argininamide (L&#8208;Rm) are studied. Results indicate that, depending on the position of the modified base located in the recognition site, the substitution of only one G by OG could either reduce, not affect, or increase such an affinity. In addition, attempts are carried out to promote chemical crosslinks between the aptamer and its target following selective oxidation of OG. Results show that such crosslinks could be produced with a high efficacy through nucleophilic addition of L&#8208;argininamide, presumably onto the C5 position of the oxidized OG base inserted into the aptamer in any position, and that no crosslink is generated for the original aptamer (not containing any OG). However, such reaction being very efficient, crosslinks are also produced between L&#8208;argininamide and oligonucleotides (including scramble sequences) that are not supposed to bind to that amino acid. Such an effect could be explained by the electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged oligonucleotides and the protonated amino acid, which favor the formation of crosslinks upon OG oxidation. Efforts to decrease formation of such nonspecific crosslinks are only partly successful.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Ultra&#8208;Fast Duplex Invasion Targeting Long&#8208;Range Double&#8208;Stranded DNA Using Artificial Nucleotide</title>

Photo&#8208;induced ultra&#8208;fast duplex invasion via ultra&#8208;fast photo&#8208;crosslinker, 3&#8208;cyanovinylcarbazole nucleoside (CNVK), aiming for fast high&#8208;efficiency invasion.

Genomic DNA stores genetic information and regulates functions of various biological processes. Genetic diseases can be caused by abnormal gene expression. Genetic manipulation requires sequence&#8208;selective recognition of double&#8208;stranded DNAs, various chemical approaches for double&#8208;duplex invasion have been developed. In the previous research, a photo&#8208;induced double&#8208;duplex invasion (pDDI) is introduced that uses artificial nucleotides, 3&#8208;cyanovinylcarbazole nucleoside (CNVK) as photo&#8208;crosslinker and 5&#8208;cyanouridine (CU) as inter&#8208;probe photo&#8208;crosslinking inhibitor. In this study, while investigating the invasion mechanism of the pDDI, the invasion independence of pDDI probes is discovered and proposed a photo&#8208;induced duplex invasion (pDI) that achieves fast invasion using only CNVK while still maintaining a high invasion efficiency. This rapid pDI approach provides a powerful new tool for site&#8208;specific manipulation of genomic DNA.

Transcription factors (TFs) are important gene regulators whose abnormal expression or function is involved in the occurrence of various diseases. The emergence of transcription factor&#8208;targeted proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (TF&#8208;PROTACs) using DNA with a specific sequence as the targeting ligand of TFs provides a promising strategy to overcome the difficulties of using small molecules to inhibit TFs without well&#8208;defined ligand&#8208;binding pockets. A smart nanomachine is reported to realize near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;triggered release and activation of TF&#8208;PROTAC using upconversion nanoparticles loaded with caged TF&#8208;PROTAC targeting the transcriptional factor NF&#8208;&#954;B. The release of the active TF degrader (dNF&#8208;&#954;B) under 980&#8201;nm NIR irradiation is demonstrated in a controlled manner, enabling precise control of the degradation of the transcriptional factor NF&#8208;&#954;B p65 in live cells. The construction of the NIR&#8208;responsive nanomachine makes it possible to load and release various TF&#8208;PROTACs to degrade different transcriptional factors on demand with spatial and temporal resolution.

         <title>Enhancing Antigen Recognition of Living Cells by Site&#8208;Specific VHH Antibody Conjugation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;specific incorporation of azido&#8208;phenylalanine (AzF) into antibodies enables precise conjugation, allowing anti&#8208;mCherry variable domains of heavy&#8208;chain&#8208;only antibodies (VHHs) to be aligned and immobilized on dibenzylcyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;coated glass via click chemistry. The mCherry&#8208;expressing HeLa cells adhered to the VHH&#8208;coated glass, whereas unmodified HeLa cells did not.

Biosensors and microdevices using living cells have gained significant attention in recent years, including methods for cell immobilization on antibody&#8208;coated surfaces. Random antibody fixation may lead to suboptimal exposure of recognition sites, reducing interaction efficiency. In contrast, aligned antibody immobilization enhances antigen recognition and binding capacity during cell immobilization. Site incorporation of azido&#8208;phenylalanine (AzF) into antibodies facilitates site&#8208;specific conjugation, enabling aligned antibody immobilization. In this study, we expressed and purified anti&#8208;mCherry variable domains of heavy&#8208;chain&#8208;only antibodies (VHHs), incorporating AzF at the C&#8208;terminus using an unnatural amino acid system to ensure its placement away from the antigen&#8208;binding site for mCherry. Anti&#8208;mCherry VHH&#8208;AzF was conjugated to dibenzylcyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;coated glass via click chemistry, followed by incubation with HeLa cells expressing mCherry on their surfaces (mCherry&#8208;coated cells). This resulted in increased immobilization of mCherry&#8208;coated cells on the VHH&#8208;coated glass, whereas normal HeLa cells did not adhere.

Gelatin Methacrylate Coating on 3D&#8208;Printed Poly(esterurethane) Scaffolds Improves Cell Adhesion and Proliferation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the dip&#8208;coating of poly(esterurethane) (SPEU) scaffolds with gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) successfully transform them from cell&#8208;repellent surfaces into bioactive platforms that support cellular proliferation and metabolic activity. An innovative system is developed that combines 3D printing and photopolymerization strategies to fabricate biofunctional GelMA&#8208;SPEU60 scaffolds.

A key challenge in tissue engineering is developing scaffolds that balance mechanical strength and bioactivity. Segmented poly(esterurethanes) (SPEU) are versatile polymers widely used in biomedical applications, particularly in the fabrication of elastomeric scaffolds for tissue engineering. Their mechanical properties and degradation rates can be tailored by modifying their chemical composition and morphology. However, the inherent hydrophobicity of SPEU often limits cell adhesion and proliferation, affecting their biocompatibility. To address this issue, surface modification, such as controlled dip&#8208;coating in gelatin methacrylate (GelMA), was explored in this work to enhance cell&#8208;material interactions. 3D&#8208;printed SPEU60 structures (with 60% hard segment content) are fabricated, surface&#8208;modified, and characterized using scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and goniometry. The ability of these scaffolds to support cell adhesion, proliferation, and viability, is evaluated in&#8201;vitro using lentivirus transfected green fluorescent 3T3&#8208;L1 murine preadipocyte cells. Results from these biological activity assays demonstrate that the GelMA coating significantly enhances the cellular response. In conclusion, these GelMA&#8208;SPEU60 structures can be considered extracellular matrices suitable for tissue engineering applications.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, the dip-coating of poly(esterurethane) (SPEU) scaffolds with gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) successfully transform them from cell-repellent surfaces into bioactive platforms that support cellular proliferation and metabolic activity. An innovative system is developed that combines 3D printing and photopolymerization strategies to fabricate biofunctional GelMA-SPEU60 scaffolds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key challenge in tissue engineering is developing scaffolds that balance mechanical strength and bioactivity. Segmented poly(esterurethanes) (SPEU) are versatile polymers widely used in biomedical applications, particularly in the fabrication of elastomeric scaffolds for tissue engineering. Their mechanical properties and degradation rates can be tailored by modifying their chemical composition and morphology. However, the inherent hydrophobicity of SPEU often limits cell adhesion and proliferation, affecting their biocompatibility. To address this issue, surface modification, such as controlled dip-coating in gelatin methacrylate (GelMA), was explored in this work to enhance cell-material interactions. 3D-printed SPEU60 structures (with 60% hard segment content) are fabricated, surface-modified, and characterized using scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and goniometry. The ability of these scaffolds to support cell adhesion, proliferation, and viability, is evaluated in&#8201;vitro using lentivirus transfected green fluorescent 3T3-L1 murine preadipocyte cells. Results from these biological activity assays demonstrate that the GelMA coating significantly enhances the cellular response. In conclusion, these GelMA-SPEU60 structures can be considered extracellular matrices suitable for tissue engineering applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Glucagon via Molecular and Formulation Strategies: From Natural Hormone to Effective and Stable Therapeutics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The therapeutic application of glucagon starts as a difficult&#8208;to&#8208;use emergency hormone and is now evolving into a next&#8208;generation metabolic therapy through advances in understanding its physiological functions. This review highlights how engineering strategies enhance glucagon usability, stability, and delivery, and expand its application from hypoglycemia rescue to the treatment of obesity and metabolic diseases.

Glucagon, a 29&#8208;amino acid pancreatic hormone, plays a central role in glucose homeostasis through activation of the glucagon receptor (GCGR). While clinically essential for hypoglycemia rescue, its broader therapeutic applications face limitations due to challenging biophysical properties, including poor solubility, strong aggregation tendency, and chemical instability, which currently require lyophilized formulations. Recent advances in peptide engineering and formulation science have enabled the development of next&#8208;generation glucagon analogs with enhanced stability and ready&#8208;to&#8208;use profiles. Moving beyond its classical role in glucose elevation, glucagon is now recognized as a multifunctional metabolic regulator influencing lipid metabolism, energy expenditure, and cardiorenal function. This expanded understanding has driven the development of innovative GCGR&#8208;targeting therapies, including multireceptor agonists such as glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 receptor (GLP&#8208;1R)/GCGR co&#8208;agonists for metabolic disorders and advanced dual&#8208;hormone delivery systems. This review examines the evolving pharmacology of glucagon by analyzing: 1) structural optimization and formulation strategies to address physicochemical challenges, 2) innovative delivery technologies, and 3) emerging therapeutic applications in metabolic diseases. Through critical assessment of translational challenges, this work bridges molecular insights with clinical innovation in glucagon&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>A Drug Screening Targeting Upregulation of Syk Gene Identifies Neochlorogenic Acid and L&#8208;Arabinitol Capable of Inducing the M2 Phenotype of Microglia in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microglial reporter screening identified neochlorogenic acid and L&#8208;arabinitol as spleen tyrosine kinase&#8208;upregulating compounds that promote microglial M2 polarization and Amyloid&#8208;&#946; phagocytosis, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease.

Despite numerous therapeutic attempts of Alzheimer's disease (AD), treatment options remain limited. Targeting microglia (MG) polarization from M1 to M2 is considered a promising approach, yet no drug specifically modulating this transition has been identified. The spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) has emerged as a potential therapeutic target due to its role in regulating AD risk genes and promoting Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) clearance. Herein, a microglial reporter gene screening model targeting Syk is developed and two small molecules, neochlorogenic acid (NCGA) and L&#8208;arabinitol (L&#8208;Ara), that can upregulate Syk gene expression, leading to the activation of MG M2 phenotype, are identified. Furthermore, these compounds markedly enhance the capacity of MG to migrate toward A&#946; and phagocytose A&#946;. However, when Syk expression is silenced using shRNA, the ability of these small molecules to induce the MG M2 phenotype and promote A&#946; phagocytosis by MG is substantially attenuated. These findings offer new insights into AD therapy development.

         <title>Optimizing the Cell Number and Size for Tumor Spheroid Modeling Using Amyloid Hydrogel</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide&#8208;based functional amyloid hydrogel is fabricated for an in vitro 3D breast cancer spheroid model with epithelial and stromal cell lines. Viable and proliferative mono as well as co&#8208;culture tumor spheroids are developed within 7 days using this technology, even at low cell densities, which also display angiogenic potential.

One of the leading reasons of female mortality on a global scale is breast cancer. Tumor size has been a crucial parameter in predicting the rate of tumor growth and metastasis. Regular core biopsy techniques usually result in a low yield of cancer cells. Hence, developing an in vitro platform with low cell numbers can be an invaluable tool for studying breast cancer. 3D spheroid culture is a promising alternative to animal models for applications such as drug testing and personalized medicine. The self&#8208;assembling KLMEI peptide amyloid hydrogel can be used as a matrix to support tumor spheroid formation for MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and MCF&#8208;7 cells across various cell numbers. Over 7 days, MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 spheroids exhibited higher proliferation than MCF&#8208;7, even at low cell numbers. Overall, the study shows that by adjusting the cell&#8208;to&#8208;gel ratios, viable spheroids can be developed to mimic different&#8208;sized in vivo tumors. The ability of the hydrogel to support co&#8208;culture spheroids formation is also examined by introducing fibroblasts with MCF&#8208;7 cells to induce angiogenesis and mimic the heterogeneous cell environment typical of in vivo tumors. Therefore, this platform possesses a promising potential for developing 3D spheroids to study the different aspects of breast cancer.

         <title>Synthesis and Application of Photocleavable Oligonucleotides Containing 1,2&#8208;Diol&#8208;Conjugated Phosphotriester</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocleavable oligonucleotides (ONs) containing 1,2&#8208;diol&#8208;conjugated phosphotriesters are designed and synthesized. The ONs containing cyclic 1,2&#8208;diol show efficient self&#8208;cleavage in neutral aqueous solution upon photoirradiation and can form stable duplexes with the complementary strands. The thermal stability of the duplex is significantly reduced by photocleavage. In addition, the photocleavable ON is applied to DNA&#8208;templated synthesis in the presence of competitive ONs.

Photocleavable oligonucleotides (ONs) containing a nonnucleosidic photocleavable spacer have been applied in a variety of chemical and biological tools. In this study, novel photocleavable ONs containing 1,2&#8208;diol&#8208;conjugated phosphotriesters without an extra spacer are designed and synthesized. The ONs containing cyclic 1,2&#8208;diol efficiently self&#8208;cleave in neutral aqueous solution upon photoirradiation, forming stable duplexes with the complementary strands. The thermal stability of the duplex is significantly reduced after photoirradiation. This characteristic is applied to DNA&#8208;templated synthesis in the presence of competitive ONs.

         <title>Characterization of BRCA1&#8208;Associated Protein&#8208;1 (BAP1) Aggregation Properties Induced by Cancer&#8208;Associated Mutations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BAP1 is a master regulator of oncogenesis with many cancer&#8208;associated mutations within its N&#8208;terminal ubiquitin C&#8208;terminal hydrolase (UCH) domain. We analytically demonstrated that BAP1&#8208;UCH harboring the N78S, C91W, F81V, and G128R mutations aggregate into amyloid fibrils following a secondary nucleation aggregation model. Our study provides valuable insights into how single mutations can affect cancer progression through protein aggregation.

BRCA1&#8208;associated protein&#8208;1 (BAP1) is a tumor suppressor protein that regulates DNA transcription through its deubiquitinase activity. Cancer&#8208;associated missense mutations within its ubiquitin C&#8208;terminal hydrolase (UCH) domain result in structural destabilization and aggregation, contributing to various malignancies such as malignant mesothelioma and uveal melanoma. In this study, we investigated the aggregation mechanisms of highly destabilized BAP1&#8208;UCH variants, including N78S, C91W, F81V, and G128R, using Thioflavin T (ThT) binding assays and AmyloFit analysis. Our results reveal that all BAP1&#8208;UCH variants follow a secondary nucleation&#8208;dominated aggregation model, exhibiting strong concentration dependence and significantly higher aggregation rates, which may be responsible for their impaired nuclear import, leading to increased cytosolic retention. These findings provide critical insights into how specific mutations in BAP1 drive aggregation and compromise its tumor&#8208;suppressing functions inside the nucleus, thereby contributing to cancer progression.

Our results reveal that all BAP1-UCH variants follow a secondary nucleation-dominated aggregation model, exhibiting strong concentration dependence and significantly higher aggregation rates, which may be responsible for their impaired nuclear import, leading to increased cytosolic retention. These findings provide critical insights into how specific mutations in BAP1 drive aggregation and compromise its tumor-suppressing functions inside the nucleus, thereby contributing to cancer progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Method Overview for Discovering ATE1 Substrates and their Arginylation Sites</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arginylation is a decades&#8208;old post&#8208;translational modification but is inherently difficult to study. A plurality of methods have been developed and deployed to uncover the biology and substrates of this modification. This review covers the history, major advancements, and substrates discovered over the course of six decades.

Arginylation is a protein modification event in which cellular machinery recognizes a conserved N&#8208;terminal or side&#8208;chain motif and post&#8208;translationally installs an arginine residue to signal a protein for degradation. This modification affects protein function, stability, and half&#8208;life and is essential to proper functions in mammalian systems. Since its discovery in the early 1960s, scientists have struggled to broadly characterize this modification in its canonical function outside of a handful of specific cases. It is known to be an essential cellular mark, as loss of the installation enzyme is embryonically lethal. However, the discovery of the substrates regulated by this mark has been slow and has required some creativity by the scientists who have chased it. Over the course of roughly six decades, the library of substrates has consistently grown through various applications. Here, we seek to summarize all approaches that have been applied to discovering and studying arginylation.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Near&#8208;Infrared Ratiometric Fluorescent Probe for Selective Detection of Monoamine Oxidase A Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyma is a novel water&#8208;soluble near&#8208;infrared ratiometric fluorescent probe with high selectivity for monoamine oxidase A (MAO&#8208;A). Cyma enables sensitive, real&#8208;time detection of MAO&#8208;A activity via a distinct fluorescence shift, exhibits excellent selectivity and good performance in live&#8208;cell imaging, and holds great potential for disease diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring.

Monoamine oxidase A (MAO&#8208;A) plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter metabolism and oxidative stress regulation and is implicated in various neurological disorders and cancer progression. However, its detection is hindered by high structural similarity to its isoform MAO&#8208;B and limitations of conventional methods, which exhibit poor specificity, low sensitivity, and spectral crosstalk. To overcome these challenges, Cyma, a water&#8208;soluble near&#8208;infrared ratiometric probe engineered on a cyanine platform, is developed. Cyma integrates a sulfonated cyanine core for improved water solubility, a clorgyline&#8208;derived recognition unit to confer MAO&#8208;A selectivity, and a propylamine moiety to enable enzymatic activation. Upon interaction with MAO&#8208;A, Cyma undergoes a specific 1,6&#8208;elimination and Smiles rearrangement, yielding a distinct fluorescence shift from 805&#8201;nm to 740&#8201;nm. Cyma demonstrates excellent selectivity for MAO&#8208;A over MAO&#8208;B and exhibits high sensitivity (detection limit: 0.0035&#8201;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1), with a strong linear correlation between ratiometric fluorescence intensity and MAO&#8208;A concentration. Furthermore, excellent biocompatibility and MAO&#8208;A detection ability of Cyma are demonstrated in SH&#8208;SY5Y cells. These findings establish Cyma as a powerful tool for selectively detecting MAO&#8208;A activity, offering significant potential for disease diagnosis, therapeutic monitoring, and intraoperative imaging.

         <title>A Non&#8208;G&#8208;Quadruplex Hemin Aptamer Forms a Better Peroxidase Mimicking DNAzyme</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex aptamer exhibits peroxidase&#8208;like activity when binding to hemin, forming a DNAzyme. This DNAzyme displays a pH&#8208;rate profile similar to horseradish peroxidase, whereas a G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;based DNAzyme shows an opposite trend. These two aptamers also show distinct hemin&#8208;dependent nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy behaviors. 

G&#8208;quadruplex DNA is known to bind to hemin, forming a complex that exhibits peroxidase&#8208;like activity. A non&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex aptamer named Hem1&#8208;2T also exhibits horseradish peroxidase (HRP) like activity upon binding to hemin. Herein, the catalytic characteristics of the Hem1&#8208;2T aptamer are studied and compared with PS2.M, an extensively studied G&#8208;quadruplex. From pH 6&#8211;8, the activity of Hem1&#8208;2T decreases with the increase in pH, which is similar to HRP, whereas the activity of PS2.M increases with pH, suggesting that Hem1&#8208;2T might be a better mechanistic mimic of HRP. Additionally, Hem1&#8208;2T is more effective at protecting hemin from degradation by H2O2, as evidenced by a slower decrease in the absorbance at 404&#8201;nm compared to PS2.M and more sustained catalysis. NMR spectroscopy indicates that hemin promotes ligand&#8208;induced structure formation in the Hem1&#8208;2T aptamer and forms a specific complex, whereas hemin interacts with the PS2.M G&#8208;quadruplex in a way leading to the disappearance of NMR peaks. Overall, the Hem1&#8208;2T&#8208;hemin complex is a better and more stable HRP mimic, supporting its potential applications in bioanalysis and biocatalysis.

         <title>Design and Characterization of Prodrugged Anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Masking an anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 antibody by conjugating a large PEG molecule to specific sites is explored as a way of mitigating undesirable activity in nontarget tissues. This prodrugged antibody exhibits reduced binding to CTLA&#8208;4 and Fc gamma receptors, demonstrated high stability, and had an extended half&#8208;life in a mouse model, potentially improving the pharmacokinetic profile and safety attributes of therapeutic antibodies.

Therapeutic antibodies are widely used to treat diseases like cancer and inflammatory conditions by binding with high specificity to their molecular targets. Masking is a strategy to mitigate undesirable activity in nontarget tissues, improving safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles by reducing target&#8208;mediated drug disposition. In this article, masking of an anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 antibody by conjugating a large PEG molecule to specific sites on the antibody is explored. While anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 immunotherapy benefits solid tumor treatment, its adverse events limit its utility. Multiple conjugation sites within the complementarity&#8208;determining regions and adjacent framework regions are evaluated to attenuate CTLA&#8208;4 binding. The optimal site for maximizing masking efficiency is identified, allowing for efficient bioconjugation and functional restoration upon exposure to a cleaving enzyme in the tumor microenvironment. The prodrugged antibody exhibits reduced binding to CTLA&#8208;4 and Fc gamma receptors, high stability, and an extended half&#8208;life in a mouse model. This technology has the potential to improve the PK profile and safety attributes of therapeutic antibodies.

         <title>Covalent Stabilization of Collagen Mimetic Triple Helices and Assemblies by Dopa Crosslinking</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collagen mimetic peptides that fold into triple helices can be covalently stabilized through a lysine&#8208;levodopa crosslink. By varying the relative amino acid positions, the stabilization degree can be tuned. This approach effectively stabilizes both homotrimeric and heterotrimeric triple helices and higher&#8208;order, collagen&#8208;mimetic fibers.

Creating thermally stable collagen mimetic peptides (CMPs) is a persistent challenge. Nature leverages covalent crosslinkings to stabilize collagen's signature triple helical tertiary structure and higher&#8208;order assemblies. Herein, crosslinkings between levodopa (Dopa) and lysine can covalently stabilize the triple helix in CMPs is demonstrated. Since alkaline conditions catalyze the oxidation of the catechol on Dopa to a benzoquinone, while being in proximity to the nucleophilic lysine, it is hypothesized that this reaction can be a facile method to covalently capture the supramolecular structure of CMPs by simply increasing the pH of the aqueous solvent with the addition of sodium hydroxide. This covalent capture strategy successfully stabilizes CMP homotrimers and a de novo designed ABC&#8208;type heterotrimer demonstrating that the Lysine&#8208;Dopa covalent bond is best templated by a supramolecular, axial cation&#8211; &#960;$\pi$ pairwise interaction. In nature, collagen can hierarchically assemble into fibers. This behavior can be mimicked with the self&#8208;assembly of CMPs, but the resulting nanofibers typically exhibit thermal stability below body temperature. In a final application, Dopa&#8211;Lysine covalent capture also enhances the thermal stability of CMP nanofibers well above 37&#8201;&#176;$^\circ$C is demonstrated. This biomimetic covalent capture strategy can stabilize a wide variety of CMP systems and potentially enable the biomedical application of these materials.

     alt="Covalent Stabilization of Collagen Mimetic Triple Helices and Assemblies by Dopa Crosslinking"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collagen mimetic peptides that fold into triple helices can be covalently stabilized through a lysine-levodopa crosslink. By varying the relative amino acid positions, the stabilization degree can be tuned. This approach effectively stabilizes both homotrimeric and heterotrimeric triple helices and higher-order, collagen-mimetic fibers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating thermally stable collagen mimetic peptides (CMPs) is a persistent challenge. Nature leverages covalent crosslinkings to stabilize collagen's signature triple helical tertiary structure and higher-order assemblies. Herein, crosslinkings between levodopa (Dopa) and lysine can covalently stabilize the triple helix in CMPs is demonstrated. Since alkaline conditions catalyze the oxidation of the catechol on Dopa to a benzoquinone, while being in proximity to the nucleophilic lysine, it is hypothesized that this reaction can be a facile method to covalently capture the supramolecular structure of CMPs by simply increasing the pH of the aqueous solvent with the addition of sodium hydroxide. This covalent capture strategy successfully stabilizes CMP homotrimers and a de novo designed ABC-type heterotrimer demonstrating that the Lysine-Dopa covalent bond is best templated by a supramolecular, axial cation&#8211; &#960;$\pi$ pairwise interaction. In nature, collagen can hierarchically assemble into fibers. This behavior can be mimicked with the self-assembly of CMPs, but the resulting nanofibers typically exhibit thermal stability below body temperature. In a final application, Dopa&#8211;Lysine covalent capture also enhances the thermal stability of CMP nanofibers well above 37&#8201;&#176;$^\circ$C is demonstrated. This biomimetic covalent capture strategy can stabilize a wide variety of CMP systems and potentially enable the biomedical application of these materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Research Progress of Functional Nucleic Acids&#8208;Based Biosensor in the Sensitive Detection of Foodborne Pathogens</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional nucleic acids, such as aptamers and DNAzymes, enable programable, high&#8208;specificity biosensors for rapid detection of foodborne pathogens. This article summarizes sensing principles and amplification strategies that advance portable and ultrasensitive food safety detection.

Foodborne pathogen contamination is a major global public health issue, highlighting the need for rapid, sensitive, and portable detection technologies. Conventional methods such as microbial culture, polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay are limited by complexity, low sensitivity, and high cost, restricting on&#8208;site use. Functional nucleic acids (FNAs), including aptamers and DNAzymes, have emerged as versatile molecular recognition elements for next&#8208;generation biosensors. Their programmability, stability, and specificity enable reliable real&#8208;time food monitoring. Moreover, nucleic acid&#8208;based signal amplification methods greatly enhance detection sensitivity. This review summarizes recent advances in FNA&#8208;based biosensors for foodborne pathogen detection, covering screening strategies like systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment, sensing mechanisms with various readouts (fluorescence, colorimetry, electrochemistry), and innovative amplification strategies for improving practical application in food safety monitoring. Representative biosensor designs, mechanisms, and performances are highlighted. Finally, existing challenges and future perspectives for enhancing detection accuracy are discussed. FNA&#8208;driven biosensors hold great promise for preventing foodborne diseases and advancing portable, high&#8208;sensitivity detection platforms.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Glucosides and Aminoglycosides to Combat Resistant Resistance</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic photocatalysts to alkylate monosaccharides, polysaccharides, and biomolecules containing glucose motifs&#8212;including the aminoglycoside antibiotics kanamycin and amikacin&#8212;are used and their biological activity, resulting in a kanamycin derivative with a 30&#8208;fold improved minimal inhibitory concentrations, is tested.

The rapid emergence of resistant bacteria and the scarcity of the antibiotic pipeline have been a persistent threat to global health. To expand the antibiotic pipeline,the strategy has focused on revitalizing the current antibiotic via novel site&#8208;specific derivatization. Aminoglycosides (AGs), once considered effective therapeutics for treating clinical infections, are now used to a limited extent due to drug&#8208;induced toxicity and AG&#8208;resistant bacteria. Challenges in the synthesis and modification of AGs impede their potential for regain efficacy. Herein, a photoredox catalyzed late&#8208;stage modification of glucosides including AGs is discussed. The chemistry can selectively install an alkyl group at the 3&#8208;position of unprotected glucoside with a broad substrate scope and high yields. Among the products, a series of compounds are characterized that can overcome drug resistance caused by APH(3&#8242;) and one of them achieves 30&#8208;fold potency compared to kanamycin against sensitive strains. The chemistry described here opens a new avenue for discovering new AG antibiotics that overcome drug resistance and may also serve as the basis for understanding their structure&#8211;activity relationships.

Synthesis of an N&#8208;Galactosyl Norbornane Aziridine and its Potent Mixed Inhibition of Aspergillus oryzae &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;galactosyl aziridine is found to have &#956;M range mixed inhibition constants (Ki and Ki&#8217;) for a fungal &#946;&#8208;galactosidase.

Aziridine&#8208;bearing cyclic polyols are established as irreversible covalent inhibitors of glycosyl hydrolases and have been employed as activity&#8208;based probes. In the present study, the stereoselective synthesis of a novel N&#8208;galactosyl aziridine derivative on a norbornane scaffold and its subsequent evaluation as an inhibitor of glycosyl hydrolase activity are described. The diastereoselective Huisgen cycloaddition between 2,3,4,6&#8208;tetra&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;galactopyranosyl azide and norbornene yields exo&#8208;triazoline intermediates of norbornane. Following the removal of the acetyl protecting groups and a silica gel&#8208;mediated decomposition of the triazoline intermediates, exo N&#8208;galactopyranosyl norbornane aziridine (N&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;galactopyranosyl)&#8208;exo&#8208;3&#8208;azatricyclo[3.2.1.02,4]octane, NGNA) is obtained. Enzymatic assays demonstrate that NGNA exerts potent mixed&#8208;mode inhibition of Aspergillus oryzae &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, while exhibiting significant selectivity over green coffee bean &#945;&#8208;galactosidase.

         <title>Developing FGF2 Mutants with Selectively Reduced Heparan Sulfate Affinity to Explore their Impact on FGFR1 Signaling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism by which the coreceptor heparan sulfate (HS) contributes to Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)/FGF receptor (FGFR) signaling remains unclear. In this study, FGF2 mutants with selectively reduced HS affinity were rationally designed through in silico analysis. Analyses of designed mutants provided important insights, suggesting that the contribution of FGF2/HS interaction to FGF2/FGFR signaling may be limited.

Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)regulates signal transduction by forming complexes with its receptors, FGF receptors (FGFRs), and heparan sulfate (HS), playing a crucial role in biological systems. Although HS has been suggested to modulate FGF/FGFR signaling as a coreceptor, multiple hypotheses exist regarding how HS affects FGF/FGFR signaling and the mechanism remains unclear. Herein, to highlight the role of FGF2/HS interaction in FGF2/FGFR1 signaling, FGF2 mutants with reduced HS&#8208;binding affinity are rationally designed through in silico analysis. These FGF2 mutants exhibit reduced HS affinity by more than two orders of magnitude while maintaining binding affinity to FGFR1. In addition, these mutants retain their thermal stability. Cellular assays using the FGF2 mutant suggest that, contrary to previous reports, the contribution of the FGF2/HS interaction in FGF2/FGFR1 signaling may be limited. The mutant FGFs that specifically alter the interaction with HS, achieved in this study, would contribute to an understanding of the role of FGF/HS interaction in FGF/FGFR signaling.

         <title>Improving the Gastric Resilience of Ferritin Nanocages by Fabrication with Gelatin for the Development of Oral Iron Supplements</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gelatin fabrication improved the structural stability and iron retention capacity of frog M ferritins under simulated gastric conditions.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world, particularly affecting children and women. The first&#8208;line treatment for IDA is oral iron supplementation, preferred for its cost&#8208;effectiveness and convenience of administration but is often accompanied by side effects like oxidative stress, infections, and low&#8208;solubility/precipitation. This study explores the use of ferritins&#8212;self&#8208;assembled nanocage proteins serving as soluble cellular&#8208;iron reservoirs&#8212;as a safer alternative for oral iron intervention. Ideal oral iron supplements must withstand gastric conditions, not trigger oxidative stress, and reach the absorption site intact. DNA protection assays and microbial growth studies demonstrate the antioxidative properties of ferritin, contrary to ferrous salts, underscoring its potential as a safer iron supplement. While ferritin shows commendable gastric tolerance, prolonged exposure can hamper its structural integrity/mineral retention. To further enhance its stability, ferritin is fabricated with gelatins, which preserved its structure/iron content under simulated gastric conditions. The combination of inherent antioxidant and controlled iron release properties of ferritin with gelatin's protective effect could help overcome the limitations of the commercial supplements. The findings of this study could pave the way for the development of "gelatin&#8208;coated iron&#8208;loaded ferritin"&#8208;based oral formulations as a safer option for IDA management.

     alt="Improving the Gastric Resilience of Ferritin Nanocages by Fabrication with Gelatin for the Development of Oral Iron Supplements"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gelatin fabrication improved the structural stability and iron retention capacity of frog M ferritins under simulated gastric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world, particularly affecting children and women. The first-line treatment for IDA is oral iron supplementation, preferred for its cost-effectiveness and convenience of administration but is often accompanied by side effects like oxidative stress, infections, and low-solubility/precipitation. This study explores the use of ferritins&#8212;self-assembled nanocage proteins serving as soluble cellular-iron reservoirs&#8212;as a safer alternative for oral iron intervention. Ideal oral iron supplements must withstand gastric conditions, not trigger oxidative stress, and reach the absorption site intact. DNA protection assays and microbial growth studies demonstrate the antioxidative properties of ferritin, contrary to ferrous salts, underscoring its potential as a safer iron supplement. While ferritin shows commendable gastric tolerance, prolonged exposure can hamper its structural integrity/mineral retention. To further enhance its stability, ferritin is fabricated with gelatins, which preserved its structure/iron content under simulated gastric conditions. The combination of inherent antioxidant and controlled iron release properties of ferritin with gelatin's protective effect could help overcome the limitations of the commercial supplements. The findings of this study could pave the way for the development of "gelatin-coated iron-loaded ferritin"-based oral formulations as a safer option for IDA management.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interactions of Neurodegenerative Disease Positron Emission Tomography Imaging Probe Candidates with the C&#8208;Terminus of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Fibrils</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binding studies of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;S) fibril ligands using photo&#8208;crosslinking mass spectrometry and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer show that the multiple system atrophy (MSA)&#8208;selective lead, HY&#8208;215, interacts with the &#945;S C&#8208;terminus, unlike Parkinson's disease (PD)&#8208;selective lead, M503. Thus, often&#8208;ignored interactions with the disordered regions of &#945;S fibrils may be important in the development of positron emission tomography imaging probes and other therapeutic small molecules for PD and MSA.

Fibrillar aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;S) is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and related disorders, including multiple system atrophy (MSA) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Herein, the fibril interactions of two candidate positron emission tomography (PET) imaging ligands, M503 and HY&#8208;215, being developed for imaging of PD/DLB and MSA, respectively, are investigated. Photo&#8208;crosslinking mass spectrometry is used to determine the sites of their binding to in&#8201;vitro fibrils, and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer with fluorescently labeled proteins is used to analyze conformational changes in the disordered &#945;S C&#8208;terminus. Taken together, these studies show that the MSA&#8208;selective PET lead, HY&#8208;215, interacts with the C&#8208;terminus, unlike the PD&#8208;selective lead M503. This study indicates that interactions with the often&#8208;ignored disordered regions of &#945;S fibrils should be considered in the development of PET probes and other therapeutic small molecules.

         <title>5&#8208;Thiohistidine N&#8208;Acetyltransferase from Proteiniphilum Saccharofermentans</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteiniphilum saccharofermentans, a Gram&#8208;negative facultative anaerobe, produces an N&#8208;acetyl transferase (5THNAT) that acetylates 5&#8208;thiohistidine using acetyl&#8208;CoA. This reaction competes with OvoC&#8208;mediated N&#960;&#8208;methylation of the same substrate. The production ratio of ovothiol to N&#945;&#8208;acetyl 5&#8208;thiohistidine is likely regulated by the relative availability of SAM and acetyl&#8208;CoA.

Ovothiol A is a 5&#8208;thiohistidine derivative biosynthesized by a broad range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Its redox&#8208;active mercaptoimidazole side chain is believed to protect cells from oxidative stress. The three enzymes that produce ovothiol A from histidine, cysteine, and S&#8208;adenosyl methionine have been identified and characterized. In contrast, no enzymes are known that produce other 5&#8208;thiohistidine derivatives. Here, a small family of acetyl&#8208;coenzyme A&#8208;dependent transferases is described that produce N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;5&#8208;thiohistidine. The discovery of these enzymes from Proteiniphilum saccharofermentans and related Bacteroidota provides evidence that the 5&#8208;thiohistidine class may be structurally and functionally more diverse than previously thought.

Bioactivity Profiles of Progressively Ring&#8208;Fluorinated Cyclohexyl Motifs in the WKYMVm Peptide as Formylpeptide FPR2 Agonists and in Keto&#8208;Piperazines as Antitrypanosome Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;cis&#8208;fluorinated cyclohexyl motifs with progressively increasing levels of fluorine are introduced into the WKYMVm peptide and a class of keto&#8208;piperazine derivatives and assayed against the FPR2 receptor or the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, respectively. Increasing fluorination, reduced Log P's, however it generally results in poorer bioactivities, indicating an inverse relationship between cyclohexane ring polarity and bioactivity in each case.

A series of all&#8208;cis&#8208;ring&#8208;fluorinated cyclohexylalanines with progressively increasing levels of vicinal fluorines, as well as 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanine and pentafluoroarylphenylalanine is introduced into the WKYMVm peptide in place of its tyrosine residue, for assays against the G&#8208;protein coupled formylpeptide receptor, FPR2. Selected all&#8208;cis&#8208;ring cyclohexylalanines of this class are also incorporated into a keto&#8208;piperazine molecular scaffold to generate sp3&#8208;rich derivatives for assays against the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. For these cyclohexylalanine analogs bioactivity trends correlate progressively with the levels of fluorination in each of the case studies. Notably, the all&#8208;cis pentafluorocyclohexylalanine analog of the W&#8208;peptide is least active perhaps correlating with the well&#8208;known polarity of this &#8216;Janus face&#8217; cyclohexane. Although the trend is also apparent in the anti&#8208;trypanosomal assays of the keto&#8208;piperazine derivatives, it is less so and some compounds are more active than the previously reported phenylalanine&#8208;derived analog.

         <title>From Molecule to Meaning: Click and Bioorthogonal Chemical Reporters for Plant Systems, Biological Imaging, and Artistic Expression</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At the intersection of chemical biology, plant imaging, and contemporary art, this review introduces the concept of chembioart. By tracing how chemical reporters illuminate plant biomolecules in vivo, their role not only in advancing scientific understanding but also in inspiring transdisciplinary collaborations and visual expression&#160;is highlighted.

Chemical biology has reshaped the ability to investigate complex biological systems at the molecular level. In this context, chemical reporters have become important tools for labeling and tracking biomolecules in living systems with spatial and temporal precision. In plant biology, they provide an alternative to genetic approaches and allow the study of dynamic processes in species or organs that are not easily accessible. Through the use of click and bioorthogonal chemistry, small&#8208;molecule probes can be metabolically incorporated into specific molecular scaffolds such as sugars, monolignols, amino acids, and lipids. These probes make it possible to follow events like glycosylation, lignification, lipid turnover, or protein synthesis in living plant tissues. This review presents an overview of current chemical reporter strategies, from molecular design and synthetic considerations to their application in plant imaging. Herein, how these tools have contributed to the development of plant chemical biology by enabling precise and modular investigations of plant structure and metabolism is described. Herein, it is also examined how chemical reporters have entered interdisciplinary contexts, including collaborations between science and the arts. By converting molecular&#8208;level information into visual and sensory formats, these approaches open new perspectives for research, education, and communication across scientific and creative disciplines.

Advances in Hydrocarbon Stapled Peptides via Ring&#8208;Closing Metathesis: Synthetic Strategies, Structural Diversity, and Therapeutic Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrocarbon stapled peptides, including single, multiple, and stitched stapling strategies, improve &#945;&#8208;helical conformation, enhance resistance to proteolytic degradation, and increase biological activity. These structural modifications significantly broaden the therapeutic potential of peptides across cancer, infectious diseases, and other biomedical applications.

Peptide stapling has emerged as a powerful strategy to stabilize &#945;&#8208;helical structures in peptides, thereby enhancing their proteolytic resistance, membrane permeability, and biological activity. Among the various stapling methodologies, hydrocarbon stapling via ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing metathesis remains the most widely adopted due to its robust chemical efficiency and synthetic compatibility with solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. This review summarizes key advancements in hydrocarbon stapling technologies, including mono&#8208; and multiple&#8208;stapling, solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;phase approaches, and newer developments such as stitched and aza&#8208;stapled peptides. The integration of rigidified anchoring residues (e.g., cyclobutane or carbocyclic &#945;, &#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acids) and orthogonal metathesis strategies has significantly expanded the structural diversity and functional potential of stapled peptides.

     alt="&amp;#xA;Advances in Hydrocarbon Stapled Peptides via Ring-Closing Metathesis: Synthetic Strategies, Structural Diversity, and Therapeutic Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrocarbon stapled peptides, including single, multiple, and stitched stapling strategies, improve &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-helical conformation, enhance resistance to proteolytic degradation, and increase biological activity. These structural modifications significantly broaden the therapeutic potential of peptides across cancer, infectious diseases, and other biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peptide stapling has emerged as a powerful strategy to stabilize &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-helical structures in peptides, thereby enhancing their proteolytic resistance, membrane permeability, and biological activity. Among the various stapling methodologies, hydrocarbon stapling via ruthenium-catalyzed ring-closing metathesis remains the most widely adopted due to its robust chemical efficiency and synthetic compatibility with solid-phase peptide synthesis. This review summarizes key advancements in hydrocarbon stapling technologies, including mono- and multiple-stapling, solution- and solid-phase approaches, and newer developments such as stitched and aza-stapled peptides. The integration of rigidified anchoring residues (e.g., cyclobutane or carbocyclic &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-disubstituted amino acids) and orthogonal metathesis strategies has significantly expanded the structural diversity and functional potential of stapled peptides. Furthermore, novel bioorthogonal modifications and imaging capabilities, such as Raman-active diyne bridges, have opened new directions in therapeutic and diagnostic applications.

         <title>Glycoproteins, Glycolipids, or Both: Why do Glycosyltransferases Recognize Different Acceptors?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are essential enzymes for glycan biosynthesis and exhibit varying specificity toward glycoprotein&#8208; and glycolipid&#8208;based acceptors. This review highlights the molecular basis of GT acceptor promiscuity with its impact on disease progression in humans and potential implications in glycobiotechnology.

Glycosylation is an important post&#8208;translational modification catalyzed by glycosyltransferases (GTs), which comprise a large group of enzymes with diversified specificity. Most GTs show high specificity toward donor and acceptor molecules, but some can recognize several donor or acceptor molecules and/or create novel glycosidic linkage types. This promiscuity has profound implications for cellular processes, influencing signaling pathways, protein stability, and disease progression. GT promiscuity may result from the structural peculiarities of the enzyme and acceptor, modulation by a ligand, oligomerization with other enzymes, or its subcellular localization. In this review, current insights into GT promiscuity are discussed, highlighting its biological significance and potential associations with human diseases. A better understanding of how GTs work will be essential for developing novel therapeutic approaches and obtaining enzymes with improved properties, which are desirable in the emerging field of glycobiotechnology.

Advanced Antibody&#8211;Drug Conjugates Design: Innovation in Linker Chemistry and Site&#8208;Specific Conjugation Technologies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study highlights the importance of linker and conjugation technology in antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs). The schematic shows an antibody with a payload attached via a linker. The linker ensures stable attachment, enabling targeted drug delivery to specific cells, minimizing off&#8208;target effects, and enhancing therapeutic outcomes. This research underscores the critical role of precise conjugation in ADC efficacy and safety.

Antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a promising class of targeted cancer therapies, with the potential to improve treatment precision because of their unique mechanism of selectively delivering cytotoxic payloads (PLs) to tumor cells. ADCs combine a monoclonal antibody directed against a tumor&#8208;associated antigen with a potent cytotoxic PL via a covalent linker which connects the PL to the antibody. Several ADCs have been approved for clinical use in oncology, including Mylotarg, Adcetris, Kadcyla, Besponsa, Polivy, Lumoxiti, Padcev, Enhertu, Trodelvy, Aidixi, Zynlonta, Tivdak, Elahere, Datroway, and Emrelis. This review focuses on recent advances in linker chemistry and site&#8208;specific conjugation technologies, which are critical for optimizing ADC design and improving therapeutic indices. The development of next&#8208;generation ADCs has focused on overcoming challenges related to linker stability, efficiency of target antigen internalization, and pharmacokinetics. Traditional conjugation methods, such as lysine or cysteine conjugation, have been widely used but are associated with inherent issues of heterogeneity and instability. Advances in linker chemistry, such as the development of novel cleavable linkers, have significantly contributed to the clinical success of ADCs. In this review, different linker components are discussed, including chemical handles for conjugation, spacers to improve hydrophobicity, and triggers for PL release. In addition, innovative conjugation strategies are highlighted, which enhance ADC homogeneity and stability. The site&#8208;specific conjugation and therapeutic performance benefits of technologies such as THIOMAB, SMARTag, microbial transglutaminase, glycan remodeling, and AJICAP are discussed. The toxicity profiles of ADCs and strategies are also addressed to mitigate off&#8208;target effects and systemic toxicity. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of linker and conjugation technologies in ADC development.

         <title>A Review of Polyhydroxybutyrate Biosynthesis by Different Microorganisms</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights advances in microbial polyhydroxybutyrate biosynthesis as a sustainable alternative to petroleum&#8208;based plastics. It emphasizes cost&#8208;effective production strategies using engineered microbial systems, low&#8208;cost carbon sources, and waste&#8208;derived feedstocks, supporting circular economy goals. The work also discusses bioprocess innovations that reduce energy use, avoid harsh chemicals, and enhance resource efficiency.

Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production from renewable biomass feedstocks using microorganisms provides a sustainable alternative to petroleum&#8208;based plastics, addressing critical challenges such as plastic pollution and fossil fuel consumption. Unlike previous reviews that primarily focus on single genera or metabolic mechanisms, this review provides a comprehensive comparison of multiple microbial platforms, emphasizing strain selection strategies, genetic engineering approaches, and substrate flexibility, particularly for waste valorization. Bacterial systems, while efficient, are limited by the high cost of sterile conditions. Engineered yeasts and fungi offer resilience to industrial stresses but face metabolic constraints. In addition, haloarchaeal extremophiles have gained attention for PHB synthesis under high&#8208;salinity, nonsterile conditions, offering unique advantages for cost&#8208;effective bioprocessing. Photosynthetic microorganisms integrate CO2 capture with PHB synthesis but face challenges like slow growth rates and low yields. Mixed microbial cultures provide a cost&#8208;effective approach by utilizing low&#8208;cost substrates under nonsterile conditions, though optimizing enrichment strategies remain essential to improving productivity. Future directions highlight the significance of evaluating strain selection strategies, advancing genetic engineering approaches, and scaling up production processes. Additionally, assessing technoeconomic viability and life&#8208;cycle environmental impact is crucial to support the development of PHB as a scalable, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally friendly solution for the circular economy.

Additionally, assessing technoeconomic viability and life-cycle environmental impact is crucial to support the development of PHB as a scalable, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly solution for the circular economy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Vivo Biosynthesis and Direct Incorporation of Noncanonical Amino Acids into Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review evaluates engineered (semi)autonomous cell systems for the biosynthesis and incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins. While semi&#8208;autonomous cells convert supplied precursors into ncAAs autonomous cells integrate biosynthetic pathways that produce these building blocks intracellularly. Such integrated approaches significantly reduce process costs, can increase protein yields, and overcome challenges such as the limited membrane permeability of ncAAs.

Autonomous cells are engineered biological systems capable of biosynthesising and directly incorporating noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins. These systems have the potential to extend the applicability of the genetic code to enable large&#8208;scale fermentative production of proteins carrying ncAAs. This work evaluates approaches for the generation of autonomous and semi&#8208;autonomous cells. Semi&#8208;autonomous cells rely on the external addition of a precursor, which is enzymatically converted in&#8201;vivo to an ncAA that is directly incorporated. In contrast, autonomous cells have a metabolic system that produces and directly incorporates an ncAA in&#8201;vivo. Through a critical evaluation of the state of the art, the reader is provided with an opinion on the future development of the field.

         <title>Mechanoglycobiology: The Roles of Cell Surface Glycans in Mechanosensing and Mechanotransduction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycans in the cell glycocalyx play an important role in sensing and transducing biophysical cues, for example, mechanical forces applied to cells, to provoke cellular responses and mediate various physiological and pathological processes, which is the research subject of mechanoglycobiology and may have a wide range of biological and biomedical applications.

Mechanoglycobiology has emerged as a rapidly expanding interdisciplinary field that involves chemistry, biology, and engineering. Despite the great advancements in this field, in&#8208;depth investigation of mechanoglycobiology remains challenging due to the complex nature of glycans and cell glycocalyx, as well as the difficulty to mechanically target these biomolecules. To address the issues, novel methods and models have been established to facilitate the investigation of glycan&#8208;mediated mechanosensing and mechanotransduction. Recently, a new, metabolic glycoengineering&#8208;based approach has been developed to selectively label cell surface glycans. This enables the application of molecularly specific acoustic tweezing cytometry to exert targeted mechanical forces to understand how mechanical actuation of glycans influences cellular activities. This approach is applicable to different glycans and cell types and, therefore, can have a broad impact. The current perspective highlights how recent developments in mechanoglycobiology may improve the knowledge and appreciation of the significance of glycans in&#160;mechanotransduction as well as the potential applications of mechanoglycobiology in medicine.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Triggered Hyaluronic Acid Hydrogel for 3D Culture and Cell Recovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
GA: Cross&#8208;linking of hyaluronic acid modified by a strained alkyne with a photosensitive crosslinker terminating in azides gives hydrogels with tuneable mechanical properties. By tuning the wavelength of employed light, the hydrogel can either be fully degraded allowing harvesting of cultured cells or softened resulting in notable changes in cell morphology.

Properties of semisynthetic hydrogels can be fine&#8208;tuned, making these attractive for various applications in regenerative medicine. Herein, a hydrogel platform based on hyaluronic acid (HA) modified by (1R, 8S,9S)&#8208;bicycle[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;9&#8208;ylmethanol (BCN) and a cross&#8208;linker composed of light&#8208;sensitive o&#8208;nitrobenzyl and polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains terminating in azides is described. The two components can undergo strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition resulting in rapid gel formation. First, adipose&#8208;derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are incorporated in the hydrogel and it is demonstrated that the cells can be easily retrieved by UV light&#8208;mediated degradation, maintaining viability and retaining spindle&#8208;like shape when the cells are replated. Next, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of inducing light&#8208;mediated softening of the hydrogel to modulate the morphology of the encapsulated cells is provided. A co&#8208;culture of endothelial cells (cord blood&#8208;derived endothelial colony forming cells and bone marrow&#8208;derived MSCs), which is commonly studied for their ability to form capillary&#8208;like vascular networks, is cultured in the regular and light&#8208;induced softened hydrogels. Nonphotoexposed hydrogels show cells with a prevalently rounded morphology, whereas stretched cells connecting into a primitive capillary network are observed in the light&#8208;softened hydrogels. Photo&#8208;induced softening offers potential to locally control cell shape and self&#8208;organization capacity.

         <title>Exploring the Substrate Flexibility of GrsB Thioesterase Leads to the Structural Reassignment of a Gramicidin S Variant</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation of the substrate specificity of gramicidin S synthetase B&#8208;thioesterase reveals stereochemical flexibility, enabling the production of gramicidin S (GS) analogs with L&#8208; or D&#8208;Ser(Allyl). Structural reassignment of a GS variant (GS&#8208;SA) obtained from precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis is achieved using liquid chromatography&#8208;mass spectrometry, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance, and antimicrobial assays.

Gramicidin S (GS) is a cyclic decapeptide derived from two pentapeptides. The C&#8208;terminal thioesterase (TE) domain of gramicidin S synthetase B (GrsB) dimerizes precursor pentapeptides and cyclizes the resulting linear decapeptide. Recently, a GS variant (GS&#8208;SA), in which a single D&#8208;Phe is replaced by L&#8208;Ser(Allyl), is reported via precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis in a native GS producer. To understand how GrsB&#8208;TE processes such modified precursors, its substrate specificity using synthetic linear peptides is investigated. GrsB&#8208;TE cyclizes a substrate containing L&#8208;Ser(Allyl) at position 6 but not at position 1. However, the enzymatically synthesized GS&#8208;SA shows a different high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography retention time than that of the reported GS variant. Further structural and functional analyses, including 1H nuclear magnetic resonance, antimicrobial assays, and circular dichroism spectroscopy, reveal that the reported GS&#8208;SA contained D&#8208;Ser(Allyl) rather than L&#8208;Ser(Allyl). These findings reveal a previously unrecognized stereochemical flexibility in GrsB&#8208;TE and support the structural revision of the reported GS variant.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Dithiocarbamato Glycoconjugates as Potential Anticancer Agents: Design, Physico&#8208;Chemical Characterization, and In Vitro Biological Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;dithiocarbamato glycoconjugates based on gold(III), gold(I)&#8208;phosphino, and gold(I)&#8208;carbene scaffolds are here investigated as potential anticancer agents. Contrary to expectations, they induce cell death by acting at the extracellular level rather than targeting overexpressed glucose transporters.

To develop new metal&#8208;based glycoconjugates as potential anticancer agents, three gold(III)&#8208;dithiocarbamato glycoconjugates of the type [AuIIIBr2(SSC&#8208;Inp&#8208;GlcN)] (Au3&#8208;5), their gold(I)&#8208;phosphine counterparts [AuI(SSC&#8208;Inp&#8208;GlcN)(PPh3)] (AuP3&#8208;5), and gold(I)&#8208;carbene analogs [AuI(SSC&#8208;Inp&#8208;GlcN)(Et2BzImy)] (AuC3&#8208;5) (Inp: isonipecotic moiety; GlcN: amino&#8208;glucose scaffold; Et2BzImy: 1,3&#8208;diethylbenzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene moiety), as well as the corresponding non&#8208;glycosylated counterparts (Au1&#8208;2, AuP1&#8208;2, and AuC1&#8208;2) bearing a terminal ester or amide function, are generated and characterized by means of several analytical techniques (FT&#8208;IR, 1H&#8208;/13C&#8208;NMR, UV&#8211;Vis, X&#8208;ray crystallography). Their stability under physiologically relevant conditions (phosphate&#8208;buffered saline solution) has also been evaluated. Contrary to the gold(III)&#8208;glycoconjugates, the glucose&#8208;functionalized gold(I) derivatives show a significant antiproliferative effect against colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT&#8208;29), metastatic breast adenocarcinoma (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231), and breast adenocarcinoma (MCF&#8208;7) cells, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range, the gold(I)&#8208;phosphine derivatives turning up to be the best performers. Cell uptake studies show no evident correlation between cell growth inhibition and cellular uptake, and the use of glucose&#8208;free cell culture media and a GLUT1 inhibitor rules out the involvement of glucose transporters in cell internalization, thus suggesting alternative cell death pathways such as acting at extracellular level (especially for the gold(I) derivatives).

&lt;p&gt;To develop new metal-based glycoconjugates as potential anticancer agents, three gold(III)-dithiocarbamato glycoconjugates of the type [Au&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SSC-Inp-GlcN)] (&lt;b&gt;Au3-5&lt;/b&gt;), their gold(I)-phosphine counterparts [Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;(SSC-Inp-GlcN)(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;AuP3-5&lt;/b&gt;), and gold(I)-carbene analogs [Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;(SSC-Inp-GlcN)(Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BzImy)] (&lt;b&gt;AuC3-5&lt;/b&gt;) (Inp: isonipecotic moiety; GlcN: amino-glucose scaffold; Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BzImy: 1,3-diethylbenzimidazol-2-ylidene moiety), as well as the corresponding non-glycosylated counterparts (&lt;b&gt;Au1-2&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;AuP1-2,&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;AuC1-2&lt;/b&gt;) bearing a terminal ester or amide function, are generated and characterized by means of several analytical techniques (FT-IR, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-/&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-NMR, UV&#8211;Vis, X-ray crystallography). Their stability under physiologically relevant conditions (phosphate-buffered saline solution) has also been evaluated. Contrary to the gold(III)-glycoconjugates, the glucose-functionalized gold(I) derivatives show a significant antiproliferative effect against colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT-29), metastatic breast adenocarcinoma (MDA-MB-231), and breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cells, with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values in the low micromolar range, the gold(I)-phosphine derivatives turning up to be the best performers. Cell uptake studies show no evident correlation between cell growth inhibition and cellular uptake, and the use of glucose-free cell culture media and a GLUT1 inhibitor rules out the involvement of glucose transporters in cell internalization, thus suggesting alternative cell death pathways such as acting at extracellular level (especially for the gold(I) derivatives).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Docking and Molecular Dynamics Simulation&#8208;Based Analysis of Advanced Small&#8208;Molecule Kinase Inhibitors Identified pre&#8208;let&#8208;7 miRNA Binders</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated computational approach evaluating the binding between pre&#8208;let&#8208;7 microRNA and small&#8208;molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) revealed varied pre&#8208;let&#8208;7 binding affinities among the advanced SMKIs. The results justified the characterization of potential RNA targets for kinase inhibitors and small molecules with protein targets in general.

RNAs play crucial roles in various cellular actions, and the uncontrolled expression or improper folding of RNAs is a cause of many diseases. Certain oncogenic phenotypes stem from the overexpression of regulatory microRNAs that contain secondary structural elements. Thus, targeting disease&#8208;related microRNAs with small molecules is a potential therapeutic&#160;strategy that has attracted growing interest. To probe the RNA&#8208;binding chemical space held in advanced small&#8208;molecule therapeutics, in this work, we screened the 78 FDA&#8208;approved small&#8208;molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) as representatives of the most advanced kinase inhibitors for their binding affinity with pre&#8208;let&#8208;7 miRNA via a combination of computational methods and biophysical measurement. The best&#8208;ranked SMKIs based on docking scores were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation studies, followed by analysis of different computational parameters. Collectively, it provided reliable information on the binding affinity for the top&#8208;performed SMKI in the formation of SMKI&#8211;miRNA complexes with pre&#8208;let&#8208;7. Furthermore, the identification of the predicted most promising SMKI&#8211;miRNA interactions was validated by microscale thermophoresis, measuring direct binding affinities. This study evaluating the binding landscapes of the 78 FDA&#8208;approved SMKIs with pre&#8208;let&#8208;7 miRNA served as an example highlighting the necessity to characterize the biological targets of SMKIs, many of which are FDA&#8208;approved cancer agents, at the transcriptomic level with RNAs. The study also illustrates the possibility that the interaction with RNA targets may contribute to the observed biological and clinical performance of these approved SMKIs.

         <title>Internal Ubiquitin Electrophiles for Covalent Trapping and Inhibition of Deubiquitinases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
GA: Genetically encoded internal electrophiles in ubiquitin (Ub) enable the profiling of multivalent interaction interfaces, addressing a key limitation of current Ub&#8208;based activity&#8208;based probes. In this study, these probes capture a Ub&#8211;deubiquitinase interaction with minimal structural perturbation and serve as selective diUb probes that covalently target the catalytic cysteines of Met1&#8208;specific Dubs. 

The ubiquitin (Ub) system governs vital cellular processes in eukaryotic biology through an intricate network of Ub&#8211;protein interactions. While semisynthetic C&#8208;terminal Ub electrophiles (UbEs) are widely used to study Ub transfer and deubiquitinase (Dub) activity, they are limited to probing the active site while leaving other functionally important sites unexplored. Building on previously identified multivalent interaction interfaces and potential allosteric sites which are key to understanding their dynamic nature, here we report the development of genetically encoded Ub&#8208;based probes to covalently tether Ub&#8208;protein interactions in a proximity&#8208;driven manner at distal locations away from the active site. This study demonstrates that UbEs with internal electrophiles maintain conformational changes observed with their C&#8208;terminal counterparts while circumventing their limitations in capturing distal binding&#8208;site complexes, an emerging feature in Ub&#8208;mediated regulation. Genetically encoding these electrophiles further demonstrate rational variation as activity&#8208;based probes (ABP), leading to a Met1&#8208;diUb ABP showing preference for OTULIN over other Met1 cleaving Dubs. Taken together, our study introduces genetically encoded Ub&#8208;based probes to explore the structural and biochemical significance of Ub&#8208;Dub interactions beyond the canonical S1 site, overcoming some limitations of traditional Ub C&#8208;terminal electrophiles.

         <title>Precision Delivery of CRISPR/Cas Systems via DNA Nanostructures for Gene Therapy and Intracellular Detection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of gene editing technology has catalyzed a paradigm shift in life science research, with the CRISPR/Cas system emerging as a cornerstone tool in modern biology due to its transformative capabilities. This review systematically examines current delivery modalities for CRISPR/Cas systems (Cas9, Cas12, Cas13), with particular emphasis on the implementation of DNA&#8208;based functional materials as advanced delivery vehicles.

The CRISPR/Cas system represents a transformative breakthrough in genome editing technology, featuring three principal effector proteins with distinct functionalities: Cas9, which induces site&#8208;specific double&#8208;strand breaks guided by a single guide RNA, enabling precise gene knockout and knock&#8208;in modifications; Cas12, which mediates targeted DNA cleavage through cis&#8208;activity while exhibiting nonspecific trans&#8208;cleavage of single&#8208;stranded DNA, a property exploited for ultrasensitive nucleic acid detection in molecular diagnostics; and Cas13, an RNA&#8208;guided RNase that specifically degrades complementary RNA transcripts, demonstrating significant potential for antiviral therapies and transcriptome regulation. Despite these advances, the clinical translation of CRISPR/Cas systems faces substantial challenges, particularly in achieving efficient and controllable delivery. This reviewsystematically examines current delivery modalities for CRISPR/Cas systems, with particular emphasis on the implementation of DNA&#8208;based functional materials as advanced delivery vehicles. The integration of multifunctional DNA nanostructures with diverse CRISPR/Cas systems may facilitate the development of integrated theranostic platforms, thereby advancing precision medicine through synergistic bioengineering approaches.

         <title>Regulation of Gene Expression of Mouse D&#8208;Amino Acid Oxidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover illustration shows the transcriptional regulation of the mouse D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAO) gene. Key TFs act on the core promoter to stimulate DAO expression, leading to D&#8208;serine metabolism and influencing neurotransmission. This reflects the study's discovery of conserved regulatory elements in DAO gene control.

D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAO) catalyzes oxidative deamination of D&#8208;amino acids, producing 2&#8208;oxo acids, hydrogen peroxide, and ammonia. In mammals, DAO is essential for metabolizing both endogenous and exogenous D&#8208;amino acids. Previous studies on human DAO identify two promoter regions (P1 and P2), a negative regulatory element in intron 1, and several transcription factor (TF) binding sites. In this study, the regulatory mechanism of mouse DAO gene expression is investigated to compare with the human system. To determine the promoter activity in the upstream region of the initiation site, plasmids containing mouse DAO gene fragments inserted into the pGL4 [luc2P/Hygro] vector and assessed luciferase activity in LLC&#8208;PK1 cells are constructed. A series of deletion constructs is analyzed, revealing promoter activity in all tested fragments. The highest promoter activity is detected in the &#8722;333/&#8722;87 subregion, with residual activities in the &#8722;87/&#8201;+&#8201;111 region. Bioinformatics analysis identifies TFs, including NEUR, EGRF, ZF07, ZF11, KLFS, SP1F, and ZF02, which bind to both the human and mouse DAO genes at conserved positions, suggesting their critical role in regulating DAO promoter activity.

Hetero&#8208;tetramer dysfunction: Li&#8211;Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a hereditary cancer predisposition caused by mutations in the TP53 gene encoding the tumor suppressor p53. It is shown that p53 variants R337C and R337H, found in LFS, impair wild&#8208;type (WT) p53 function by forming heterotetramers with reduced transcriptional activity. This dominant&#8208;negative&#8208;like effect may explain tissue&#8208;specific tumor susceptibility in LFS.

Li&#8211;Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an inherited cancer predisposition disorder caused by heterozygous TP53 mutations. Among these, missense mutations at Arg337&#8212;such as R337C and R337H&#8212;are common in LFS patients. Although many studies have characterized individual p53 variants in LFS, the impact of tetramerization domain (TD) mutations on wild&#8208;type (WT) p53 function remains unclear. Herein, a novel FRET&#8208;based assay system that enables the simultaneous detection of heterotetramer formation and p53&#8208;dependent transcriptional activity in live cells is developed. These results show that the heteromultimerization of the R337C variant with WT p53 is only slightly reduced compared to WT homotetramers, yet its transcriptional activity is diminished by over 50%. In contrast, the R337H variant forms heterotetramers at near&#8208;normal levels but exhibits markedly compromised transcriptional activity. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized dominant&#8208;negative&#8208;like effect, suggesting reduced p53 function is due not only to decreased tetramer formation but also to diminished heterotetramer stability. Moreover, the LFS&#8208;associated p53TD variants show a greater loss of activity against the low&#8208;affinity, apoptosis&#8208;inducing bax response element than against the high&#8208;affinity, cell cycle arrest&#8208;related CDKN1A response element. Collectively, this study demonstrates that p53TD mutations can exert dominant&#8208;negative effects, advancing the understanding of p53 heteromultimer function in LFS pathogenesis. These mechanistic insights into p53 heterotetramer stability may not only inform genetic screening strategies for LFS but also support future therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring p53 function by stabilizing mutant tetramers.

         <title>Chemically Synthesized LRAD3&#8208;D1 Interacts with N&#8208;Terminal Domain of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein</title>

Chemical synthesis, calcium&#8208;templated in&#8208;vitro folding and competitive ELISA assay reveal that only domain 1 of the LRAD3 ectodomain interacts with the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;related corona virus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) spike NTD, while domains 2 and 3 do not, providing valuable insight into ACE2&#8208;independent viral entry pathways that may contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches targeting SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 strains associated with severe neurological complications.

Growing evidence of post&#8208;COVID neurological complications, such as encephalopathy, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment, suggests severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;related corona virus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) viral infection into the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of viral entry into the CNS, where human angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is barely expressed, is critical for addressing the neurological consequences of COVID&#8208;19. Importantly, the low&#8208;density lipoprotein receptor class A domain containing 3 (LRAD3) is overexpressed in brain cells, suggesting a possible ACE2&#8208;independent alternate pathway of viral entry into brain cells. Herein, the interaction of the chemically synthesized LRAD3 domains with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein is reported. It is observed that the extracellular domains of LRAD3 depend on calcium for proper folding and maintaining their structural integrity. The results reveal that domain 1 of LRAD3, which is most accessible from the cell surface, engages with the N&#8208;terminal domain of the viral spike protein. These findings open up possibilities to develop new therapeutic strategies targeting ACE2 independent viral entry pathways.

         <title>Binding of Hg(I) and Hg(II) Ions to Amyloid&#8208;Beta (A&#946;) Peptide Variants Affect Their Structure and Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mercury (Hg) exposure is a possible risk factor for Alzheimer&#180;s disease (AD). Some studies reported higher Hg levels in AD patients, but evidence is inconclusive. A mechanism linking Hg exposure to AD neuropathology remains to be found. The hallmark of AD brains is deposits of insoluble amyloid plaques consisting mainly of aggregated amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides.
&#160;
Here, we use transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and biophysical spectroscopy techniques to study in vitro interactions between inorganic Hg and pathologically relevant A&#946;(1&#8208;40) and A&#946;(4&#8208;40) variants and the A&#946;(1&#8208;40)(H6A, H13A, H14A) mutant. For the first time, effect on A&#946; aggregation of both Hg(I) and Hg(II) is compared.
&#160;
Hg(II) binds A&#946;(1&#8208;40) with apparent binding affinity of 28&#177;8 &#181;M, at 20 &#176;C in 20 mM MES buffer, pH 7.3. The N&#8208;terminal His6, His13 and His14 residues are involved in binding coordination. Hg(II) binding induces structural alterations (coil&#8208;coil interactions) in A&#946; monomers positioned in membrane&#8208;mimicking SDS micelles. Equimolar amounts of either Hg(I) or Hg(II) inhibit normal A&#946; fibrillation by directing aggregation towards formation of large amorphous aggregates. All these structural rearrangements may be relevant for the harmful A&#946; aggregation processes involved in AD brain pathology. Inducing protein misfolding and aggregation might be a general toxic mechanism of mercury.</dc:description>
