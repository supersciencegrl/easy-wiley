      <title>Synthesis of Se&#8208;Heterocycles by Cascade Cyclization of Alkynes Containing Heteroatoms</title>
      <dc:description>Over the last decades, many methods have been reported for the synthesis of selenium&#8208; heterocyclic scaffolds by virtue of their interesting reactivities and a broad range of applications in the medicinal and material chemistry. This review involves the electrophilic/radical cyclization of alkynes containing heteroatoms which resulted into the novel Se&#8208;heterocycles. The synthesis of seleno&#8208;heterocycles via different nucleophiles including O, N, S, Se, Te, and C&#8208;nucleophiles is exhaustively discussed. Also, one&#8208;pot electrophilic cyclization of 1,3&#8208;diynes and 1,3,5&#8208;triynes was described in details. Furthermore, the various mechanisms underlying the synthesis of selenium&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactam, carbapenem heterocycle, bis&#8208; and tris&#8208;selenide alkene, &#946;&#8208;selenosulfonation and selenated alkynes were discussed. The Se&#8208;heterocyles reported in this review allow preparing these selenated compounds bearing the selenium moiety both on the rings (outside) and inside the ring (e.g. selenophenes). The review outline show the growing opportunities to construct the alkyne heteroatom resulted in the selenium containing heterocycles.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective Heck&#8208;Matsuda Reactions of Spirocyclopentenyl Hydantoins Directed by Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions: Application in the 2nd Generation Total Synthesis of the (S,S)&#8208;Sphingosine&#8208;1&#8208;Phosphate Receptor 1 Agonist VPC01091</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. A highly efficient Heck&#8208;Matsuda desymmetrization of unsaturated spirohydantoins directed by non&#8208;covalent interactions, which allows the construction of two simultaneous stereogenic centers, including a trisubstituted quaternary one, is described. This Heck arylation permitted a novel enantioselective total synthesis of the S1PR1 agonist (also an S1PR3 antagonist) compound VPC01091, a potential drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. The broad scope of these enantioselective Heck&#8208;Matsuda arylations of the spirohydantoins provided several arylated spiro systems in yields ranging from 76% to 99%, with enantiomeric ratios (er) up to 97:3, and diastereoselectivities (dr) of &gt;20:1 in all cases studied. The method uses only 2% of Pd(TFA)2 and 3 mol% of the chiral N,N&#8208;ligand Pyrabox in short reaction times of 1&#8208;2 h. These enantioselective Heck arylations can also be carried out at the gram scale in high yields with no erosion of their diastereoselectivity or enantioselectivity.	The key spiro Heck products (R,R)&#8208;21 and (R,R)&#8208;27 bearing an aryl iodide moiety or an aryl n&#8208;octyl moiety were employed as starting materials for the total enantioselective syntheses of the (S,S)&#8208;VPC01091, in overall yields of 20% and 22% respectively after 10 or 9 steps from the starting spirohydantoin, with an er&gt; 95:5. Computational analysis of the enantioselective Heck&#8208;Matsuda desymmetrization supports the rationale involving a key non&#8208;covalent interaction between the imide carbonyl of the spirohydantoin and the cationic palladium bounded to the chiral N,N&#8208;ligand.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Carbonylative Difunctionalization of Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>The carbonylation reaction represents one of the most powerful methods for the rapid build&#8208;up of carbonyl structures and has widely applied in both academic and industry fields. Carbonylative difunctionalization of alkenes, which installs a unique functional group and a carbonyl group across the C&#8208;C double bonds, offers a high potential strategy for the selective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;substituted carbonyl compounds. The carbonylative difunctionalization of alkenes involves the formation of three &#963;&#8208;bonds and two stereocenters as well as a carbonyl group in a single transformation. Careful design of the substrate and control of reaction pathway would result unexpected advantages in constructing complex structures, which are ubiquitous in natural products, pharmaceuticals and functional materials. In this Review, the important advances and contributions in carbonylative difunctionalization of alkenes are summarized based on the different reaction types, with the wish to inspire future studies and promote further developments in this field.</dc:description>

      <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of N&#8208;Propargyl Alkynes and Axial Chiral N&#8208;Allenes with Epimeric Pyrroloimidazolone Auxiliaries</title>
      <dc:description>An N&#8208;propargyl pyrroloimidazolone with syn stereochemistry derived from L&#8208;proline serves as a starting material for the diastereoselective synthesis (&gt;95:5 dr) of propargyl alkynes or allenamides by direct quench of its lithiated intermediate with alkylating agents or aldehydes/ketones, respectively. Use of the epimeric anti pyrroloimidazolone starting material results in reversal of stereochemistry at the propargyl position in the products, without the need to prepare a separate substrate from D&#8208;proline. Lithiation of the syn pyrroloimidazolone and quench with prochiral benzaldehydes without prior transmetalation gives allenamides with crystallographically verified atypical stereochemistry of the benzylic alcohol in &gt;95:5 dr. The epimeric series of benzylic alcohols may also be obtained in &gt;95:5 dr by employing transmetalation with chlorotitanium triisopropoxide prior to aldehyde quench. Density Functional Theory (DFT) computational studies provide a rationale for the change in benzylic alcohol stereochemistry by virtue of differing stereofacial attack in 6,5&#8208;bicyclic (Li) or 6&#8208;membered (Ti) transition states.</dc:description>

      <title>The synthesis of chiral allyl carbamates via a merger of photoredox and nickel catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>A mild, and versatile, organophotoredox/Ni&#8208;mediated protocol was developed for the direct preparation of diverse, enantioenriched allyl carbamates. The reported approach represents a significant departure from classical step&#8208;by&#8208;step synthesis of allyl carbamates. This dual photoredox/Ni based strategy offers unrivalled capacity for convergent unification of readily available alkyl halides and chiral carbamates derived from 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;alken&#8208;3&#8208;ols with high chemoselectivity and efficiency. The reported photoredox/Ni catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction is not limited to carbamates, but also to other O&#8208;derivatives such as esters, ethers, acetals, carbonates or silyl ethers. 
To demonstrate the utility of the reported protocol, the resulting allyl carbamates were transformed into functionalized non&#8208;racemic allylamines through a sigmatropic rearrangement reaction in enantiospecific manner.

      <title>Zinc/Indium Bimetallic Lewis Acid Relay Catalysis for Dehydrogenative Silylation/Hydrosilylation Reaction of Terminal Alkynes with Bis(hydrosilane)s</title>
      <dc:description>When mixed with two different Lewis acid catalysts of zinc and indium, terminal alkynes were found to elegantly react with bis(hydrosilane)s to selectively give 1,1&#8208;disilylalkenes from among several possible products, by way of a sequential dehydrogenative silylation/intramolecular hydrosilylation reaction. Adding a pyridine base is crucial in this reaction; a switch as a catalyst of the zinc Lewis acid is turned on by forming a zinc&#8208;pyridine&#8208;base complex. A range of the 1,1&#8208;disilylalkenes can be obtained by a combination of aryl and aliphatic terminal alkynes plus aryl&#8208;, heteroaryl&#8208;, and naphthyl&#8208;tethered bis(hydrosilane)s. The 1,1&#8208;disilylalkene prepared here is available as a reagent for further transformations by utilizing its C&#8208;Si or C=C bond: the former includes Hiyama cross&#8208;coupling, bismuth&#8208;catalyzed ether formation, and iododesilylation; the latter includes double alkylation and epoxidation. Mechanistic studies clarified the role of the two Lewis acids: the zinc&#8208;pyridine&#8208;base complex catalyzes the dehydrogenative silylation as a first stage, and, following on this, the indium Lewis acid catalyzes the ring&#8208;closing hydrosilylation as a second stage, thus leading to the 1,1&#8208;disilylalkene.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When mixed with two different Lewis acid catalysts of zinc and indium, terminal alkynes were found to elegantly react with bis(hydrosilane)s to selectively give 1,1&#8208;disilylalkenes from among several possible products, by way of a sequential dehydrogenative silylation/intramolecular hydrosilylation reaction. Adding a pyridine base is crucial in this reaction; a switch as a catalyst of the zinc Lewis acid is turned on by forming a zinc&#8208;pyridine&#8208;base complex. A range of the 1,1&#8208;disilylalkenes can be obtained by a combination of aryl and aliphatic terminal alkynes plus aryl&#8208;, heteroaryl&#8208;, and naphthyl&#8208;tethered bis(hydrosilane)s. The 1,1&#8208;disilylalkene prepared here is available as a reagent for further transformations by utilizing its C&#8208;Si or C=C bond: the former includes Hiyama cross&#8208;coupling, bismuth&#8208;catalyzed ether formation, and iododesilylation; the latter includes double alkylation and epoxidation. Mechanistic studies clarified the role of the two Lewis acids: the zinc&#8208;pyridine&#8208;base complex catalyzes the dehydrogenative silylation as a first stage, and, following on this, the indium Lewis acid catalyzes the ring&#8208;closing hydrosilylation as a second stage, thus leading to the 1,1&#8208;disilylalkene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light Induced C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization for the Formation of C&#8722;N Bonds under Metal Catalyst&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>The construction of C&#8722;N bonds is a central tenet of modern synthetic chemistry as it widely exists in bioactive molecules, natural products, and functional materials. Visible&#8208;light induced strategies can serve as particularly powerful tools for achieving C&#8722;N bond formation. This mini review summarizes the recent advancements in the transformation of C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds into C&#8722;N bonds via photocatalysis under metal catalyst&#8208;free conditions. These reactions generally occur in the presence of abundant and clean visible&#8208;light at ambient temperature without the use of metal catalysts, which undoubtedly represents a future trend in green and sustainable chemistry. The main achievements in this area from 2015 until the present are described according to the type of nitrogen sources and emphasis is placed on the working mechanisms.

      <title>Recent Progress on Reductive Coupling of Nitroarenes by Using Organosilanes as Convenient Reductants</title>
      <dc:description>Nitroarenes are stable, low&#8208;cost, and readily available starting materials. The directly utilize nitroarenes in synthetically valuable C&#8211;N bond formation is of great significance, because the pre&#8208;reduction step to corresponding amines can be avoided. Previously, phosphines and carbon monoxide (CO) are the most widely used reductants in the reductive cyclization or/and carbonylation of nitroarenes. Currently, much attention has been attracted to organosilanes as new potential reducing agents, not only because they are inexpensive, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, and mild reagents, but also various novel reaction models of nitroarenes have been explored. In this review, we mainly summarize the recent progress on the reductive coupling of nitroarenes by using organosilanes as the end reductants. We hope that a deep understanding of the reaction model and underlying working mechanism can provide a timely guideline for researchers who are interested in this fantastic area, leading to further exploration of practical and efficient reductive coupling of nitroarenes for C&#8208;N bond formation and N&#8208;heterocycle synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>Advances in the Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Atropisomeric Hexatomic N&#8208;Heterobiaryls</title>
      <dc:description>Axially chiral hexatomic N&#8208;heterobiaryls are among the most important class of structures with extensive utility in asymmetric catalysis as chiral ligands and organocatalysts, as exemplified by QUINAP and QUINOX. Besides, these atropisomers have attracted broad attention due to their application in drug discovery. Hence, it is not surprising that extensive efforts have been devoted for the pursue of efficient catalytic asymmetric methods for their direct and atroposelective construction. In addition to the direct heteroaryl&#8208;aryl cross&#8208;coupling, which remains as a challenge, a series of creative catalytic asymmetric strategies based on pre&#8208;formed heterobiaryl systems have been developed by taking advantage of the intrinstic property of N atom on the heteroarenes. Generally, the methods employed extensively involved kinetic resolution, dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation, dynamic kinetic resolution and desymmetrization reaction. A growing number of approaches through stereoselective de novo formation of a six&#8208;membered
N&#8208;heteroaromatic ring have also been reported for specific applications in this field. This review summarizes recent advancements of axially chiral hexatomic N&#8208;heterobiaryls construction by means of asymmetric catalysis, including their scope, limitations, mechanisms and applications.

      <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Alkyne Functionalization by N&#8208;O/S&#8208;O/C&#8208;O Bond Oxidants</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract: Since the beginning of this century, homogeneous gold&#8208;catalyzed alkyne transformations have been an active area of research in pursuit of developing novel and efficient synthetic methodologies. This emerging area of research which at the beginning exploited the mild Lewis acid character of gold and its propensity to form &#960;&#8208;complex with alkyne, has been reinvigorated upon the discovery of gold&#8208;catalyzed oxidative alkyne functionalization in 2007. The gold&#8208;catalyzed alkyne oxidation enabled direct access to &#945;&#8208;oxo gold carbenes and gold alkynal complex with versatile reactivity which has been applied to achieve novel transformations including but not limited to oxyarylation, C&#8722;H, X&#8722;H (X = N, O) insertion, cyclization, cycloaddition, ring expansion, and various novel cascade reaction. This review provides a comprehensive summary of methods, applications and mechanistic insight of gold&#8208;catalyzed oxidative alkyne functionalization by N&#8722;O/S&#8722;O/C&#8722;O bond oxidants covering the literature reports appeared since 2007.</dc:description>

      <title>Double Carbonylation Reactions: Overview and Recent Advances</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. The compounds like amides, carbamates, oxamates, oxamides, &#945;&#8208;keto amides, diketones, esters, ureas, etc. find extensive applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and organic synthesis. The classical syntheses of these compounds often involve cumbersome routes involving toxic chemicals. The carbonylation reactions such as aminocarbonylation, alkoxycarbonylation, oxidative carbonylation and double carbonylation deliver as an efficient and attractive alternative to the conventional synthetic routes even at industrial scale. The catalytic single carbonylation reactions are extensively studied, however, catalytic double carbonylation reactions are not explored for several potential applications. This review covers literature on the use of different types of catalysts involving various	metals like Pd, Cu, Fe, Co, Rh and Ni for double carbonylation reactions along with the chemistry of associated ligands. It also covers double carbonylation used for synthesis of different types of novel substrates with the discussion related to mechanism of formations of mono and di carbonylation products. The notable introduction of several CO&#8208;surrogates and exploration of their efficiency have solved the problems related to the toxicity of CO.  CO&#8208;surrogates used for double carbonylation reactions are also discussed.</dc:description>

CO&#8208;surrogates used for double carbonylation reactions are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Efficient Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate [NADP(H)] Recycling in Closed&#8208;Loop Continuous Flow Biocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
The front cover picture, designed by Thomas Classen from the group of J&#246;rg Pietruszka, illustrates an efficient closed&#8208;loop cofactor recycling in continuous flow biocatalysis. This was achieved by using phase separation techniques in combination with an immobilized alcohol dehydrogenase as biocatalyst and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate as cofactor. The system was applied to different substrates, allowing rapid substrate change and providing efficient long&#8208;term runs. Details of this work can be found in the full paper on pages XXXX&#8211;YYYY (B. Baumer, T. Classen, M. Pohl, J. Pietruszka, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2020, 362, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202000058).

      <title>Synthesis of Heteroarene&#8208;Fused Cyclopentadienes and Related Compounds Suitable for Metallocene Preparation</title>
      <dc:description>Metallocene catalysis is widely used in transformations of unsaturated organic compounds, including the bulk industrial synthesis of polyolefins. Over the last few decades, the electronic and structural properties of their &#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;coordinated ligands have been modified by introducing electron&#8208;donating, electron&#8208;withdrawing, and sterically hindered substituents to obtain desirable catalytic properties for the metallocenes. An efficient way to design &#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;coordinated ligands is to exploit the annelation of heterocyclic fragments with a cyclopentadiene ring. In the present review, we summarize, systematize, and analyze synthetic approaches to heterocycle&#8208;fused cyclopentadienes suitable for metallocene catalyst preparation.
