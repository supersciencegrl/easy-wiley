Abstract
Two EWG&#8208;activated Hoveyda&#8208;Grubbs&#8208;type ruthenium complexes (Sil&#8208;II and Sil&#8208;II&#8217;) were obtained, characterized, and screened in a set of olefin metathesis reactions. These catalysts were conveniently synthesized from a commercially available pharmaceutical building block &#8211; Sildenafil aldehyde &#8211; in two steps only. Stability and catalytic activity tests disclosed that the bulkier NHC&#8208;ligand bearing catalyst Sil&#8208;II&#8217; is visibly more stable and productive than its smaller NHC&#8208;analogue Sil&#8208;II. Good application profile of catalyst Sil&#8208;II&#8217; was confirmed in a set of diverse metathesis reactions including ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) and cross&#8208;metathesis (CM) of complex polyfunctional substrates of medicinal chemistry interest, including a challenging macrocyclization of the Pacritinib precursor. Compatibility of the new catalyst with various green solvents was checked and metathesis of Sildenafil and Tadalafil&#8208;based substrates was successfully conducted in acetone. The mechanism of Sil&#8208;II&#8217; initiation has been investigated through kinetic experiments unveiling that the decrease of the steric hindrance of the chelating alkoxy moiety (from iPrO to EtO) favors the interchange initiation pathway over the typical dissociation pathway for other popular 2nd generation Hoveyda&#8208;Grubbs catalysts.

         <title>Biochemical and Structural Characterization of an (R)&#8208;Selective Transaminase in the Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Hydroxy Amines</title>

Abstract
An (R)&#8208;selective transaminase RbTA with excellent stereoselectivity (&gt;99% ee) in the asymmetric amination of hydroxy ketones was identified. Biochemical characterization showed that RbTA exhibited the highest activity toward 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone among reported enzymes, and that it has broad substrate specificity, including for aliphatic, aromatic, and alicyclic ketones. Crystallization of RbTA were performed, as were molecular docking and mutagenesis studies. Residue Tyr125 plays a key role in substrate recognition by forming a hydrogen bond with hydroxy ketone. The applicability of the enzyme was determined in preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of (R)&#8208;3&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;butanol, demonstrating the potential of RbTA as a green biocatalyst for production of value&#8208;added chiral hydroxy amines. This study provides an efficient tool for enzymatic synthesis of chiral hydroxy amines, as well as structural insight into substrate recognition by transaminases in the asymmetric amination of hydroxy ketones.

Abstract
This paper reports the transition metal&#8208;free C(sp3)&#8722;H sulfenylation of arylacetamides by using thiophenols as the sulfenyl reagents. The reactions take place in the presence of only K3PO4. Control experiments indicate that the reactions proceed via a featured sulfur&#8208;centred free radical intermediate. In addition, the synthesis of 2&#8208;thiomethyl benzoxazoles has been realized via the p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (p&#8208;TSA) promoted annulation of the sulfenylated products.

Abstract
The iodine&#8208;promoted oxidative domino annulation and carbonylation process has been developed for the synthesis of biologically important azaarene&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;b:4&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;e]pyridines (BPPs), diuracilpyridines and o&#8208;amino diheteroaryl ketones. The domino procedure proceeded with easily available methyl azaarenes, 5&#8208;aminouracils and substituted 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles. This protocol is a simple and metal&#8208;free approach which exhibits high functional group compatibility and broad substrates scope. Moreover, this transformation can be applied for the preparation of dipyrazolo/diuracil&#8208;fused pyridines on a gram scale.

Abstract
A catalytic carbonylative approach to the multicomponent synthesis of benzothiophene derivatives from simple building blocks [1&#8208;(2&#8208;(methylthio)phenyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ols, carbon monoxide, and an alcohol)] is presented. It is based on an S&#8208;cyclization&#8208;demethylation&#8208;alkoxycarbonylation&#8208;reduction sequence promoted by the PdI2/KI catalytic system, occurring under relatively mild conditions (40&#8197;atm, 80&#8201;&#176;C, 15&#8197;h). Benzothiophene&#8208;2&#8208;acetic esters are obtained in moderate to good yields (35&#8211;70%) starting from variously substituted substrates in combination with different alcohols as external nucleophiles (17&#8197;examples).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A catalytic carbonylative approach to the multicomponent synthesis of benzothiophene derivatives from simple building blocks [1-(2-(methylthio)phenyl)prop-2-yn-1-ols, carbon monoxide, and an alcohol)] is presented. It is based on an &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-cyclization-demethylation-alkoxycarbonylation-reduction sequence promoted by the PdI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/KI catalytic system, occurring under relatively mild conditions (40&#8197;atm, 80&#8201;&#176;C, 15&#8197;h). Benzothiophene-2-acetic esters are obtained in moderate to good yields (35&#8211;70%) starting from variously substituted substrates in combination with different alcohols as external nucleophiles (17&#8197;examples).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Indene Derived Phosphorus&#8208;Thioether Ligands for the Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Olefins with Diverse Substitution Patterns and Different Functional Groups</title>

Abstract
A family of phosphite/phosphinite&#8208;thioether ligands have been tested in the Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of a range of olefins (50 substrates in total). The presented ligands are synthesized in three steps from cheap indene and they are air&#8208;stable solids. Their modular architecture has been crucial to maximize the catalytic performance for each type of substrate. Improving most Ir&#8208;catalysts reported so far, this ligand family presents a broader substrate scope, covering different substitution patterns with different functional groups, ranging from unfunctionalized olefins, through olefins with poorly coordinative groups, to olefins with coordinative functional groups. &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated acyclic and cyclic esters, ketones and amides were	hydrogenated in enantioselectivities ranging from 83 to 99% ee. Enantioselectivities ranging from 91 to 98% ee were also achieved for challenging substrates such as unfunctionalized 1,1&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted olefins, functionalized tri&#8208; and 1,1&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted vinyl phosphonates, and &#946;&#8208;cyclic enamides. The catalytic performance of the Ir&#8208;ligand assemblies was maintained when the environmentally benign 1,2&#8208;propylene carbonate was used as solvent.

Abstract
A protocol for the synthesis of terminal N&#8208;vinylazoles from aromatic aldehydes, DMSO, and azoles has been reported. In this strategy, DMSO was involved in the construction of the C=C bond as a terminal carbon synthon. Both aromatic aldehydes and azoles could be well tolerated and give the corresponding terminal N&#8208;vinylazoles in 52&#8211;91% yields. Based on preliminary experiments, a plausible mechanism is proposed.

Abstract
Non&#8208;activated allyl alcohols are utilized as allylating agent for thiocarbamate&#8208;directed allylation of pyrrole and indole. The synthetic methodology is accompanied by advantages like silver&#8208;free conditions and generates water as the by&#8208;product. A wide range of substituted pyrroles and indoles along with several structurally different allyl alcohols took part in the reaction. Among notable examples, biologically relevant prenylation, geranylation, and synthesis of 1,3&#8208;dienes are achieved. Selective mono allylation of pyrrole, gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and ready deprotection of directing group are the other key highlights of this method.

Abstract
A variety of chromeno[4,3&#8208;c]isoxazolidines were prepared in good yields through visible light promoted Chan&#8208;Lam reaction and [3+2] cycloaddition cascade reaction in one pot. Mechanistic studies showed that visible light promoted both Chan&#8208;Lam reaction and cycloaddition. The obtained products were converted to various useful chromenone derivatives. Moreover, the reaction was easily performed at gram scales with the purification of products without column chromatography and used to efficiently synthesize estrone&#8208;derived chromeno[4,3&#8208;c]isoxazolidine.

The front cover picture, designed by J&#232;ssica Margalef, illustrates the usefulness of a modular and easy&#8208;to&#8208;assemble catalyst design for asymmetric hydrogenation. By choosing the appropriate sulfur and phosphorus substituents on new Ir&#8208;P,S&#8208;catalysts, it is possible to hydrogenate substrates of very different nature (50 olefins in total). Improving on most catalysts reported so far, di&#8208; and E/Z&#8208;trisubstituted olefins with a variety of functional groups and coordination ability can be reduced with excellent enantioselectivities. Details can be found in the Research Article by Di&#233;guez and co&#8208;authors (J. Margalef, M. Biosca, P. de la Cruz&#8208;S&#225;nchez, X. Caldentey, C. Rodr&#237;guez&#8208;Escrich, O.

Abstract
Indole&#8208;based heterocycles containing sulfur or nitrogen atoms are important frameworks that occur widely in biological active natural products and drugs. Consequently, several novel chemical transformations and new catalytic strategies have been developed for the preparation of these skeletons in a highly efficient and selective manner. This review focuses on recent advancements in the construction of indole&#8208;fused heterocyclic compounds by using iminoindolines, 3&#8208;diazoindol&#8208;2&#8208;imines, 2&#8208;thioxoindolines, and their derivatives as starting materials.

Abstract
Over the past few decades, organophosphorus catalysis has emerged as a robust platform for the preparation of highly functionalized molecules with excellent control of reactivity and selectivity. Organophosphorus catalysis has the advantages of mild and metal&#8208;free reaction conditions. The easy&#8208;to&#8208;tune electronic and steric properties of phosphorus provide an easy handle for developing efficient synthetic methodologies with high stereochemical fidelity. This review describes the efforts to introduce boron and silicon functionalities into organic substrates catalyzed by organophosphorus compounds. These catalysts are categorized into nucleophilic, electrophilic, and biphilic phosphorus catalysts. Phosphorus compounds efficiently catalyze hydroboration of various unsaturated systems, carbonyl compounds, imines, etc.; hydro&#8208;/cyano&#8208;silylation of carbonyls; and silylation of alcohols. The present review emphasizes the scope of nucleophilic, electrophilic, and biphilic phosphorus&#8208;based catalysis to introduce boron and silicon functionalities into organic compounds, mainly from the recent decade.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed/TsOH&#8208;promoted one&#8208;pot tandem annulation of 1,6&#8208;allenynes with organic azides was reported, providing N&#8208;allyl 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;fused structures in moderate to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. Moreover, the late&#8208;stage diversification of the N&#8208;allyl products can be realized by chemoselectively reducing to the N&#8208;alkyl counterparts.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed tandem intermolecular ylide formation/intramolecular cycloaddition of diazo compounds and aldehyde&#8208;tethered&#8208;cyclohexadienones was reported, chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectively providing oxapolycyclic frameworks in moderate to excellent yields under mild conditions. This reaction creates two C&#8722;C bonds and one C&#8722;O bond with five stereocentres including two all&#8208;carbon quaternary centres. Moreover, the late&#8208;stage diversification of products can be realized via chemoselective substitutions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copper-catalyzed tandem intermolecular ylide formation/intramolecular cycloaddition of diazo compounds and aldehyde-tethered-cyclohexadienones was reported, chemo- and diastereoselectively providing oxapolycyclic frameworks in moderate to excellent yields under mild conditions. This reaction creates two C&#8722;C bonds and one C&#8722;O bond with five stereocentres including two all-carbon quaternary centres. Moreover, the late-stage diversification of products can be realized via chemoselective substitutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
A two&#8208;step transition metal&#8208;free methodology for the C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) functionalisation of saturated N&#8208;heterocyclic systems is disclosed. First, aminal derivatives are generated through the anodic oxidation of readily accessible carboxylic acids. Then, in the presence of BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2, iminium ions are unmasked and rapidly alkylated by organozinc reagents under flow conditions. Secondary, tertiary and quaternary carbon centers have been successfully assembled using this methodology. Such an approach is especially relevant to drug discovery since it increases C(sp3)&#8208;functionalities rapidly within a molecular framework. As proof of concept, our methodology was applied to derivatization of peptides and an API.

Abstract
A radical promoted approach for the selective synthesis of furo[3,2&#8208;b]quinolines and benzylidene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydrofuro[3,4&#8208;b]quinolines have been achieved from 2&#8208;alkynyl quinoline&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehydes by fine&#8208;tuning of base and oxidant in good yields. In the presence of an oxidant, the reaction afforded the 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclized furoquinolines by decarbonylative intramolecular cyclization via a Dakin&#8208;type reaction; however, in the absence of oxidant, 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclized products were obtained selectively through reductive intramolecular cyclization. The formation of furoquinolines was further supported by X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies. The proposed mechanism was well supported by the control experiments.

Abstract
Both enantiomers of cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclohexane have been obtained enantioselectively through engineered amidase&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of meso carbocyclic 1,2&#8208;dicarboxamides under mild condition. Based on the enzyme&#8208;substrate binding model suggested by molecular docking, the amplification and reversal of enantioselectivity of amidase was quickly achieved through generating and testing only 8 variants. The origin of enantiopreference for amidase was revealed by MD simulations and the reason for the reversal of enantioselectivity towards amidase variant was disclosed. The synthetic application of biocatalytic meso&#8208;desymmetrization was demonstrated by straightforward transformation of the products to enantiomerically pure heterocyclic compounds.

Abstract
The first enantioselective vinylogous Mannich reaction of acyclic vinylketene silyl acetals with acyclic ketimines derived from alkynyl ketoesters was developed. Excellent yields and enantioselectivities were obtained from the reaction using bis(imidazoline)&#8208;Zn(II) catalyst. Based on experiments and MO calculation, a plausible transition state was proposed to explain the stereoselectivity of the reaction. The obtained products were converted into various amines and a lactam. This process provides an efficient route for the synthesis of acyclic &#948;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and their derivatives.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed (Pd(PPh3)4/Ag2O/PivOH) C2&#8208;regioselective direct dehydrogenative alkynylation of unsubstituted selenophene was achieved. The selenophenes substituted with R1 groups at 2&#8208;position can be C5&#8208;alkynylated with a variety of 4&#8208;substituted phenylacetylenes (R2 groups). The R1 and R2 can be either electron&#8208;withdrawing or electron&#8208;donating groups, demonstrating a wide range of substrate scope with various functional group tolerance. The mono/C2&#8208;alkynylated selenophenes can subsequently undergo the second direct alkynylation at C5&#8208;position to afford symmetrical or unsymmetrical donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor 2,5&#8208;dialkynylated selenophenes.

Abstract
A series of enantioenriched 4,5,6,7&#8208;tetrahydrofuro[2,3&#8208;b]pyridines were accessed by a cycloisomerization/cycloaddition strategy. Starting from ynamide derivatives and aldehydes, yields ranging from 27 to 90% and high levels of stereoselectivity (de&gt;95%, 93&#8211;99% ee) were obtained through sequential relay catalysis. The concurrent use of a gold complex with a diphenylprolinol silyl ether was applied to a combination of diversely functionalized substrates.

         <title>Z&#8208;Selective Fluoroalkenylation of (Hetero)Aromatic Systems by Iodonium reagents in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Directed C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct and catalytic incorporation of fluorine containing molecular motifs into organic compounds resulting high&#8208;value added chemicals represents a rapidly evolving part of synthetic methodologies, thus this area is in the focus of pharmaceutical and agrochemical research. Herein we report a stereoselective procedure for direct fluorovinylation of aromatic and heteroaromatic scaffolds. This methodology development has been realized by palladium&#8208;catalyzed ortho C&#8208;H activation reaction of aniline derivatives featuring the regioselectivity via directing groups such as secondary of tertiary amides, ureas or ketones. The application of non&#8208;symmetrical aryl(fluoroalkenyl)&#8208;iodonium salts as fluoroalkenylating agents allowed mild reaction conditions in general for this transformation. The scope and limitations have been thoroughly investigated and the feasibility has been demonstrated by more than 50 examples.</dc:description>

Abstract
A catalytic Lewis acid regulated reaction between quinone imine ketals (QIKs) and 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds provides a divergent and tunable approach to a variety of skeletons, including a series of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds, indoles, and benzofurans. The use of lithium chloride and ferrous bromide gives C3&#8208; or C2&#8208;alkylation products of the QIKs. The combination of ferrous bromide and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid delivers indole derivatives. Sequential hydrolysis and C3&#8208;alkylation occur in the presence of ytterbium (III) trifluoromethanesulfonate and stoichiometric amounts of water. When the reaction is performed with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and stoichiometric amounts of water, benzofuran is obtained. This protocol utilizes mild conditions, exhibits regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity, and has broad functional group tolerance.

         <title>Electrochemical Functionalization of Imidazopyridine and Indazole: An Overview</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Electrochemical method offers a mild, simple and efficient tool for the synthesis of interesting and useful molecules, thus eluding severe chemical oxidising and reducing agents used in conventional synthetic methods. In particular, electrochemical C&#8722;H activation is expected to play an important role in the direct functionalization of heterocyclic compounds. Over the past few decades, the research interest on imidazopyridine and indazole is enhanced significantly due to their multipurpose uses in medicinal and industrial chemistry. Therefore, structural modification of these heterocycles using electro&#8208;oxidation 	method is one of the important research topics among synthetic organic chemistry in recent days. This perspective outlines a comprehensive discussion on electrochemical functionalization of indazole and imidazopyridine published so far. A summary of the current challenges and a future direction for the development of efficient and green electrochemical methods for functionalization of these heterocycles is also presented.</dc:description>

Therefore, structural modification of these heterocycles using electro-oxidation 	method is one of the important research topics among synthetic organic chemistry in recent days. This perspective outlines a comprehensive discussion on electrochemical functionalization of indazole and imidazopyridine published so far. A summary of the current challenges and a future direction for the development of efficient and green electrochemical methods for functionalization of these heterocycles is also presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We presented a palladium&#8208;catalyzed domino cyclization/phosphorylation of gem&#8208;dibromoolefins, which utilize H&#8208;phosphinates and secondary phosphine oxides as the phosphine sources, respectively. A vareity of phosphorylated heteroaromatics were obtained in moderate to good yields with wide functional group compatibility. This one&#8208;pot reaction enables multiple bond&#8208;forming events including C&#8211;X (X = O, N, S) and C&#8211;P bonds using easily available starting materials. Moreover, this protocol can be easily applied to large&#8208;scale preparation and late&#8208;stage functionalization.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;catalyzed routes have been achieved for the synthesis of 3&#8208;nitroquinolines from readily available nitroolefins and anthranils. This reaction proceeds via the [4 + 2] cycloaddition between anthranils and nitro&#8208;styrenes under mild reaction conditions to obtain biologically important heterocycles. A wide range of diversely substituted nitro&#8208;olefins and anthranils are successfully employed in this reaction to access a series of 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;quinolines in 81&#8208;93% yields.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Enzyme Cascade Catalyzed Asymmetrization of Primary Alcohols: Synthesis of Enantiocomplementary Chiral &#946;&#8208;Nitroalcohols</title>

Abstract
Biocatalytic asymmetrization of inexpensive and stable primary alcohols to prepare enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols is an important development in green chemistry for the production of chiral pharmaceutical intermediates. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step cascade reaction sequence in which first benzylic alcohols were oxidized to produce corresponding benzaldehydes using horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH). The in&#8197;situ generated aldehydes were then reacted in a biphasic medium with nitromethane by Arabidopsis thaliana hydroxynitrile lyase (AtHNL) or Baliospermum montanum HNL (BmHNL) catalyzed Henry reaction to produce stereoselective &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols with (R) or (S) configuration, respectively. Using HLADH&#8208;AtHNL, (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols were obtained in up to 64% conversion, and HLADH&#8208;BmHNL, (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols in up to 70% conversion, while in both cases excellent stereoselectivity (up to &gt;99% ee) was achieved. The concept was proven by functionalization of sp3 C&#8722;H bond of ten simple achiral benzylic alcohols to enantiocomplementary chiral &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols.

         <title>A Cross&#8208;coupling Reaction between Aliphatic Aldehydes and Sulfonium Salts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted electron&#8208;deficient alkenes is often accomplished via cross&#8208;coupling of diazo compounds in the presence of a metal catalyst. Herein, we report an organocatalytic protocol that enables the direct coupling of aliphatic aldehydes with sulfonium ylides. A key carbene mimetic, &#945;&#8208;iodoenamine/enol, is believed to engage in direct cross&#8208;coupling with a sulfonium ylide, delivering &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds with a formyl substituent. The reaction demonstrated remarkably mild conditions, convergence, and control of olefin geometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free, PhI(OAc)2&#8208;Promoted Oxidative C(sp2)&#8722;H Difunctionalization: Synthesis of Thioaminated Naphthoquinones</title>

Abstract
A three&#8208;component thioamination reaction has been developed in the presence of phenyliodonium(III) diacetate (PIDA) leading to the formation of a thioaminated products. This catalytic approach represents a method for the metal&#8208;free thioamination of 1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone. It was observed that maleimides also work smoothly under this metal&#8208;free reaction condition. This present method implies the oxidative coupling reaction through a one&#8208;step process with the generation of C&#8722;N and C&#8722;S bonds. Various aromatic and aliphatic thiols and amines provided the corresponding thioaminated compounds in 62&#8211;88% yields. A plausible reaction pathway has been predicted according to few control experiments.

         <title>Recent Advances in Transformations Involving Electron&#8208;Rich Alkenes: Functionalization, Cyclization, and Cross&#8208;Metathesis Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Due to the versatile reactivity and molecular complexity, as well as diversity, electron&#8208;rich alkenes bearing nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atoms have been regarded as versatile reagents in organic synthesis. This review mainly focuses on the recent advances in the reaction development of electron&#8208;rich alkenes since 2000, including mono&#8208;/difunctionalization reactions, cyclization reactions, and cross&#8208;metathesis reactions. Numerous protocols enabling facile and efficient transformations of electron&#8208;rich alkenes to valuable compounds have been developed, which are discussed with special emphasis placed on the mechanistic aspects and the synthetic utilities. We hope that this review will help inspire future studies and promote developments in this area.

         <title>Selective &#945;&#8208;Deuteration of Cinnamonitriles using D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O as Deuterium Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective &#945;&#8208;deuteration of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitriles using the strong base tBuOK or a metal&#8208;ligand cooperative Ru pincer catalyst is described. With D2O as deuterium source and glyme as solvent at 70 &#176;C, tBuOK is an efficient catalyst for deuteration at the &#945;&#8208;C(sp2) position of cinnamonitriles, providing access to a broad range of deuterated derivatives in good to excellent yields and with very high levels of deuterium incorporation. While the tBuOK&#8208;catalysed protocol does not tolerate base&#8208;sensitive functional groups, cinnamonitrile derivatives containing a benzylic bromide or ester moiety were deuterated in excellent yields using Milstein&#8217;s ruthenium PNN pincer catalyst. Moreover, the activity for H/D exchange of the metal&#8208;ligand cooperative Ru catalyst is found to be significantly higher than that of tBuOK, allowing reactions to proceed well even at room temperature. A mechanistic proposal is put forward that involves deprotonation of the cinnamonitrile &#945;&#8208;CH position when using tBuOK as catalyst, whereas H/D exchange catalysis with the Ru PNN pincer likely proceeds via (reversible) oxa&#8208;Michael addition of D2O.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic trans Semireduction of Primary and Secondary Propiolamides: Substrate Scope and Mechanistic Studies</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. We report a chemoselective, phosphine&#8208;catalyzed semireduction of primary and secondary propiolamides. In the presence of stoichiometric pinacolborane and catalytic n&#8208;tributylphosphine, a variety of propiolamides were successfully converted to the corresponding acrylamides in excellent yield with (E)&#8208;stereoselectivity. The reaction condition is tolerant of various functional groups including alkene, alkyne, ketone, or ester. Deuterium labeling studies	established that the hydride from activated pinacolborane is added to the &#945;&#8208;carbon and the proton on the amide nitrogen is abstracted by the &#223;&#8208;carbon to furnish the (E)&#8208;acrylamides. DFT calculations revealed a clear energetic driving force for the (E)&#8208; over the (Z)&#8208;isomer.</dc:description>

         <title>Overview of Regioselective and Stereoselective Catalytic Hydroboration of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Hydroboration of alkynes is of special interest to researchers since it is the most straightforward process for the synthesis of highly important vinylborane synthetic intermediate compounds. It is significant in terms of both regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, since several positional isomers are formed during the process of hydroboration. Given the importance of this class of compounds, an extensive study has been carried out regarding catalytic condition development and detailed mechanistic studies for selectively obtaining a single isomer. This review comprehensively summarizes both the regioselective and stereoselective catalytic hydroboration of alkynes. It is aimed at giving readers accurate knowledge of the catalytic systems available for the hydroboration of certain alkynes. We anticipate that this inclusive review will encourage researchers to explore more new types of catalytic systems to achieve the remarkable process of hydroboration of alkynes.

         <title>Application of Mutualism in Organic Synthetic Chemistry: Mutually Promoted C&#8722;H Functionalization of Indole and Reduction of Quinoline</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Here we reported a one&#8208;pot, metal&#8208;free B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed strategy for simultaneous synthesis of C3&#8208;regioselective functionalization of indoles and complete reduction of quinolines. It turned out that by sharing a quinolinium hydridoborate intermediate, the original determining steps with high energy barrier in both the convergent disproportionation of indole and reduction of quinoline could be realized at room temperature, thus furnishing both the C3&#8208;borylated (or silylated) indoles and N&#8208;borylated tetrahydroquinolines in up to 98% yields at room temperature. Mechanistic studies suggested that both reactions would consume a product generated from the other reaction such that they can mutually promote each other, thus producing desirable products in a high atom&#8208;economy and low energy&#8208;cost manner. This strategy opened the gate to introducing mutualism to the field of chemistry.

         <title>Isocyanide&#8208;Induced Esterification of Sulfinic Acids to Access Sulfinates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The isocyanide&#8208;induced esterification of sulfinic acids with alcohols or thiophenols access to sulfinates has been developed. Various primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols could be compatible with the established protocols. Notably, such an isocyanide&#8208;induced synthetic strategy presented the advantages of simple operation, good functional group tolerance, and more than 40 examples up to 99% yields.

Abstract
Here we report a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed and atom&#8208;economical ortho&#8208;N&#8208;indolyl&#8208;N&#8208;pyrazolylbenzene synthesis from 1,2,3&#8208;triazapentalenes and ynamides. The reaction occurs through the cleavage of the triazole ring and formation of a &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene intermediate. An aza&#8208;Nazarov&#8208;type cyclization with participation of an arene ring is involved. The reaction consists in a formal [4+1] heterocycloaddition where the four&#8208;carbon synthon is provided by the ynamide. Finally, indole synthesis could also be performed in a one&#8208;pot procedure from their 1&#8208;propargyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzotrizaole precursors.

         <title>Bu4NHSO4&#8208;Catalyzed Direct N&#8208;Allylation of Pyrazole and its Derivatives with Allylic Alcohols in Water: A Metal&#8208;Free, Recyclable and Sustainable System</title>

Abstract
Allylic amines are valuable and functional building blocks. Direct N&#8208;allylation of pyrazole and its derivatives as an atom economic strategy to provide allylic amines has been achieved only using commercial Bu4NHSO4 as the metal&#8208;free catalyst and water as the solvent without any additives. 11&#8211;93% isolated yields were obtained for the N&#8208;allylation of pyrazole and its derivatives with allylic alcohols. Bu4NHSO4 could be reused for six times by simple extraction nearly without loss of catalytic activity and was also suitable for a gram&#8208;scale production. The reaction of allylic ether and pyrazole did not occur to give the desired product indicated that allylic ether was not the active intermediate in the pathway. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that there are hydrogen bonding effects among substrates, solvent and catalyst, especially the one formed between allylic alcohol and H2O. Control experiments in different protic solvents further demonstrate the intermolecular hydrogen bonding of allylic alcohol and water.

         <title>Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Aryl Borrowing Amination of Diaryl Methanols Containing Pyridine&#8208;Directing Groups</title>

Abstract
The rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed aryl borrowing amination of various diaryl methanols with sulfonamides have been developed. The amination of alcohols via C&#8722;C bond activation is less developed and remains a challenge. These aryl borrowing reactions feature mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance, and compatibility with a wide range of alcohols, overall comprising an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic procedure. Mechanistic studies indicate that a rhodacycle complex exist during the aryl borrowing amination reaction.

         <title>Tailoring the Reactivity of the Langlois Reagent and Styrenes With Cyanoarenes Organophotocatalysts under Visible&#8208;Light.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective one&#8208;step access to fluoroalkylated hexestrol derivatives, nonsteroidal estrogens, is achieved in good to excellent isolated yields under organophotoredox conditions by using the stable and easy to handle Langlois reagent. Furthermore, the challenging selective hydrotrifluoromethylation of styrenes proceeds under mild reaction conditions without the requirement for any additive. We assume that the solvent drives the reaction pathway towards either the reduction or the dimerization of the radical intermediate generated after initial addition of the fluoroalkyl radical to the styrene. The versatility of the developed system is also extended to encompass radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling as exemplified here using cyanopyridine. Mechanistic investigations including luminescence and EPR spectroscopy allow to shed the light on the different mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A phosphine&#8208;mediated reaction for the construction of spirocyclopenta[c]chromene&#8208;indolinones is reported via a Rauhut&#8208;Currier (RC)&#8208;type/acyl transfer/Wittig sequence. This methodology attributes the chemoselective phosphine addition to the alkynoate which generates the phosphorus zwitterion via RC&#8208;type reaction, and that further undergoes O&#8208;acylation to form the seven&#8208;membered betaine intermediate with acyl chloride in the presence of base. Extensive investigations reveal that the exceptional &#948;&#8208;acylation occurs through the C&#8208;O bond cleavage upon the seven&#8208;membered betaine, and the subsequent Wittig reaction preferentially results in the aforementioned spiro compound. Furthermore, our protocol could also be applicable to different alkynoates to provide a series of spirocyclopenta[&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]chromenones bearing privileged skeletons.</dc:description>

         <title>ortho&#8208;Allylation of 2&#8208;Arylindazoles with Vinyl Cyclic Carbonate and Diallyl Carbonate via Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>

Abstract
A manganese&#8208;catalyzed directed C&#8722;H allylation of 2&#8208;arylindazole has been developed. Both vinyl cyclic carbonate and diallyl carbonate are effectively used for ortho&#8208;allylation via decarboxylation. The mechanism was investigated and possibly Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation is not involved in the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Synthesis of Poly&#8208;Functionalized Indolizines via [5+1] Annulative Access to Pyridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Multi&#8208;functionalization of the pyridine motif of indolizine was achieved through [5+1] annulative construction of pyridine from 2&#8208;hydroxyacetophenone and pyrrole derivative in the presence of Cs2CO3. The reaction is proposed to take place via domino aldol&#8208;oxa Michael&#8208;Michael&#8208;elimination&#8208;oxidation procedure, leading to installation of three different functional groups at the C5, C6, and C7 positions of indolizines. Solvent (2&#8208;MeTHF) and the hydroxyl of 2&#8208;hydroxyacetophenones seemed to play crucial roles for this successful cyclization event. Further elaboration of the resulting scaffold and expansion of this protocol using other methyl ketones were demonstrated as well.

         <title>Investigating the Structure&#8208;Reactivity Relationships Between Nicotinamide Coenzyme Biomimetics and Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate Reductase</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ene reductases (ERs) are attractive biocatalysts in terms of their high enantioselectivity and expanded substrate scope. Recent works have proved that synthetic nicotinamide coenzyme biomimetics (NCBs) can be used as easily accessible alternatives to natural cofactors in ER&#8208;catalyzed reactions. However, the structure&#8208;reactivity relationships between NCBs and ERs and influence factors are still poorly understood. In this study, a series of C&#8208;5 methyl modified NCBs were synthesized and tested in the PETNR&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reductions. The physicochemical properties of these NCBs including electrochemical properties, stability, and kinetic behavior were studied in detail. The results showed that hydrophobic interaction caused by the introduced methyl group contributes to the stabilization of binding conformation in enzyme active site, resulting in comparable catalytic activity with that of NADPH. Molecular dynamics and steered molecular dynamics simulations were further performed to explain the binding mechanism between PETNR and NCBs, which revealed that stable catalytic conformation, appropriate donor&#8208;acceptor distance and angle, as well as free dissociation energy are important factors affecting the activity of NCBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;enzymatic Cascade Reactions for the Synthesis of &lt;i&gt;cis,cis&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Muconic acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lignin valorization allows the generation of a number of value&#8208;added products such as &lt;i&gt;cis,cis&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;muconic acid (ccMA), which is widely used for the synthesis of chemicals for the production of biodegradable plastic materials. In the present work, we reported the first multi&#8208;enzymatic, one&#8208;pot bioconversion process of vanillin into ccMA. In details, we used four sequential reactions catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;demethylase LigM (and the tetrahydrofolate&#8208;regeneration enzyme methyl transferase MetE), decarboxylase AroY (based on the use of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; transformed cells) and catechol 1,2&#8208;dioxygenase CatA. The optimized lab&#8208;scale procedure allowed to reach, for the first time, the conversion of 5 mM vanillin into ccMA in ~ 30 h with a 90% yield: this achievement represents an improvement in terms of yields and time when compared to the use of a whole&#8208;cell system. This multi&#8208;enzymatic system represents a sustainable alternative for the production of a high value added product from a renewable resource.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract. A synthetically useful Z&#8208;selective cascade formal thiyl radical addition, 1,3&#8208;double bond isomerization, oxygen trapping reaction, can be promoted by Eosin B under visible light, leading to the construction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208; and alkylthio enone derivatives in good yields. An accurate study on the reactivity of different thiols and the screening of the reaction conditions, allowed us to extend this reaction to a large number of substrates, showing a good functional groups tolerance while highlighting the limitations of this procedure. Background experiments and mechanistic studies were also. performed to rationalize this cascade process. The usefulness of this methodology was finally demonstrated via the transformation of a series of &#945;&#8208;sulfanyl&#8208;enone adducts through selected oxidation reactions, stereoselective synthesis of cyclopropyl ketones, indanones, and pyrazole compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiofunctionalization of Electron&#8208;Rich Heteroarenes through Magnesiation and Trapping with Octasulfur</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein we report a site&#8208;selective and thiol&#8208;free thiofunctionalization of electron&#8208;rich heteroarenes. After a selective ortho&#8208;magnesiation, the use of S8 followed by an electrophile allows direct access to S&#8208;alkyl or &#8208;aryl derivatives. In situ oxidation provides the corresponding sulfoxide and sulfone derivatives. Applying this protocol, Cerlapirdine was prepared in 4 steps with 28% overall yield.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Fused Indolin&#8208;3&#8208;Ones via a [3+3] Cycloaddition Reaction</title>

Abstract
A formal [3+3] cycloaddition reaction of azaoxyallyl cations and isatogens generated in&#8197;situ from &#945;&#8208;halo hydroxamates and o&#8208;nitroalkynes, respectively, was developed. The cycloisomerization of the o&#8208;nitroalkynes, followed by base&#8208;mediated elimination of hydrogen halide and 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of the azaoxyallyl cations with the isatogen intermediates, were hallmarks of this one&#8208;pot tandem reaction. A series of tricyclic fused indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones were obtained under very mild reaction conditions with high atom economy, and the reaction exhibited excellent functional group tolerance. In addition, the reaction was highly scalable to multigram quantities. The obtained indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones exhibited robust DNA staining patterns in agarose gel electrophoresis. Coupled with the fluorescence properties of the products, these results highlight the potential utility of tricyclic fused indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones in various fluorescence and cell&#8208;staining applications.

Abstract
Aryl enol acetates and DMF could promote radical difluoroalkylation of aryl enol acetates to generate &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;ketoacetates without a catalyst, an oxidant, or a base. When using different bases, &#946;&#8208;fluoroenones and &#946;&#8208;enaminones were synthesized by controllable C&#8722;F bond activation. These transformations provide an alternative method for the cascade difluoroalkylation and C&#8722;F bonds activation of aryl enol acetates.

Abstract
A metal&#8208;free multi&#8208;component sulfur dioxide insertion reaction of alkynes, sodium metabisulfite, aryldiazonium, and quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;ones has been developed under visible&#8208;light&#8194;photoredox&#8208;catalysis. This photocatalytic tandem reaction would be conducted at room temperature by using of Rhodamine 6G as organic photocatalyst and sodium metabisulfite as the SO2 surrogate. This protocol provides a synthetic strategy for the construction of various quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;one&#8208;containing vinyl sulfones with favourable functional group tolerance, in which one C&#8722;C bond and two C&#8722;S bonds were constructed in one pot procedure.

         <title>Access to Unsymmetrically Substituted Diaryl Gold N&#8208;Acyclic Carbene (NAC) and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) Complexes via the Isonitrile Route</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A variety of unsymmetric diaryl gold N&#8208;acyclic carbene (NAC) complexes was synthesized via the isonItrile route by three different methods: (a) solvent free in a melt, (b) mechanochemically and (c) in THF at room temperature. The latter method can also be used to synthesize unsaturated gold NHC complexes.
These methods overall offer access to a broad array of new complexes and remove one of the previous limitations of the
isonitrile route to NAC and NHC complexes of gold, namely the inability to react with the less nucleophilic aromatic amines. The new complexes also proved to be successful as pre&#8208;catalysts in the gold&#8208;catalyzed phenol synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Alkynylation of C&#8208;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkynylation reactions are one of the most sought&#8208;after synthetic methodologies due to the versatility of C&#8208;C triple bond diversifications. Sonogashira coupling was widely used for the synthesis of alkynylated molecules; however, this methodology requires the use of previously halogenated substrates, which is a major drawback. To overcome this issue, a complementary method, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H alkynylation, has emerged as an alternative tool in recent years. Although the initial reports required the use of either specific directing groups or strong alkynylating agents for effective functionalization, recent studies indicate that transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective alkynylations can be carried out using mild and readily available alkynylating agents under moderate reaction conditions.  In this review, we explain the functionalization of both sp2&#8208;C&#8211;H and sp3&#8208;C&#8211;H bonds by emphasizing the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8208;methylation is a vitally important reaction applicable in chemical synthesis and structure&#8208;based drug design. Notably, the &#8220;magic methyl&#8221; effect has become decisive in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery for the modulation of bio&#8208;active properties in life science molecules.  In this regard, C&#8208;methylation reaction is widely applied chemical modification in various biomolecules, pharmaceuticals, and natural products. In general, this reaction often relies on activated, hazardous and uneconomical methyl sources such as diazomethane, dimethyl sulfate, and methyl halides. To achieve methylation reactions in a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective manner, the use of &#8216;ideal&#8217; C1 source is crucial. In this regard, methanol constitutes an expedient &#8208;CH3 source because this simple alcohol is less&#8208;hazardous, inexpensive, and abundantly available platform chemical as well as it produces only water as the by&#8208;product in methylation processes. Regarding potential catalysts to perform C&#8208;methylation using methanol by hydrogen borrowing methodology, non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based catalysts are highly preferable due to their unique advantages such as more abundance, inexpensive and low&#8208;toxicity. In recent years, chemists made significant contributions towards catalytic valorization of methanol as C1 source to insert methyl groups via CH activation in a variety of compounds and life science molecules. Consequently, in this minireview we summarize the C&#8208;methylation process using methanol by applying Fe&#8208;, Mn&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Ni&#8208;based catalysts as well as metal free catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Enantioenriched Amines by Iron&#8208;Catalysed Amination of Alcohols Employing at Least One Achiral Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture, designed by Anastasiia Afanasenko, illustrates the methodology for the synthesis of enantioenriched amines by the direct Fe&#8208;catalysed coupling of amines with alcohols through the borrowing hydrogen strategy, while at least one of these substrates is achiral. As in the well&#8208;known &#8220;The Tortoise and the Hare&#8221; fable by Aesop, tortoise &#8208; stands for chiral amine &#8211; won the race retaining the stereochemical integrity in the final product, whereas beta&#8208;branched enantioenriched primary alcohol &#8211; depicts by the hare &#8211; lost the competition due to its racemization that led to the partial loss of the chirality in the target amine. Details can be found in the Research Article by Katalin Barta and collaborators (G. Bottari, A. Afanasenko, A. A. Castillo&#8208;Garcia, B. L. Feringa, K. Barta, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2021, 363, XXXX&#8208;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202100231)

         <title>Directed Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed pseudo&#8208;Anomeric C&#8722;H Alkynylation of Glycals as an Approach towards C&#8208;Glycoconjugate Synthesis</title>

Abstract
The synthesis of complex C&#8208;glycoconjugates is presented here using a key directed nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkynylation step. Thanks to a bidentate amidoquinoline&#8208;type directing group, the insertion of diverse alkynyl moieties onto the pseudo&#8208;anomeric position of glycal substrates was performed on ten examples in moderate to good yields. These platforms were used as starting substrates in a click reaction with complex azides to form original C&#8208;glycoconjugates. By this route, a C&#8208;glycosylated amino acid, a C&#8208;linked disaccharide and a C&#8208;glycosylated biotin derivative were synthesized. Preliminary conditions to remove the directing group are also proposed.

Abstract
An organocatalytic 1,6&#8208;addition using 4&#8208;(alk&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;3&#8208;cyanocoumarins as acceptors has been developed. Dienolates derived from 5&#8208;substituted&#8208;furan&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;ones have been employed as pronucleophiles, therefore, enabling the synthesis of hybrid molecules bearing two biologically relevant units. Appropriate design of substrates and the application of quinine&#8208;derived catalyst resulted in very good site&#8208;selectivity as well as chemical and stereochemical efficiency of the process.

         <dc:description>A new tetraarylpyrrole&#8208;based phosphine ligand L1 in combination with Pd(dba)2 provided a catalyst for the Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination reaction. A variety of amines were rapidly coupled with aryl chlorides at a Pd loading of 0.5 mol%. The selective monoarylation of aliphatic primary amines was achieved in the presence of 0.8 equiv. water. Comparison experiments were also conducted, which revealed that the catalytic activity of L1 is superior to representative phosphine ligands in the Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;N coupling of various amines.</dc:description>

Abstract
This study has developed a method to prepare diastereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective indoline&#8208;fused 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine scaffolds. The synthetic process involved an Ugi four&#8208;component reaction in which readily available starting materials were used and a metal&#8208;free intramolecular post&#8208;Ugi tandem consecutive 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig/6&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization under basic conditions. The plausible mechanism and substrate structures were elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and supported by density functional theory calculations.

Abstract
Substrate&#8208;controlled cascade reactions between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes or their analogues and 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzyl chloride in the presence of a chiral secondary amine as the catalyst and base were developed, to obtain a broad spectrum of &#945;&#8208;benzylated enals and enantioenriched cyclopropane&#8208;fused chroman&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives. The cyclopropane&#8208;tethered iminium ion clearly served as a key intermediate in these reactions to trigger stereochemical outcomes, one of which was supported by a control experiment.

         <title>Expanding the Toolbox of Heterogeneous Asymmetric Organocatalysts: Bifunctional Cyclopropenimine Superbases for Enantioselective Catalysis in Batch and Continuous&#8208;Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy for the immobilization of chiral 2,3&#8208;bisaminocyclopropenium salt (pre&#8208;catalyst) onto polystyrene and silica supports is presented together with a suitable procedure for the conversion into the corresponding cyclopropenimine superbase catalysts. The activity and recyclability of polystyrene&#8208; and silica&#8208;supported cyclopropenimines were initially tested under batch conditions in a model Michael addition detecting comparable efficiencies but a superior stability of the latter heterogeneous catalyst (5 cycles, accumulated TON of 27.1). The preferred silica&#8208;supported cyclopropenimine behaved very similarly to the soluble counterpart in the reaction of glycine imine with different Michael acceptors (48&#8208;92% yield; 60&#8208;98% ee) and it could be utilized as packing material for the fabrication of fixed&#8208;bed mesoreactors (pressure&#8208;resistant stainless&#8208;steel columns). Continuous&#8208;flow experiments were performed with satisfactory long&#8208;term stability (24 h on stream) with unaltered conversion efficiency and enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxoammonium Salt&#8208;Mediated Vicinal Oxyazidation of Alkenes with NaN3: Access to &#946;&#8208;Aminooxy Azides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An approach to the vicinal oxyazidation of alkenes has been achieved under mild and transition metal&#8208;free conditions. This method utilizes NaN3 as the azidation agent and 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxoammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEMPO+BF4&#8722;) as the single&#8208;electron oxidant as well as the oxygen source. By using this protocol, various &#946;&#8208;aminooxy azides were synthesized and several complex bioactive molecules were functionalized.

         <title>Organocatalytic Synthesis of Substituted Vinylene Carbonates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The organocatalytic synthesis of substituted vinylene carbonates from benzoins and acyloins was studied using diphenyl carbonate as a carbonyl source. A range of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) precursors were screened and it was found that imidazolium salts were the most active for this transformation. The reaction occurs at 90&#8201;&#176;C under solvent&#8208;free conditions. A wide range of substituted vinylene carbonates (symmetrical and unsymmetrical, aromatic or aliphatic), including some derived from natural products, were prepared with 20&#8211;99% isolated yields (24 examples). The reaction was also developed using thermomorphic polyethylene&#8208;supported organocatalysts as recoverable and recyclable species. The use of such species facilitates the workup and allows the synthesis of vinylene carbonates on the preparative scale (&gt;30&#8197;g after 5 runs).

         <dc:description>Direct and selective transformation of ArCF3 into other relevant functional groups is one of the unmet challenges in contemporary synthetic organic chemistry due to the inherent properties of C&#8208;F bonds. In this context, herein we communicate two mild, solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical coupling transformations of CF3 group with nitro compounds into amides or Schiff bases employing Ytterbia. This process proceeds via C&#8208;F bond activation along with utilizing Si&#8208;based reductants/oxygen scavengers &#8208; reductants of the nitro group. The scope and limitations of the disclosed methodologies are thoroughly studied. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first example of mechanical energy promoted transformation of the inert CF3 group into other functionalities.</dc:description>

Abstract
Radical cascade cyclization of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazones/oximes has recently emerged as an efficient and powerful protocol for the construction of diverse and valuable functionalized pyrazolines and isoxazolines. In this review, three catalytic ways of radical cascade cyclization of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazones/oximes are summarized and classified; these are transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed systems, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free systems, and photo&#8208;/electrocatalytic systems, respectively. Through these methods, various functional groups are installed on the pyrazoline and isoxazoline skeletons to enrich the small organic molecule library.

         <title>Umpolung Strategy for Arene C&#8722;H Etherification Leading to Functionalized Chromanes Enabled by I(III) N&#8208;Ligated Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>

Abstract
The direct formation of aryl C&#8722;O bonds via the intramolecular dehydrogenative coupling of a C&#8722;H bond and a pendant alcohol represents a powerful synthetic transformation. Herein, we report a method for intramolecular arene C&#8722;H etherification via an umpoled alcohol cyclization mediated by an I(III) N&#8208;HVI reagent. This approach provides access to functionalized chromane scaffolds from primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols via a cascade cyclization&#8208;iodonium salt formation, the latter providing a versatile functional handle for downstream derivatization. Computational studies support initial formation of an umpoled O&#8208;intermediate via I(III) ligand exchange, followed by competitive direct and spirocyclization/1,2&#8208;shift pathways.

         <title>Divergent Access to Benzocycles through Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylative Cyclizations</title>

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed chemodivergent approach to five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered benzocycles from dienyl arenes tethered with a ketone has been developed. Through proper choice of coordinating ligands and catalytic conditions, copper&#8208;catalyzed borylative cyclization of a single dienyl arene can be diverted to two different pathways, leading to indanols and dihydronaphthalenols with high stereoselectivity. The chiral bidentate bisphosphine ligand (S,S)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE was optimal for asymmetric copper&#8208;allyl addition to a tethered ketone via a boat&#8208;like transition state, whereas NHC ligands led to boro&#8208;allyl addition producing indanols with high diastereoselectivity.

Abstract
Tunable C&#8722;H activation cascade reactions between quinazolinones and cyclopropenones have been developed. Notably, cyclopropenones, acting as multi&#8208;functional building blocks, could be assembled to construct up to 10&#8197;distinct heterocyclic scaffolds in a one&#8208;pot manner.

         <title>Domino Ring&#8208;Opening of N&#8208;Tosyl Vinylaziridines Triggered by Aryne Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
The reactivity of N&#8208;tosyl vinylaziridines toward arynes has been demonstrated under mild and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions to yield 2&#8208;(phenanthren&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;sulfamides in moderate to good yields. The selective synthesis of N&#8208;H and N&#8208;aryl products was accomplished using CsF in MeCN and KF/18&#8208;C&#8208;6 in 1,4&#8208;dioxane, respectively. This cascade process involves a sequential Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, ring&#8208;opening aromatization, ene&#8208;reaction, and selective N&#8208;arylation reaction.

         <title>Indium Catalyzed Sequential Regioselective Remote C&#8722;H Indolylation and Rearrangement Reaction of Peroxyoxindole</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Indium&#8208;catalyzed sequential remote C&#8722;H functionalization (C&#8208;6 position) and C3&#8208;indolylation of peroxyoxindole using indole is described for the synthesis of terindolinone derivatives. Whereas, N&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;phenyl peroxyoxindole derivatives undergoes consecutive skeletal rearrangement to generate transient carbocation, which has been trapped with indole nucleophile to generate 2&#8208;(1H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazin&#8208;3(4H)&#8208;one derivatives. In contrast with Indium (III) Chloride, FeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O facilitates oxidative cleavage of the peroxyoxindole (Hock cleavage) and further reaction with indole to afford biologically important trisindoline derivatives. A plausible mechanism has been proposed for these reactions with experimental evidences.

Abstract
A synthesis of spiroindolinone&#8208;isoindolinone skeletons is presented. The protocol is through a Ugi four&#8208;component reaction followed by highly efficient and mild copper&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular tandem C&#8722;N/C&#8722;C coupling process. Control experiments demonstrated that the formation of C&#8722;C bond is a copper catalyzed coupling process rather than base promoted nucleophilic aromatic substitution pathway which proposed in Prof. Van der Eycken's palladium catalyst system previously.

Abstract
2&#8208;Imino&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;selenadiazole derivatives can be synthesized from hydrazides and isoselenocyanates by sequential oxidation and a tributylphosphine (PBu3)&#8208;promoted annulation reaction at room temperature. In this synthetic process, crude less stable N&#8208;aroyldiazene intermediates generated by I2&#8208;mediated oxidation of hydrazides were used directly in a subsequent annulation reaction to afford the selenadiazole products. The merits of the present synthetic strategy also include absence of transition metals and gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

Abstract
The construction of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides has gradually become a hotspot of carbohydrate chemistry in recent years. In this work, we present an efficient, regioselective, stereoselective and widely applicable strategy for the synthesis of 2&#8208;indolyl&#8208;C&#8208;deoxyglycosides via Ir(I)&#8208;catalyzed, pyridine&#8208;group&#8208;directed C&#8722;H functionalization. This method exhibits high tolerance for the functional groups of indoles and the protecting groups of carbohydrates. Moreover, this protocol has good stereoselectivity and mainly produces &#946;&#8208;configuration products. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and several practical transformations were conducted for further applications. Meantime, we also explored the mechanism of this method and proposed a catalytic cycle

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidative Azo&#8208;Ene Cyclization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidative azo&#8208;ene cyclization has been developed. The developed CuI/DMAP/O2 system efficiently facilitates the aerobic oxidation of ene&#8208;containing hydrazides to azo compounds, which undergo azo&#8208;ene cyclizations for the synthesis of oxazolidinones. In addition, the present approach enables the synthesis of lactams, as well as a nitroso&#8208;ene cyclization. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that two carbonyl groups were essential for the successful azo&#8208;ene cyclization and that a concerted mechanism might be plausible for this azo&#8208;ene cyclization.

         <title>Recent Advances in Catalytic Asymmetric Aza&#8208;Michael Addition Triggered Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
As an important branch of the Michael addition reaction, the aza&#8208;Michael addition cascade reaction has been developed rapidly in recent years. This is because the reaction serves as an important method for effectively constructing functionalized C&#8722;N bonds, which can be widely used in the synthesis of chiral drugs and their intermediates and natural products. Given the importance of this topic, this review highlights the recent developments of aza&#8208;Michael addition triggered cascade reactions in asymmetric synthesis, including aza&#8208;Michael/Michael, aza&#8208;Michael/Aldol, aza&#8208;Michael/Henry, aza&#8208;Michael/hemiacetal, aza&#8208;Michael/Mannich, aza&#8208;Michael/alkylation, aza&#8208;Michael/cyclization, aza&#8208;Michael/ring&#8208;opening, aza&#8208;Michael&#8208;IED/HAD, aza&#8208;Michael/INCR, and aza&#8208;Michael/1,6&#8208;conjugate addition reactions. In this paper, the reaction mechanism and derivatization experiments of different reactions are timely introduced to provide a more comprehensive theoretical basis for subsequent studies.

Abstract
We describe herein that the cross&#8208;coupling of bromodifluoroacetamides with (iodoethynyl)arenes proceeds without recourse to any photocatalyst when exposed to visible light at room temperature to afford alkynyldifluoroacetamides in 62&#8211;83% yields (27 examples). Several control experiments suggest that the reaction involves the homolysis of bromodifluoroacetamides and the coupling of the resultant difluoromethyl radical species with the 1&#8208;iodoalkynes via a radical chain process. Divergent transformations of the coupling products led to various organofluorine compounds, demonstrating the synthetic utility of the developed photo&#8208;coupling method.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of Alkynyl Norbornene Derivatives for the Synthesis of Benzofused Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Modular approaches, which allow a systematic variation of heteroaromatic cores and substituents, are crucial for the development of heteroaromatic drug candidates and organic functional materials. A new strategy involving the cyclization of heteroarenes tethered with alkynes through a norbornene bridge was developed. The precursors were readily prepared by a three&#8208;component coupling process of heteroaryl halides, norbornadiene, and terminal alkynes. The Pd catalytic system derived from Pd(OAc)2 and 2&#8208;(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine transformed a variety of five&#8208;membered heteroarenes to the corresponding benzofused products, including (di)benzothiophene, indazole, carbazole, indole, and benzofuran, with aryl and alkyl substituents at the C4(C7) position. During the cyclization process, the norbornene ring underwent a retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, serving as an acetylene synthon. This approach was used to synthesize naphthalene derivatives from electron&#8208;rich arenes, demonstrating its versatility in the annulation of (hetero)aromatic rings.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A radical alkylarylation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;methacryloyl indoles via autoxidation of alkylboronic acids was developed under metal&#8208;free conditions for the construction of indolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolinone derivatives. Primary and secondary alkyl boronic acids were utilized as suitable alkyl sources with O2 as the clean and green oxidant in a simple operate mode. Moreover, this protocol can also be applied to the construction of benzimidazo&#8208;[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolinone derivatives.

Abstract
The first direct transition metal&#8208;free access to 3,6&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;pyrones from &#945;&#8208;chloro aldehydes and &#946;&#8208;tosyl enones is reported. The reactions proceed via the Michael addition/lactonization/elimination cascade. The regioselective addition of NHC&#8208;bound enolates/homoenolates to the enones bearing a bulkier functionality such as tosyl group at the &#946;&#8208;position has remained challenging. The 3,6&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;pyrones could be converted to valuable products such as 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenes, 1,4&#8208;disubstituted naphthalenes as well as anthracenes and 6,13&#8208;disubstituted dihydro&#8208;ethenopentacenes in a simple operation.

         <title>A Study of the Reactions of 3&#8208;Bromopropenals with Anilines for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Bromo Enaminones</title>

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot strategy for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;bromo enaminones is reported. The reactions proceed via the p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (TsOH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O) catalyzed reactions of 3&#8208;bromopropenals with anilines in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and does not require an external brominating agent. The chemoselective 1,2&#8208;addition was accomplished by employing aniline with a sterically hindered electron&#8208;withdrawing group attached at the ortho&#8208;position. In addition, the reactions involving other aniline derivatives as nucleophiles have resulted in minor yields of 1,4&#8208;addition product. The 3&#8208;bromopropenals showed a diverse range of reactivities with aniline derivatives.

         <title>Time&#8208;Dependent Diastereodivergent Michael Addition Enabled by Phosphazenes Acting as Catalysts and Reactants</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A switching of the step order within cascade process enabled design of a diastereodivergent approach to phosphazenopyrrolines with a 1,3&#8208;relationship of stereocenters. The approach is based on a cascade transformation of readily accessible &#947;&#8208;azidobutyronitriles that includes Staudinger, aza&#8208;Wittig and Michael steps. Stereodivergence is achieved at the Michael step that is self&#8208;catalyzed by phosphazene intermediates and provides construction of quaternary stereocenter. Depending on the type of phosphazene intermediates, generating either via Staudinger reaction or via subsequent intramolecular aza&#8208;Wittig reaction with nitrile and then reacting with a Michael acceptor, either trans&#8208; or cis&#8208;isomers of the target product can be produced. Thus, diastereoselectivity can be achieved by varying the time of addition for the Michael acceptor. Therefore, three distinct roles were revealed for phosphazenes in this process: catalysts, reactants and stereoselectivity controllers. This stereodivergent strategy was applied for the synthesis of all stereoisomers of the biorelevant tetrahydro&#8208;7&#8208;aza&#8208;indoles.

         <title>Mechanochemistry Enabled Construction of Isoxazole Skeleton via CuO Nanoparticles Catalyzed Intermolecular Dehydrohalogenative Annulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A dehydrohalogenative approach for isoxazole annulation by partnering &#946;&#8208;vinyl halides and &#945;&#8208;nitrocarbonyls under mechanochemical setting was accomplished. This chemistry is operative under the cooperative catalysis of cupric oxide nanoparticles (&lt;50&#8197;nm) and DABCO. The key beneficial aspects of this protocol include: (i) broad substrate scope, (ii) no vigorous work&#8208;up, (iii) short reaction time, (iv) solvent&#8208;free condition, (v) commercial viability of substrates/reagents (vi) good chemical yields and selectivity. The other merit of this chemistry is the ease with which CuO can be recuperated and reused after the reaction with not much drop in catalytic activity for six runs. With no confinement to &#946;&#8208;vinyl halides, the validated condition is also open to alkynes for isoxazole preparation, thereby establishing the broader utility of the current methodology.

         <title>Insight into the Modes of Activation of Pyridinium and Bipyridinium Salts in Non&#8208;Covalent Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A series of pyridinium and bipyridinium salts were prepared and their catalytic properties were evaluated in the aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between imines and Danishefsky diene. Depending on the substituents of the pyridinium/bipyridinium rings and on the nature of the counterion, two mechanisms of activation were demonstrated. In case of non&#8208;substituted rings, the substrate is activated through charge transfer involving the aryl ring on the C&#8208;side of the imine. When halogen atoms were introduced on the catalysts, the activation mode switched to halogen bond involving the imine nitrogen lone pair. Moreover, alternative activation modes based on hydrogen bonding and radical cation were ruled out. This work allowed us to develop two families of catalysts whose potential was demonstrated in the cycloaddition of various imines with Danishefsky diene. The first family is composed of the simple methyl pyridinium triflate and dioctyl bipyridinium triflate. The former is active only with imines bearing a p&#8208;methoxyphenyl group on the C&#8208;side and the latter was found to be efficient with imines bearing different substituents on both the N&#8208; and C&#8208;sides of the imines. The second family is based on halogenated pyridinium salts which proved active with almost all considered imines.

Abstract
The pyridone fragment in the ligand [2, 2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridin]&#8208;6(1H)&#8208;one (bipy&#8208;6&#8208;OH) enables the oxidative Heck reaction of simple arenes with oxygen as the sole oxidant and no redox mediator. Arenes with either electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing groups can be functionalized in this way. Experimental data on the reaction with toluene as the model arene shows that the C&#8722;H activation step is turnover limiting and that the ligand structure is crucial to facilitate the reaction, which supports the involvement of the pyridone fragment in the C&#8722;H activation step. In the case of fluoroarenes, the alkenylation of mono and 1,2&#8208;difluoro benzenes requires the presence of bipy&#8208;6&#8208;OH. In contrast, this ligand is detrimental for the alkenylation of 1,3&#8208;difluoro, tri, tetra and pentafluoro benzenes which can be carried out using just [Pd(OAc)2]. This correlates with the acidity of the fluoroarenes, the most acidic undergoing easier C&#8722;H activation so other steps of the reaction such as the coordination&#8208;insertion of the olefin become kinetically important for polyfluorinated arenes. The use of just a catalytic amount of sodium molybdate as a base proved to be optimal in all these reactions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pyridone fragment in the ligand [2, 2&#8217;-bipyridin]-6(1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-one (bipy-6-OH) enables the oxidative Heck reaction of simple arenes with oxygen as the sole oxidant and no redox mediator. Arenes with either electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups can be functionalized in this way. Experimental data on the reaction with toluene as the model arene shows that the C&#8722;H activation step is turnover limiting and that the ligand structure is crucial to facilitate the reaction, which supports the involvement of the pyridone fragment in the C&#8722;H activation step. In the case of fluoroarenes, the alkenylation of mono and 1,2-difluoro benzenes requires the presence of bipy-6-OH. In contrast, this ligand is detrimental for the alkenylation of 1,3-difluoro, tri, tetra and pentafluoro benzenes which can be carried out using just [Pd(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]. This correlates with the acidity of the fluoroarenes, the most acidic undergoing easier C&#8722;H activation so other steps of the reaction such as the coordination-insertion of the olefin become kinetically important for polyfluorinated arenes. The use of just a catalytic amount of sodium molybdate as a base proved to be optimal in all these reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
An asymmetric 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition reaction of dialkyl diazomethylphosphonates to para&#8208;quinone methides promoted by phase&#8208;transfer catalysis has been developed. A series of chiral diarylmethylated diazomethylphosphonates were accessed with up to 85% yields and 99% ee enantioselectivities. The resulting products were further transformed into bioactive compounds, namely, a chiral dihydrocinnoline phosphonate and a chiral &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonate, bearing diarylmethine stereogenic centers.

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Cyclobutenes and Spirocycles via Asymmetric P(III)/P(V) Redox Catalysis</title>

Abstract
An enantioselective phosphine&#8208;catalyzed transformation has been developed for the synthesis of chiral cyclobutene triesters and fluorinated spirocyclic compounds. The strategy involved a P(III)/P(V) redox cycling process, via in&#8197;situ reduction of phosphine oxide with phenylsilane. This catalytic methodology has enabled the enantioselective synthesis of functionalized cyclobutenes (24 examples, up to 94% ee). On the occasion of the extension of this study to &#945;&#8208;ketoester indenone substrates, a surprising reactivity has been discovered for the synthesis of spiro&#8208;indenone products.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Oxidative Homocoupling of 2&#8208;Acyl Imidazoles</title>

Abstract
A diastereoselective and enantioselective construction of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds is reported. Nishiyama's RuPhebox complex (2.0&#8197;mol% catalyst loading) serves as a chiral Lewis acid catalyst in conjunction with BrCCl3 and a base for the oxidative homocoupling of 2&#8208;acyl imidazoles via the stereocontrolled reaction of intermediate Ru enolates with in&#8197;situ brominated 2&#8208;acyl imidazoles. Cleavage of the achiral imidazole auxiliary provides optically active 2,3&#8208;disubstituted succinic acids which are useful intermediates in the synthesis of chiral compounds like the natural product class of lignans.

Abstract
We present a synthetic protocol for the construction of polysubstituted five&#8208;membered heterocycles via TMSOTf&#8208;catalyzed formal [3+2] cycloaddition of electron&#8208;rich alkynes, which features free from any metal, atom economy and water as the main by&#8208;product. Furthermore, alkenyl ether adduct has been verified as the key intermediate. Notably, by utilizing this approach, we can synthesize a broad range of polysubstituted furans, thiophenes and pyrroles, and extend this transformation to deliver fused&#8208;polyheterocycles. This reaction can be achieved on a gram scale and the corresponding products are intermediates for producing diverse potentially useful scaffolds.

         <title>Optimizing the Iodide/Iodonium/O2 Oxidation Cycle Enhances the Scope, Selectivity, and Yields of Hydroiodic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Multicomponent Cyclocondensation Reactions</title>

Abstract
Catalytic iodine in the presence of water acts indirectly as a source of Br&#248;nsted acid and, concurrently, generates iodonium ion and hydrogen peroxide, which mediate the final oxidative aromatization step in the multicomponent cyclocondensation of an aromatic amine and two aliphatic aldehyde compounds. The oxidative cycle in this and related iodine&#8208;catalyzed reactions is seldom discussed, generally unoptimized, and rarely investigated in detail. This work establishes that two independent catalytic cycles (H+ and I&#8722;/I+) drive such multicomponent cyclocondensation/ oxidation reactions, provided that the oxidant is generated in sufficient concentration to inhibit oxidation of the dihydroquinoline by the intermediate iminium cation. The complementary dual catalytic cycles, when optimized, act in concert to suppress side product formation, which simplifies isolation and purification of the self&#8208;aggregating products, and increases the efficiency and scope of the Wang&#8208;Kozlov multicomponent reaction.

Abstract
An iridium/f&#8208;diaphos catalytic system for the enantioselective hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;ketoesters via dynamic kinetic resolution is reported. The desired anti &#946;&#8217;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino esters were obtained in moderate to good yields (60&#8211;95%) with 72&#8211;99% ees and 91:9 to 99:1 drs. This protocol tolerates various functional groups and could be easily conducted on gram scale with lower catalyst loading (TON up to 9100).

Abstract
Metalaxyl, an acylalanine fungicide, was synthesized through catalytic continuous sequential&#8208;flow reactions. Commonly used syntheses of this compound use batch systems and suffer from problems such as coproduction of halogen&#8208;containing by&#8208;products derived from acyl and alkyl halides in the substitution reactions of 2,6&#8208;dimethylaniline. To minimize waste and enhance efficiency, a halide&#8208;free approach including two continuous&#8208;flow catalytic processes, heterogeneous Pt&#8208;catalyzed reductive alkylation and homogeneous acid&#8208;catalyzed amidation with an acid anhydride, was developed. Systematic examination of the two reactions in flow mode enabled a high&#8208;yielding, two&#8208;step sequential continuous&#8208;flow process to be achieved.

         <title>Protein Engineering of d&#8208;Succinylase from Cupriavidus sp. for d&#8208;Amino Acid Synthesis and the Structural Implications</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
d&#8208;Amino acids are important chiral building blocks for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Previously, we have used d&#8208;Succinylase (DSA) from Cupriavidus sp. P4&#8208;10&#8208;C and N&#8208;succinyl amino acid racemase (NSAR, EC.4.2.1.113) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus NCA1503 to produce d&#8208;amino acids via the dynamic kinetic resolution of N&#8208;succinyl&#8208;dl&#8208;amino acids. However, the use of this bioconversion system remains challenging for industrial application due to the insufficient enantioselectivity of DSA toward N&#8208;succinyl&#8208;d&#8208;amino acids. Therefore, we screened DSA mutants for improved enantioselectivity by directed evolution. Several mutants showed improved enantioseletivity compared to wild&#8208;type DSA. L182E mutant had superior enantioselectivity, and the thermal stability was also remarkably improved by this single mutation. We solved the crystal structure of the L182E mutant in complex with succinic acids at a resolution 2.0&#8197;&#197;. The mutated residues in all generated mutants that showed improved enantioselectivity (including the substituted Glu182 in the L182E mutant) are found very close to the active site. The solved crystal structure also provides some rationale to explain the higher thermostability of the L182E mutant compared to wild&#8208;type DSA. d&#8208;phenylalanine and d&#8208;tryptophan were produced in high conversion (approximately 90%) with 98.8% ee and 99.6% ee, respectively, using coupled L182E DSA and NSAR with the one&#8208;pot enzymatic method. These data suggested that L182E DSA may be a useful biocatalyst for industrial d&#8208;amino acids production.

         <dc:description>








Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed amination to access diarylamines has been developed through C&#8722;CN bond activation of aryl nitriles with anilines. In this developed catalytic protocol, various aromatic and heteroaromatic nitriles could be utilized as the electrophiles to couple with substituted anilines. A diversity of diarylamines were obtained in 15&#8211;95% yields.

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Access to &#946;&#8208;Substituted o&#8208;Hydroxyphenyl Ethyl Ketones from 4&#8208;Chromanone and its Application in Preparation of a Silica&#8208;Supported Cobalt(II) Salen Complex</title>

Abstract
The o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketone skeleton is prevalent in many biologically active natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Herein, a two&#8208;step protocol has been developed for synthesis of various &#946;&#8208;substituted o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketones. A base&#8208;mediated ring opening of 4&#8208;chromanone was used to introduce the &#946;&#8208;ethoxyl o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketone intermediary, followed by nucleophile substitution under BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O assisted conditions to give the desired &#946;&#8208;carbon, nitrogen, or thiol substituted o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketones. With the aid of this protocol, a silica&#8208;supported cobalt(II) salen complex was successfully prepared and its structure was confirmed by FTIR, 13C MAS NMR, UV&#8208;Vis absorption, and XPS spectra. The immobilized cobalt(II) salen catalyst not only displayed comparable catalytic activity in the synthesis of several heterocycles including 1,3&#8208;oxazolidine, benzimidazole, and benzoxazole as compared with their homogeneous counterparts, but also could be recycled for several times without obvious loss of its catalytic activity.

Herein, a two-step protocol has been developed for synthesis of various &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-substituted &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketones. A base-mediated ring opening of 4-chromanone was used to introduce the &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-ethoxyl &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketone intermediary, followed by nucleophile substitution under BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O assisted conditions to give the desired &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-carbon, nitrogen, or thiol substituted &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketones. With the aid of this protocol, a silica-supported cobalt(II) salen complex was successfully prepared and its structure was confirmed by FTIR, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C MAS NMR, UV-Vis absorption, and XPS spectra. The immobilized cobalt(II) salen catalyst not only displayed comparable catalytic activity in the synthesis of several heterocycles including 1,3-oxazolidine, benzimidazole, and benzoxazole as compared with their homogeneous counterparts, but also could be recycled for several times without obvious loss of its catalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereo&#8208; and Regioselective [3+3] Annulation Reaction Catalyzed by Ytterbium: Synthesis of Bicyclic 1,4&#8208;Dihydropyridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An ytterbium catalyzed formal [3+3] cycloaddition of cyclic enamines and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones catalyzed is reported. The reaction proceeds with a &#8216;head to tail&#8217; regioselectivity through a conjugate addition of the enamine moiety followed by an amine&#8208;carbonyl condensation. In addition the use of chiral enamines provided a high degree of stereoselectivity, driven by a possible balance between steric and &#960;&#8208;stacking effects. The resulting bicyclic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines were evaluated as antiproliferative agents against A549 (carcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cell) and SKOV3 (human ovarian carcinoma) human tumor cell lines. Good toxicities were found for some of the compounds against A549 and SKOV3 cell lines, with best IC50 values of 0.89&#8197;&#956;M for A549 and 6.69&#8197;&#956;M for SKOV3, and a very good selectivity was observed towards MRC5 (non&#8208;malignant) cell lines.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalysed electrophilic N&#8208;imination of aryl(alkenyl) boronic acids with a stable hypervalent iodine(III) reagent containing a transferable (diarylmethylene)amino group is developed. The electrophilic C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling reaction proceeds smoothly at room temperature under oxidant&#8208;free and base&#8208;free conditions, which is further characterized by the broad functional group compatibility, thereof, extending the N&#8208;electrophile scope of electrophilic C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling outside the limitation of N&#8722;O and N&#8722;Cl reagents.

         <title>Synthesis of Enantioenriched Amines by Iron&#8208;Catalysed Amination of Alcohols Employing at Least One Achiral Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The synthesis of a broad range of enantioenriched amines by the direct Fe&#8208;catalysed coupling of amines with alcohols through the borrowing hydrogen strategy, while at least one of these substrates is achiral is reported. When starting from &#945;&#8208;chiral amines and achiral alcohols, a wide range of enantioenriched amine products, including N&#8208;heterocyclic moieties can be obtained with complete retention of stereochemistry and the power of this method is demonstrated in the one&#8208;step synthesis of known pharmaceuticals from commercially available, simple enantiopure primary amines and achiral alcohols. It was also found that the use of &#946;&#8208;branched enantioenriched primary alcohols and achiral amines as reaction partners leads to a partial loss of stereochemical integrity in the final product, however, a systematic optimization enabled partial retention of enantiopurity and possible parameters effecting for racemization were identified.

Abstract
The reactions of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) and isomeric &#946;&#8208;styrylmalonates with conformationally non&#8208;rigid &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines in the presence of Lewis acids were studied. The effect of the structural features of starting compounds on the process course was determined. The main attention was focused to discover the reaction conditions for the formal (4+2)&#8208;cycloaddition pathway with the possibility of variation of the &#945;&#8208;substituent in azadiene instead of known (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition synthetic methodology. Based on the results obtained, a method for the diastereoselective synthesis of substituted trans,trans&#8208;tetrahydropyridines was developed. Three substrate&#8208;sensitive diverse Lewis acid catalytic systems have been employed based on Sc(OTf)3, Sn(OTf)2, and GaCl3. The use of GaCl3 as a Lewis acid allows to obtain a minor product of the formal (2+2+2)&#8208;cycloaddition, which represents a fully 1,2,3,4,5,6&#8208;hexasubstituted cyclohexane derivative produced with diastereoselectivity &gt;30:1. Appropriate mechanistic and stereochemical models have been suggested.

         <dc:description>
The front cover picture, designed and donated by WesWizzArt and painted by the Mexican artist Way (Wayra Castillo&#8208;Guerrero), illustrates the toluene dioxygenase&#8208;catalyzed conversion of aromatics. The enzyme exhibits a high affinity for monocyclic, but only a low one for bicyclic substrates. A semi&#8208;rational designed mutant library opened the way for the conversion of the bicyclic substrates naphthalene, 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline and 2&#8208;phenylpyridine at unprecedented rates, enabling the biosynthesis of their products in substantial quantities. Variants at active site positions M220, A223 and F366 exhibited a major influence in product formation and selectivity. Details can be found in the Research Article by Bernhard Hauer and co&#8208;workers (J. L. Wissner, J. T. Schelle, W. Escobedo&#8208;Hinojosa, A. Vogel, B. Hauer, Adv. Synth.
