      <dc:description>Abstract: We describe the application of S&#8722;H bond insertion reactions of aryl diazoacetates with cysteine residues that enabled metal&#8208;free, S&#8722;H functionalization under visible&#8208;light conditions.

      <title>Reprogramming epoxide hydrolase  to improve enantioconvergence in hydrolysis of styrene oxide scaffolds</title>
      <dc:description>Enantioconvergent hydrolysis by epoxide hydrolase is a promising method for the synthesis of important vicinal diols. However, the poor regioselectivity of the naturally occurring enzymes results in low enantioconvergence in the enzymatic hydrolysis of styrene oxides. Herein, modulated residue No. 263 was redesigned based on structural information and a smart variant library was constructed by site&#8208;directed modification using an &#8220;optimized amino acid alphabet&#8221; to improve the regioselectivity of epoxide hydrolase from Vigna radiata (VrEH2). The regioselectivity coefficient (r) of variant M263Q for the R&#8208;isomer of meta&#8208;substituted styrene oxides was improved 40&#8211;63&#8208;fold, and variant M263V also exhibited higher regioselectivity towards the R&#8208;isomer of para&#8208;substituted styrene oxides compared with the wild type, which resulted in improved enantioconvergence in hydrolysis of styrene oxide scaffolds. Structural insight showed the crucial role of residue No. 263 in modulating the substrate binding conformation by altering the binding surroundings. Furthermore, increased differences in the attacking distance between nucleophilic residue Asp101 and the two carbon atoms of the epoxide ring provided evidence for improved regioselectivity. Several high&#8208;value vicinal diols were readily synthesized (&gt;88% yield, 90%&#8211;98% ee) by enantioconvergent hydrolysis using the reprogrammed variants. These findings provide a successful strategy for enhancing the enantioconvergence of native epoxide hydrolases through key single&#8208;site mutation and more powerful enzyme tools for the enantioconvergent hydrolysis of styrene oxide scaffolds into single (R)&#8208;enantiomers of chiral vicinal diols.</dc:description>

The regioselectivity coefficient (r) of variant M263Q for the R&#8208;isomer of meta&#8208;substituted styrene oxides was improved 40&#8211;63&#8208;fold, and variant M263V also exhibited higher regioselectivity towards the R&#8208;isomer of para&#8208;substituted styrene oxides compared with the wild type, which resulted in improved enantioconvergence in hydrolysis of styrene oxide scaffolds. Structural insight showed the crucial role of residue No. 263 in modulating the substrate binding conformation by altering the binding surroundings. Furthermore, increased differences in the attacking distance between nucleophilic residue Asp101 and the two carbon atoms of the epoxide ring provided evidence for improved regioselectivity. Several high&#8208;value vicinal diols were readily synthesized (&amp;gt;88% yield, 90%&#8211;98% ee) by enantioconvergent hydrolysis using the reprogrammed variants. These findings provide a successful strategy for enhancing the enantioconvergence of native epoxide hydrolases through key single&#8208;site mutation and more powerful enzyme tools for the enantioconvergent hydrolysis of styrene oxide scaffolds into single (R)&#8208;enantiomers of chiral vicinal diols.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Advances in Asymmetric Amino Acid Synthesis Enabled by Radical Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral amino acids (AAs), being the main &#8220;building&#8221; blocks of the living organisms, are also an important class of organic compounds which broadly applied in synthetic chemistry, biochemistry, catalysis and the designing of new drugs. According to the industrial&#8208;commodity market, chiral non&#8208;proteinogenic AAs containing various functional groups come to the fore. To date, radical cross&#8208;coupling reactions are becoming an option as an attractive powerful tool for AA syntheses. Owing to mild reaction conditions and high functional&#8208;group tolerance, radical chemistry represents an ideal strategy for the synthesis of challenging complex non&#8208;proteinogenic AAs. Moreover, the radical cross&#8208;coupling allows introducing AA residue into drug scaffolds and natural compounds. In the present review, we wish to summarize and discuss all the reported to date methods of the asymmetric synthesis of AAs using radical chemistry by presenting a comprehensive account of the literature in this &#64257;eld going back to 1990. We especially emphasize on a radical chemistry approach and, exclusively, on stereoselective synthesis of various &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;AAs and derivatives employing a different type of radical initiators starting from AIBN and organostannes and ending with powerful photoredox catalysis.

      <dc:description>Amines represent an important class of industrial feedstock as many pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, petrochemicals, and healthcare products are derived from them. Researchers around the globe are investing their time and efforts in developing novel methodologies for the functionalization of aliphatic and aromatic amines by improving their functional group tolerance, regioselectivity, chemoselectivity, and time efficiency. Among the most studied methods for the derivatization of amines, C&#8210;H activation is gaining significant interest due to easy to follow, environmentally friendly, and time economic protocols. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8210; and C(sp2)&#8210;H  activation is a fascinating field of chemistry where the electronics of the structure, functional group characteristics, and nature of the directing group (DG) decide the outcome of the chemical reaction. Under carefully tailored reaction conditions and by a selection of the correct substrates/reagent, site&#8208;specific C&#8210;H functionalization can be achieved at different positions with respect to the amine group.

      <title>Zinc&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Alkylation of Aromatic Amines with Alcohols: A Ligand Free Approach</title>
      <dc:description>An efficient zinc&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;alkylation reaction of aromatic amines was achieved using aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic alcohols as the alkylating reagent. A variety of aniline derivates, including heteroaromatic amines, underwent N&#8208;alkylation reaction and furnished the corresponding monoalkylated product in good to excellent yields. The application of the reaction is also further demonstrated by synthesizing a 2&#8208;phenylquinoline derivative from acetophenone and 2&#8208;amino benzyl alcohol. Deuterium labeling experiments show that the reaction proceeds via borrowing hydrogen process.</dc:description>

      <title>How Site&#8208;Directed Mutagenesis Boosted Selectivity of a Promiscuous Enzyme</title>
      <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Acetylhexosaminidases (GH20; EC 3.2.1.52) are &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;glycosidases with a dual activity for cleaving both &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) units from glycostructures. This substrate promiscuity is a hurdle in the selective synthesis of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;acetylhexosamine oligosaccharides combining both GlcNAc and GalNAc units since there are hardly any GalNAc transferring enzymes available for synthetic applications. We present here site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of a synthetically potent promiscuous &#946;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;acetylhexosaminidase from &lt;i&gt;Talaromyces flavus&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Tf&lt;/i&gt;Hex), which, as a wild type, exhibits a GalNAcase/GlcNAcase ratio of 1.2. On the basis of molecular modeling, we identified crucial amino acid residues responsible for its GalNAcase/GlcNAcase selectivity. Six site&#8208;directed mutants were prepared, heterologously expressed in &lt;i&gt;Pichia pastoris&lt;/i&gt;, purified, and kinetically characterized. As a result, novel engineered enzymes with an up to 7&#8208;times higher selectivity for either GalNAc or GlcNAc substrates were obtained, preserving the favorable properties of the wild type &lt;i&gt;Tf&lt;/i&gt;Hex, mainly its transglycosylation potential and tolerance to functional groups in the substrate molecule. The substrate selectivity and transglycosylation yield were further corroborated by reaction engineering. The new selective and synthetically capable enzymes were applied in the preparation of tailored &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;acetylhexosamines.</dc:description>

      <title>A Convoluted Polyvinylpyridine&#8208;Palladium Catalyst for Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling and C&#8208;H Arylation</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. The development of highly active and reusable supported catalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling and catalytic C&#8208;H arylation is important for fundamental and applied chemistry, with these reactions being used to produce medical compounds and functional materials. Herein, we found that a mesoporous composite made of a linear poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) and tetrachloropalladate acted as a dual&#8208;mode catalyst for a variety of cross&#8208;coupling reactions, with both Pd nanoparticles and a Pd complex catalyst being observed under different conditions. The polyvinylpyridine&#8208;palladium composite 1 was readily prepared via the molecular convolution of poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) and sodium tetrachloropalladate to provide a hardly soluble polymer&#8208;metal composite. The Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling and the C&#8208;H arylation of aryl chlorides and bromides with arylboronic acids, thiophenes, furans, benzene, and anisole proceeded in the presence of 0.004 mol% (40 mol ppm) to 1 mol% Pd of 1 to afford the corresponding coupling products in high yields.
Furthermore, the catalyst was reused without an appreciable loss of activity. Pharmaceutical compounds and functional materials were synthesized via the coupling reactions. N2 gas adsorption/desorption analysis indicated that the catalyst had a mesoporous nature, which played a crucial role in the catalysis. In the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings, in situ generated palladium nanoparticles in the polymer matrix were catalytically active, while a polymeric Pd(II) complex was crucial in the C&#8208;H arylations. These catalytic species were investigated via XAFS, XPS, far&#8208;infrared absorption, and Raman spectroscopies, as well as DFT calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>A Strategy for Accessing Aldehydes via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;O/C&#8208;N Bond Cleavage in the Presence of Hydrosilanes</title>
      <dc:description>We report the catalytic reduction of both active esters and amides by selective C(acyl)&#8211;X (X = O, N) cleavage to access aldehyde functionality via a palladium&#8208;catalyzed strategy. Reactions are promoted by hydrosilanes as reducing reagents with good to excellent yields and with excellent chemoselectivity for C(acyl)&#8211;N and C(acyl)&#8211;O bond cleavage. Carboxylic acid C(acyl)&#8211;O bonds are activated by 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;4,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (CDMT) to form triazine ester intermediates, which further react with hydrosilanes to yield aldehydes in one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step procedures. We demonstrate that C(acyl)&#8211;O cleavage/formylation offers higher yields and broader substrate scopes compared with C(acyl)&#8211;N cleavage under the same reaction conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Tailor&#8208;Made Polydiacetylene Micelles for the Catalysis of 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions in Water</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. A colloidal catalyst was developed by complexation of copper chloride in polydiacetylene micelles. The latter were designed to accommodate and stabilize copper salts, by providing a suitable liganded environment. Micelles were valorized as nanoreactors for the promotion of the Huisgen cycloaddition reaction in water thanks to their central hydrophobic core which permitted not only aqueous dispersion, but also concentration of the reagents at the vicinity of the catalyst. The system was found to be active on a variety of substrates and efficiently operated under sustainable conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>HFIP&#8208;Mediated Decarboxylative [4+3]&#8208;Annulation of Azaoxyallyl Cations with Isatoic Anhydride</title>
      <dc:description>
The front cover picture, provided by Sung&#8208;Gon Kim and his co&#8208;workers, illustrates an efficient [4+3]&#8208;annulation reaction between in situ generated azaoxyallyl cations and isatoic anhydride to afford seven&#8208;membered 1,4&#8208;benzodiazepinediones. This annulation involves the cascade reaction of decarboxylative addition of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) to isatoic anhydride, addition to the azaoxyallyl cation generated from &#945;&#8208;halohydroxamate, and intramolecular substitution to yield 1,4&#8208;benzodiazepinediones. Details of this work can be found in the full paper on pages XXXX&#8211;YYYY (E. Kim, C. Y. Lee, S.&#8208;G. Kim, Adv. Synth. Catal . 2020, 362, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202000439).

      <title>Recent Progress on Reductive Coupling of Nitroarenes by Using Organosilanes as Convenient Reductants</title>
      <dc:description>Nitroarenes are stable, low&#8208;cost, and readily available starting materials. The directly utilize nitroarenes in synthetically valuable C&#8211;N bond formation is of great significance, because the pre&#8208;reduction step to corresponding amines can be avoided. Previously, phosphines and carbon monoxide (CO) are the most widely used reductants in the reductive cyclization or/and carbonylation of nitroarenes. Currently, much attention has been attracted to organosilanes as new potential reducing agents, not only because they are inexpensive, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, and mild reagents, but also various novel reaction models of nitroarenes have been explored. In this review, we mainly summarize the recent progress on the reductive coupling of nitroarenes by using organosilanes as the end reductants. We hope that a deep understanding of the reaction model and underlying working mechanism can provide a timely guideline for researchers who are interested in this fantastic area, leading to further exploration of practical and efficient reductive coupling of nitroarenes for C&#8208;N bond formation and N&#8208;heterocycle synthesis.</dc:description>
