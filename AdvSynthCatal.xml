         <title>Harnessing Alkene Radical Anions via Electroreduction Strategy: An Emerging Paradigm for Alkene Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 368, Issue 3, 3 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents the recent achievements in the synthetic applications of electrochemically generated alkene radical anions, and systematically elaborates on their formation mechanisms.

Alkene&#8208;derived radical anions represent a unique and versatile class of reactive intermediates with extensive applications in synthetic chemistry for constructing diverse structurally and synthetically valuable organic molecules. These intermediates exhibit dual reactivity because they possess both carbon radical and anionic characters, thus offering new opportunities and attractive paradigms for the divergent functionalization of alkenes. Conventional generation of alkene radical anions relies heavily on stoichiometric reductants, which often suffer from poor selectivity, limited substrate scope, and the formation of undesired byproducts. This has motivated the exploration of robust and sustainable alternative strategies. In recent years, electrocatalysis has emerged as a promising and efficient synthetic tool, providing a synthetically attractive and environmentally friendly alternative for the single&#8208;electron reduction of alkenes. This review primarily focuses on electrochemically generated alkene radical anions and their pivotal role in enabling alkene functionalization, and systematically elaborates on their formation mechanisms. The objective of this review is to offer a comprehensive picture of the current state of the field, enhance the understanding of this chemical paradigm, and inspire innovative research to promote broader innovative applications of electrocatalytic alkene radical anion chemistry.

         <title>Rhodium Multitasking Catalysis Integrating Long&#8208;Range Isomerization, Cycloisomerization, and Hydrosilylation of 1,n&#8208;Dienes to Give 2,3&#8208;Disubstituted Dihydrobenzofurans: Mechanistic Insight Into Functionalization&#8208;Controlled Reactivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 368, Issue 3, 3 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered a rhodium catalyst that performs sequential long&#8208;range isomerization, cycloisomerization, and hydrosilylation of 1,n&#8208;dienes to yield silylated 2,3&#8208;disubstituted dihydrobenzofurans. This unprecedented multitasking system also demonstrates that the choice of hydrosilylation reagent significantly affects the alkene&#8208;isomerization equilibrium, offering new mechanistic insights into multitasking catalysis.

Multitasking catalysis offers a robust and sustainable strategy for achieving multiple transformations within a single catalytic system. Herein, we describe a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed multitasking sequence that orchestrates long&#8208;range isomerization, cycloisomerization, and hydrosilylation of 1,n&#8208;dienes in a single operation. This work represents the first demonstration of a single catalytic system capable of performing these three distinct reactions consecutively. The transformation efficiently delivers silylated 2,3&#8208;disubstituted dihydrobenzofuran derivatives, which are key structural motifs in bioactive and functional molecules. Systematic optimization revealed that the hydrosilylation step is highly sensitive to the steric and electronic properties of the silane reagent. Mechanistic investigations, including in&#8201;situ 1H NMR analyses, indicated that the hydrosilane strongly influences the equilibrium of long&#8208;range isomerization by modulating the availability of catalytically active Rh&#8211;H species. In contrast to our previously developed hydroboration system, the current hydrosilylation conditions suppress alkene migration, resulting in limited product convergence. These findings uncover how the terminal functionalization reagent governs multitasking catalysis and provide valuable insight for designing next&#8208;generation integrated catalytic systems.

         <title>Direct Evidence for the Role of Silver(I) Salts in Promoting the Oxidative Addition Step in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Arylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 368, Issue 3, 3 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exact role of silver salts, a commonly used additive in Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation reactions with aryl halides, has been widely questioned. In this work, we provide direct experimental evidence that, in addition to being a halogen scavenger, silver can also promote the oxidative addition step.

Silver is a widely used additive in Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation reactions with aryl halides, which compromises the overall sustainability of the processes. The role of silver in these transformations has been attributed to its ability to act as a halogen scavenger to regenerate the active catalyst. However, the possibility of silver playing other roles has been widely questioned, as replacing silver salts with other halogen scavengers has proven challenging. In this work, we provide experimental evidence demonstrating the role of silver as a promotor of the rate&#8208;limiting oxidative addition step of Pd(II) to Pd(IV) with aryl iodides, a role that, until now, has not been experimentally established. These findings are further supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Markovnikov Hydroboration of Alkenes via Hydrogen Atom Transfer (MHAT)</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 368, Issue 3, 3 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov hydroboration of alkenes is disclosed. Remarkably, this methodology operates at mild reaction conditions and delivers high catalytic efficiency (TONs and TOFs up to 2800 and 2600 h&#8208;1, respectively). Furthermore, this approach diverges from previous reports by relying on two subsequent hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer processes: one generating the copper hydride (HAT) and another activating the alkene (MHAT).

The synthesis of organoboron compounds is continually improving due to their relevance as intermediates in the construction of diverse fine chemicals. Among the different strategies used, direct hydroboration of alkenes remains the most direct and atom&#8208;economical, with a large part of recent efforts focused on catalysts based on the more abundant and less toxic first&#8208;row transition metals. Herein, we present a protocol for the copper&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov hydroboration of alkenes under mild reaction conditions, requiring only stoichiometric amounts of a simple and commercially available borane (pinacolborane). Remarkably, beyond its advantages in catalytic activity, this system proceeds through a new radical pathway for catalytic hydroborations, encompassing two subsequent hydrogen atom transfer processes: one that activates the borane and forms the copper hydride (HAT) and another that activates the alkene (MHAT).

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Aryloxycarbonylayion of Aryl Bromides with Phenols Using Inositol Hexaformate as an Efficient CO Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 368, Issue 3, 3 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a novel carbon monoxide surrogate inositol hexaformate (HFI) and applied it to the palladium&#8208;catalyzed aryloxycarbonylation of aryl bromides with phenols. HFI liberates six molecules of carbon monoxide, exhibiting a significantly higher efficiency and CO capacity than the conventional formate surrogates. This surrogate provides a practical and efficient platform for the synthesis of carbonyl&#8208;containing compounds in the laboratory.

Carbonylation represents a straightforward and powerful strategy for installing carbonyl groups into organic molecules. However, the widespread adoption of carbon monoxide gas in laboratories is hampered by its toxicity, flammability, and smell&#8208;less properties. To address these challenges, we developed a new carbon monoxide surrogate, inositol hexaformate (HFI), and demonstrated its utility in the palladium&#8208;catalyzed aryloxycarbonylation of aryl bromides with phenols. Notably, HFI efficiently releases six equivalents of carbon monoxide, showing a significant improvement in efficiency over commonly used formate surrogates. This work provides a practical and robust method for conducting carbonylation reactions, which is expected to broaden the accessibility of this important transformation in synthetic chemistry.

However, the widespread adoption of carbon monoxide gas in laboratories is hampered by its toxicity, flammability, and smell-less properties. To address these challenges, we developed a new carbon monoxide surrogate, &lt;i&gt;inositol hexaformate&lt;/i&gt; (HFI), and demonstrated its utility in the palladium-catalyzed aryloxycarbonylation of aryl bromides with phenols. Notably, HFI efficiently releases six equivalents of carbon monoxide, showing a significant improvement in efficiency over commonly used formate surrogates. This work provides a practical and robust method for conducting carbonylation reactions, which is expected to broaden the accessibility of this important transformation in synthetic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design and Utilization of Stable Hydrofluoroolefin&#8208;Based Trifluoropropynyl Surrogate for Sonogashira Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 368, Issue 3, 3 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel methodology for the construction of aromatic and heteroaromatic trifluoropropynyl derivatives has been developed. The new protocol is based on a tandem Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction between a bench&#8208;stable trifluoropropynyl carbinol reagent, generated from the commercially available and inexpensive hydrofluoroolefin&#8208;1234yf gas, and (hetero)aryl iodides, leading to a wide scope of trifluoromethylated (hetero)arylacetylenes.

The synthesis of aromatic trifluoromethylated scaffolds is of considerable importance in organic chemistry and pharmaceutical research. Herein, a catalytic method with broad functional group tolerance for the construction of aromatic and heteroaromatic trifluoropropynyl derivatives is reported. This methodology is based on a tandem Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction between an hydrofluoroolefins&#8208;based carbinol and (hetero)aryl iodides. The developed protocol employs inexpensive and commercially available HFO&#8208;1234yf gas to generate a bench&#8208;stable trifluoropropynyl carbinol reagent.

         <title>Hydricity Modulated Methylation of Indoles and Nitriles Using Methanol: Selective Synthesis of C3&#8208;Methylated Indoles, Bisindolylmethanes, and &#945;&#8208;Methylated Nitriles</title>

         <dc:description>
Chemodivergent functionalization of indoles with methanol via borrowing hydrogen and interrupted borrowing hydrogen pathways was achieved using benzimidazole&#8208;based Ru(II) complexes. The product selectivity between C3&#8208;methylated indoles and bis(indolyl)methanes was effectively governed by tuning the hydricity of the Ru&#8208;H species through ligand backbone modification. This study demonstrates the pivotal role of metal hydricity in directing product outcomes, offering a versatile catalytic system with broad substrate scope.

The selective functionalization of indoles using methanol via borrowing hydrogen (BH) and interrupted borrowing hydrogen (I&#8208;BH) pathways offers a sustainable approach to access value&#8208;added molecules. Herein, the synthesis of a series of benzimidazole&#8208;functionalized cyclometalated (NC)&#8208;Ru(II) and (NN)&#8208;Ru(II) complexes and their application in the chemodivergent functionalization of indoles with methanol are reported, affording either C3&#8208;methylated indoles or bis(indolyl)methanes (BIMs). The product selectivity was governed by the hydricity of the Ru&#8211;H species, which was effectively tuned by ligand backbone modification. This varying catalytic behavior of these complexes under consideration toward the selective formation of different products was fairly understood by analyzing their electronic properties based on electrochemical and density functional theory studies. Additionally, the electron&#8208;rich (NC)&#8208;Ru complex facilitated the &#945;&#8208;methylation of phenylacetonitrile under relatively mild conditions. Finally, an array of control experiments and the identification of different intermediates aided in establishing the proposed mechanism.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven C&#63743;H Alkylation, Arylation, and Acylation of Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones</title>

This article presents a catalyst&#8208;free, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven strategy for the direct C&#63743;H functionalization of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. Using ambient air as the sole oxidant, this unified platform enables alkylation, arylation, and acylation under mild conditions. The protocol expands structural diversity of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones, offering a sustainable tool for late&#8208;stage functionalization and drug discovery.

Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and their derivatives constitute a privileged class of bioactive scaffolds with broad pharmacological potential, including anticancer, antibacterial, and neuroregulatory activities. Developing efficient and sustainable strategies for their molecular diversification under mild conditions remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. Here, we report a catalyst&#8208;free, light&#8208;driven C&#63743;H functionalization strategy that exploits visible light and ambient air as the sole oxidant to achieve direct alkylation, arylation, and acylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. This operationally simple protocol features excellent substrate scope and functional group tolerance, delivering a wide range of structurally diverse quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones derivatives in a rapid and sustainable manner. Mechanistic investigations, supported by control experiments and spectroscopic studies, reveal that the transformation proceeds via the excitation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor complexes, which endows this system with the unique capability of enabling efficient C&#63743;H functionalization without the need for any external catalyst.

         <dc:description>
A remote (4 + 3) cycloadditions of pyrrolidinone&#8208;based Morita&#8722;Baylis&#8722;Hillman carbonates with &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines has been developed. In the presence of PPh3, the reaction could deliver a series of novel and densely substituted fused bicyclic azepines under mild reaction condition in good yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and regioselectivity, along with good substrate applicability.

A mild, synthetically straightforward and selective PPh3&#8208;promoted remote (4&#8201;+&#8201;3) cycloaddition reactions of pyrrolidinone&#8208;based Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines have been first established. This reaction enables the synthesis of a diverse range of synthetically valuable, highly substituted pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;b]azepines bearing three tertiary chiral centers in good yields (up to 87%) with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and diastereoselectivities (all cases&#8201;&gt;25:1 dr). In addition, the synthetic utility of this method was further demonstrated by scale&#8208;up reactions and synthetic transformations of the product. Additionally, molecular docking studies have revealed that the novel fuzed bicyclic privileged structures, which incorporate azepine and pyrrolone motifs, possess potential anticancer activity.

&lt;p&gt;A remote (4 + 3) cycloadditions of pyrrolidinone-based Morita&#8722;Baylis&#8722;Hillman carbonates with &#945;, &#946;-unsaturated imines has been developed. In the presence of PPh3, the reaction could deliver a series of novel and densely substituted fused bicyclic azepines under mild reaction condition in good yields with excellent diastereo- and regioselectivity, along with good substrate applicability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mild, synthetically straightforward and selective PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-promoted remote (4&#8201;+&#8201;3) cycloaddition reactions of pyrrolidinone-based Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates with &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated imines have been first established. This reaction enables the synthesis of a diverse range of synthetically valuable, highly substituted pyrrolo[2,3-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]azepines bearing three tertiary chiral centers in good yields (up to 87%) with excellent chemo-, regio-, and diastereoselectivities (all cases&#8201;&amp;gt;25:1 dr). In addition, the synthetic utility of this method was further demonstrated by scale-up reactions and synthetic transformations of the product. Additionally, molecular docking studies have revealed that the novel fuzed bicyclic privileged structures, which incorporate azepine and pyrrolone motifs, possess potential anticancer activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Cascade Annulation of CF3&#8208;Imidoyl Sulfoxonium Ylides with Activated Nitriles for the Divergent Synthesis of Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Substituted Pyrroles and Quinolines</title>

A copper catalyst&#8208;controlled cascade annulation of CF3&#8208;imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides with activated nitriles has been developed, which enables the divergent synthesis of trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted pyrroles and quinolines, respectively.

A copper catalyst&#8208;controlled cascade annulation of CF3&#8208;imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides with activated nitriles has been disclosed, which enables the divergent synthesis of trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted pyrroles and quinolines. For the synthesis of pyrroles, the [3&#8201;+&#8201;2] annulation proceeds to give the multisubstituted pyrrole products. For the synthesis of quinolines, the CuI&#8208;induced intramolecular cyclization is involved in the reaction with the cleavage of C&#63743;CN bond.

         <dc:description>
Herein, a base&#8208;promoted C3&#8208;cyanoalkylation reaction of oxindoles with readily available acrylonitrile derivatives is presented. This method exhibits excellent functional group compatibility, and mechanistic studies unambiguously confirm that the reaction proceeds via a radical process mediated by an EDA complex under light&#8208;free conditions.

A novel method for base&#8208;promoted C3&#8208;cyanoalkylation of oxindoles with readily available acrylonitrile derivatives has been achieved in the absence of light. Substrates bearing various substituents show good compatibility in an economical and redox&#8208;neutral system. Mechanistic investigations unambiguously confirm a radical process mediated by an electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex, formed from oxindole enolates associating with substituted acrylonitriles.

         <title>Photothermal Catalytic CO2 Dissociation Over Nb2O5&#8211;Nb2CTx Schottky Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 368, Issue 3, 3 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Nb2O5&#8211;Nb2CTx Schottky heterostructures have been designed to complete photoinduced thermochemical CO2 dissociation reaction, achieving a high CO production rate of 70.1&#8201;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1at 300&#176;C. The high activity arose from the superior photothermal conversion efficiency of Nb2CTx, fast charge separation efficiency of Schottky heterostructures, and efficient photoinduced oxygen vacancies cycling ability of Nb2O5.

Solar&#8208;driven CO2 dissociation reaction via a two&#8208;step thermochemical cycle is a promising option, but it requires extremely high reaction temperatures (&gt;1000&#176;C). Herein, we designed Nb2O5&#8211;Nb2CTx Schottky heterostructures that could achieve photoinduced thermochemical CO2 dissociation reaction at 300&#176;C. Under light irradiation, the CO production rate of Nb2O5&#8211;Nb2CTx reaches to 70.1&#8201;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is three times higher than that of pristine Nb2O5. The high activity arose from the superior photothermal conversion efficiency of Nb2CTx, fast charge separation and transfer kinetics from the Schottky heterostructures, increased surface CO2 adsorption sites from photoinduced oxygen vacancies, and efficient redox cycling ability. This work presents a feasible strategy to fabricate photothermal synergistic catalysts which could achieve stable CO2 dissociation performance at mild reaction temperature.

         <title>Revealing the Differences in Enhancing C&#8211;N Coupling Reaction Among Different Types of Semiconductor Catalysts for Electrosynthesis of Urea</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 368, Issue 3, 3 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, this study explores the differences in urea synthesis performance by utilizing an n&#8208;type semiconductor catalyst (CeO2) and a p&#8208;type semiconductor catalyst (Co3O4). CeO2 exhibits superior performance in electrocatalytic urea synthesis, achieving a urea yield of 889.4&#8201;&#956;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.45 V versus RHE. These values surpass those of the p&#8208;type semiconductor catalyst Co3O4 (562.2&#8201;&#956;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1). The catalytic performance of CeO2 in urea synthesis was 58.2% higher than Co3O4. Systematic experiments confirm the significant advantage of the n&#8208;type semiconductor catalyst CeO2 in suppressing competing reaction. Its synthesis pathway resembles two racing cars: the &#8220;race track&#8221; of the p&#8208;type semiconductor catalytic system is obstructed by stones, leaving it far behind the performance of the n&#8208;type semiconductor system.

Electrochemical C&#8211;N coupling for urea synthesis reduces greenhouse gas emissions, addressing climate change. Semiconductor catalysts show promise, but how semiconductor type (n&#8208; or p&#8208;) affects C&#8211;N coupling remains unclear. Herein, this study explores the differences in urea synthesis performance by utilizing an n&#8208;type semiconductor catalyst (CeO2) and a p&#8208;type semiconductor catalyst (Co3O4). CeO2 exhibits superior performance in electrocatalytic urea synthesis, achieving a urea yield of 889.4&#8201;&#956;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 18.5% at &#8722;0.45 V versus RHE. These values surpass those of the p&#8208;type semiconductor catalyst Co3O4 (562.2&#8201;&#956;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 and 16.1%, respectively). Electrochemical characterization revealed that CeO2 possesses a significantly greater double&#8208;layer capacitance and a lower charge transfer resistance, as determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, compared to Co3O4, indicating a larger electrochemically active surface area and more facile interfacial charge transfer kinetics. Systematic experiments confirm the significant advantage of the n&#8208;type semiconductor catalyst CeO2 in suppressing competing reaction. In&#8201;situ attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy reveals C&#8211;N bond stretching vibrations at 1458&#8201;cm&#8722;1, confirming C&#8211;N coupling reaction occurs. This study provides deeper mechanistic insights into urea electrosynthesis over semiconductor catalysts and offers guidance for establishing carbon&#8208;cycle&#8208;based economic models.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a Faradaic efficiency of 18.5% at &#8722;0.45 V versus RHE. These values surpass those of the p-type semiconductor catalyst Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (562.2&#8201;&#956;g h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; mg&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 16.1%, respectively). Electrochemical characterization revealed that CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; possesses a significantly greater double-layer capacitance and a lower charge transfer resistance, as determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, compared to Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, indicating a larger electrochemically active surface area and more facile interfacial charge transfer kinetics. Systematic experiments confirm the significant advantage of the n-type semiconductor catalyst CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in suppressing competing reaction. In&#8201;situ attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy reveals C&#8211;N bond stretching vibrations at 1458&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, confirming C&#8211;N coupling reaction occurs. This study provides deeper mechanistic insights into urea electrosynthesis over semiconductor catalysts and offers guidance for establishing carbon-cycle-based economic models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A divergent Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed strategy transforms &#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxonium ylides into two distinct scaffolds under mild conditions. With [Ru(p&#8208;cymene)Cl2]2/Cu(OAc)2&#183;H2O, amination with amines yields biologically relevant &#945;&#8208;ketoamides, while homocoupling in their absence affords &#945;,&#945;,&#946;&#8208;tricarbonyl ylides. Both pathways proceed via a common Ru&#8208;carbene intermediate, display broad scope, and enable downstream heterocycle formation and late&#8208;stage modifications.

         <title>LMCT Photocatalysis Coupled with Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer (XAT) for Difunctionalizing Alkene Fluoroalkylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 368, Issue 3, 3 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a copper LMCT photocatalysis/XAT&#8208;coupled fluoroalkylation of alkenes using bromodifluoroacetic anhydride (BDFAA) and LiCl to form difluorolactones. Essential aspects include solubility&#8208;modulated proximity effect between lithium ion and BDFAA, solvent&#8208;mediated propagative radical relay via HAT/XAT, and thermodynamic control of intermediates, enabling reactivity tuning of radical species for efficient reaction.

Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) photocatalysis, which utilizes simple transition metal salts to enable redox&#8208;potential&#8208;independent conversion of anions into radicals, has recently gained significant interest in organic synthesis. Radical relay, which transforms primary radicals generated via LMCT into secondary radicals through atom transfer, expands the synthetic utility of LMCT photocatalysis. However, the high reactivity of LMCT&#8208;derived radical species strongly limits the reaction modes and applicable substrates. In this study, we successfully couple copper LMCT photocatalysis with halogen atom transfer (XAT) and demonstrate efficient gem&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactone synthesis via difunctionalizing fluoroalkylation of alkenes using bromodifluoroacetic anhydride (BDFAA) and LiCl. Key steps include chlorine radical formation via the LMCT of [CuCl3]Li and bromine atom transfer from BDFAA to generate a fluoroalkyl radical. Although theoretical calculations suggest that chlorine radical addition to alkenes is significantly faster than XAT, the desired yet energetically unfavorable XAT proceeds through solubility&#8208;modulated proximity between the catalyst and BDFAA, as well as a solvent&#8208;mediated radical relay involving hydrogen atom transfer from acetonitrile. This study reveals a novel application of LMCT photocatalysis and proposes a general strategy for tuning radical reactivity through the entire reaction system.

         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective synthesis of Pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]coumarin containing aza&#8208;quaternary stereocenter has been reported. The reaction proceeds via [3+3] annulation of &#945;&#8208;CF3 alkynyl ketimines and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins under metal/organo catalytic system. This method affords CF3&#8208;containing chiral pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]coumarin derivatives in good yields (up to 85%) with outstanding enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee) under mild reaction conditions.

An efficient regio&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]coumarins has been developed via a [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] annulation reaction between &#945;&#8208;CF3 alkynyl ketimines and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins. The reaction proceeds via a squaramide&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific Mannich reaction followed by a Lewis acid&#8208;mediated annulation, enabling excellent control of both regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Notably, this represents the first enantioselective synthesis of pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]coumarin derivatives bearing an aza&#8208;quaternary stereocenter. The methodology exhibits broad substrate compatibility with both steric and electronic variations. Practicality of the protocol is demonstrated by scale&#8208;up reaction as well as diverse downstream functionalizations.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Reduction of Carboxylic Acids to Alcohols With Ammonia Borane</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 368, Issue 3, 3 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a general protocol for reducing diverse carboxylic acids to alcohols using readily available Pd&#8208;catalyst and ammonia borane. Aromatic, heterocyclic, aliphatic, and di&#8208;acids were converted in good to excellent yields, with fatty acids giving up to 98%. The method's utility is highlighted through late&#8208;stage reduction of bioactive compounds.

We report a general protocol for the reduction of different kinds of carboxylic acids to produce alcohols using a commercial heterogeneous Pd&#8208;catalyst and ammonia borane as a reducing agent. Applying this Pd&#8208;based catalyst, a series of aromatic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic carboxylic acids, including di&#8208;acids, were reduced to their corresponding alcohols in good to excellent yields. Interestingly, fatty acids were also conveniently converted to fatty alcohols with a yield of up to 98%. Further, the synthetic utility of this reduction process is showcased by performing late&#8208;stage reduction of bioactive compounds.

         <title>Electrochemical Imidoyl Radical&#8208;Involved Functionalization of Isocyanides to Construct Benzotriazole&#8208;Sulfonamide and Guanidine Derivatives</title>

Electrochemical synthesis methods are developed for benzotriazole&#8208;benzenesulfonamide derivatives using benzotriazoles, isocyanides, and benzenesulfonamides as substrates, and electrochemical synthesis methods for guanidine derivatives using benzotriazoles and isocyanides as substrates. Both methods require no exogenous chemical oxidants and can be carried out at room temperature.

Benzotriazoles and benzenesulfonamides arewidely present in various bioactive molecules, so the development of mild and convenientsynthetic strategies to synthesize compounds containing these functional groups is crucial for discovering candidate therapeutic drugs with higher efficacy and fewer side effects. Herein, we report an imidoyl radical&#8208;involved electrochemical method for the difunctionalization of isocyanides with benzotriazoles and benzenesulfonamides, and also realize the electrochemical reaction of isocyanides with benzotriazoles to construct guanidine derivatives. This strategy achieves the difunctionalization of isocyanide under the action of a base, with benzotriazole as the radical precursor and sulfonamide as the nucleophile. Either does not require a chemical oxidant and can be carried out at room temperature.

         <title>Recent Progress in the Moderation Strategies of Bi&#8208;precatalyst Reconstruction for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 368, Issue 3, 3 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic electrochemical reconstruction of Bi&#8208;based catalysts during CO2 reduction to formate is a key origin of structural degradation, ultimately undermining long&#8208;term stability and product selectivity. This review provides an overview of recent advances in stabilization strategies that regulate this dynamic reconstruction, which can be broadly classified into three categories: passive suppression, proactive direction, and circumvention strategies. This review aims to construct a rigorous theoretical framework for the rational design and controllable synthesis of advanced Bi&#8208;based catalysts, thereby outlining some potential directions for the future applications.

Bismuth (Bi)&#8208;based materials have emerged as highly promising catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) toward formate production, owing to their high intrinsic catalytic activity and low cost. However, a critical challenge for practical application is the dynamic electrochemical reconstruction of Bi&#8208;based catalysts during CO2RR electrocatalysis, an inherently uncontrollable and indeterminate process that often leads to severe structural degradation of catalysts and a subsequent decay in long&#8208;term stability and selectivity. Herein, this review focuses on the development of stabilization strategies to moderate the dynamic reconstruction of Bi&#8208;based catalysts. In detail, this review systematically analyzes and summarizes three distinct principal strategies: (1) passive suppression strategy, which preserves high&#8208;valent Bi&#948;+ species by suppressing reconstruction; (2) proactive direction strategy, which directs a controllable &#8220;self&#8208;optimization&#8221; reconstruction toward desired active species; and (3) circumvention strategy, which circumvents the complex reconstruction process through direct synthesis and modification of metallic Bi catalysts. This review aims to construct a rigorous theoretical framework for the rational design and controllable synthesis of advanced Bi&#8208;based catalysts, thereby outlining some potential directions for the future industrial applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Imidazo&#8208;Fuzed Pyrazino[2,1&#8208;b]quinazolinones Through Gold(I)&#8208; and Base&#8208;Promoted Intramolecular Hydroamination Cyclization</title>

A variety of imidazo&#8208;fuzed pyrazino[2,1166b]quinazolinone scaffolds were prepared in good to excellent yields through gold(I)166catalyzed and base166mediated intramolecular hydroamination reactions of N3166alkynyl quinazolinone tethered imidazoles. 5166Methylene imidazo166fuzed pyrazino[2,1166b]quinazolinones were obtained under gold(I)166catalyzed conditions, while base166mediated conditions afforded 5166alkyl imidazo166fuzed pyrazino[2,1166b]quinazolinones. Moreover, the prepared 5&#8208;methylene imidazo166fuzed pyrazino[2,1166b]quinazolinones could be applied in the various metal ions recognition based on their fluorescence properties.

We describe a facile method to prepare a variety of imidazo&#8208;fuzed pyrazino[2,1&#8208;b]quinazolinone scaffolds in good to excellent yields through gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed and base&#8208;mediated intramolecular hydroamination reactions of N3&#8208;alkynyl quinazolinone tethered imidazoles. It was found that 5&#8208;methylene imidazo&#8208;fuzed pyrazino[2,1&#8208;b]quinazolinones were obtained under gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed conditions, while base&#8208;mediated conditions afforded 5&#8208;alkyl imidazo&#8208;fuzed pyrazino[2,1&#8208;b]quinazolinones. The reaction could be easily prepared on a gram scales. More importantly, the prepared 5&#8208;methylene imidazo&#8208;fuzed pyrazino[2,1&#8208;b]quinazolinones could be applied in the various metal ions recognition based on their fluorescence properties.

Simple Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalysis
In their Research Article (10.1002/adsc.70236), Mukund P. Sibi and Norihiko Takeda report chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed &#945;&#8208;aminoxylation reactions. The cover depicts reaction components passing through an &#8220;enantioselective gate,&#8221; leading to enantioenriched products. In contrast to catalysts with bulkier substituents, a simple octahydrobinaphthol&#8208;based phosphoric acid is optimal.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective C(sp2)&#63743;H Alkylation and Heteroannulation of Hydroxyarenes With 2&#8208;Aryl Aziridines</title>

Iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;selective Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation of phenols with 2&#8208;aryl aziridines and heterocyclization of 2&#8208;naphthols with 2&#8208;arylaziridines to obtain benzoindolines are demonstrated under mild conditions. Ortho&#8208;alkylation occurs at a lower reaction temperature, whereas annulation takes place at room temperature. Synthetic transformations of the compounds lead to various important heterocycles.

Iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective ring opening of 2&#8208;aryl aziridines with unprotected phenols and 2&#8208;naphthols is achieved at room temperature. Here, the phenol acts as a C&#8208;nucleophile to selectively attack the more substituted ring carbon of the aziridine to form a C&#8208;alkylated product. Interestingly, in the case of 2&#8208;naphthol, dehydrative heteroannulation occurs after the C&#8208;alkylation to deliver benzoindolines at room temperature. Mechanistic experiments suggest that the reaction proceeds via a Lewis acid&#8208;assisted formation of a carbocation intermediate, followed by dehydrative cyclization to give benzoindolines by the reaction of 2&#8208;naphthols and 2&#8208;aryl aziridines.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Enabled Organocatalyst&#8208;Assisted Enantioselective Regiodivergent Cascade Reactions: Overriding Intrinsic Reactivity of Vinylogous Pyrazolones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 368, Issue 3, 3 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for enantioselective regiodivergent accessing complex spiro&#8208;pyrazolone scaffolds with multiple quaternary stereogenic centers is established. The enantioselective regiodivergent outcome of this protocol is tuned by the polarity of the solvent, thus providing both enantioselective regioisomers using quinine&#8208;derived bifunctional catalysts.

Enantioselective regiodivergent cascade reactions remain a significant challenge due to the dual requirement of achieving precise control over both regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. Herein, a quinine&#8208;derived bifunctional catalyst&#8208;driven strategy is presented for constructing the diverse asymmetric polycyclic spiro&#8208;pyrazolone scaffolds in a cascade manner. The cascade reaction is initiated by the asymmetric vinylogous Michael addition (VMA) of arylidene pyrazolones to the indandione&#8208;derived acceptors, followed by regioselective transformations that lead to structurally diverse products. The divergent reaction outcomes are governed by the interaction between the in situ generated conjugate acid of the catalyst and the anionic intermediate (VMA adduct). These outcomes are further modulated by adjustments in the reaction conditions, particularly the polarity of the solvent. In toluene, the reaction predominantly yields the cage product with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity via a cascade pathway involving asymmetric VMA/acetalization/oxa&#8208;Michael/Michael addition. In contrast, in MeCN, the reaction proceeds through an asymmetric VMA/proton transfer/aldol/acetalization, furnishing the fused product. Mechanistic studies reveal that the formation of the fused product involves an unusual and reversible reaction pathway. Specifically, the catalyst&#8208;controlled 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition of 1,3&#8208;indandione to the diene intermediate occurs under optimal conditions. This strategy demonstrates a versatile foundation for asymmetric regiodivergent cascade reactions.

A diverse range of (hetero)arylacetonitriles was synthesized in moderate to good yields. The method could be further extended to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules bearing an arene moiety.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Chemoselective Amide Bond Cleavage for the Synthesis of N&#8208;Acyl Sulfoximines in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 368, Issue 3, 3 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable and metal&#8208;free protocol enables the chemoselective N&#63743;C bond cleavage of amides for the synthesis of N&#8208;acyl sulfoximines. Utilizing bench&#8208;stable N&#8208;acyl saccharin as an acyl source, this green process operates efficiently in both batch and continuous&#8208;flow systems, affording high yields, broad substrate scope, reagent recyclability, and significant reduction in reaction time.

Amides and sulfoximines are pivotal structural motifs in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals; however, sustainable and direct methods for their incorporation remain underdeveloped. Herein, a metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free protocol is presented for the efficient synthesis of N&#8208;acyl sulfoximines via selective N&#63743;C bond cleavage of amides, utilizing bench&#8208;stable N&#8208;acyl saccharin as an acylating agent for NH&#8208;sulfoximines. This transformation proceeds under mild conditions using green solvents and exhibits a broad substrate scope encompassing natural products and drug derivatives. Notably, the method is compatible with both batch and continuous&#8208;flow platforms, achieving a significant reduction in reaction time from 24&#8201;h to 15&#8201;min. The process offers high yields, excellent functional group tolerance, and gram&#8208;scale scalability. Furthermore, the recovery of recyclable saccharin enhances atom economy and minimizes waste generation.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Deaminative Radical Diversification of Sulfonamides via CuI/Photoredox Synergy: A Direct Strategy for (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Iodovinyl Sulfones</title>

Unlocking sulfonamide diversity through a light&#8208;driven copper catalyst: A one&#8208;step strategy bypasses preactivation, directly transforming these medicinally vital scaffolds into stereocontrolled (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;iodovinyl sulfones&#8212;molecular building blocks primed for drug discovery.

A dual&#8208;catalytic metallaphotoredox strategy repurposes sulfonamides as sulfonylating reagents via radical cascades, leveraging copper's dual role as photoredox mediator and coupling catalyst. Exemplified by iodosulfonylation of alkynes, the protocol achieves in&#8201;situ sulfonamide diazotization to generate sulfonyl radicals, followed by regioselective addition to alkynes and copper&#8208;catalyzed iodination. This all&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy eliminates the need for sulfonamide prefunctionalization, offering step&#8208;economy, operational simplicity, and broad functional group tolerance.

         <title>Organocatalytic Atroposelective Arylation: A Practical Strategy for the Synthesis of Axially Chiral Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 368, Issue 3, 3 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalytic atroposelective arylation has emerged as one of the most powerful strategies for the synthesis of axially chiral compounds over the past decade. This review highlights breakthroughs in different catalytic modes, with particular emphasis on innovations in electrophile design and enantioselectivity control. These advances have significantly facilitated the construction of enantioenriched axially chiral frameworks, including biaryl, heterobiaryl, and nonbiaryl atropisomers featuring C&#63743;C or C&#63743;N stereogenic axes.

As important structural scaffolds prevalent in natural products, bioactive molecules, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials, axially chiral compounds have contributed significantly to the fields of drug discovery, materials science, and asymmetric catalysis. In recent years, conceptual strategies such as direct axis formation, de&#8201;novo arene construction, and functionalization of prochiral or racemic biaryls have spurred extensive research into the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of axial chirality. Among these, organocatalytic atroposelective arylation reactions, which enable the construction of a stereogenic axis in a single step under environmentally friendly, metal&#8208;free conditions, have demonstrated profound synthetic potential across diverse methodologies. This review systematically summarizes the seminal contributions and methodological developments in this field, with particular emphasis on the use of various electrophilic arylation reagents under catalyst control for the asymmetric synthesis of enantioenriched biaryl, heterobiaryl, and nonbiaryl atropisomers featuring diverse structures and well&#8208;defined conformational properties. Mechanistic insights are comprehensively discussed, along with the strengths and limitations. Furthermore, critical perspectives on future directions are provided, highlighting opportunities for further methodological innovation in scientific research and broader applications in industrial organic synthesis. We hope that the repertoire of organocatalytic atroposelective arylation reactions will continue to flourish and inspire chemists worldwide to further advance this evolving field.

Chiral sulfonimidoyl fluorides enable stereocontrolled SuFEx click chemistry for synthesizing enantioenriched S(VI) compounds, advancing covalent drug discovery and material design.

Sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) has emerged as a powerful click chemistry platform for covalent bond formation, with broad applications in drug discovery, polymer science, and bioconjugation. Among the diverse SuFEx linkers developed in recent years, sulfonimidoyl fluorides (RN=S(&#63742;O)F) have gained prominence due to their tunable electrophilicity, multifunctional modifiable sites, and the presence of chiral sulfur(VI) centers. This reagent exhibits exceptional reactivity in stereospecific SuFEx transformations, offering not only an efficient strategy for the synthesis of enantioenriched sulfur compounds but also a versatile foundation for covalent drug discovery and chemical probe development. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in sulfonimidoyl fluoride chemistry, with an emphasis on the construction of chiral S(VI) centers and stereocontrolled SuFEx reactions. Despite the limited literature in this nascent field, key breakthroughs and discuss future research directions, is consolidated providing forward&#8208;looking perspectives to stimulate further progress in stereospecific SuFEx chemistry.

         <title>Primary Amination of Enones Using Inorganic Ammonium Salts and Nitrogen Isotope Incorporation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 368, Issue 3, 3 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, and oxidant&#8208;free amination protocol for enones by employing user&#8208;friendly ammonium carbonate as the primary amino source was developed. When the ammonia surrogate is replaced with a readily available combination of 15NH4Cl and Na2CO3, a variety of completely 15N&#8208;labeled primary &#945;&#8208;aminoenones can be obtained.

Developing efficient methods to incorporate a primary amino group onto small molecules is of great importance in pharmaceutical and agrochemical fields. This significance becomes even more pronounced when it comes to accessing their corresponding 15N isotopologs. Here, we present a mild, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, and stoichiometric oxidant&#8208;free amination protocol for fluoroenones by employing user&#8208;friendly ammonium carbonate as the primary amino source. The protocol demonstrates high atom economy by directly converting starting materials into the &#945;&#8208;aminoenones. When the ammonia surrogate is replaced with a readily available combination of 15NH4Cl and Na2CO3, a variety of completely 15N&#8208;labeled primary &#945;&#8208;aminoenones can be synthesized with excellent functional group compatibility. The critical role of iodine in enhancing primary amination of fluoroenones is revealed by the transient formation of a more reactive iodinated enone, which facilitates downstream nucleophilic amination. Furthermore, the protocol exhibits robust scalability and is compatible with biologically and naturally relevant molecules. Molecular iodine is demonstrated as an inexpensive, environmentally benign, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle additive to pursue primary amination.

         <title>Exploring the Uncharted Indolizine Chemical Space: Construction of 5&#8208;Acylindolizines via a Domino Aldol&#8211;Vinylogous Aldol Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 368, Issue 3, 3 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A domino aldol condensation&#8211;intramolecular vinylogous aldol condensation process was implemented for the first time to enable access to a wide range of novel 5&#8208;acylated indolizines with a hydrogen, an alkyl, an aryl, or an alkoxy moiety at the C7 site.

Described herein are two annulative functionalization approaches to novel indolizines leveraging a domino aldol condensation&#8208;vinylogous aldol condensation procedure to construct the pyridine moiety of indolizines, enabling installation of an alkyl, an aryl, or an alkoxy group at the C7 position and an acyl group at the C5 position of indolizine framework. In the first approach, aldehyde oxidatively generated in situ from trialkylamine participated in a [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] annulation process with N&#8208;substituted pyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxaldehydes to give rise to 5&#8208;acylindolizines. In the second approach, the use of various aldehydes as reaction partners in this protocol allowed for the introduction of a wide range of substituents at the C7 site of indolizines.

         <title>Synthesis of Carboline Derivatives Using Domino Annulation Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 368, Issue 3, 3 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The purpose of this review is to highlight the recent cutting&#8208;edge developments in new domino annulation strategies for synthesizing various carboline derivatives. It emphasizes convenient, multibond forming, and selective domino annulation reactions using easily accessible starting materials, providing novel access to carboline derivatives with broad substrate scope and high efficiency.

Carbolines represent a class of privileged heterocyclic scaffolds that widely exist in natural products, pharmaceutical agents, agrochemicals, and functional materials. Despite their importance, the development of facile and efficient methods for synthesizing carboline derivatives remains a pivotal challenge in modern organic synthesis and heterocyclic chemistry. Domino annulation has evolved as a powerful strategy enabling convenient assembly of diverse heterocyclic molecules. Significant progress has been achieved in this field during recent years. This review highlights the important developments in the novel domino annulations for carboline synthesis since 2019. It aims to provide a valuable resource for organic researchers, offering deeper insights into the reactivity and synthetic potential of these elegant methods. It is also hoped that this review will inspire development of novel domino annulation strategies, thereby expanding the toolbox for N&#8208;heterocycle synthesis.

         <title>Recent Developments in Merging Photochemistry and Enantioselective Catalysis in Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 368, Issue 3, 3 February 2026. </description>

Combining enantioselective catalysis with photocatalysis in flow platforms enables efficient, selective, and scalable transformations. While this merger addresses key limitations of batch protocols, it also introduces new challenges specific to the integration of these methodologies. Recent studies underline both the promise and the need for refined strategies to fully exploit this approach.

The integration of asymmetric catalysis, crucial for the synthesis of structurally complex and enantioenriched target molecules, with photocatalysis, renowned for its atom economy and operational simplicity, offers a synergistic platform with considerable potential. Incorporating this dual strategy into flow systems further enhances the overall efficiency, enabling improved reaction control, scalability, and sustainability. This review provides an overview of recent advancements and discoveries that demonstrate the advantages of this merger, despite its relatively unexplored nature. The advancement of these processes together may uncover new possibilities in catalytic processes.

         <title>Hexafluoroisopropanol&#8208;Enabled One&#8208;Step Access to Oxetanol and Azetidinol Scaffolds from Unprotected Indoles and Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 368, Issue 3, 3 February 2026. </description>

An HFIP&#8208;enabled, metal&#8208;free protocol is presented for the direct coupling of indoles, pyrroles, and furan with strained four&#8208;membered ketones to access oxetanol and azetidinol scaffolds. This method shortens synthetic sequences and features broad substrate scope, operational simplicity, medicinal chemistry relevance, and applicability to late&#8208;stage modification.

This work reports a direct, hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP)&#8208;enabled, one&#8208;step construction of oxetanol and azetidinol scaffolds from unprotected indoles and other electron&#8208;rich (hetero)arenes via selective activation of strained four&#8208;membered heterocyclic ketones. The method operates under mild, protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free conditions, shows broad functional&#8208;group tolerance (e.g., halides, ester, boronate), and accommodates diversely substituted indoles. Compared with metal&#8211;halogen activation routes, this approach streamlines access to valuable strained tertiary&#8208;alcohol frameworks with strong potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Photoinduced Radical&#8208;Mediated Strategies for the Synthesis of Pyridine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 368, Issue 3, 3 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine is one of the most prevalent structural cores in pharmaceuticals. Photoinduced strategies provide a mild, efficient, and environmentally benign approach for the site&#8208;selective functionalization of pyridines. This review summarizes the research advances in photoinduced pyridine functionalization over the past several years, covering the following aspects: 1) direct functionalization of pyridines, 2) functionalization of pyridine from N&#8208;activated pyridinium salts, 3) functionalization of pyridine from 4&#8208;pyridylphosphonium salts, and 4) functionalization of pyridine via temporary dearomatization. For the studies included in each section, this paper will discuss the functional group tolerance and substrate scope of both the functionalization reagents and pyridine substrates, as well as the distinct reaction mechanisms arising from the structural differences of the reactants. In addition, this review will analyze the key factors governing the regioselectivity of pyridine functionalization via different photoinduced pathways.

Pyridine is one of the most prevalent structural cores in pharmaceuticals. Photoinduced methods provide a mild, efficient, and ecofriendly approach for the selective functionalization of pyridines. Herein, we summarize the research work on photoinduced pyridine functionalization over the past few years. The major advances in this field are systematically classified based on the differences in starting reactants. This account will review, within the research of each section, the functional group tolerance and substrate scope of functionalizing reagents and pyridine substrates, as well as the different mechanisms caused by the differences in each reactant. It will also analyze the key influencing factors of each photoinduced pathway on the pyridine functionalization sites and provide insights for the development of new methods for photoinduced radical&#8208;mediated highly regioselective functionalization of pyridines.

         <title>Dinickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Amination of Ketones With Aliphatic Amino Group</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 368, Issue 3, 3 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dinickel catalyst enables the direct &#945;&#8208;amination of both cyclic and acyclic ketones with aliphatic amino groups. This method provides a streamlined route to valuable &#945;&#8208;amino ketones in good yields with moderate to good enantioselectivities, offering a new protocol for synthesizing challenging chiral &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines.

Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;amination of ketones represents a straightforward strategy for synthesizing highly valuable chiral &#945;&#8208;amino ketones. However, most existing methods install a masked amino group, requiring additional steps to reveal the free amine. Consequently, the direct introduction of a simple alkylamino group at the ketone &#945;&#8208;position remains underdeveloped. Herein, we report a dinickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective &#945;&#8208;amination of simple ketones that directly constructs chiral &#945;&#8208;tertiary secondary amines. This reaction proceeds in moderate to good yield with good enantioselectivity via an SN2 nucleophilic substitution at nitrogen by a dinickel enolate.

An efficient method for the electrochemical monofluoromethylthiolation of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine has been developed. The method employs bunte salt as the monofluoromethylthiolating reagent. This reaction occurs in an undivided cell without the need for catalysts, oxidants, or electrolytes. Various substituted 2&#8208;arylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines C&#8208;3 monofluoromethylthiolation products are obtained regioselectively, with good yields.

The catalyst, UiO&#8208;67&#8208;Pyma&#8208;Ir, shows exceptional chemoselectivity to the reduction of nitro group and leaves other reducible groups unacted including carbonyl (C&#63743;O), alkene (C&#63743;C), and halogen substituents.A robust metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) catalyst featuring site&#8208;isolated Ir centers, UiO&#8208;67&#8208;Pyma&#8208;Ir, is reported for selective hydrogenation of nitroaromatics under mild conditions. UiO&#8208;67&#8208;Pyma&#8208;Ir exhibits exceptional chemoselectivity by preferentially catalyzing the hydrogenation of nitro groups to amino groups in the presence of potentially susceptible functional groups such as carbonyl (C&#63743;O), alkene (C&#63743;C), and halogen substituents, enabling high conversion of nitroarenes while retaining the integrity of sensitive functional motifs. UiO&#8208;67&#8208;Pyma&#8208;Ir also demonstrates high stability and recyclability as its activity and structural integrity is maintained over six consecutive cycles without significant degradation.

         <title>Photoinduced C(sp3)&#8211;H Amidation with Sulfilimines via Energy&#8208;Transfer Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;promoted strategy for intramolecular and intermolecular C&#8211;H amidation is described. Using acyl sulfilimines as nitrene precursors, this method operates via a triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer mechanism without metals or additives. It provides direct access to valuable N&#8208;acyl hemiaminal ethers, benzo[e][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, and isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones, from unactivated C(sp3)&#63743;H bonds under mild conditions.

Visible light&#8208;mediated selective amidation of unactivated C(sp3)&#63743;H bonds is presented with acyl sulfilimines as free nitrene precursors via triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer pathway. Both intermolecular and intramolecular reactions were achieved under mild, additive&#8208;free conditions without metal&#8211;nitrenoids formed. This protocol offers a widely applicable approach to access various synthetically versatile compounds, including N&#8208;acyl hemiaminal ether, benzo[e][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one, and isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives in a selective manner.

         <title>Stereoselective De Novo Synthesis of Substituted Cyclopentanes via a Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed (3&#8201;+&#8201;2) Cycloaddition of Enamides</title>

         <dc:description>
A wide range of cyclopentylamine scaffolds can be prepared from various N&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;amides through a stepwise (3&#8201;+&#8201;2) allyl cation cycloaddition. The synthetic method involves the generation of an aurated dithioallyl cation, the reactivity of which is governed by the well&#8208;defined gold(I)&#8208;catalyst that is used, in addition to some remarkable counterion effects that affect the chemoselectivity of the overall process.

A general and stereoselective synthesis of highly substituted cyclopentylamine scaffolds is reported starting from various N&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;amides. The reaction involves the generation of an aurated dithioallyl cation which undergoes a classical stepwise (3&#8201;+&#8201;2) allyl cation cycloaddition with a range of enamide substrates. The close coordination of the reactive intermediates with the well&#8208;defined gold(I)&#8208;catalyst results in a reactivity and selectivity profile that can be readily rationalized on the basis of a nonconcerted carbocationic cycloaddition reaction, and some remarkable counterion effects are seen to effect the chemoselectivity of the overall process.

         <title>Biocatalytic Nitration of Aromatic and Heterocyclic Compounds: Current Status and Future Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 368, Issue 3, 3 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional chemical nitration faces many problems, while biocatalytic nitration, as a promising alternative, can utilize natural nitrifying enzymes to prepare aromatic and heterocyclic nitro compounds. This review summarizes the representative nitrifying enzyme and discusses the current challenges and future opportunities faced by bio&#8208;nitration, to provide references for the synthesis of natural and non&#8208;natural nitro compounds.

Nitro compounds are widely utilized as value added pharmaceuticals and explosives, the majority of which contain a nitro group on an aromatic or heterocyclic ring. Nitration of aromatic or heterocyclic rings typically relies on well&#8208;established chemical methods, but the harsh conditions, unsatisfying selectivity, and low efficiency need to be solved for practical application. In contrast, biocatalytic nitration offers a promising alternative in the preparation of nitro compounds with complex aromatic and heterocyclic structures. The earliest nitrifying enzymes were found in the metabolic pathways of several natural products having aromatic or heterocyclic nitro groups. With evolved and engineered nitrifying enzymes, bio&#8208;nitration can be achieved for the preparation of a broader range of unnatural nitro group containing compounds. This study provides a comprehensive summary of the representative nitro compounds having nitro groups on the aromatic and heterocyclic rings, the associated nitrifying enzymes, and the characteristics of representative nitrifying enzymes which present specific nitration mechanisms. This study also discusses challenges with current bio&#8208;nitration techniques and proposes future opportunities for the application of bio&#8208;nitration as a powerful tool in the synthesis of natural and unnatural nitro compounds.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Boryl Ketones via Acid&#8208;Mediated Hydration of Alkynyl MIDA Boronates</title>

         <dc:description>We report here a metal&#8208;free strategy for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;boryl ketones via trifluoroacetic acid&#8208;mediated hydration of alkynyl MIDA boronates. The reaction operates under mild conditions, avoids the need for transition&#8208;metal catalysts, and exhibits broad functional&#8208;group compatibility. Isotopic labeling studies revealed that the methylene&#8208;position hydrogen atoms originate primarily from TFA rather than water, and that water participates in the hydrolysis of the trifluoroacetate ester intermediate. The resulting &#945;&#8208;boryl ketones function as versatile synthons and can be further converted into valuable boron&#8208;containing heterocycles, highlighting their utility in organic synthesis and pharmaceutical research.&#945;&#8208;boryl ketones are valuable synthons in modern organic synthesis, materials science, and drug discovery. We report here a metal&#8208;free hydration of alkynyl MIDA boronates mediated by trifluoroacetic acid, providing efficient access to &#945;&#8208;boryl ketones under mild conditions. This method omits the use of transition metal catalysts, exhibits broad functional group tolerance, and proceeds through a Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;promoted hydration mechanism, as supported by isotopic labeling studies. The resulting &#945;&#8208;boryl ketones were converted into valuable boron&#8208;substituted heterocycles, highlighting their potential as versatile synthons in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
An oxidative coupling between tetrahydroisoquinolines and various nucleophiles has been successfully achieved using Lewis acid, B(C6F5)3, as a catalyst. The method operates under mild conditions, avoids harsh oxidants, and delivers structurally diverse coupled products in high efficiency.

Cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reactions have emerged as a powerful strategy for direct C&#63743;H functionalization, yet many approaches rely on harsh oxidants, light&#8208;driven processes, or expensive electrochemical setups, which limit their applicability. Here, we report a B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed approach that enables efficient &#945;&#8208;hydride abstraction of N&#8208;aryl tetrahydroisoquinolines under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds through the formation of an iminium ion. Overall, this work establishes a practical and sustainable approach to CDC reactions, highlighting the potential of B(C6F5)3 catalysis for direct C&#63743;H functionalization.

         <title>Ultrafast Joule Heating Synthesis of Metal Phosphides for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 368, Issue 3, 3 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal phosphides can be synthesized via the Joule heating technique in less than 60&#8201;s. This ultrafast synthesis approach endows the materials with exceptional physicochemical properties, enabling their application in energy&#8208;related catalysis and beyond.

Electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies powered by renewable energy are crucial pathways toward achieving sustainable energy development, with hydropower exhibiting significant potential. Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have shown great promise for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water electrolysis owing to their excellent physicochemical properties. However, traditional strategies for synthesizing TMPs generally involve time&#8208;consuming (&#8805;2h) and energy&#8208;consuming high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. Herein, we present a universal synthesis strategy based on ultrafast Joule heating (JH), for the efficient preparation of a broad range of TMPs within 60&#8201;s, encompassing both non&#8208;noble metal and noble metals, such as PtP2, Pd7P3, CoP, FeP2, Ni2P, and RhPx. As an example, the as&#8208;synthesized PtP2 demonstrates outstanding HER performance, achieving a current density of 10&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of 32&#8201;mV in 0.5&#8201;M H2SO4 electrolyte, along with good operational stability exceeding 50&#8201;h. This method not only provides a versatile platform for the rapid and facile synthesis of diverse metal phosphides, but also demonstrates the promising potential of JH&#8208;derived TMPs for energy&#8208;related catalytic applications and beyond.

A practical Pd&#8208;catalyzed [2&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition of terminal ynamides rapidly delivers 3&#8208;aminocyclobutenones at room temperature within minutes. This robust method overcomes persistent challenges in substrate scope and hydrolytic sensitivity, thereby providing efficient and scalable access to synthetically versatile cyclobutenone scaffolds for medicinal chemistry applications.

This work presents the first successful [2&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition of terminal ynamides, enabled by a palladium catalyst, for the efficient synthesis of 3&#8208;aminocyclobutenones under mild conditions. The reaction employs Pd(PPh3)4 at room temperature and completes within minutes, overcoming previous limitations such as narrow substrate scope and high sensitivity to hydrolysis. Broad functional group tolerance is demonstrated with various N&#8208;sulfonyl ynamides. This practical and scalable method provides direct access to valuable cyclobutenone scaffolds for medicinal chemistry applications.

Biocatalytic stereo&#8208;controlled C&#8211;S bond formation unlocked! Engineered, cofactor&#8208;independent 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase variants catalyze enantioselective thia&#8208;Michael additions of aliphatic thiols to cinnamaldehyde, affording (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;thioenals with up to 99% conversion and high enantiopurity (up to 95:5 e.r.).

The thia&#8208;Michael addition is one of the most versatile and practical reactions for C&#63743;S bond formation in organic synthesis, but remains a continuing challenge for biocatalysis. Here we report engineered cofactor&#8208;independent enzymes, based on the promiscuous enzyme 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase, for the enantioselective synthesis of various (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;thioenals via the nucleophilic addition of aliphatic thiols to cinnamaldehyde. These engineered enzymes efficiently promote the formation of the carbon&#8211;sulfur bond with good stereocontrol, affording the desired (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;thioenal products with excellent conversions (up to 99%) and with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high enantiopurity (e.r. up to 95:5). Our results highlight the power of catalytic promiscuity for expanding the biocatalytic repertoire for non&#8208;natural reactions.

         <dc:description>A bench&#8208;stable saccharin electrophilic reagent enables the direct installation of the heptafluoroisopropylthio group onto diverse (hetero)arenes and amines under mild conditions. The method forms C&#63743;SRF and N&#63743;SRF bonds in a single step and allows subsequent oxidation to sulfonamides. This practical approach streamlines access to complex fluorinated sulfur motifs for late&#8208;stage functionalization.We report the multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of a shelf&#8208;stable, saccharin&#8208;based reagent for the direct electrophilic installation of the heptafluoroisopropylthio (&#8211;SCF(CF3)2) group. This bulky, highly fluorinated motif is increasingly valued for tuning lipophilicity, polarity, and metabolic stability in agrochemical design, yet methods for its direct incorporation remain scarce. The reagent enables mild, one&#8208;step formation of C&#63743;SRF and N&#63743;SRF bonds with a broad range of nucleophilic substrates, including indoles, pyrroles, phenols, and amines, exhibiting genuine electrophilic reactivity and broad functional&#8208;group tolerance. Furthermore, oxidation of the resulting N&#63743;SRF bond provides access to sulfonamide derivatives without the need for conventional sulfonyl chloride precursors. This strategy offers a practical and modular route to complex fluorinated sulfur compounds and expands the synthetic toolbox for late&#8208;stage functionalization with valuable polyfluoroalkylthio motifs (&#8211;SRF).</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Reductive Coupling of Cyclobutenes and Aldimines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol for highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling of unactivated cyclobutenes and aldimines promoted by a readily available cobalt&#8208;based catalyst was developed. The process represents the first instance of enantioselective reactions of cyclobutenes with aldimines through oxidative cyclization pathway, enabling introduction of an amino&#8208;containing chiral fragment onto cyclobutanes.

A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed protocol for diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling of unactivated cyclobutenes and aldimines through oxidative cyclization promoted by a chiral bisphosphine&#8211;cobalt is presented. Such processes represent an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis that enable umpolung reactivity of cyclobutenes with imines and incorporation of a chiral amino&#8208;containing fragment onto the four&#8208;membered ring scaffold, delivering a broad scope of enantioenriched cyclobutyl amines in up to 98% yield and&#8201;&gt;99.5:0.5 er as a single diastereomer. Functionalization provided a variety of densely functionalized cyclobutanes that are otherwise difficult to access. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that the reaction proceeded through diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective oxidative cyclization followed by protonation. Density functional theory calculations elucidated the origin of stereoselectivity in detail.

         <title>Organic Halogenation of Alkynes with Inorganic Halides Using Perylenediimide as Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unveils the direct generation of chlorine radicals from sodium chloride under visible&#8208;light perylenediimide photocatalysis. Coupled with N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide as radical cargo, this strategy channels the elusive Cl&#8226; into efficient oxydihalogenation of alkynes.

Harnessing chlorine radicals (Cl&#8226;) for selective organic transformations has remained challenging due to their extreme reactivity and dependence on unstable chlorine precursors. Here, we present a visible&#8208;light strategy that directly generates Cl&#8226; from sodium chloride (NaCl), an abundant, benign, and previously inaccessible chlorine source. Using perylenediimide (PDI) as a sustainable, metal&#8208;free photocatalyst and N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) as a radical cargo, chloride anions were oxidized to Cl&#8226;, which drove efficient oxydihalogenation of terminal and internal alkynes. This approach could overcome long&#8208;standing solubility and redox barriers, affording gem&#8208;dihaloketones in high yields. Mechanistic studies confirmed radical intermediacy and revealed the unprecedented role of NaCl as a chlorine radical progenitor. This work establishes inorganic halide salts as renewable radical precursors and provides a sustainable platform for green halogenation chemistry.

         <title>Synergistic Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution of NiCeOx Bimetallic Oxide Nanosheets and Cadmium Sulfide Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By forming a S&#8208;scheme heterojunction with cadmium sulfide nanorods and simultaneously generating an internal electric field to enhance surface carrier separation, the photocatalytic efficiency is significantly improved.

To address the rapid photogenerated carrier recombination issue that limits the efficiency of photocatalytic applications in semiconductors, this article presents for the first time the application of NiCeOx bimetallic oxides synthesized by the hydrothermal method in photocatalytic hydrogen production. By forming an S&#8208;shaped heterojunction with cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanorods, an internal electric field is simultaneously generated to enhance the efficiency of surface carrier separation. Experimental findings reveal that the hydrogen evolution rate for NiCeOx/CdS achieves 8604.78&#8201;&#956;molg&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. This result indicates that the establishment of this unique heterojunction facilitates more effective electron movement from NiCeOx to CdS, leading to accelerated charge separation and transfer processes. Both experiments and theoretical calculations have jointly demonstrated that the composite material enhances the hydrogen production rate through photocatalysis and have also revealed the charge transfer mechanism of the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction. This research provides a promising strategy for utilizing novel bimetallic oxide within the domain of photocatalysis and realizing directed electron migration in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

A catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free method for the synthesis of multifunctional oxa&#8208;bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes from &#945;&#8208;diazoketones and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes is presented. Mediated by visible light, the process proceeds under mild conditions via a sequential Wolff rearrangement/[2&#960; + 2&#963;] cycloaddition cascade. The reaction demonstrates broad substrate scope and high regiospecificity. The utility of the products is highlighted through diverse transformations, underscoring their potential in drug discovery.

The development of oxygen&#8208;containing three&#8208;dimensional bicyclic scaffolds as bioisosteres of aromatic rings is of increasing importance for improving physicochemical and pharmacokinetic profiles in modern pharmaceutical development. Herein, we report a catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free strategy to access a series of multifunctional oxa&#8208;bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane derivatives in a single operation from readily accessible &#945;&#8208;diazoketones and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes. The process involves a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated sequential Wolff rearrangement/[2&#960; + 2&#963;] cycloaddition. Generally, this reaction proceeds under mild conditions and features broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and high regiospecificity. The synthetic utility of this method is demonstrated through diverse synthetic transformations of the resulting products. Furthermore, control experiments and mechanistic studies were conducted, and a plausible mechanism is proposed to rationalize the observed efficiency.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Enabled Inverse Electron Demand Thermal Decarbonylative Skeletal Expansion: A New Gateway to the Synthesis of Multifunctionalized Quinoline</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have described an efficient AgSbF6&#8208;catalyzed decarbonylative tandem inverse electron&#8208;demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction that proceeds at mild temperatures to produce quinoline derivatives from 2&#8208;(p&#8208;tolyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;one and various internal alkynes. To clarify the function of the Lewis acid, we compared the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps of the complexes formed between the diene and AgSbF6. Density functional theory studies indicate that the reaction strongly favors the inverse electron&#8208;demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder pathway. The generation of carbon monoxide was confirmed by headspace gas chromatography. This strategy offers a convenient one&#8208;pot route to quinoline derivatives with promising applications in drug discovery.

Herein, we have reported an efficient AgSbF6 catalyzed decarbonylative tandem inverse electron demand hetero Diels&#8211;Alder reaction in a very moderate temperature for the construction of quinoline derivatives from 2&#8208;(p&#8208;tolyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;one with a variety of internal alkynes. To understand the role of the Lewis acid in the reaction, highest occupied molecular orbital&#8208;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gaps are compared for the adducts formed between the diene and AgSbF6. A mechanistic investigation, utilizing density functional theory calculations, revealed a clear preference for the inverse electron demand hetero Diels&#8211;Alder reaction pathway. The release of carbon monoxide gas has been detected through headspace gas chromatography analysis. This strategy enables the one pot synthesis of quinoline derivatives which offer substantial potential in drug discovery.

         <title>Electrochemical &#945;&#8208;Selective Chlorination of Indanones with AlCl3/MgCl2</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for the electrochemical chlorination of indanones has been developed using AlCl3 or MgCl2 as the chlorine source and electrolyte. This method can selectively form mono&#8208; or dichlorinated products under mild conditions, and has the advantages of no oxidant and high regioselectivity, providing an efficient and environmental friendly route for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chloroindanone.

We propose an electrochemical regioselective chlorination strategy for the &#945;&#8208;position of indanone. In this strategy, AlCl3 or MgCl2 plays a dual role as both a chlorine source and an electrolyte, allowing for the selective generation of mono&#8208; or dichlorinated products under mild conditions by utilizing AlCl3 or MgCl2 as the chlorine source. This method not only aligns with green chemistry principles but also demonstrates good substrate universality and scalability, providing an efficient and environmentally friendly approach for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chloroindanone.

         <title>Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Quinoxalines From &#946;&#8208;Alkyl Nitroolefins and o&#8208;Phenylenediamines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes a copper&#8208;catalyzed cascade synthesis of quinoxalines via allylic C&#63743;H oxidation/cyclocondensation of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted nitroalkenes with o&#8208;phenylenediamines, wherein the diamines function dually as both coupling partners and crucial supporting ligands.

A novel copper&#8208;catalyzed protocol is discovered for the synthesis of quinoxalines through the direct coupling of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted nitroalkenes and o&#8208;phenylenediamines. The cascade transformation proceeds via a mechanistically intriguing pathway involving allylic C&#63743;H bond oxidation followed by cyclocondensation. Remarkably, o&#8208;phenylenediamines are proposed to play a dual role, serving not only as conventional condensation partners but also as essential ligands that facilitate the copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative transformation.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of 3&#8208;Trifluoroethyl Benzofurans Through Rh&#8208;Catalyzed C&#63743;C Bond Activation Coupled with Transfer Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Divergent synthesis of 4&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto&#8208; and 4&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;trifluoroethyl benzofurans has been realized through Rh&#8208;catalyzed atom&#8208;economical skeletal reorganizations of readily accessible trifluoromethyl alkene&#8208;tethered benzocyclobutenols. These transformations proceed via complicated sequences involving C&#63743;C bond activation, migratory insertion, &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination, chain walking, and inter&#8208; or intramolecular transfer hydrogenation.

The strategic incorporation of the pharmacologically privileged trifluoroethyl group into the biologically significant benzofuran scaffold offers considerable potential for medicinal and agrochemical applications. Herein, an atom&#8208;economical synthetic approach to 3&#8208;trifluoroethyl benzofurans through Rh&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of readily available trifluoromethyl alkene&#8208;tethered benzocyclobutenols is reported. This transformation proceeds via a mechanistically intricate sequence involving C&#63743;C bond activation, migratory insertion, &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination, chain walking, and transfer hydrogenation. By modulation of reaction conditions, both intermolecular and intramolecular transfer hydrogenation pathways have been developed, leading to the divergent synthesis of 4&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto&#8208; and 4&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;trifluoroethyl benzofurans.

         <title>Harnessing Carbenoid Reactivity From Imidazoles and Oxiranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of azole compounds and oxiranes exhibits carbenoid reactivity at elevated temperatures, as demonstrated by the successful benzoin condensation of aromatic aldehydes. Using this catalytic system to polymerize bifunctional aldehyde/oxirane monomers yields thermosets with glass transition temperatures above 100&#176;C.

The combination of azole compounds, such as 1&#8208;methylimidazole and oxiranes (e.g., phenyl glycidyl ether) gives carbenoid reactivity at elevated temperatures. Benzoin condensation was performed with 5 mol% azole and 10 mol% oxirane under air at temperatures of 70&#176;C and above, achieving conversions of up to 85% of benzaldehyde and yields of up to 64% of benzoin. The lower benzoin yield is due to the formation of oxidative benzoin follow&#8208;up products under these reaction conditions. A variety of combinations of azole compounds and oxiranes have been shown to catalyze benzoin condensation. Thus, a modular, potentially inexpensive method of generating carbenoid reactivity has been revealed. The proposed mechanism for catalyst formation involves oxirane opening by, for example, 1&#8208;methylimidazole, which forms a zwitterionic methylimidazolium adduct with the oxirane. Then, the acidic proton in the 2&#8208;position of the imidazolium core is deprotonated by the zwitterion's alkoxide releasing the corresponding N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC). In addition to its primary function, surplus oxirane serves as a scavenger, removing acidic byproducts that are formed from the aldehyde through oxidative NHC catalysis. This property enables benzoin condensation without the exclusion of oxygen. The practical utility of this catalytic system was demonstrated by polymerizing simple bifunctional aldehyde/oxirane monomers&#8212;namely, 4&#8208;(2&#8208;oxiranylmethoxy)&#8208;benzaldehyde, 3&#8208;(2&#8208;oxiranylmethoxy)&#8208;benzaldehyde, and vanillin&#8208;based 2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8208;oxiranylmethoxy)&#8208;benzaldehyde&#8212;using 5 mol% 1&#8208;methylimidazole in a solventless manner and without excluding air. The monomers polymerized via both the formyl and the oxirane groups, yielded thermosets with glass transition temperatures above 100&#176;C.

Presented herein is a novel synthesis of CF3&#8208;isoxazolidine&#8208;fused isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones through the cascade reaction of N&#8208;hydroxybenzamides with CF3&#8208;ynones. The formation of products is initiated by aryl C&#8722;H bond metalation and insertion of the triple bond, followed by protodemetalation, intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition, and oxo&#8208;nucleophilic addition. In addition, the products thus formed can be transformed into several valuable compounds through easy&#8208;to&#8208;run derivations by taking advantage of the rich chemistry of the functional groups embedded therein.

Both isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;one and isoxazolidine are privileged scaffolds in developing new pharmaceuticals and functional materials. Presented herein is a novel synthesis of CF3&#8208;isoxazolidine&#8208;fused isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones through the cascade reaction of N&#8208;hydroxybenzamides with CF3&#8208;ynones. The formation of product is initiated by aryl C&#63743;H bond metalation and insertion of the triple bond, followed by protodemetalation, intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition, and oxo&#8208;nucleophilic addition. In this cascade process, the N&#8208;hydroxyamide group plays a triple role by acting as: 1) directing group for C&#63743;H bond metalation; 2) N&#8208;nucleophilic site for isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;one ring formation; and 3) O&#8208;nucleophilic site for isoxazolidine ring formation. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report on the concurrent construction of these two privileged cyclic scaffolds in one pot. In addition, the products thus formed can be transformed into several valuable compounds through easy&#8208;to&#8208;run derivations by taking advantage of the rich chemistry of the functional groups embedded therein.

The formation of product is initiated by aryl C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H bond metalation and insertion of the triple bond, followed by protodemetalation, intramolecular &lt;i&gt;aza&lt;/i&gt;-Michael addition, and &lt;i&gt;oxo&lt;/i&gt;-nucleophilic addition. In this cascade process, the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxyamide group plays a triple role by acting as: 1) directing group for C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H bond metalation; 2) &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-nucleophilic site for isoindolin-1-one ring formation; and 3) &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-nucleophilic site for isoxazolidine ring formation. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report on the concurrent construction of these two privileged cyclic scaffolds in one pot. In addition, the products thus formed can be transformed into several valuable compounds through easy-to-run derivations by taking advantage of the rich chemistry of the functional groups embedded therein.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Potassium Br&#248;nsted Base&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Diols via a Tandem Allylic Isomerization/Asymmetric Aldol&#8211;Tishchenko Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
Chiral potassium base catalysts featuring 1,1&#180;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol&#8208;derived chiral crown ethers as ligands promote a tandem allylic isomerization/asymmetric aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction of allylic alcohols and aldehydes. This method provides enantioenriched 1,3&#8208;diols with excellent diastereoselectivity and high enantioselectivity, thereby expanding the synthetic utility of potassium catalysis.

A series of chiral potassium Br&#248;nsted bases containing 3,3&#8242;&#8208;substituted 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol&#8208;based chiral crown ethers are demonstrated as sustainable metal catalysts for a tandem allylic isomerization/asymmetric aldol&#8211;Tishchenko reaction. The crown ether creates an effective chiral environment around the potassium cation, yielding diverse 1,3&#8208;diols containing three contiguous stereogenic centers with excellent diastereoselectivity and high enantioselectivity. This system allows the use of allylic alcohols instead of enolizable ketones as nucleophiles, thus broadening the synthetic applicability of this reaction.

         <dc:description>The hitherto few explored &#945;&#8208;halomethyl amidine motif has been assembled through the addition of a lithiated (di)&#8208;halomethane (i.e. carbenoid) to easily accessible N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl substituted carbodiimides. Despite the inherent low electrophilicity of these heterocumulenes &#8211; as quantitatively determined in Mayr&#8217;s previous studies &#8211; their sp&#8208;hybridized carbon atom acts as a competent site of attack for these tamed nucleophiles. The overall high&#8208;yielding transformation featuring a genuine chemoselective profile &#8211; as documented by employing variously functionalized materials &#8211; is adaptable to the addition of dihalogenated carbenoids. Reaction products could be advantageously employed in nucleophilic substitution sequences, as well as, in further functionalization of the nitrogen atoms due to the constitutive heteroallyl&#8208;type skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>eAmidation: An Electrochemical Amidation of Aldehydes via the Oxidation of N&#8208;Aryl Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the use of electrochemistry has emerged as a powerful yet sustainable means of enabling key transformations. Amidation is one of the most frequently executed transformations in synthetic chemistry, and using an electrochemical approach, the current study has demonstrated the synthesis of amides from aldehydes and amines. Mechanistic work indicates that the reaction proceeds via the oxidation of an intermediate hydrazone to generate an acyl diazene as the acylating species. The protocol developed has enabled the synthesis of a broad range of amides, including access to pharmaceutically relevant products, directly from aldehydes without recourse for hazardous chemical oxidants and activating agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand controlled regio&#8208;divergent [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of alkynes by merging electrochemistry and nickel catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions between three alkynes, a diyne and an alkyne, or a triyne offer a straightforward and typical protocol toward all kinds of polysubstituted benzens. Herein, the synthesis of polysubstituted aromatics through electrochemical nickel catalyzed cyclotrimerization of alkynes is developed. The regio&#8208;divergent cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes was achieved by judicious choice of ligands. And tributylphosphine, sterically hindered bipyridine or &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands delivered 1,2,4&#8208; and 1,3,5&#8208;substituted aromatics with high regioselectivities respectively. Besides, the semi&#8208;intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between	diynes and alkynes are also amenable under this catalytic system. This approach operates without metal reductant, exhibits wide functional groups tolerance, ease of scalability and furnishes 75 examples with moderate to good yields, including some biorelevant compounds. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculation revealed the catalytic pathways of 1,3,5&#8208; and 1,2,4&#8208;cyclotrimerizations, and the origin of the ligand controlled regioselectivity.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;carboalkoxy&#8208;3&#8208;substituted&#8208;cyclohexenones are powerful building blocks for the synthesis of a variety of bioactive target molecules. Their preparations requires multi&#8208;steps sequence involving the use of stoichiometric quantities of various reagents, while the catalytic approaches are limitited to trisubstituted cyclohexenones. We describe here an efficient catalytic approach based on gold(I)&#8208;catalysis starting from unsymmetrical diynyl mono&#8208;ester or symmetrical diynyl di&#8208;ester substrates. The carbon chain linking the two alkyne functions can bear two or one substituent, or even be unsubstituted. Regardless of the nature of the substrates and independently of its substitution, the cyclohexenone derivatives are cleanly produced.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(II) complex dispersed in imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid: Recyclable catalyst system for regioselective and chemoselective hydrobromination and hydrochlorination of alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a recyclable catalyst system combining Cu(II)O and 4,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline in a 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid for the hydrohalogenation of alkynes. The reaction efficiently yields alkenyl bromides and chlorides with good functional group tolerance and regioselectivity across a range of functionalized alkynes. Remarkably, the reaction exhibits unprecedented chemoselectivity for alkyne over alkenes in polyenynes and enables late&#8208;stage modifications to rapidly synthesize brominated polyenes. The catalyst system could be recycled for up to six runs without significant reduction of the reaction yield.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Click reactions display many of the goals desired for more sustainable chemical
conversions.  Yet, the solvent used is an often overlooked aspect in determining the
environmental impact of reactions. In the current paper we develop the first
mechanochemical method for the efficient and solvent&#8208;free SuFEx reaction of sulfonyl
fluorides with a wide range of phenols.  After outlining the optimization process, which
yields an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use and robust method, we provide indications of the very wide
scope of this approach, and demonstrate this potential via the application to a range of
natural phenols that also display other functionalities, and several gram&#8208;scale
syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mild Reductant NHC&#8208;ligated Borane for N&#8209;Formylation of Amines with CO2 under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A convenient and efficient metal&#8208;free protocol has been reported for formylation of various amines with carbon dioxide. This reaction could proceed under ambient conditions and show a broad substrate scope, encompassing primary amines, secondary amines, chiral amino acid esters and bioactive molecules. Furthermore, this method offers several advantages, including the preservation of substrate chirality, ease of separation and purification and the suitability of formic acid and formate salts as reactants in this reaction.</dc:description>
