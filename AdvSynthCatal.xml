         <title>Highly Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Organocatalytic &#947;&#8208;Allylic Alkylation of Quinolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We report the first synthesis of 2&#8208;alkenylquinolines from 2&#8208;allylquinolines and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The reaction proceeds in a highly regioselective and enantioselective way and shows a broad tolerance of functionalities both in the aromatic ring of the enal and on the quinoline.

         <title>Catalyst and Additive&#8208;Free Selective Ring&#8208;Opening Selenocyanation of Heterocycles with Elemental Selenium and TMSCN</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A catalyst and additive&#8208;free strategy for selective ring&#8208;opening selenocyanation of saturated heterocycles with elemental selenium and TMSCN is developed, affording a series of aliphatic selenocyanates and selenaheterocycles. In the case of unprotected unstrained N&#8208;heterocycles, the reactions offer ammonium selenonitriles that prove to be an efficient selenonitrile reagent.

         <title>Boron Reagents and Catalysts for the Functionalization of Strained Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The particular nature of boron compounds allows an ample modularity of their properties ranging from Lewis acids, C&#8208;nucleophiles, B&#8208;nucleophiles, or even conjunctive reagents for new synthetic manipulations. Moreover, the increasing demand for functionalized boron derivatives for pharmaceutical or material science applications requires the development of new synthetic methods for boron introduction in organic compounds. This review summarizes the possible combinations of boron derivatives with a variety of strained heterocycles reported in the most recent literature.

         <title>Synthesis of Difluorinated Dihydrobenzo[de]chromenes via Rh(III)&#8208;Catalysed C&#8208;H Couplings of 1&#8208;Naphthols with Gem&#8208;Difluoromethylene Alkynes</title>

Abstract
The Rh(III)&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H couplings of 1&#8208;naphthols with gem&#8208;difluoromethylene alkynes have been realized for the direct construction of difluorinated dihydrobenzo[de]chromenes with broad substrate/functional group compatibility and good regio&#8208;/chemoselectivity and in an atom&#8208;economic manner. The unique fluorine effects account for the unconventional reaction path involving intramolecular 1,3&#8208;hydrogen migration process to afford the exo&#8208;methylene fragment.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroarylation of Homopropargyl Iodoindoles with Concurrent Alkyl and Iodonium Migrations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp) arylation/carbocyclization/iodonium migration reaction sequence has been accomplished. Novel 2&#8208;iodo&#8208;1&#8208;aryl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazoles are now easily available. As this result is contrary to the selectivity observed using gold catalysis, the formation of 2&#8208;iodocarbazoles is noticeable, suggesting a metal&#8208;controlled cyclization through chemo&#8208; and regioselective 1,2&#8208;alkyl migration and 1,4&#8208;iodonium migration.

         <title>Fluorinated Aryl Boronates as Building Blocks in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Organoboron compounds are well known building blocks for many organic reactions. However, under basic conditions, polyfluorinated aryl boronic acid derivatives suffer from instability issues that are accelerated in compounds containing an ortho&#8208;fluorine group, which result in the formation of the corresponding protodeboronation products. Therefore, a considerable amount of research has focused on novel methodologies to synthesize these valuable compounds while avoiding the protodeboronation issue. This review summarizes the latest developments in the synthesis of fluorinated aryl boronic acid derivatives and their applications in cross&#8208;coupling reactions and other transformations.

         <title>PPTS&#8208;Catalyzed Bicyclization Reaction of 2&#8208;Isocyanobenzaldehydes with Various Amines: Synthesis of Diverse Fused Quinazolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A PPTS (pyridinium p&#8208;toluenesulfonate)&#8208;catalyzed bicyclization reaction of 2&#8208;isocyanobenzaldehydes as 1,5&#8208;dielectrophiles with various amines has been developed. The reaction not only provides a simple and efficient strategy for the assembly of structurally diverse fused quinazoline derivatives from readily available substrates under metal&#8208;free and mild conditions in a single step with only water and hydrogen as the by&#8208;products, but also opens the way to the application of o&#8208;formyl arylisocyanides in the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles.</dc:description>

Abstract
A procedure on palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative reaction of trifluoroacetimidoyl chlorides and nitro compounds for the construction of pharmaceutically valuable 2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones has been achieved. In this transformation, Mo(CO)6 has been used both as a convenient CO source and a reducing reagent. This newly developed protocol is compatible with various nitro compounds and can be readily scaled up to 1&#8197;mmol scale.

         <title>Recent Advances in Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Chemical and Enzymatic Carbene&#8208;Transfer Reactions</title>

Abstract
The use of diazo compounds in the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions to form C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (X=O, S, N, Si, P etc.) bonds have been a well established approach in organic synthesis. In this context, various transition metals such as Pd, Cu, Rh, Ni, Co, Fe, Ir etc. have proved useful to generate a metal&#8208;carbene intermediate which subsequently undergoes carbene transfer or insertion to form C&#8722;C, C&#8722;Si or C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. However, the use of most abundant, cheaper and environmentally benign metal such as iron to catalyze carbene&#8208;transfer reactions has attracted considerable attention in the last few years. Iron is the second most abundant transition metal in nature and also an integral part of various biological systems which make it highly valuable to use as a catalyst in organic chemistry. This review summarizes the efforts made after 2013 in the area of iron&#8208;catalyzed chemical and enzymatic carbene&#8208;transfer reactions using diazo compounds as carbene precursor.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Base&#8208;Controlled C&#8722;N Coupling Reactions: Selective Mono Versus Diarylation of Primary Amines with 2&#8208;Chlorobenzimidazoles</title>

Abstract
Herein, a base&#8208;controlled protocol was developed for the C&#8722;N coupling of primary amines and 2&#8208;chlorobenzimidazoles, affording a handful of secondary or tertiary amines in a selective fashion. Moreover, this protocol was realized under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, and the variation of the base from iPr2NH to LiOtBu completely switched the selectivity from monoarylation to diarylation. Further investigations elucidated that the variety, intrinsic basicity and amount of the utilized bases considerably affected these reactions.

         <title>Electronic Effect&#8208;guided Rational Design of &lt;i&gt;Candida antarctica&lt;/i&gt; Lipase B for Kinetic Resolution Towards Diarylmethanols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we developed an electronic effect&#8208;guided rational design strategy to enhance the enantio&#8208;selectivity of &lt;i&gt;Candida antarctica&lt;/i&gt; lipase B (CALB) mutants towards bulky pyridyl(phenyl)methanols. Compared to W104A mutant previously reported with reversed &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;stereoselectivity toward &lt;i&gt;sec&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;alcohols, three mutants (W104C, W104S and W104T) displayed significant improvement of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;enantioselectivity in the kinetic resolution (KR) of various phenyl pyridyl methyl acetates due to the increased electronic effects between pyridyl and polar residues. The electronic effects were also observed when mutating other residues surrounding the stereospecificity pocket of CALB, such as T42A, S47A, A281S or A281C, and can be used to manipulate the stereoselectivity.

Compared to W104A mutant previously reported with reversed &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;S&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&#8208;stereoselectivity toward &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;sec&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&#8208;alcohols, three mutants (W104C, W104S and W104T) displayed significant improvement of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;S&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&#8208;enantioselectivity in the kinetic resolution (KR) of various phenyl pyridyl methyl acetates due to the increased electronic effects between pyridyl and polar residues. The electronic effects were also observed when mutating other residues surrounding the stereospecificity pocket of CALB, such as T42A, S47A, A281S or A281C, and can be used to manipulate the stereoselectivity.

         <title>Electrochemical Thiolation and Borylation of Arylazo Sulfones with Thiols and B2pin2</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient electrochemical synthesis approach of various unsymmetrical thioethers and arylboronates has been developed. Bench stable arylazo sulfones were used as radical precursors for carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond formation under electrochemical conditions. Moreover, the scalability of this approach was evaluated by performing the electrochemical thiolation and borylation of arylazo sulfones with thiols and B2pin2 on a gram scale. This protocol not only avoided the use of stoichiometric oxidants, metal catalysts, activating agents and even added bases, but also exhibited favorable functional group tolerance.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in Transition&#8208;Metal Catalyzed Carbonylative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling Reaction: An Update</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metals have been an indispensable component of modern catalysis and among these palladium is the top&#8208;ranked choice of chemists as catalyst. After the several important developments of palladium catalysed C&#8208;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions, carbonylative transformations have been realised as an attractive post modification of these reactions. Carbonylative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reaction is among such transformations for direct incorporation of CO fragment for the preparation of biaryl or aryl/alkyl ketones via transition metal catalysis. Ketone functionality is basically a valuable building block having huge pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications. Moreover, carbonylative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling is also used in the synthesis of various natural bioactive molecules through direct joining of molecular fragment via CO bridge. In this review, the past decade developments in the carbonylative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions are documented in detail with modern approaches in transition metal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;level production of phenylacetaldehyde using fusion&#8208;tagged styrene oxide isomerase</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude improvement in the production of phenylacetaldehyde to 3.37 M (405 g L&lt;sup&gt;&#8208;1&lt;/sup&gt;) from the enzymatic isomerisation of styrene oxide was achieved. A small ubiquitin&#8208;related modifier (SUMO) tag increases the productivity of the whole&#8208;cell biocatalytic system by enhancing the expression of active membrane&#8208;bound styrene oxide isomerase (SOI) while retaining enzyme catalytic efficiency and broad natural substrate scope. The isomerisation was performed by using &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; expressing SUMO&#8208;tagged SOI in an organic&#8208;aqueous biphasic system to yield 96% of phenylacetaldehyde. This biocatalytic isomerisation system represents a cleaner and greener synthetic alternative to traditional chemical Meinwald rearrangement reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, great improvements have been made on palladium&#8208;catalyzed radical reactions. Emerging elegant methodologies of radical involved palladium&#8208;catalyzed transformations provide more and more effective strategies for the construction of complex heterocyclic compounds and applications in drug discovery. It is universally known that Pd(0)/(II)/(IV)&#8208;mediated reactions usually undergo two&#8208;electron transfer processes, while the Pd(I) and Pd(III) involved reactions usually occur via single electron transfer processes. Since our review on palladium radical was published, numurous methodolgies involving palladium radical have sprung up in the past five years. This review further summarized the up&#8208;to&#8208;date transformations toward palladium radical from 2015. For most of these catalytic cycles strategies, plausible mechanisms are demonstrated in detail to give better insight for chemists in need.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. A clean method has been developed for the &#945;&#8208;allylation of phenyl and alpha alkyl phenyl acetonitrile with allylic alcohols. The reaction is catalyzed by nickel complexes in situ generated from a combination of Ni(cod)2 and the dppf ligand and performed  at 80&#176;C in  methanol as reaction solvent.	Accordingly to this simple and base&#8208;free protocol that only yields water as a side&#8208;product, many allylic nitriles were synthetized with good yields.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a practical protocol for efficient, mild, visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component intermolecular trifluoromethyl&#8208;alkenylation reactions of unactivated alkenes. The protocol has good functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope. Using this protocol, we not only introduced a trifluoromethyl group into alkenes but also converted unactivated alkenes to styrene&#8208;based activated alkenes, in addition to accomplishing late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Developments in Remote &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;C&#8208;H Bond Functionalizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the past decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the developments of novel methods for the activation/functionalization of inert C&#8211;H bonds as these protocols are not only competent, reduce the waste materials in addition to the reaction time and multiple steps but also allows the reaction to be carried out in a highly regio&#8208;specific manner under operationally simple yet effective reaction conditions. Although, in recent years, a remarkable progress has been made in the field of ortho&#8208;and para&#8208;C&#8211;H bonds functionalization but to our best knowledge, the distal meta&#8208;C&#8208;H activation/functionalization is still infancy and is yet to be explore to the advanced level. Hence, we feel that there is an urgent need to aware the research community about where the field of meta&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization stand at present and where it might be going in near future. To this context, we strive to compile the significant achievements made in the selective meta&#8208;C&#8208;H bonds functionalization since 2018 to till date. More interestingly, we have also displayed an overview of the earlier reports related to the meta&#8208;C&#8208;H activation/functionalization at the beginning of this particular manuscript, and hopefully the present review article will open diverse opportunities for the advancement of both academia as well as industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Zirconium Oxide&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Amidation of Unactivated Esters under Continuous&#8208;Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A sustainable and environmentally benign direct amidation reaction of unactivated esters with amines has been developed in a continuous&#8208;flow system. A commercially available amorphous zirconium oxide was found to be an efficient catalyst for this reaction. While the typical amidation of esters with amines requires a stoichiometric amount of a promoter or metal activator, the present continuous&#8208;flow method enabled the direct amidation reaction under additive&#8208;free conditions with an extensive diversity towards various functional groups. High yields of the products were obtained with a nearly equimolar proportion of starting materials to reduce byproduct formation, which renders this process applicable for use in a sequential&#8208;flow system.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this review, the pivotal achievements and recent advances in catalytic asymmetric aza&#8208;DAR reported up to 2020 are retrospectively considered and their potency for enantioselective synthesis of useful chiral piperidine, quinoline, pyridazine, oxazine and oxadiazine derivatives and fused compounds of higher molecular complexity bearing these pharmacology&#8208;relevant heterocyclic scaffolds is demonstrated. The reported data are systematized according both to key electron transfer modes (normal or invers electron demand reactions) and to main types of attainable heterocyclic products. Of significant attention are an analysis of activation strategies (complexation, enamine or enolate formation, H&#8208;bonding, etc.) applicable to reactions with particular types of dienes and dienophiles and identification of plausible reaction pathways (either concerted or stepwise) over stereoselective cyclization processes. The review contains 310 references and 122 synthetic schemes.</dc:description>

Single crystal XRD analysis revealed that the silver atom was located in the vicinity of the imidazole ring and that cationic silver complexes formed dimers through coordination between the silver metal and the imidazole pendant. These cationic silver complexes served as catalysts for cyclization of alkyne&#8208;tethered carboxylic acids. NMR experiments indicated that the dimeric cationic silver complex dissociated to a monomer upon protonation of the imidazole moiety, resulting in coordination of an acetonitrile to the silver atom. DFT calculations supported the acid&#8208;base cooperative action of the silver&#8208;imidazole for the efficient alkyne&#8208;carboxylic acid cyclization.</dc:description>

Abstract
A synthesis of alkyl aryl ethers was achieved via the cross&#8208;coupling of aryl halides with primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols catalyzed by a bench&#8208;stable nickel complex supported by a monoanionic O,N,N&#8208;tridentate ligand. This nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction proceeds smoothly in the absence of a phosphine ligand, affording alkyl aryl ethers in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Catalytic Approach to Diverse &#945;&#8208;Aminoboronic Acid Derivatives by Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Trifluoroborate&#8208;Iminiums</title>

Abstract
A series of structurally diverse benzyl protected trifluoroborate&#8208;ammoniums were prepared in good to high yields by an efficient hydrogenation of corresponding trifluoroborate&#8208;iminiums using Crabtree's catalyst. Subsequent N&#8208; and B&#8208;deprotections were demonstrated on selected examples to provide several &#945;&#8208;aminoboronic acids. Preliminary experiments on asymmetric version of the reaction indicated a correlation between E/Z&#8208;ratio in the trifluoroborate&#8208;iminium substrate and enantioselectivity. The broad scope, operational simplicity and efficiency of the presented method imply its high potential for a facile access to libraries of &#945;&#8208;aminoboronic acid derivatives that can be used in medicinal chemistry applications and beyond.

         <title>Recent Trends and Prospects in Homogeneous Manganese&#8208;Catalysed Epoxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Epoxidation of alkenes is a significant reaction in organic chemistry due to its opportunities in producing compounds of biochemical interest. Catalytic epoxidation with first&#8208;row transition elements has gained attention in the latest years wherein manganese based catalysts stand superior by satisfying numerous principles of green chemistry. In this review, we have summarized the recent developments in olefin epoxidation using homogeneous manganese catalysts. Manganese complexes with porphyrin, Schiff base, salen, and other non&#8208;heme ligands made efficient catalytic systems during the last five years. Notably, we witnessed greener approaches in recent reports wherein photo&#8208;catalysis is a promising strategy. We anticipate that the review will benefit the researchers to get a better understanding of the reaction and to choose the best catalysts for their reactions.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted synthesis of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones has been developed using 9&#8208;mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methylacridinium perchlorate as an organo&#8208;photocatalyst. The atmosphere&#8208;controlled method (Ar/air) enabled the selective synthesis of hydroxyl&#8208; and acyl&#8208;containing quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones under mild reaction conditions without the use of any metal catalysts or toxic reagents. A fluorescent labelling experiment showed that hydroxyl&#8208;containing quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones may have utility in various biological applications as potent fluorophores.

Abstract
A highly efficient cascade Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation/intramolecular chemodivergent cyclization reaction of N&#8208;carbamoylindoles and sulfoxonium ylides has been successfully achieved for the first time. This synergistic process provides rapid access to functionalized dihydropyrimidoindolone and tricyclic [1,3]oxazino[3,4&#8208;a]indol&#8208;1&#8208;ones skeletons under redox neutral conditions with broad substrate scope and remarkable functional&#8208;group compatibility. Further late&#8208;stage modification of structurally complex drug molecules and mechanistic studies were also accomplished.

         <title>Bifunctional Ru&#8208;loaded Porous Organic Polymers with Pyridine Functionality: Recyclable Catalysts for N&#8208;Formylation of Amines with CO2 and H2</title>

Abstract
A series of pyridine functionalized porous organic polymers (POPs&#8208;Py&amp;PPh3) have been synthesized by polymerizing tris(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)phosphane and 4&#8208;vinylpyridine. The pyridine moieties in the copolymer materials contribute to CO2 adsorption and promote the subsequent conversion of CO2. The POP supported Ru catalyst (Ru/POP3&#8208;Py&amp;PPh3) shows a high catalytic activity (TON up to 710) in the N&#8208;formylation of various primary and secondary amines with CO2/H2, affording the corresponding formamides in good yields (55&#8211;95%) under mild reaction conditions. The heterogeneous catalyst can be easily separated from the reaction system and reused for at least eight cycles in the N&#8208;formylation of morpholine.

Abstract
A visible light&#8208;rose bengal&#8208;TBHP mediated, controlled oxidation of N&#8208;substituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinolines is developed for the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones and isoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones. The present method feature's a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerances, and the products were prepared in good to excellent yields. The developed methodology further demonstrated in the synthesis of isoindolo[2,1&#8208;b] isoquinolin&#8208;5(7H)&#8208;one (topoisomerase&#8208;I inhibitor).

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylation in the Synthesis of N&#8208;Ynonylsulfoximines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation reactions with Cr(CO)6 as carbonyl source are key for the preparation of N&#8208;ynonylsulfoximines from NH&#8208;sulfoximines and bromoalkynes. The couplings proceed at room temperature with a wide range of substrate combinations affording the corresponding products in good yields.

         <title>1,2&#8208;Benzothiazine Derivatives from Sulfonimidamides by Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation Reactions in Solution and under Solvent&#8208;Free Mechanochemical Conditions</title>

Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional aza&#8208;analogues of 1,2&#8208;benzothiazine 1,1&#8208;dioxides have been prepared from sulfonimidamides. Two different protocols are presented. The first is a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed annulation reaction with &#945;&#8208;sulfonyloxyketones leading to 4&#8208;unsubstituted benzothiazine derivatives. By selective bromination with NBS the heterocyclic ring can further be functionalized. In the second approach, an iridium catalyst is applied under solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical conditions providing products with 3,4&#8208;disubstituted thiazine rings from diazoketo esters and diazoketo sulfones.

         <title>Unravelling the C&#8208;H arylation of benzo&#8208;fused cycloalkanones:  combined experimental and computational evidence</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The C&#8208;H functionalization of benzo&#8208;fused cycloalkanones represents a synthetic challenge since such scaffolds display different activation sites, at sp2 and sp3 carbons, a bicyclic structure and various sizes of the cycloalkanone ring. Anticipating the outcome of C&#8208;H functionalisation and the impact of the presence and size of the cycloalkanone ring would help to foresee synthetic routes to more complex molecular architectures. The mechanism of C&#8208;H arylation was studied using DFT calculations for tetralone, benzosuberone and indanone and compared to acetophenone. Comparison of energetic profiles allowed identifying key steps of the process. Analysis of the topology of key intermediates allowed correlating the deformation of palladacycles to the potential reactivity of the benzo&#8208;fused cycloalkanone family members. Our experimental results were in full agreement with the trend provided by the theoretical study. A wide panel of diversely substituted benzo&#8208;fused cycloalkanones has been successfully obtained using optimized conditions. Moreover, an approach towards polycyclic molecules has been illustrated featuring a C&#8208;H arylation and a second step taking advantage of the remaining ketone fragment. The ability of the ketone fragment to undergo diverse transformations leads to alternative pathways to more complex molecular architectures.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemical reactions by milling, grinding or other types of mechanical action have emerged as a salient green approach because of its wide applications towards academic and industrial chemical communities in sustainable solvent&#8208;free/solvent&#8208;less processes. Liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG) as an extension of traditional solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical techniques by which a small amount of liquid is used as an additive to enhance and/or control reactivity, has been fruitfully applied in the screening of inclusion compounds, cocrystals, salts, solvates, and polymorphs. However, utilization of this important technique in the synthesis of pharmaceutically and biologically relevant targets was not adequately investigated. This review article summarizes an overview of the latest development of LAG mechanochemical approaches in the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and drug&#8208;like fragments, highlights its superiority versus conventional syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Developments in Z&#8208;Selective Olefin Metathesis Reactions by Molybdenum, Tungsten, Ruthenium, and Vanadium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
This review article summarizes reports for Z&#8208;selective olefin metathesis reactions by molybdenum, tungsten, ruthenium, and vanadium catalysts. It is clearly demonstrated that the ligand modifications play essential roles in achieving the stereospecific olefin metathesis reactions. In particular, Mo&#8208; and W&#8208;alkylidene based complex catalysts having pyrrolide&#8208;aryloxide [or bis(aryloxide)] were highly effective in the efficient enantioselective ring opening/cross&#8208;metathesis (EROCM), cross metathesis (CM), homodimerization, ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), and in ring closing metathesis (RCM) with high Z&#8208; selectivities (&#8764;&gt;98%). Ruthenium&#8208;carbene catalysts having cycloadamantyl, catechothiolate, phenolate and thiophenolate ligands display pronounced Z&#8208;selectivity (&gt;98%) in efficient CM, ROCM, AROCM, RCM, ROMP reactions. Halogenated (arylimido)&#8208;alkoxo vanadium&#8208;alkylidenes were thermally robust and effective for efficient highly cis&#8208;specific ROMP of cyclic olefins to afford end&#8208;functionalized ring&#8208;opened polymers.

Abstract
An approach to 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzo[f]isoindolones by a Ag&#8208;catalyzed Ugi 4CR/cascade radical cyclization sequence under mild conditions has been developed. The reaction of (E)&#8208;2&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;4&#8208;arylbut&#8208;3&#8208;ynoic acids, aldehydes, amines, and isocyanides produced 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;benzo[f]isoindolones regioselectively in 60&#8211;85% yields via sequential Ugi 4CR/cascade radical cyclization reaction in the presence of Cs2CO3 and AgOTf. The method achieved the formation of two C&#8722;C bonds under air atmosphere in one&#8208;pot fashion.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrosilylation of Cyclic Imines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates the application of Zn&#8208;complex as a key catalyst for enantioselective hydrosilylation of cyclic imines. As the replacement of platinum&#8208;group metals is currently an interesting challenge in catalysis, a promising alternative in asymmetric hydrosilylation, is to use environmentally benign and easily accessible chiral Zn&#8208;based catalysts. I. W&#281;glarz, K. Michalak and J. Mlynarski show that in situ generated zinc&#8208;ProPhenol complex with silane affords pharmaceutically relevant enantioenriched 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted pyrrolidines in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). Details can be found in the communication by Jacek Mlynarski and co&#8208;workers (I. W&#281;glarz, K. Michalak, J. Mlynarski, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2021, 363, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202001043).

Abstract
In the presence of PhCO2H (20&#8197;mol%), the formal [3+2] cycloaddition between in&#8197;situ formed 1,4&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;one&#8208;based azomethine ylides and azodicarboxylic acid derivatives proceeded readily, thus leading to the formation of trans&#8208;configured spiro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones in up to 98% chemical yield with &gt;20:1&#8197;dr. The relative configuration of the title compounds was unambiguously determined by means of X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis. The reaction mechanism was hypothesized to account for the diastereoselective formation of the isolated spiro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Heterocyclics via Cascade Cyclization of Propargylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates the cascade cyclization of propargylic alcohols with diverse nucleophiles for the construction of heterocyclic compounds via the allenyl carbocation intermediate. In this review, these reactions can be divided into four categories based on the types of nucleophiles, such as C&#8208;nucleophiles, O,S&#8208;nucleophiles, N,P&#8208;nucleophiles, and halo&#8208;nucleophiles. A series of functionalized heterocyclic compounds were constructed under mild reaction conditions. Details can be found in the review by Qiang Xiao and co&#8208;workers (X.&#8208;R. Song, R. Yang, Q. Xiao, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2021, 363, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202001142).

         <title>Recent Trends in the Synthesis and Mechanistic Implications of Phenanthridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenanthridine derivatives are one of the most intensively studied families of biologically active compounds. There has been considerable scientific interest in the turn of this century in the synthesis of these N&#8208;containing heterocycles as they are prevalent in many alkaloids and also possess striking biological activities including antibacterial, antifungal, antitumor activities. In this regard, a number of synthetic approaches toward the construction of phenanthridine moieties with various substituents, and to increase their yield have been developed by the synthetic organic community. Even though many researchers have developed various innovative methods for the synthesis of phenanthridine	derivatives for the past few years, still there is substantial scope for the discovery of novel synthetic methods. In this review, the latest developments in the diverse synthetic strategies of phenanthridine derivatives in the presence and absence of metals were described. The present review also enlightens the use of different reagents, the diversity of the substrates identified, and the plausible mechanisms unraveled towards the construction of these biologically relevant scaffolds.</dc:description>

Abstract
A base&#8208;mediated, green, microwave&#8208;assisted efficient preparation of a diverse benzoxanthone library from variety of readily accessible &#947;&#8208;alkynyl 1,3&#8208;diketones is reported. The synthesis is based on tandem reactions involving intramolecular cyclization, propargyl&#8208;allenyl isomerization, and electrocyclization in one pot. Some of the benzoxanthones are also synthesized by the one&#8208;pot reaction of 1,3&#8208;diketone and alkynyl bromide under basic heating conditions. This transformation also results in the construction of one new C&#8722;C bond and one new C&#8722;O bond.

Abstract
(R)&#8208;1&#8208;(4&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;(3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethan&#8208;1&#8208;ol [(R)&#8208;2] is a key chiral intermediate in the synthesis of telotristat ethyl, an anti&#8208;carcinoid syndrome drug. However, the synthetic methods for (R)&#8208;2 mainly include chemical reductions, rarely involving biocatalysis or bioreduction until now. Here, we report a method for obtaining (R)&#8208;2 by biocatalytic reduction of corresponding prochiral acetophenone (1) with bulky o&#8208;substitution using recombinant Lactobacillus fermentum short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase 1 (LfSDR1) as a biocatalyst. Further engineering of LfSDR1 variants could access asymmetric reduction of 1 and yield (R)&#8208;2 with a &gt;99% ee and a &gt;99% conversion. In addition, through the test of different co&#8208;solvents and a series of initial substrate concentrations, substrate 1 with the concentration of 60&#8197;g/L can be completely converted into (R)&#8208;2 on a preparative scale (1.13&#8197;g, 3.93&#8197;mmol, 75.6% isolated yield) in 24&#8197;hours. This study presents an efficient enzymatic process for the biocatalytic synthesis of key chiral intermediate (R)&#8208;2 in the synthesis of telotristat ethyl.

Abstract
A gold&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of 1,3&#8208;dihydrooxazolo[3,4&#8208;a]indoles from 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;4&#8208;ols and nitrones is described; this new bicyclic annulation presents the first examples that internal alkynes can react with nitrones to undergo an oxoarylation route. DFT calculations indicate a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic shift of initial alkenylgold intermediates to elude the intermediacy of gold carbenes. We also developed new [3+2]&#8208;annulations of the same 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;4&#8208;ols with imines, yielding oxazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;ylidene derivatives efficiently. The tethered alcohols of these 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;ynes allow trapping of their metastable 2&#8208;azadienium intermediates to enable a novel annulation. Our mechanistic analysis indicates that the two products, despite their structural relevance, are produced from two independent systems.

Abstract
A process for the de novo synthesis of imino&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides is described. The methodology is based on the reaction of 1&#8208;C&#8208;stannylated iminosugars with various electrophiles under the conditions of Migita&#8208;Kosugi&#8208;Stille cross&#8208;couplings, which gives 1&#8208;C&#8208;substituted iminosugar derivatives in a stereoretentive process. The required iminoglycosyl stannanes are obtained by way of the highly stereoselective addition of tributylstannyllithium to (SR)&#8208; or (SS)&#8208;N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl glycosylamines, followed by an activation cyclization sequence. Most interestingly, the methodology is tunable: the configuration of the tin adduct is controlled exclusively by the tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl auxiliary, thus giving access after ring formation to &#8216;&#945;&#8217;&#8208;configured or &#8216;&#946;&#8217;&#8208;configured iminoglycosyl stannanes. With the subsequent stereoretentive C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming process, the methodology allows the synthesis of pseudo anomers of imino&#8208;C&#8208;glycosyl compounds in a controlled fashion.

         <title>Lewis Acid Catalyzed Reductive Cyclization of 2&#8208;Aryloxybenzaldehydes and 2&#8208;(Arylthio)benzaldehydes to Unsubstituted 9H&#8208;Xanthenes and Thioxanthenes in Diisopropyl Ether</title>

Abstract
Readily accessible 2&#8208;aryloxybenzaldehydes and 2&#8208;(arylthio)benzaldehydes undergo a sequence of reactions leading to a wide variety of unsubstituted 9H&#8208;xanthenes and thioxanthenes in high yields when heated with a Lewis acid in diisopropyl ether. This reductive cyclization method is compatible with several important functional groups. The method is also applicable for the selective reductive cyclization of the more electron&#8208;rich aryl ring of a 2,6&#8208;bis(aryloxy)benzaldehyde. The key feature of this transformation is the chemoselective reduction of a transient xanthylium ion in the presence of aldehydic group via intermolecular hydride transfer from diisopropyl ether (solvent).

This reductive cyclization method is compatible with several important functional groups. The method is also applicable for the selective reductive cyclization of the more electron&#8208;rich aryl ring of a 2,6&#8208;bis(aryloxy)benzaldehyde. The key feature of this transformation is the chemoselective reduction of a transient xanthylium ion in the presence of aldehydic group via intermolecular hydride transfer from diisopropyl ether (solvent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Regioselective and Chemodivergent Synthesis of Azulenolactones and Azulenolactams from Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions of Azulenecarboxamides with Sulfoxonium Ylides</title>

Abstract
A regioselective and chemodivergent synthetic approach for azulenolactones and azulenolactams as a new scaffold was demonstrated through Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed reaction of N&#8208;methoxyazulene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxamides with sulfoxonium ylides. Sulfoxonium ylides that act as a precursor of secondary carbene was described, leading to the selective formation of azulenolactones and azulenolactams bearing two substituents on a newly introduced double bond. This method demonstrated functionalization of less reactive 2&#8208;position of azulene to overcome the natural reactivity.

         <title>Synthesis of Hydrobenzoimidazoles from para&#8208;Quinamines and 1,3,5&#8208;Triazinanes via a Formal [3+2] Annulation Reaction</title>

Abstract
The synthesis of hydrobenzoimidazoles from para&#8208;quinamines and 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes was achieved via a formal [3+2] annulation reaction in the presence of In(OTf)3 as the catalyst. Further studies demonstrated that the synthesis of hydrobenzooxazoles could also be accomplished via the same strategy from para&#8208;quinols and 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction of 2&#8208;(3&#8208;arylpropioloyl)benzaldehydes was developed, leading to benzylated 1,4&#8208;naphthoquinones via radical&#8208;triggered cascade cyclization. This example of an acylbenzylation involving internal alkynes could be carried out with a broad substrate scope and wide functional group tolerance.

Abstract
An iodine&#8208;promoted one&#8208;pot cascade oxidative annulation reaction has been developed for the synthesis of [1,2,3]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines from methyl azaarenes and N&#8208;tosylhydrazines. The reaction has a broad substrate scope and can be easily scaled up to gram&#8208;scale. 1,2,3&#8208;Triazoles are an important skeletal structure for the construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;P bonds, 2&#8208;cyclopropylquinolines and imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines, for which different synthetic applications were explored.

Abstract
A three&#8208;component reaction of aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates, sodium metabisulfite, and 3&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;methylbut&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;ol under mild conditions is described. By using abundant and cheap sodium metabisulfite as the sulfur dioxide surrogate, this protocol features good functional group compatibility, affording 2&#8208;arylsulfonylacetonitriles in moderate to good yields. The reaction proceeds smoothly at room temperature without the need of any catalysts or additives. Moreover, the synthetic utility of this method is demonstrated by the transformation of 2&#8208;arylsulfonylacetonitrile into 2&#8208;arylsulfonyl acetamide and 2&#8208;arylsulfonylethylamine.

Herein we describe a modular, convergent synthesis of substituted benzo[a]benzo[6,7]&#8208;indolo[2,3&#8208;h]carbazoles (BBICZs) using a bidirectional gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction as a key step. A building block strategy enabled the easy variation of substituents at different positions of the core structure and a general analysis of substitution effects on the materials properties of the target compounds. All BBICZs were fully characterized and their optical and electronic properties were studied experimentally as well as by computational methods. Organic thin&#8208;film transistors based on eight selected derivatives were fabricated by vacuum deposition and charge&#8208;carrier mobilities up to 1&#8197;cm2/Vs were measured.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free, Multicomponent Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydroarylsulfonylation and Alkoxyarylsulfonylation of Vinyl Arenes</title>

Abstract
A unified strategy for the hydro&#8208;arylsulfonylation of vinyl arenes has been developed under catalyst, additive&#8208;free conditions at room temperature from the corresponding aryldiazonium salts, DABSO (DABCO&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2SO2), and thiophenol as hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reagent. Mechanistically, an incipient arylsulfonyl radical is generated from the corresponding aryl diazonium salts and DABSO which undergoes anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition to styrenes followed by hydrogen atom transfer from thiophenol. Interestingly, this multi&#8208;component reaction is highly chemoselective suppressing deleterious thiosulfonylation and thiol&#8208;ene reactions. Tuning the reaction conditions, a four&#8208;component difunctionalization with alkoxy group has been achieved using 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene as an oxidant. Furthermore, base&#8208;promoted elimination to form vinyl sulfone has been also examined. The practicability of this present reaction has been demonstrated by the ex situ generation of sulfur dioxide in an H&#8208;type reaction vessel and subsequent hydro&#8208; and alkoxyarylsulfonylation in good to moderate yields. The hydroarylsulfonylation reaction is scalable and applied to a metal&#8208;free synthesis of the key intermediate for an anti&#8208;migraine drug Eletriptan.

         <title>Reduction of Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes Enabled by a Photoinduced Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>

Abstract
Direct hydrogen atom transfer from a photoredox&#8208;generated Hantzsch ester radical cation to electron&#8208;deficient alkenes has enabled the development of an efficient formal hydrogenation under mild, operationally simple conditions. The HAT&#8208;driven mechanism is supported by experimental and computational studies. The reaction is applied to a variety of cinnamate derivatives and related structures, irrespective of the presence of electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents in the aromatic ring and with good functional group compatibility.

Abstract
Organic azides are highly reactive, which have long established as versatile building blocks in the assembly of structurally diverse N&#8208;containing heterocycles. The conversion of organic azides into high&#8208;value compounds is of great importance and a subject of enormous current interest. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H amination/annulation of organic azides provides a powerful tool for the transformation of organic azides into a wide range of biologically important heterocyclic frameworks. In this review, we aim to summarize the recent progress on organic azides&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8722;H amination/annulation for N&#8208;heterocycle synthesis enabled by transition metal catalysts. Representative strategies are discussed in detail, including catalytic systems, reaction scopes, limitations and mechanisms.

Abstract
Molecules with di&#8208; or trichloromethyl group are widely existed in natural products and man&#8208;made structures that represent special activities in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Besides, polychloromethyl&#8208;containing compounds are also high valuable intermediates in organic synthesis and also can be used as functional materials. Therefore, significant efforts have been made toward the incorporation of polychloromethyl groups into certain structures. In this field, a variety of polychloromethyl reagents, such as CH2Cl2, HCCl3, CCl4, TMSCCl3, TMSCCl2H, etc. have been utilized as the di&#8208; or trichloromethyl sources toward polychloromethylated structures through radical, nucleophilic, and other reaction patterns. In this review, we summarized and discussed the recent achievements in the synthesis of polychloromethylated compounds, mainly focused on the employment of different polychloromethyl reagents. Most of the works we investigated were reported after 2010. Mechanism discussions and outlooks were also given.

Abstract
The biocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of amines from carbonyl compounds and amine precursors presents an important advance in sustainable synthetic chemistry. Oxidoreductases (ORs) that catalyze the NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent reductive amination of carbonyl compounds directly to amines using amine donors present advantages complementary to those of amine transaminases (ATAs) with respect to selectivity, stability and substrate scope. Indeed some ORs accept alkyl and aryl amines as reaction partners enabling access to chiral secondary amine products that are not directly accessible using ATAs. Moreover, superior atom economy can usually be achieved as no sacrificial amines are required as with ATAs. In recent years a number of ORs that apparently catalyze both imine formation and imine reduction in the reductive amination of carbonyls has been identified using structure informed protein engineering, sequence analysis from natural biodiversity and increasingly a mixture of both. In this review we summarize the development of such enzymes from the engineering of amino acid dehydrogenases (AADHs) and opine dehydrogenases (OpDHs) to become amine dehydrogenases (AmDHs), which are active toward ketones devoid of any requisite carboxylate and/or amine functions, through to the discovery of native AmDHs and reductive aminases (RedAms), and the engineering of all of these scaffolds for improved or altered activity. Structural and mechanistic studies have revealed similarities, but also differences in the determinants of substrate binding and mechanism in the enzymes. The survey reveals that a complementary approach to enzyme discovery that utilizes both natural genetic resources and engineering can be combined to deliver biocatalysts that have significant potential for the industrial synthesis of chiral amines.

         <title>Recent Developments in the Polychloroalkylation by Use of Simple Alkyl Chlorides</title>

Abstract
Owing to their easy availability and cheapness, simple alkyl chlorides are good raw materials for introducing complex polychlorinated groups. Polychlorinated hydrocarbons units, such as di&#8208; or trichloromethyl groups, not only widely found in pesticide and bioactive molecule, but also can be as a precursor to converted into different functional groups such as &#8722;COOH, &#8722;CHO and &#8722;CO. The direct polychloroalkylation reaction by using simple alkyl chlrides has been considered to be an important tool for synthesizing complex polychlorinated compounds. This review summarizes recent developments, especially free radical strategies, in the polychloroalkylation of different substrates (such as 2&#8208;acylpyridines, benzyl tertiary amines, alkenes, imine and 1,n&#8208;enynes). We hope that this review provides a new perspective on this field and also provides a reference to develop environmentally friendly and sustainable methods.

Abstract
Asymmetric multi&#8208;catalysis, designed to mimic catalytic processes in nature, is a powerful instrument to fulfil fascinating transformations. As a result, this area of research has attracted considerable interests within chemistry communities. Although there are numerous reviews involving multi&#8208;catalysis, reviews describing asymmetric organomulticatalysis remain rare. Taking into consideration that organocatalysts possess the superiorities of effortless availability, inexpensiveness, hypotoxicity, facile handling and hyposensitivity to moisture and oxygen, they have definite advantage in their own distinct modes of activation when utilized in multi&#8208;catalytic reactions. Organomulticatalysis refers to the synthetic strategies of modular combination of organo&#8208;catalyzed reactions into one synthetic operation with minimum workup or change in conditions. It is apparent that a variety reports utilizing the concept of enantioselective organomulticatalysis have substantially surfaced in the past few years. Hence, it is indispensable to succinctly present all such reports by means of disclosing the mechanistic analysis, as well as the challenges and issues associated in the development of the asymmetric catalytic system. Additionally, this review will introduce some of the unsettled conundrums and possible innovations in this field.

         <title>Halohydrin Dehalogenases and Their Potential in Industrial Application &#8211; A Viewpoint of Enzyme Reaction Engineering</title>

Abstract
At the moment, there are approx. 100 published papers investigating halohydrin dehalogenases from different aspects; enzymology, molecular biology and reactions they can catalyse. Unquestionably, these enzymes are of great importance and hold an immense potential due to the wide spectrum of different compounds that can be synthesized by their action. These compounds, such as chiral epoxides, &#946;&#8208;substituted alcohols, oxazolidinones etc., significantly enrich the chemist's toolbox and, moreover, open the possibility for the synthesis of even more complex compounds. Still, there are many unknowns, and it is the purpose of this work to demonstrate the possibilities and bottlenecks, in scientific sense, that could further help in broadening the applicative potential of these fascinating enzymes.

Abstract
We report the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylacrylates from &#945;&#8208;trifluoroborylacrylates via a stereoretentive radical trifluoromethylation with inexpensive reagents NaSO2CF3 and TBHP at room temperature. Under these conditions, a wide substrate scope afforded the (E)&#8208;diastereomer exclusively in moderate to good yield. The utility of the reaction products is demonstrated in the synthesis of phenyl&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran, a potent and selective class of IKCa channel blockers.

Abstract
Herein, we disclose a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed regioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization on the piperazine core using aldehydes as alkylating agents. The present transformation appears to go through the dehydrogenation of the piperazine to propagate to enamine in&#8197;situ, followed by nucleophilic addition to the aldehyde and hydrogenation to result in the regioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation. A variety of aromatic, heteroaromatic, aliphatic aldehydes were employed for the C&#8208;3 alkylation of N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;p&#8208;nitrophenyl substituted piperazines.

Abstract
K2CO3&#8208;mediated [4+1] annulation reactions of N&#8208;acetyl hydrazones with bifunctional amino reagents are described, which provide an environmental&#8208;friendly strategy to construct 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles that does not employ metals, azides, organocatalysis, or oxidants. A series of substituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazole derivatives was prepared with good yields.

Abstract
The site&#8208;selective functionalization of biologically important nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles and related derivatives remains a challenging and important task. We report herein on the direct regiodivergent N1/C2 phosphorylation of free indole derivatives. Cyclic voltammograms and EPR data indicate that by utilizing different electrolyte&#8208;mediated anodic oxidation to generate different active indole species, a diverse collection of N1 and C2 phosphorylation products could be obtained in moderate to high yields under exogenous&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free and metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free electrochemical conditions. In addition, N&#8722;P coupling was also found to be compatible with various alkylamines.

Abstract
A P(III)&#8208;mediated entry towards construction of C&#8722;N/C&#8722;S bond has been devised. The developed heterocyclization method was exercised for the synthesis of a diverse range of N,S&#8208;heterocycles and related spiro molecules. P(NMe2)3 revealed the maximum efficacies under the aerobic reaction conditions and a spectrum of bis&#8208;nucleophiles, and isothiocyanates were tolerated well to serve the access of manifold immense molecules.

         <dc:description>Chiral 2&#8208;alkylquinazolinones are key synthetic intermediates, but their preparation in high optical purity is challenging. Thus, a multicomponent procedure integrating anthranilic acids, N&#8208;Boc&#8208;amino acids, and amines in the presence of methanesulfonyl chloride, N&#8208;methylimidazole, and copper(II) chloride was developed to mildly afford N&#8208;Boc&#8208;2&#8208;alkylaminoquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones with excellent preservation of enantiomeric purity (&gt; 99% ee). Copper(II) chloride was essential to retaining enantiopurity, and reaction component structural changes were well tolerated, resulting in an efficient, all&#8208;in&#8208;one procedure that promotes sequential coupling, lactonization, aminolysis, and cyclization in good yields. The method was applied to the rapid assembly of four key intermediates used in the synthesis of high profile quinazolinones, including several PI3K inhibitor drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Couplings (CDC) of C&#8208;H Bond in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To develop highly efficient synthetic reactions is quite important in organic chemistry. Cross dehydrogenative couplings (CDC) utilize C&#8208;H bonds of substrates to construct new C&#8208;X (X=C, S, O, N, P) bonds. For CDC, the pre&#8208;functionalization of reaction substrates can be avoided and the C&#8208;X (X=C, S, O, N, P) bonds can be newly formed by simple and efficient synthesis routes. Meanwhile, water is increasingly used as a substitute for organic solvents in cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling because of its rich content, non&#8208;toxicity, and non&#8208; flammability. In recent years, organic chemists are devoted their efforts to explore the cross dehydrogenative couplings (CDC) in aqueous phase which feature high atom utilization rate and environmental friendliness. Herein, we summarized the recent advances in the construction of C&#8208;C, C&#8208;S, C&#8208;O, C&#8208;N, and C&#8208;P bonds through CDC reactions of C&#8212;H bonds in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Salicylic Acid&#8208;Promoted Three&#8208;Component Annulation of Benzimidazoles, Nitroalkenes and Elemental Sulfur</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a three&#8208;component reaction of benzimidazoles, nitroalkenes and elemental sulfur has been developed. Cheap and easily available salicylic acid found to be an efficient mediator for the present transformation. This protocol provides facile access to structurally significant imidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazole skeleton from simple raw materials, with a range of compatible synthetically useful functionalities. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale preparation of this method is effective, which enables potential applications of it in broader fields of molecule synthesis. Mechanistically, a reaction cascade involving sequential aza&#8208;Michael addition, nucleophilic sulfuration, and deaminative aromatization was proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomatization and Functionalization of Aromatic Rings via &#951;3&#8208;Benzyl Palladium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates recent advances on selective dearomatization and functionalization of aromatic rings via &#951;3&#8208;benzyl palladium intermediates. The importance of this topic relies on providing efficient strategy for dearomatization and functionalization of arenes and heteroarenes in mild conditions. A series of C&#8722;C or C&#8208;heteroatom bond formation reactions is summarized. Theoretical calculations are also introduced in details, accounting for the reactions occurring regioselectively in the benzene ring, rather than benzylic position. Details can be found in the review by Ming Bao and co&#8208;workers (S. Zhang, Y. Yamamoto, M. Bao, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2021, 363, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202000838).

         <title>Uncatalyzed Formation of Polyaminoboranes from Diisopropylaminoborane and Primary Amines: a Kinetically Controlled Polymerization Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Recently, we disclosed the uncatalyzed formation of polyaminoboranes (PABs) from monomeric diisopropylaminoborane (iPr2N&#8722;BH2) and primary amines (RNH2). Their structure is studied through a detailed multinuclear NMR study and their full spectroscopic characterization is presented revealing that N&#8208;alkyl substituted PABs exhibit magnetically non&#8208;equivalent methylenic protons in the close vicinity of the BN&#8208;backbone. We also performed an in&#8208;depth theoretical study of this global chemical process. The mechanism is fully apprehended and the strong influence of the temperature on the outcome of the reaction is unveiled. DFT&#8208;calculations clearly show that the formation of the polyaminoboranes (RNH&#8722;BH2)n results from a kinetically controlled step&#8208;growth polymerization reaction that can be globally viewed as a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail association process of the in&#8197;situ generated transient monomeric monoalkylamino&#8208;borane [RNH&#8722;BH2].

         <title>Sequential N&#8208;Arylation and Intramolecular Imine Addition Reaction of Indoloazomethine Ylides with Arynes for the Synthesis of Thiadiazepine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free reaction of indoloazomethine ylides with 2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)aryl triflates in the presence of TMAF and MeOH provided 1,4&#8208;thiadiazepines through sequential N&#8208;arylation and intramolecular imine addition reaction, which is fully oxidized with p&#8208;chloranil. These compounds are smoothly isomerized to indoloindolizines in quantitative yield. Moreover, formation of indoloindolizine was accessed from indoloazomethine ylide and 2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)aryl triflate in semi&#8208;one&#8208;pot.

         <title>Phosphorus Compounds as Precursors and Catalysts for Radical C&#8722;C Bond&#8208;Forming Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The photochemistry of organophosphorus compounds and their reactions with carbon&#8208;centred radicals was studied from the 1950s to the 70s, but has not been well exploited in synthetic chemistry until very recently. This review discusses the various modes of reactivity that phosphorus compounds display in radical C&#8722;C bond forming reactions, including the role of phosphonium salts as radical precursors, phosphines and phosphites as deoxygenating agents from oxygen&#8208;centred radicals and phosphines in electron&#8208; and charge&#8208;transfer chemistry. We also highlight the potential that these processes have in the future development of new reactions and cascade processes.

This review discusses the various modes of reactivity that phosphorus compounds display in radical C&#8722;C bond forming reactions, including the role of phosphonium salts as radical precursors, phosphines and phosphites as deoxygenating agents from oxygen&#8208;centred radicals and phosphines in electron&#8208; and charge&#8208;transfer chemistry. We also highlight the potential that these processes have in the future development of new reactions and cascade processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Direct Reductive Amination of Biobased Furans to N&#8208;Substituted Furfurylamines by Engineered Reductive Aminase</title>

Abstract
Furfurylamines are important building blocks for the synthesis of many pharmacologically active compounds and polymers. In this work, direct reductive amination of biobased furans to N&#8208;substituted furfurylamines by reductive aminase from Aspergillus oryzae (AspRedAm) was reported. Besides the reductive aminase activity, AspRedAm also showed a promiscuous, yet low alcohol dehydrogenase activity. The variant W210F proved to be a good catalyst for the synthesis of N&#8208;substituted furfurylamines. Furans were transformed to the target products with the conversions up to &gt;99% and selectivities up to &gt;99%. In addition, N&#8208;substituted furfurylamines were synthesized in the total turnover number (TTN) up to 3200 on a preparative scale, indicating the applicability of this biocatalytic route in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis and Applications of &#945;&#8208;Ketothioesters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Ketothioesters have only recently received widespread attention as synthetic intermediates and an impressive growth has been realized for their utilization in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Several elegant approaches such as oxidative thioesterification and radical coupling allow for their convenient synthesis from easily available starting materials, e.&#8201;g., methyl ketones, alkenes, alkynes, and &#945;&#8208;hydroxyketones. Due to their multifaceted and diverse reactivities, several important reactions such as C(O)&#8722;S bond cleavage and S&#8208;migration with various C&#8208;, N&#8208;, and O&#8208;based nucleophiles, Ni&#8208;catalyzed mono&#8208; and double&#8208;decarbonylations, enantioselective carbonyl&#8208;ene reaction, diastereoselective hetero Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with olefins, and different types of cyclization reactions have been observed. They have also proven to be a valuable tool for the synthesis of heterocycles, pharmaceutically relevant anticancer drug, and natural product. However, in comparison to other 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives such as &#945;&#8208;ketooxoesters, &#945;&#8208;ketoamides, and &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehydes, they are much less appreciated as synthetic intermediates. This review summarizes the recent advancements achieved in the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;ketothioesters as well as their applications in the development of new reactions for the formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O bonds, including multiple bond&#8208;forming processes.

         <title>Organocatalytic Deuteration Induced by the Dynamic Covalent Interaction of Imidazolium Cations with Ketones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
In this article, we suggest a new organocatalytic approach based on the dynamic covalent interaction of imidazolium cations with ketones. A reaction of N&#8208;alkyl imidazolium salts with acetone&#8208;d6 in the presence of oxygenated bases generates a dynamic organocatalytic system with a mixture of protonated carbene/ketone adducts acting as H/D exchange catalysts. The developed methodology of the pH&#8208;dependent deuteration showed high selectivity of labeling and good chiral functional group tolerance. Here we report a unique methodology for efficient metal&#8208;free deuteration, which enables labeling of various types of &#945;&#8208;acidic compounds without trace metal contamination.

         <title>Zwitterion&#8208;Initiated Hydroboration of Alkynes and Styrene</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The hydroboration of alkynes and styrene with HBpin has been developed using tris(pentaflurophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3) as the initiator of catalysis. The hydroboration is proposed to be initiated by Lewis acid activation of the alkyne by (B(C6F5)3) to form a highly reactive zwitterionic species which subsequently react with HBpin to give the alkenyl boronic ester. This zwitterion has also showed potential to be a competent catalyst for the hydroboration of styrene. The zwitterionic intermediate is analogous to that proposed in the Piers borane&#8208;catalysed hydroboration and 1,1&#8208;carboboration of alkynes with B(C6F5)3.

Abstract
Among aromatic compounds, borazarenes represent a significant class of isosteres in which carbon&#8208;carbon bonds have been replaced by B&#8722;N bonds. Described herein is a summary of the selective reactions that have been developed for known systems, as well as a summary of computationally&#8208;based predictions of selectivities that might be anticipated in reactions of yet unrealized substructures.

         <title>Multicomponent and One&#8208;pot Syntheses of Quinoxalines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Quinoxalines represent bicyclic nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles with a wide array of applications. They exhibit a multitude of biological activities relevant in medicinal chemistry as well as a plethora of luminescence properties. Quinoxaline syntheses exploit the whole raft of multicomponent syntheses from domino to sequential or consecutive reactions, harvesting well&#8208;known synthetic concepts and reactions, such as Ugi&#8208;reactions, but also leading to the development of novel reactions and sequences. Diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis and transition metal catalyzed multicomponent reactions open efficient pathways to quinoxalines and quinoxaline&#8208;containing moieties in a one&#8208;pot fashion. This review outlines the underlying reaction&#8208;based principles of multicomponent syntheses of quinoxalines and summarizes recent developments quinoxaline&#8208;directed MCRs, illustrating their scopes.

         <title>Enantioselective Desymmetrization of 1,3&#8208;Disubstituted Adamantane Derivatives via Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Bond Amination: Access to Optically Active Amino Acids Containing Adamantane Core</title>

Abstract
In order to synthesize optically active amino acids containing the adamantane core, an enantioselective desymmetrization of adamantanes via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond amination was examined. After investigating various conditions, it was found that the coupling reaction between disubstituted adamantane and aryloxysulfonamide was catalyzed by Rh2(S&#8208;TCPTTL)4 to furnish the desired products having up to 85% ee (e.r.=92.4: 7.6) (&gt;99% ee after recrystallization). The synthetic utility of the enantioenriched products as chiral building blocks was demonstrated by transforming one of them into a dipeptide derivative and a Schiff&#8208;base ligand. The absolute configuration of one of the amino acid derivatives was determined unambiguously by X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structure analysis.

An asymmetric (4 + 1) annulation of 3&#8208;diazooxindoles/4&#8208;diazooxisoquinolines with para&#8208;quinone methides, catalyzed by a chiral phosphoric acid, has been described. A wide range of spiro[dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;2,3'&#8208;oxindoles/2,4'&#8208;oxisoquinoline] derivatives were afforded with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. In this study, the possible reaction pathway was proposed and the synthetic applications were shown by a tenfold scale&#8208;up conversion as well as the further transformations into other structurally more complex spirocyclic compounds.

         <title>Photocatalysis in Dual Catalysis Systems for Carbon&#8208;Nitrogen Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The development of versatile methods for the formation of carbon&#8208;nitrogen bonds has significant impact on the synthetic chemistry community. However, it remains challenging owing to the utilization of costly catalyst systems and harsh reaction conditions. Compared to conventional methods, photoredox catalysis which harnesses the energy from light has emerged as an environmentally benign and cost&#8208;effective strategy for promoting challenging C&#8722;N bond constructions. Furthermore, the synergistic action of photoredox catalysis with another catalytic process has a profound impact on the reactivity profiles of many traditional synthetic routes. Over the recent years, immense progress has been made towards expediting photocatalysis in dual&#8208;catalysis for achieving various industrially important C&#8722;N bond formation processes under milder conditions. This review highlights the advancement of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art achieved in these dual&#8208;catalytic platforms for the construction of C&#8722;N bonds over the last decade.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Functionalization of Arylalkynes: Access to &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Dibromo Aryl Ketones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A general and effective protocol to synthesize &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dibromo aryl ketones has been developed via an electrochemical oxidative method. The reaction proceeds smoothly at room temperature in an undivided cell without the addition of external oxidants. In the reaction process, LiBr acts as both bromine source and supporting electrolyte. This electrooxidation strategy has good substrate applicability and functional group compatibility. Moreover, the reaction could be scaled up efficiently in a continuous flow cell. The target product could undergo further functionalization for the synthesis of some useful heterocyclic compounds.

         <title>Catalytic Photoredox Allylation of Aldehydes Promoted by a Cobalt Complex</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The preparation of homoallylic alcohols by addition of organometallic allyl compounds to carbonyls is an important strategy in organic chemistry. Allylating organometallic cobalt species can be generated employing stoichiometric quantities of Zn acting as reductant. To avoid the employment of stoichiometric amount of Zn, we have developed an allylation reaction of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes promoted by photoredox catalysis in the presence of a cobalt complex, and we present herein a full account of our research. In the presence of the abundant CoBr2 (10&#8197;mol&#8201;%), 4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl (dtbbpy, 10&#8197;mol&#8201;%), allyl acetate (3&#8197;equiv.), [Ir(dtbbpy)(ppy)2]PF6 (ppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridine, 2&#8197;mol&#8201;%), and N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (4&#8197;equiv.), an allylation of aldehydes is taking place, in moderate to good yields. Substrates scope, limitations, and photophysical investigations of this new process are reported.

         <title>Photoredox Fluoroalkylation of Hydrazones in Neutral and Reductive Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Visible light promoted fluoroalkylation of hydrazones using 4&#8208;perfluoropyridine sulfides as fluoroalkyl radical sources is described. The process can proceed in neutral and reductive modes delivering either hydrazones or hydrazines, respectively, depending on structure of starting substrates and reaction conditions. For the reductive process, ascorbic acid is used as a terminal reductant, which recycles the photocatalyst and serves as a source of hydrogen towards nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals.

Abstract
Synthesis of triazolo[1,5&#8208;a][1,4]diazepin&#8208;6&#8208;ones on solid support is reported in this article. Amino acids immobilized on Wang resin were nosylated and alkylated with propargyl alcohol, but&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ol or different 3&#8208;phenylprop&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ols using Mitsunobu alkylation conditions. After denosylation, acylation with Fmoc&#8208;azidoalanine yielded linear precursors that were thermally cyclized on resin to give immobilized triazolodiazepinones. After cleavage from the polymer support, the target compounds were obtained in high crude purities and good overall yields. Furthermore, the synthetic approach was applied to convenient solid&#8208;phase synthesis of oligopeptide containing the triazolodiazepinone moiety as the peptidomimetic heterocyclic constraint.

Abstract
Boron&#8208;catalyzed environmentally benign dehydrative Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of indole/pyrrole and aniline derivatives with &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl ketones has been developed for the first time. This method provides an efficient and green replacement of toxic and unstable methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) by safer and cheaper &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl ketone. The reaction features easy operation, wide substrate scope and significantly, only water is formed as by&#8208;product.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution and Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of &#947;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Substituted Butenolides via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 1,4&#8208;Hydroboration</title>

Abstract
Kinetic resolution (KR) and dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of &#947;&#8208;aryl and heteroaryl&#8208;substituted butenolides via CuH&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;hydroboration using pinacolborane is reported. With a copper&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE catalyst, selectivity factors were extremely high (s=&gt;400) with regard to the kinetic resolution of &#946;&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;phenyl butenolide; DKR was possible in the presence of an amine base (DBU), which facilitated racemization of the starting unsaturated lactones. The reaction provided easy access to highly enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones (&gt;99% ee) containing &#946;,&#947;&#8208;substituents.

Abstract
A method for Beckmann rearrangement using ethyl 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfonyloxyimino) acetate (o&#8208;NosylOXY) under microwave irradiation is reported. Ketoximes (19&#8197;examples) are converted to the corresponding amides/lactams with 69&#8211;97% yields in &#8764;10&#8197;minutes without any Lewis acid or co&#8208;catalyst. This is an example of halogen&#8208;free organocatalytic Beckmann rearrangement. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)&#8208; and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)&#8208;based detailed mechanistic investigation suggest that o&#8208;NosylOXY acts as an initiator. Such initiators are reported before based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, we report here the HRMS signatures of two transient intermediates, the nitrilium ion and the nitrilium ion's dimeric species. Rigorous NMR&#8208;based investigation of the reaction mechanism is performed. Our results indicate that the reported Beckmann rearrangement proceeds via two consecutive rearrangements.

         <title>The Construction of Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Heterocycles from Alkynyl Imines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles have attracted considerable attention due to their extensive applications in the fields of organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science. This review focuses on the recent advances in the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles via the cyclization of alkynyl imines. By using this protocol, a variety of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, mainly including four&#8208;, five&#8208;, six&#8208;, and seven&#8208;membered nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, aza&#8208;spirocycles, and fused aza&#8208;heterocycles, could be obtained efficiently under mild conditions. Additionally, mechanistic features of these transformations are also discussed.

         <title>A Catalytic Construction of Indoles via Formation of Ruthenium Vinylidene Species from N&#8208;Arylynamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Treatment of ynamides with a catalytic amount of TpRuCl(PPh3)2 resulted in the construction of indole scaffolds known as privileged structure motifs. This reaction involved a cascade of 1,2&#8208;rearrangement and cyclization carrying out C&#8722;C bond formation via a ruthenium vinylidene intermediate, as revealed by a deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments. Furthermore, the transformation of multi&#8208;functionalized ynamide, derived from a practical drug molecule, showed a high functional group tolerance of this reaction.

         <title>Synthesis of Hydrophilic Phosphorus Ligands and Their Application in Aqueous&#8208;Phase Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions</title>

Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions in aqueous media are experiencing a constant increase in interest. In homogenous catalysis the use of water as a solvent offers advantages in cost, safety, the possibility of two&#8208;phase catalysis and simplified separation strategies. In the life sciences, transition metal catalysis in aqueous systems enables the ligation or modification of biopolymers in buffer systems or even in their cellular environment. In biocatalysis, aqueous systems allow the simultaneous use of enzymes and transition metal catalysts in cascade reactions. The use of water&#8208;soluble phosphine ligands still represents the most reliable and popular strategy for transferring metal catalysts into the aqueous phase. This review summarizes the recent advancements in this field since 2009 and describes current synthetic strategies for the preparation of hydrophilic phosphines and phosphites. In addition, recent applications of transition metal catalysis in aqueous solvents using these hydrophilic ligands are presented.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions in aqueous media are experiencing a constant increase in interest. In homogenous catalysis the use of water as a solvent offers advantages in cost, safety, the possibility of two&#8208;phase catalysis and simplified separation strategies. In the life sciences, transition metal catalysis in aqueous systems enables the ligation or modification of biopolymers in buffer systems or even in their cellular environment. In biocatalysis, aqueous systems allow the simultaneous use of enzymes and transition metal catalysts in cascade reactions. The use of water&#8208;soluble phosphine ligands still represents the most reliable and popular strategy for transferring metal catalysts into the aqueous phase. This review summarizes the recent advancements in this field since 2009 and describes current synthetic strategies for the preparation of hydrophilic phosphines and phosphites. In addition, recent applications of transition metal catalysis in aqueous solvents using these hydrophilic ligands are presented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Pd&#8208;Catalysed Fujiwara&#8208;Moritani type Reaction of N,S&#8208;Heterocyclic Systems with Olefins</title>

Abstract
Dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;thiazine skeletons bearing olefin fragment at their &#945;&#8208;position were prepared through a Pd(OAc)2&#8208;catalysed Fujiwara&#8208;Moritani type reaction via C&#8722;H alkenylation with olefins. This approach is selective, generalizable to a wide range of olefins and requires only 1&#8197;eq. of Ag2CO3 without the need of co&#8208;oxidant. The C&#8722;H bond activation proved to be strongly dependent on the olefin's substitution while unfused dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;thiazines seemed to be affected by the oxidation state of the sulfur atom. The utility of olefins obtained was demonstrated by their implication in the dipolar cycloaddition reaction with a non&#8208;stabilized azomethine ylide.

Abstract
This review describes recent advances in the synthesis of anthranilamide/1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene&#8208;substituted organoboron compounds with diminished boron Lewis acidity via catalytic B(aam)&#8208; and B(dan)&#8208;installing borylation reactions, which have attracted growing attention especially in the last five years owing to their unique reactivity, regioselectivity, and the outstanding stability toward air and moisture of organoboron compounds obtained therefrom. Direct Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings with R&#8211;B(aam)/B(dan), which were believed to be wholly unreactive until recently, are also discussed.

Abstract
A protocol for the synthesis of 10&#8208;phenanthrenol from 1&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylethanone bearing an electron&#8208;withdrawing group through metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H arylation has been established. The electrochemical intramolecular cycloaromatization avoids the use of excess amounts of chemical oxidizing agents, and provides concise and regio&#8208;selective access to a variety of valuable 10&#8208;phenanthrenol derivatives.

         <title>Selective Construction of C&#8722;C and C=C Bonds by Manganese Catalyzed Coupling of Alcohols with Phosphorus Ylides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we report the manganese catalyzed coupling of alcohols with phosphorus ylides. The selectivity in the coupling of primary alcohols with phosphorus ylides to form carbon&#8208;carbon single (C&#8722;C) and carbon&#8208;carbon double (C=C) bonds can be controlled by the ligands. In the conversion of more challenging secondary alcohols with phosphorus ylides the selectivity towards the formation of C&#8722;C vs. C=C bonds can be controlled by the reaction conditions, namely the amount of base. The scope and limitations of the coupling reactions were thoroughly evaluated by the conversion of 21 alcohols and 15 ylides. Notably, compared to existing methods, which are based on precious metal complexes as catalysts, the present catalytic system is based on earth abundant manganese catalysts. The reaction can also be performed in a sequential one&#8208;pot reaction generating the phosphorus ylide in&#8197;situ followed manganese catalyzed C&#8722;C and C=C bond formation. Mechanistic studies suggest that the C&#8722;C bond was generated via a borrowing hydrogen pathway and the C=C bond formation followed an acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling pathway.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective 3&#8208;Fluoroallylic Cyanation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A rhodium catalyzed allylic cyanation of 3&#8208;fluoroallylic trifluoroacetates with TMSCN and a bulky phosphite ligand gives 3&#8208;fluoroallylic nitriles with a good substrate scope and high Z/E&#8208;selectivity. For dialkylated substrates the fluorine substituent controls the regioselectivity in favor of the distal product. For the stereoselectivity of the allylic cyanation selected scalemic substrates showed inversion of the stereocenter and some or no stereoerosion.

Abstract
A pyridine&#8208;catalysed desulfonylative addition of &#946;&#8208;diketones to arylazosulfones was developed to obtain diazenyl &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. The aryldiazenyl group was observed in the desired product from arylazosulfones, and this diazenylation reaction was achieved via a possible rearrangement process based on diaziridine ring cleavage. The scope of the protocol was investigated and a plausible mechanism was given.

         <title>A Visible Light and Iron&#8208;mediated Carbocationic Route to Polysubstituted 1&#8208;Halonaphthalenes by Benzannulation using Allylbenzenes and Polyhalomethanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A wide array of polysubstituted 1&#8208;bromo and chloronaphthalenes are obtained from coupling of allylbenzenes and polyhalomethanes. The reaction is mediated by iron metal under visible light irradiation and proceeds via a Kharasch addition intermediate followed by intramolecular FeIII mediated Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation, with the formation of two Csp2&#8722;Csp2 bonds in the process. This method gives easy access to 1&#8208;halonaphthalenes with substituent(s) at C&#8208;5 to C&#8208;8 that are otherwise hard to synthesize.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Amino Carboxylic&#8208;Phosphonic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Chiral amino acids featuring a phosphonate pendant arm are an important type of biologically active scaffold. Here in this review, we comprehensively summarize the modern synthetic methods towards asymmetric construction of chiral amino carboxylic&#8208;phosphonic acid derivatives. The main streams of such interesting compounds include phosphono&#8208;containing &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;amino acid derivatives, amino acid fluorophosphonate derivatives, amino acid cyclopropanylphosphonate derivatives, and bisphosphono&#8208;amino acid derivatives. Chiral resolution protocols, chiral auxiliary&#8208;directed syntheses, and valorization of the pool of abundant chiral amino acid resources remain contemporary concerns, and meanwhile catalytic enantioselective synthesis has also emerged as a potent strategy as demonstrated by the latest advances.

         <title>Non&#8208;Bonding 1,4&#8208;Sulphur&#8208;Oxygen Interaction Governs the Reactivity of &#945;&#8208;Ketothioesters in Triphenylphosphine&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization with Acetylenedicarboxylates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Ketothioesters undergo triphenylphosphine (PPh3)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization with acetylenedicarboxylate esters smoothly, in contrast to &#945;&#8208;ketooxoesters which require more drastic conditions with the limited substrate scope. The reaction works well with a wide range of &#945;&#8208;ketothioesters, delivering highly functionalized &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones in moderate to excellent yields. The higher reactivity of the thioester derivatives is seemingly due to a favourable intramolecular non&#8208;bonding electrostatic 1,4&#8208;interaction involving C&#8722;S &#963;* orbital on the sulphur atom and the lone pair of electrons in the electron&#8208;donating oxygen atom. This is apparent from the X&#8208;ray crystallographically determined internuclear distance between the sulphur and ketone (C=O) oxygen atoms (2.71&#8211;2.85&#8197;&#197;), which is significantly less than the sum of their van der Waals radii (3.25&#8211;3.30&#8197;&#197;). The substitution on the S atom is oriented diametrically away from the ketone O atom to maximize the interaction between them. The trend is also seen in the 1,4&#8208;S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O contact between the S and furan O atoms (2.70&#8197;&#197;) in the &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone products.

         <title>Synthesis of Allylboronates via Zweifel&#8208;type Deprotonative Olefination</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A method for the synthesis of allylboronates via Zweifel&#8208;type deprotonative olefination was demonstrated. Tetrasubstituted vinylboronates were used as the substrates. NCS (N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide) was used as a bifunctional additive, electrophile and base. This method exhibited a different elimination strategy in Zweifel type transformation to afford allylboronates. The homo&#8208;alcohols and alkenes were stereoselective synthesized from the obtained allylboronates, demonstrating the synthetic value of this methodology.

         <title>Recent Development of Recoverable MacMillan Catalyst in Asymmetric Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Chiral imidazolidinone as an organocatalyst was developed by MacMillan and co&#8208;workers in 2000 and they evaluated this organocatalyst originally in the enantioselective Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. Later, this catalyst was used in a number of other asymmetric organic transformations. Chiral organocatalysts are expensive, therefore their recoverability and reusability are highly desirable to make the organic transformation economically viable for industrial application. Hence, the chiral imidazolidinone was modified and attached to different supports for its recoverability and reusability. A number of recoverable imidazolidinones have been reported in asymmetric Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. In this review, we have summarized the reports on reusable and recoverable imidazolidinones (MacMillan catalysts) as organocatalysts in asymmetric organic transformations.

         <title>Copper&#8208;catalyzed Reaction of Anthranils with Methyl Ketones: Site&#8208;Selective C5&#8208;Dicarbonylation of Anthranils</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective C5&#8208;dicarbonylation reaction of anthranils has been developed for synthesis of 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds using methyl ketone as a commercially available carbonylation reagent. This process represents the first example to implement the C5&#8208;dicarbonylation of anthranils, which involves an oxidative Csp3&#8208;H/Csp2&#8208;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction along with thermolytic N&#8722;O bond cleavage.

         <title>Effective C5&#8208;Arylation of Peptide&#8208;Integrated Oxazoles: Almazole&#8197;D</title>

Abstract
An efficient functionalization approach of oxazoles by using Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions is reported. Oxazolone formation and subsequent sulfamoylation in&#8197;situ are facilitated by employing N,N&#8208;diethylsulfamoyl imidazolium triflate. Cross&#8208;couplings provide both oxazole&#8208;arenes and oxazole&#8208;heteroarenes and were compatible with sensitive and epimerization&#8208;prone substrates, as exemplified by the total synthesis of the natural product almazole D.

         <title>Engineering an Alcohol Dehydrogenase from Kluyveromyces polyspora for Efficient Synthesis of Ibrutinib Intermediate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>(S)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypiperidine [(S)&#8208;NBHP] is a key intermediate for the synthesis of mantle cell lymphoma drug, ibrutinib. Here, KpADH, an alcohol dehydrogenase from Kluyveromyces polyspora, exhibits evolutionary potential in the asymmetric reduction of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;3&#8208;piperidone (NBPO) to (S)&#8208;NBHP. By screening key resi&#8208;dues in substrate binding pocket of KpADH, an excellent variant Y127W was obtained with 6&#8208;fold improved activity of 119.3 U&#183;mg&#8208;1, 1.8&#8208;fold enhanced half&#8208;life of 147 h and strict S&#8208;stereoselectivity (&gt;99% ee). When catalyzed by Y127W, a complete conversion of 600 g&#183;L&#8208;1 NBPO was achieved at a substrate to catalyst ratio (S/C) of 30 in 10 h. Based on crystal&#8208;structure of Y127W, molecular docking and dynamic simulations reveal hydrogen bonds formed between W127 and Boc group of NBPO, as well as improved structural stability mainly contribute to the increased catalytic activity and stereoselectivity of Y127W. This study offers guidance for engineering ADHs for biosynthesis of chiral hetero&#8208;cyclic alcohols, and provides insights into mechanisms in catalytic activity and stereoselectivity toward car&#8208;bonyl&#8208;containing heterocyclic substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Synthesis of Pyrrole&#8211;imidazole Alkaloids via a Tandem C&#8208;N, C&#8208;C coupling Protocol</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a strategy for the synthesis of pyrrole alkaloid derivatives through a tandem C&#8208;N, C&#8208;C coupling reaction employing 2&#8208;pyrrole formaldehyde and proline as starting materials. This cyclization protocol is successfully applied to polarity&#8208;controlled site&#8208;selective and stereoselective C(sp3)&#8722;H hydrocarboxylation of proline derivatives, allowing for a remarkably streamlined synthesis of pyrrole alkaloid derivatives which have shown promising biological activities.</dc:description>
