[1,3]oxazino[3,2&#8208;b]isoquinolin&#8208;15&#8208;ones was achieved via photoinduced rearrangement of 3&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;hydroxypropyl&#8208;pyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with a 313 nm UV light. &lt;i&gt;Trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;(8b,15a)&#8208;9a&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;11H,15H&#8208;dibenzo[f,h][1,3]oxazino[3,2&#8208;b]isoquinolin&#8208;15&#8208;ones and trans&#8208;(8b,15a)&#8208;9a&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;11H,15H&#8208;dibenzo[f,h][1,3]
oxazino[3,2&#8208;b]isoquinolin&#8208;15&#8208;ones were obtained in 76&#8208;92% yields via a one&#8208;pot reaction. Alternatively, irradiation of 3&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;hydroxypropyl&#8208;pyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones in the presence of HCl aqueous solution (1 M) led to the formation of cis&#8208;(8b,15a)&#8208;9a&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;11H,15H&#8208;dibenzo[f,h][1,3]oxazino[3

The construction of a partially dearomatized phenanthrene ring and quinolizidinone ring was achieved by a one&#8208;pot reaction, with controlled &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; stereochemistry.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Promoted Domino Processes for the Synthesis of Homoallylic Amines, Quinolines and Tetrahydroquinolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, the synthesis of homoallylic amines, quinolines, and tetrahydroquinolines has been demonstrated. The domino one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component approach has been accomplished using Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed conditions. A useful scaffold construction strategy can be achieved by controlling the electronic effect of aniline rather than relying on reaction conditions. The described method applies to a wide variety of substrates embedded with diverse functional groups and can be extended toward the synthesis of natural products. Suitable control experiments, real&#8208;time NMR studies, and DFT calculations have validated the reported process. The protocol outlines a strategy for synthesizing homoallylic amines and quinolines, controlled by the electronic properties of anilines.

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Selective Synthesis of Alkynyl Sulfides via C&#8722;S Bond Cleavage of Alkynyl Sulfonium Salts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An effective one&#8208;pot approach has been devised for the selective synthesis of alkynyl sulfides through the cleavage of C&#8722;S bonds in alkynyl sulfonium salts. This method involves a base&#8208;promoted nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening and desulfurization pathway, enabling the efficient preparation of diverse alkynyl sulfide compounds. The reaction demonstrates excellent tolerance to various functional groups and proves applicable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules and pharmaceuticals. Moreover, the practicality of this method has been underscored through scale&#8208;up reaction and modification of alkynyl sulfide products.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Peptidols via Reductive Cleavage Through a Benzotriazole Linker</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Peptidols were prepared through the reductive cleavage of benzotriazole intermediates obtained from the on&#8208;bead activation of 3,4&#8208;diaminobenzoyl linkers. Remarkably, this method used commercially available amino acid residues and resins without further modification. Pure peptidols were collected with only filtration in 49%&#8211;87% yield. Only the derivatives with aspartic acid as the first C&#8208;terminal residue required sophisticated chromatography purification. Esters and carboxylic acids were identified as side products and were suppressed by additional reduction or reduction in DMF. Remarkably, the reduction of peptides with the first aspartic acid residue at the C&#8208;terminal afforded a C&#8208;terminal lactone, which could be reduced by deprotection at 0&#8201;&#176;C. For the synthesis of branched peptidols, the bulky wedge structures of the branched peptides resulted in low total yields, which were improved to 23%&#8211;28% by using peripheral Boc groups and SPPS on the Tental gel resin. In addition, this method gave two peptaibols, SPF&#8208;5506&#8208;A4 and Ac&#8208;Gramicidin A, in 11% and 46% yields, respectively.

Abstract
A three&#8208;component strategy for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl allyl alcohols from 1,3&#8208;dienes is developed. A diverse range of synthetically valuable &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl allyl alcohols are obtained in moderate to high yields. Broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance are observed. This method is also applicable to mono&#8208;olefins and 1,3&#8208;enynes. The control experiment results demonstrate that the hydroxyl group OH in the product comes from TBHP. In addition, the practicality and mild reaction conditions make these synthetic transformations attractive and valuable for organic synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;A three-component strategy for the synthesis of &#946;-perfluoroalkyl allyl alcohols from 1,3-dienes is developed. A diverse range of synthetically valuable &#946;-perfluoroalkyl allyl alcohols are obtained in moderate to high yields. Broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance are observed. This method is also applicable to mono-olefins and 1,3-enynes. The control experiment results demonstrate that the hydroxyl group OH in the product comes from TBHP. In addition, the practicality and mild reaction conditions make these synthetic transformations attractive and valuable for organic synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The front cover picture illustrates the cooperative action of carboxylic acids in ruthenium&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H oxygenation. Dicarboxylic acids, such as maleic acid, dramatically increase the basicity and electrophilicity of metal(oxo) intermediates through intramolecular electrostatic interactions. The ruthenium catalyst system, which incorporates the cooperative action of carboxylic acids, has become a powerful C&#8722;H oxidation method that offers both reactivity and site&#8208;selectivity. It progresses with site&#8208; and chemo&#8208;selectivity in the C&#8722;H oxidation using hydrogen peroxide as a terminal oxidant, even in multifunctionalized complex natural products.

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of Chiral Heterocycles via Asymmetric Carbon&#8208;Heteroatom Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral heterocyclic compounds play a crucial role in the pharmaceutical science, materials science, and agrochemical industries. The critical step for synthesizing chiral heterocycles is the formation of asymmetric carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds, which can be achieved in a chiral environment under thermal or photochemical conditions. However, photochemical asymmetric transformation has become an area of immense growth in the past 15 years. In the drug discovery and development era, chiral photochemical transformations have drawn the attention of researchers to develop new synthetic strategies for chiral heterocycles via asymmetric carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond formation. Chiral photochemistry in the pathway of asymmetric synthesis requires a chirality source which is transferred to the products. A catalytic chiral metal complexing agent or a chiral photosensitizer that generally follows a single electron transfer (SET) or oxidative and reductive quenching cycle has been widely exploited to achieve this goal. In this review, we have demonstrated the recent development of photochemical synthesis of chiral heterocycles via asymmetric carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond formation by using a chiral metal catalyst, asymmetric organocatalyst, or dual catalytic system based on their plausible mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru(II) Catalyzed Oxidative Dehydrogenative Annulation and Spirocyclization of Isoquinolones with N&#8208;Substituted Maleimides</title>

Abstract
A Ruthenium(II) catalyzed additive&#8208;free oxidative, dehydrogenative annulation of different malemides on 3,4&#8208;disubstituted isoquinolone to afford fused and spiro&#8208;cyclized isoquinolo&#8208;isoquinolone and isoindolo&#8208;isoquinolone derivatives is reported here. By simply changing solvent and oxidizing agents, under two different conditions, this methodology produced two different poly&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclized products. Isoquinolone&#8208;NH was strategically used as the internal directing group in the ortho C&#8722;H activation using Ru(II) catalyst. Mechanistically dehydrogenative, oxidative C&#8722;C followed by C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling and aza&#8208;michael reaction pathway led to the corresponding fused and spiro&#8208;products respectively. A diversified library of eighty&#8208;one (81) such two products were synthesized by employing this methodology. The fused and the spirocyclized polyheterocyclic compounds absorbed at &#955;max 240&#8211;270&#8197;nm range, however only spiro&#8208;compounds produced blue fluorescence at &#955;em 391&#8211;450&#8197;nm range.

         <title>Catalytic Orthogonal Glycosylation Enabled by Enynal&#8208;Derived Copper Carbenes</title>

Abstract
Herein, we present an approach for catalytic orthogonal glycosylation utilizing earth&#8208;abundant copper carbenes. This method operates under mild conditions and employs readily accessible starting materials, including benchtop stable enynal&#8208;derived glycosyl donors, synthesized at the gram scale. The reaction accommodates a variety of glycosyl acceptors, including primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols. The enynal&#8208;derived copper carbenes exhibit remarkable reactivity and selectivity, allowing for the formation of glycosidic linkages with different protecting groups and stereochemical patterns. This approach provides access to both 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208; and &#8208;trans&#8208;glycosidic linkages. The product stereoselectivity is independent of the anomeric configuration of the glycosyl donor, which also has orthogonal reactivity to widely used alkynes and thioglycoside donors. An iterative synthesis of a trisaccharide further demonstrates the application of this orthogonal reactivity.

Abstract

Abstract
Herein, we report a photocatalytic method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;quinolones under mild conditions by employing &#945;&#8208;diazo acetamide as substrates. The use of Eosin Y as a photocatalyst allows an economical and environmentally benign synthetic method. The process involves the generation of radicals from diazo compounds promoted by a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism. The method demonstrates a broad substrate scope to provide various aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;quinolones. To support the proposed mechanism, a series of mechanistic experiments were conducted.

Abstract
Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed and solvent&#8208;switched [3+2]&#8208;spiroannulation and [4+n] (n=1, 2, 3) annulations of 2&#8208;aryl quinazolinone or 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophthalazine&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones with ynones or alkynyl alcohol or 1,3&#8208;diynes under mild reaction conditions have been analyzed. These reactions take place in the presence of the appropriate solvent and features a redox&#8208;neutral pathway. Ynone serves as an &#8216;atypical one&#8208;carbon unit&#8217; in [4+1] annulation and generates a tetrasubstituted carbon center bearing diverse heterocycles through [3+2] and [4+1] annulation strategies. Post transformations of the synthesized spiro&#8208;products augments the potential of the developed methodology.

         <title>Tandem Hydrogen&#8208;Borrowing Dehydrogenative Coupling and Hydrodefluorination</title>

Abstract
Dehydrogenative coupling (DC) is an attractive approach to constructing new C&#8722;N bonds using alcohols as electrophiles. In &#8216;hydrogen&#8208;borrowing&#8217; variants of DC, the H2 liberated can be used to re&#8208;hydrogenate unsaturated intermediates to produce saturated products. Here, we show how so&#8208;generated H2 can also be used to replace fluorine atoms with hydrogens in CF3 groups in a tandem dehydrogenative coupling/hydrodefluorination process.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Production of Vanillin from Capsaicinoids through a Retrosynthetic Enzyme Cascade</title>

Abstract
Vanillin is a key organoleptic component in vanilla, one of the most important natural flavors in the industry. The limited supply of natural vanilla, extracted from cured vanilla beans, elevates the commercial value of &#8216;natural&#8217;&#8208;labeled vanillin, producible by microbial conversion of natural precursors such as ferulic acid, eugenol, isoeugenol, lignin, and glucose. However, cellular toxicity and undesirable overoxidation of vanillin remain challenges to the microbial methods. Here, we developed a one&#8208;pot enzymatic conversion of capsaicinoids to vanillin by retracing the biosynthetic pathway found in Capsicum plants. The enzyme cascade consists of the hydrolysis of capsaicinoids by immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB) and the oxidative deamination of the resulting vanillylamine by &#969;&#8208;transaminase from Paracoccus denitrificans (PDTA). Process optimization of individual enzyme reactions was conducted on an analytical scale, enabling&gt;95% reaction yield of vanillin from capsaicinoids in the one&#8208;pot cascade reaction without undesirable accumulation of the oxidation byproduct and the inhibitory reaction intermediate, i.&#8201;e., vanillic acid and vanillylamine, respectively. To verify practical applicability, we performed a preparative&#8208;scale reaction starting with 1.75&#8197;g capsaicinoids and 2.75&#8197;g sodium pyruvate at 10&#8197;mg/mL CALB and 3&#8197;&#956;M PDTA, leading to an 81% reaction yield and a 57% isolation yield. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of one&#8208;pot production of vanillin from capsaicinoids, which might pave the way for cost&#8208;effective and sustainable access to natural&#8208;labeled vanillin from a renewable feedstock readily available from Capsicum fruits.

Abstract
Herein, we report a chemo&#8208; and regioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed redox C7&#8208;spiroannulation reaction of N&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole indolines with maleimides, resulting in a series of N&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole indoline fused azaspirocycles in up to 92% yield. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by the synthesis of highly functionalized nitrogen&#8208;containing spiropolycyclic skeletons. The annulation reaction could also be performed with maleic esters and acrylates. The products were purified by simple filtration. The Rh catalyst can be recycled, and the reaction could be performed at gram&#8208;scale using 0.5&#8197;mol% of catalyst, which makes this protocol potentially applicable in industry. Moreover, the efficient post&#8208;modification of pharmaceutical molecules demonstrates its practicability.

Abstract
An intermolecular addition reaction involving an unconventional combination of a diarylmethyl anion and an electrophile, which is mediated by the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis, was developed. Diarylmethyl anions having a benzofuran moiety were generated through the rearrangement with the aid of a catalytic amount of phosphazene base P2&#8208;tBu. The resulting carbanion intermediates were trapped by various electrophiles, such as &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, aryl aldehydes, &#945;&#8208;ketoesters, and N&#8208;Boc imines, providing the corresponding diarylalkane derivatives in good yields.

Abstract
A visible light&#8208;mediated strategy for the preparation of aromatic stannanes from aryl halides (mostly aryl bromides) is presented herein. The reaction proceeds under metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions and exhibits a broad substrate scope. The products obtained have been employed in the C&#8722;C bond formation via Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Mechanistic investigation evidenced the key role of both aryl radical and trimethylstannyl radical in Ar&#8722;Sn bond formation.

Abstract
Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkenylation and arylation of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines with alkenyl and aryl carboxylic acids under microwave assistance have been realized. Using [Rh(CO)2(acac)] as the catalyst and Piv2O as the acid activator, 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines undergo C8&#8208;selective decarbonylative C&#8722;H alkenylation with a wide range of alkenyl and aryl carboxylic acids, affording the C8&#8208;alkenylated or arylated 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines. This method enables the synthesis of C8&#8208;alkenylated 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines that would otherwise be difficult to access by means of conventional C&#8722;H alkenylation protocols. Moreover, this catalytic system also works well in C8&#8208;selective decarbonylative C&#8722;H arylation of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines with aryl carboxylic acids. The catalytic activity strongly depends on the choice of the N&#8208;directing group, with the readily installable and removable N&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrimidyl) group being optimal. The catalytic pathway is elucidated by mechanistic experiments.

Abstract
Enantioselective access to polycyclic tetrahydroxanthone compounds was achieved through an organocatalyzed cascade reaction of alkene&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;diketones and alkenyloxindoles, using quinine&#8208;derived squaramide as an efficient catalyst. It afforded a variety of optically active spirooxindole&#8208;based tetrahydroxanthones with 18&#8211;94% yields, &gt;19:1 dr, and 86&#8211;99% ee.

Abstract
Herein, we report a photochemical synthesis of 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl containing quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones through consecutive photoredox catalysed reactions. A wide range of C3&#8208;modified quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones were obtained in 53&#8211;91% yields by this approach. Mechanistic studies including radical trapping, EPR studies, D&#8208;labelling investigations, and many other control experiments well explained the proposed consecutive photoredox mechanism.

In ancient Indian history, the quest for spiritual liberation, known as &#8220;moksha&#8221;, was a central focus of many saints, sages, and ascetics. The ultimate goal of realizing one&#8242;s true nature was achieved after the practice of severe austerity. The pursuit of scientific discovery is driven by an innate curiosity and a desire to unravel unknown mysteries.

&lt;p&gt;In ancient Indian history, the quest for spiritual liberation, known as &#8220;moksha&#8221;, was a central focus of many saints, sages, and ascetics. The ultimate goal of realizing one&#8242;s true nature was achieved after the practice of severe austerity. The pursuit of scientific discovery is driven by an innate curiosity and a desire to unravel unknown mysteries.

Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroacylation of unsaturated substrates with aldehydes involving the formyl C(sp2)&#8722;H bond activation provides an expedient and efficient access to the carbonyl compounds such as ketones and esters, which are a class of important scaffolds in natural products and in drug development. Recently, extensive attention has been paid to the hydroacylation reactions of the components containing an alkenyl moiety that can trigger a regioselective transformation in the presence of a transition metal catalyst. In this review, we summarize the constructive endeavors in rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed (formal) hydroacylation reactions from 2018, and the plausible pathway is also dissected to offer some insights into the reaction mechanism.

Abstract
The Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction stands as a powerful synthetic tool for C&#8722;H functionalization of aromatic feedstocks, which is conventionally realized through electrophilic alkylation and acylation. The burgeoning interests in axially chiral compounds across diverse fields have spurred extensive exploration of this classic transformation for catalytic atroposelective synthesis. Consequently, the past decade has witnessed the rapid expansion of various non&#8208;canonical Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions, including electrophilic arylation, alkenylation, halogenation, sulfenylation, and amination of aryl C&#8722;H bonds, thereby delving into new chemical spaces. A range of catalytic atroposelective synthetic methods have been devised for these significant arene C&#8722;H functionalization. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the cutting&#8208;edge catalytic synthesis of atropoisomers through non&#8208;canonical Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions, categorized into three parts based on the type of bond formation on the aromatics: C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formations, C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) bond formations and C(sp2)&#8722;heteroatom bond formations. The richness of electrophiles and the modulation of atroposelectivity by diverse chiral organocatalysts, particularly chiral Br&#248;nsted acids, are elucidated. We anticipate that the repertoire of asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction will continue to flourish and to be demonstrated in not only scientific researches but also industrial organic synthesis.

Abstract
Aryl halides are one of the most important chemical feedstocks in pharmaceuticals due to its easy accessibility, inexpensiveness, and widely utilized as aryl radical precursors in organic synthetic chemistry. Conventionally, the stoichiometric reagents such as AIBN/n&#8208;Bu3SnH were used for generation of aryl radical from aryl halides, and suffered from requirement of toxic radical initiators, high temperature and thus, the development of simple, mild strategies for the generation of aryl radical from aryl halides are highly desirable. Recently, visible light mediated strategies received considerable attention, allowing the generation of aryl radical from aryl halides under mild reaction conditions. The present review described the recent breakthroughs and advancements in visible light mediated photocatalyst&#8208;free C&#8722;B/C/O/P/Se/S bond formation of aryl halides.

Abstract
An iron&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling of non&#8208;activated secondary alkyl iodides with terminal alkynes is described. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions in N&#8208;MethylPyrrolidone without auxiliary ligand or co&#8208;catalyst. This procedure allowed the obtention of 28 coupling products. Moreover, slow addition of LiHMDS base allows to achieve up to 89% yields. This method enables the conversion of non&#8208;activated alkyl iodides in a Fe&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling, which was so far not achievable with iron catalysts. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest the implication of a key single electron transfer in the catalytic process.

Abstract
In this work, we reported a method for construction of difluorocyclopropanes through visible light&#8208;promoted [1+2] cycloaddition reaction of aryl diazo esters with gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, encompasses a wide range of substrates (36 examples), exhibits good tolerance to various substituents, and demonstrates a diastereoselectivity of &gt;20:1. Additionally, antifungal activity evaluation revealed that these derivatives exhibited certain activity, the EC50 values for the products towards Botrytis cinerea and Rhizoctonia solani were measured to be 1.51 and 1.36&#8197;&#956;M, respectively, which are significantly lower than those of commercial fungicides Hymexazol and Azoxystrobin. This work not only provides an efficient method for the synthesis of difluorocyclopropanyl derivatives, but reveals their potential applications in fungicide creation.

Abstract
The transmetalation triggered rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation and tandem annulation of 2&#8208;biphenylboronic acids with sulfoxonium ylides or iodonium ylides has been developed. Various products of phenanthrenes were constructed under redox&#8208;neutral conditions in 34&#8211;86% yields. Several mechanism exploration experiments and derivatization reactions were conducted in sequence to gain a deeper understanding of the process and the potential of this transformation. It offers an alternative approach for the synthesis of phenanthrene derivatives.

Abstract
The direct conversion of specific C&#8722;H bonds to C&#8722;Si bonds in alkanes or aromatics via catalytic methods has attracted growing research interest. Herein, we report the preparation of a new iridium catalyst supported on a naphthyridine&#8208;based porous organic polymer and its successful application in the dehydrogenative silylation of 2&#8208;arylphenols or alcohol and hydrosilanes to access ring&#8208;fused oxasilacycles. The synthetic method exhibits broad substrate scope and good functional group compatibility while avoiding the use of hydrogen acceptors. In addition, this organic polymer supported iridium catalyst could be easily recovered from the reaction system and reused for at least seven times without apparent deactivation. This research provides new insights for the further design of heterogeneous nanocatalysts and contributes to the synthesis of silicon&#8208;substituted functional molecules.

Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free dearomative aza&#8208;spirocyclization reaction of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles is established by using molecular iodine under basic conditions. The required substrates were prepared via sequential Fisher indole synthesis and sulfonylation. This dearomatization reaction is amenable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and provides access to various spiroindolenine derivatives from indole sulfonamide precursors.

         <title>Ball&#8208;Milling to Access Dinucleoside Polyphosphates and Analogues</title>

Abstract
Dinucleoside 5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;polyphosphates (NpnNs) play essential roles in various biological processes. Access to these high value&#8208;added compounds, while avoiding the many drawbacks of solution phase synthesis, is a challenge that has been overcome thanks to mechanochemistry. A straightforward solid&#8208;state synthesis based on activation of phosphate or pyrophosphate sodium salts to their diimidazolides, followed by coupling with commercially available nucleotides, under air conditions, gave symmetrical NpnNs. The scope ranged from Np3Ns to highly challenging Np6Ns. The methodology has also been implemented using medronic acid and imidodiphosphate to obtain NpnNs analogues, some of which are unprecedented.

Abstract
Dihydroquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones, recognized for their bioactive properties, feature a six&#8208;membered structure with nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. A method has been developed for synthesizing enantioenriched 3,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives. This approach utilizes an asymmetric [4+2]&#8208;cyclization process, combining 2&#8208;amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes with azlactones, and is facilitated by a bifunctional squaramide&#8208;based organocatalyst. This process has enabled the creation of chiral 3,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones with complex structures, including chiral tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenters, delivering corresponding products in 26&#8211;95% yield with a diastereomeric ratio of 1.2:1&#8211;19:1 and 52&#8211;97 ee.

We report herein an enantioselective [3+3] annulation of indoline&#8208;2&#8208;thiones with yne&#8211;enones by chiral dinuclear zinc catalysts via a Br&#248;nsted base and Lewis acid cooperative activation model. This transformation proceeded through sequential conjugate addition, allenyl ketone formation and intramolecular sulfa&#8208;Michael 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization. A range of enantioenriched tetrahydrothiopyrano[2,3&#8208;b]indole derivatives bearing an exocyclic double bond were obtained in moderate yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 20 : 1 dr, 20:1 Z/E ratio and 95% ee). Late&#8208;stage functionalization, large&#8208;scale experiment and further derivatizations were also explored.

         <title>Engineering Styrene Oxide Isomerase Towards Enhanced Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;Flurbiprofen</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conventional synthesis of (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;flurbiprofen, a valuable non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID), involves inefficient chiral resolution with low&#8208;yielding multiple reaction steps, or asymmetric synthesis with low enantioselectivity and/or regioselectivity. Here, we developed high&#8208;yielding, enantioselective, and sustainable synthesis of (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;flurbiprofen via two chemoenzymatic approaches from a simple alkene: (A) enzymatic epoxidation&#8208;isomerization&#8208;oxidation cascade and Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation; and (B) chemical epoxidation, enzymatic isomerization&#8208;oxidation cascade, and Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation. Styrene oxide isomerase (SOI)&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;retentive Meinwald rearrangement was the key step in the two pathways, but SOI suffers from low activity. SOI was engineered via two rounds of iterative saturation mutagenesis and screening with a three&#8208;enzyme cascade assay, generating a double&#8208;mutant SOI&lt;sub&gt;DM&lt;/sub&gt; (N99A/D95A) with 5.5&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic efficiency (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;). In Pathway A, cascade biotransformation of 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylstyrene with engineered &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; strain expressing SOI&lt;sub&gt;DM&lt;/sub&gt;, styrene monooxygenase (SMO) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), and subsequent Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation afforded (S)&#8208;flurbiprofen in 98% yield and 91% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;. In Pathway B, chemical epoxidation (Sharpless dihydroxylation and ring&#8208;closing), cascade conversion using an engineered &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; strain expressing SOI&lt;sub&gt;DM&lt;/sub&gt;, ALDH and NADH oxidase (NOX), and Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation produced (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;flurbiprofen in 83% yield and 98% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;. Compared to conventional synthesis, the developed methods reduced reaction steps, minimized waste generation and improved enantioselectivity or overall yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral P,N,N&#8208;Ligands for Asymmetric Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The chiral P,N,N&#8208;ligands represented a new type of tridentate ligand developed in recent years and displayed wide utilities in asymmetric catalysis. In the past decades, numerous chiral P,N,N&#8208;ligands with ferrocene, phenethylamine and spiro backbones were synthesized by addition of an aminopyridine, imidazole or diamines coordinating group. These chiral tridentate P,N,N&#8208;ligands showed excellent performance in the ruthenium, iridium, manganese, or cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenations. A wide range of substrates, including simple ketones, &#945;&#8208;halogenated ketones, &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones, &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;amino keto&#8208; ones, &#945;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, or &#948;&#8208;keto acids, &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;keto amides, &#946;&#8208; or &#948;&#8208;keto esters, &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;enones, olefins, imines, quinolines and indoles, could be hydrogenated to afford the corresponding chiral products with high yields and enantioselectivities. In this review, progress on the asymmetric hydrogenation of C=O, C=N, C=C bonds with chiral tridentate P,N,N&#8208;ligands was summarized.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
This review presents an outline of current advancements in the photochemical and electrochemical synthesis of oxazoles and isoxazoles. Oxazole and isoxazole are important building blocks for a variety of medicinally useful compounds. Therefore, the synthesis of these heterocycles via sustainable technologies is worth demanding. Photochemical and electrochemical are two among the few sustainable technologies. This review covers a brief discussion on reaction parameters like catalysts, substrates scope, reaction temperature, solvents, electrodes, electrolytes (in case of electrochemical process), light source (in case of photochemical process) for individual reaction. Detailed discussion on mechanistic insight for each reaction is also presented. Finally, summary, and future direction toward the development of effective electrochemical and photochemical methods for the reaction of oxazoles and isoxazoles is also presented.

         <title>Recent Advances in Radical Transformations of Propargylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Propargylic alcohols are regarded as a class of readily available and versatile synthons in organic synthesis. Due to their unique bifunctional character, the transformation of propargylic alcohols has been widely utilized as a powerful strategy for the construction of various functionalized frameworks over the past few decades. Recently, the radical transformation of propargylic alcohols has attracted considerable attention in synthetic chemistry. This review summarizes recent progress in the radical transformation of propargylic alcohols. Based on the different mechanisms of radical formation underlying these transformations, this review has been divided into four parts: (1) transition&#8208;metal catalyzed radical transformation; (2) photo&#8208;induced radical transformation; (3) electro&#8208;induced radical transformation; and (4) metal&#8208;free or oxidant&#8208;mediated radical transformation of propargylic alcohols.

         <title>N&#8208;Tosylhydrazones as [N,N] Synthons in Heterocyclic Chemistry: Synthesis of 3,5&#8208;Disubstituted N&#8208;Alkenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazoles</title>

Abstract
A new mode of reactivity of N&#8208;sulfonylhydrazones towards alkynes is described: ketone&#8208;derived N&#8208;tosylhydrazones (NTHs) bearing &#945;&#8208;H atoms behave as [NN] synthons in their reactions with alkoxy alkynyl Fischer carbene complexes (FCCs) and only the two N atoms are incorporated into the newly formed pyrazole ring. The scope of the reaction, leading to 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;N&#8208;alkenyl pyrazoles, proved to be wide regarding both partners; thus, a variety of aryl and primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl substituents are tolerated within the FCC, while aryl alkyl NTHs, symmetric and asymmetric dialkyl NTHs and NTHs derived of cyclic ketones can be also employed. In addition, the reaction can be performed at large scale and applied for late&#8208;stage diversification of natural products. A reasonable reaction mechanism is also proposed, which is supported by deuteration experiments and DFT calculations.

         <title>Access to 4&#8208;Membered Heterocycles via Visible&#8208;Light Triggered Intramolecular Cyclization from Alkynes: Bypassing Unfavorable 4&#8208;endo&#8208;dig Cyclization</title>

Abstract
We describe a catalyst, oxidant, and coupling&#8208;reagent free strategy to access 4&#8208;membered heterocycles, representing a unique example of visible&#8208;light triggered intramolecular cyclization of propargylic alcohols and amines to access oxetanones and azetidinones respectively. Despite the direct 4&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization from these starting materials has proven to be unfavorable, the formation of key p&#8208;quinone methide intermediacy allows an efficient bypass for regioselective 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization, resulting in the formation of the desired 4&#8208;membered heterocycles. This mild and operationally simple protocol facilitates the synthesis of products with distinct substitution patterns such as quaternary &#945;&#8208;carbons, and enables late&#8208;stage functionalization.

Abstract
A process for the synthesis of aryl thioglycosides from the aryl thianthrenium salts and 1&#8208;thiosugars is achieved by copper(I)&#8208;mediated, photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reactions. The desired products could be obtained in 32% to 78% yield after irradiation with 34&#8197;W blue light at room temperature. Various functional groups, especially including halogen groups, were well tolerated under standard reaction conditions. This strategy differs conceptually from all previous S&#8208;glycosylations in that thiosugar functionality could be incorporated into complex natural products or drugs at a late stage site&#8208;selectively, which has not been shown via aryl halides and aryldiazonium salts.

Abstract
The domino annulation reactions of o&#8208;aminotrifluoroacetophenone derivatives and MBH carbonates enabled by PPh3 have been reported, which provide a series of tetrahydrofuro[3,2&#8208;b]indolines containing a CF3&#8208;substituted tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenters in yields of 74 to 95% and &gt;20:1 dr. In this process, MBH carbonates were used as C1/C3 synthons. The MTT assay shows that the products exhibit the activity of inhibitory effect on proliferation on Hela cancer cell line.

         <title>Self&#8208; or Acridinium&#8208;Catalyzed Electrophotosynthesis of Thiocyanato Heterocycles from Activated Alkenes</title>

Abstract
While the emergence of electrophotochemistry provides opportunities, such a chemistry at this stage suffers from limited reaction types and high photocatalyst loadings. A self&#8208;catalyzed electrophotosynthesis as well as one with a low photocatalyst loading is presented. These external&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free cyclizations are enabling and applicable to a range of activated alkenes, affording a diverse array of thiocyanato heterocycles including 4&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones, isoquinoline&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones, indolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolin&#8208;6(5H)&#8208;ones, benzoimidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolin&#8208;6(5H)&#8208;ones and indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones, and the protocols are amenable to the late&#8208;stage diversification of complex molecular architectures as well as gram&#8208;scale syntheses. Sunlight could serve as the light source, and the reaction could be conducted in an all&#8208;solar&#8208;driven mode using a commercially available photovoltaic panel to produce electricity.

         <title>Ambiphilic Reactivity of SF5&#8208;Alkynes Applied to Regioselective and Stereodivergent Halogenation Reactions: An Experimental and Theoretical Case Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We explored the ambiphilic reactivity of SF5&#8208;alkynes, and we proved they can act as both nucleophiles and electrophiles. We selected halogenation reactions as benchmark reactions and developed highly selective stereodivergent hydrohalogenation (I, Br, Cl, F) reactions of SF5&#8208;alkynes. The stereochemistry is finely controlled thanks to the nature of the acids used (strong or soft) in the presence of halide source, while the high regioselectivity is governed by the strong polarization of SF5&#8208;alkynes. Mechanistic studies supported by DFT calculations shed light on two different reaction mechanisms responsible of the excellent stereocontrol.
This stereoselectivity was quantitatively rationalized with the ASM and EDA methods. A few dihalogenation reactions are reported and DFT calculations rationalize this cis&#8208;stereoselectivity. Relative configuration of all the SF5&#8208;haloalkenes was unambiguously determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Noteworthy, several post&#8208;functionalization reactions such as cross&#8208;couplings, cyanation and reductions are described to strengthen the synthetic potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectivity Switch in Non&#8208;Directed Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Olefination of Chlorobenzene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8208;H olefination of chlorobenzene derivatives, which favored the  functionalization at the ortho&#8208;to&#8208;chlorine position, was reported. The catalytic system employed a commercially available quinoline ligand to access a wide panel of olefinated aryl chlorides in moderate to high yields from feedstock chemicals (42 examples, 28 to 93% yields). The synthetic utility of the method was further demonstrated by the coupling of various bio&#8208;relevant acrylate partners offering straightforward access to structurally diverse complex molecules. A computational study of the reaction allowed us to confirm that the C&#8208;H activation step, occurring through a concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation mechanism, determined the site&#8208;selectivity of the transformation. The regioselectivity was controlled by the pKa of the C&#8208;H bond (more acidic position) and the lower distortion of chlorobenzene in the key transition structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Hydrosilylation and Hydroboration of Allenes Catalyzed by Cobalt&#8208;Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Achieving precise control over regioselectivity and stereoselectivity in the hydroelementation of terminal allenes presents a formidable challenge. Despite the existence of various catalytic methods for their functionalization, this entire class of reactions remains significantly underdeveloped and demands extensive research. Here, we report a method for the hydroelementation of allenes using inexpensive PN5P pincer cobalt complexes built on a triazine backbone. Depending on the substituent at the ring, the method enables the selective synthesis of E&#8208;alkenylsilane or Z&#8208;allylborane derivatives. In the presented approach, silanes and pinacoloboranes play a dualistic role of simultaneous activator and substrate excluding the need for the addition of external bases. Finally, the application potential of the obtained compounds was demonstrated by performing further functionalizations of the obtained compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Hydrazines by Electrocatalytic Addition of Hydrazines to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy for the synthesis of N,N&#8208;disubstituted hydrazines via the electrocatalytic addition of hydrazine to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds is reported. The reaction was carried out under constant current electrolytic conditions in an undivided cell. Using this methodology, various N,N&#8208;disubstituted hydrazines are prepared with 57&#8208;94% yields in 40 min. By adding cyclohexanone and acetic acid to the reaction mixture of N,N&#8208;disubstituted hydrazines and heating for 2 h, a "one&#8208;pot" synthesis of N&#8208;substituted indoles has also been developed. Furthermore, based on cyclic voltammetry and controlled experiments, a plausible mechanism involving the radical pathway is proposed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we present a (NH4)2S2O8 mediated difunctionalization reaction of aryl alkenes with quinoxalinones and P(O)SH compounds. This method enables the synthesis of various phosphorothioate&#8208;containing quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives (46 examples) in 37&#8208;79% yields.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A one&#8208;pot Pd&#8208;catalyzed tandem process to prepare (2&#8208;arylallyl) aryl sulfones has been developed. This strategy is based on the modular assembly of a boronic acid, a sodium sulfinate and 2&#8208;bromoallyl acetate. The reaction is completely regioselective towards the terminal alkene, yielding (2&#8208;arylallyl) aryl (or alkyl) sulfones with yields ranging from 56 to 93%. Control experiments together with DFT calculations allowed to propose a plausible reaction mechanism of the tandem reaction.
The usefulness of this methodology has been demonstrated with the formal synthesis of the marketed drug Apremilast and of several natural products by asymmetric hydrogenation. Using the commercially available UbaPHOX iridium complex, chiral &#946;&#8208;methyl sulfones with up to 98% ee were obtained</dc:description>

         <title>Phospholanes via twofold C&#8208;H&#8208;addition to phospholes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. A synthetic route towards phospholanes via twofold C&#8208;H&#8208;addition of a DMSO molecule to &#946;&#8208;H substituted phospholes is described. The resulting fused phospholane oxothiolane system in case of symmetric &#945;&#8208;substitution possesses four stereogenic centers or rather six in case of asymmetric &#945;&#8208;substitution. The reaction conditions are shown to be applicable for a variety of phospholes with different P&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;substituents always leading to stereoselective formation of the fused heterocyclic ring system. All phospholane derivatives with one exception are sufficiently air stable for purification with column chromatography and are fully characterized by NMR and elemental analysis and mass spectrometry. With the help of X&#8208;ray crystallography, the different configurations of the isomers could be demonstrated. For one model system derivatization reactions are presented. When oxidizing or reducing the sulfoxide group only a single diastereomer is observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective C6&#8208;Arylation of Thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazole Heterocycles with Aryl Iodides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient and regioselective C6&#8208;arylation of thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazoles with aryl iodides as coupling partners has been developed. This strategy was performed in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 as catalyst in combination with AgOTf as an oxidant and TFA in dimethylacetamide. In all experiments, only the C6&#8208;arylated thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazole was isolated since its C5&#8208;regioisomer was not observed, indicating the high regioselectivity of this approach.
The catalytic system used is compatible with a variety of 3&#8208;functionalized thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazoles and iodoaryl electrophiles, providing access to novel 3,6&#8208;disubstituted thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazoles in moderate to good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Nitrocyclopropanes Bearing a Thioester Group and Three Stereogenic Centers</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A two&#8208;stage protocol was developed for accessing nitrocyclopropanes that bear a thioester group and three stereogenic centers. This protocol achieves practical overall yields ranging from 54% to 75%, along with high levels of stereoselectivity (single diastereomer with up to 98% ee). Brominated monothiomalonate (Br&#8208;MTM) is used as an &#945;&#8208;bromo thioacetate equivalent, which reacts efficiently with nitroolefins in the presence of a low catalyst loading (0.5 mol%) of cinchona alkaloid squaramide under both "on water" and organic homogeneous conditions. The obtained &#945;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitrothioesters undergo an anti&#8208;selective decarboxylation and intramolecular SN2 cyclization process, leading to the formation of desired cyclopropanes. Control experiments were conducted alongside computational studies in order to gain insights into the observed stereoselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrafluoroethylation of Electron&#8208;Rich Alkenyl Iodides Enabled by &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; Generation of Solvent&#8208;Stabilized &#8220;Ligandless&#8221; CuCF2CF2H</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we have developed a metal&#8208;mediated synthetic method for incorporating the 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl (CF2CF2H) motif into unactivated, electron&#8208;rich alkenyl iodides using cross&#8208;coupling reactions. We discovered that the stable Cu(CF2CF2H)(PPh2Me)3 complex, while unreactive with these substrates, serves as a valuable P&#8208;ligated reservoir for the formation of solvent&#8208;stabilized "ligandless" and reactive CuCF2CF2H species. This transformation occurs upon addition of CuBr, which partially scavenges the P&#8208;ligand in the form of CuBr(PPh2Me)3. The resulting in situ generated solvent stabilized "ligandless" system significantly enhances the reactivity of the complex, particularly towards challenging electron&#8208;rich substrates. This advancement enables the synthesis of HCF2CF2&#8208;glycals, as well as nucleosides/nucleobases and arenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Boracarboxylation of Styrenes Using Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The boracarboxylation reaction has potential for production of natural products and drug candidates, but the development of an asymmetric version of this transformation is challenging. We report an enantioselective boracarboxylation of styrenes, enabled by a copper catalyst containing chiral phosphines. Our experimental conditions provide yields between 31&#8208;76% and enantiomeric ratios from 80:20 up to 98:2 for electron&#8208;rich styrenes. Oxidation of a boracarboxylation product provide (S)&#8208;tropic acid, an intermediate towards several tropane alkaloids. A computational analysis of the mechanistic details shows a complex pattern of competing reaction pathways, explaining challenges encountered when developing asymmetric reactions using CO2.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A formal atom transfer radical [3+2] annulation (ATRAn) reaction between different homoallyl radical precursors and 1,1&#8208;diborylethene was developed. It provides a rapid access to polysubstituted cyclopentanes containing a gem&#8208;diboronic ester moiety. The synthetic utility of theses uniquely functionalized 5&#8208;membered rings is highlighted by their easy conversion to attractive borylated building blocks such as 1&#8208;borylated bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes. The ATRAn reaction was extended to homopropagylic radicals giving access to unique allylic gem&#8208;diboronic esters that could be used in allylboration of aldehydes. Furthermore, this work highlights that 1,1&#8208;diborylethene represents a synthetic equivalent to ketene, a so far elusive radical trap due to its daunting reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;catalyzed Alkenylation and Alkenyloxylation with&#8208;Alkenyl(phenyl)iodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and straightforward Cu&#8208;catalyzed vinylation method for alkenyl ethers has been developed. This method demonstrates outstanding performance, delivering high yields and remarkable stereoselectivities for both cyclic and chain alkenyl ether substrates. Furthermore, we have successfully applied this method to directly vinylate the C&#8208;2 position of protected glucals, offering a valuable tool for their functionalization. Moreover, through the utilization of alkenyl alcohols as substrates, we accomplished a 1,2&#8208;alkenyloxylation of alkenyl double bond, enabling the synthesis of functionalized cyclic ether compounds with five or six&#8208;membered rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;light mediated Ugi&#8208;type reaction for the synthesis of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted phthalides
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of diverse phthalides containing quaternary carbon centers remains poorly exploited, requiring stepwise reactions with toxic reagents under high temperatures. Herein, we describe a visible&#8208;light promoted, photo&#8208; and metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free protocol for the modular synthesis of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted phthalides with water as the sole by&#8208;product. This process featured an open&#8208;flask operation of a three&#8208;component reaction involving an isocoumarin as the self&#8208;photosensitizer for aerobic ring contracting rearrangements, allowing the convenient preparation of 3&#8208;(1&#8242;&#8208;indolyl)&#8208;phthalides in moderate to good yields. The mechanistic investigations suggested that singlet oxygen (1O2) was generated through an energy&#8208;transfer pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Palladium Catalysis in Suzuki&#8208;Type Coupling of Benzotriazinones for o&#8208;Aryl/Alkenyl Benzamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium catalyst system based on PdCl2(PPh3)2 or PdCl2(dppf) is reported for Suzuki&#8208;type coupling of both N&#8208;aryl and alkyl benzotriazinones with aryl/alkenyl boronic acids to afford a series of ortho&#8208;aryl/alkenyl benzamides in yields up to 99%, showing improvements on catalytic efficiency, substrate scope and practicality. Scope and limitations of the improved protocol have been demonstrated with more than 40 examples, including a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of activated o&#8208;biphenyl amide. Large electronic and steric effects from the boronic acid counterpart have been observed, implying the transmetallation from boron to palladium should be involved in the rate&#8208;determining step in catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

Abstract
In this manuscript we report the synthesis of 3&#8208;amido&#8208;benzo[b]silines thanks to a 2&#8208;step strategy involving a 3&#8208;component silylformylation of ynamides followed by a Friedel&#8208;Crafts cyclization/isomerizing dehydration domino sequence. This reaction is tolerant to various structural variations and has allowed us to synthesize a library of diversely substituted silacycles with yields from 33 to 85%. We also studied the fluorescence properties of these compounds which show structural similarities with recognized probes such as Si&#8208;Rhodamine for example.

The front cover picture, made by painter Monika Tomanov&#225; and reproduced with permission, illustrates that nitrobenzenesulfonamides prepared from 2&#8208;aminobenzyl cyanide and alkylated with various agents can be converted to N&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;nitroarylindoles. The reaction proceeds via base&#8208;catalyzed Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement leading to metal&#8208;free intramolecular C&#947;&#8208;arylation followed by spontaneous cyclization. The process is as simple as developing a black and white photo in a darkroom chamber. Details can be found in Research Article by Miroslav Soural and co&#8208;workers (K. Zakova, P. Kralova, M.

The front cover illustrates pandas as gold catalysts on trees, with the leaves symbolizing reaction reagents, intermediates, and products. It portrays the 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#8208;selective cyclization of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;ynones. The smiling panda under the tree captures the synthesized 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones, which reflect the isolation of the intermediates. The illustration suggests the synthetic utility of the 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones for syntheses of spiropseudoindoxyl and pyranoindole derivatives, and implies the opening of avenues toward the discovery of new bioactive materials.

Abstract
A scalable procedure for the synthesis of 4,6&#8208;difluorotryptophan is reported based on a deaminative coupling of a 4,6&#8208;difluorogramine with 2&#8208;benzylthio&#8208;1,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;imidazolone as glycine equivalent. Thus prepared 4,6&#8208;difluorotryptophan was incorporated into the C&#8208;terminal domain of the HIV&#8208;1 capsid protein (CA&#8208;CTD), and 19F spectra of the 4,6&#8208;difluoro Trp CA CTD were recorded and compared to the singly fluorinated counterparts.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photochemical synthesis of biologically relevant benzyl oxindoles is presented via electron&#8208;donor acceptor (EDA) complex strategy. This exogenous photocatalyst&#8208;free method describes the formation of a new electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex based on potassium carbonate and thianthrenium salts for C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) bond formation. This transition&#8208;metal free reaction allows a rapid increase in oxindoles molecular complexity chemical space, tolerating different functional groups as well as sophisticated biomolecules. The scalability and sustainability of this method is highlighted by an important waste recovery protocol. Mechanistic investigations support the formation of an EDA complex that induces a radical chain, and the applicability of this method is showcased by straightforward derivatization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalysed C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation and Hydrogen Isotope Exchange via Nitrogen&#8208;Based Carbonyl Directing Groups</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Growing interest in improved structural diversity within the pharmaceutical industry has led to a focus on more sp3&#8208;rich drug frameworks. Meanwhile, spiralling pharmaceutical research and development costs continue to require expedited adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity studies, which are heavily reliant on the use of molecules incorporating deuterium and tritium. Herein, we report a an iridium catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H activation and hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) methodology capable of utilizing pharmaceutically ubiquitous nitrogen&#8208;based carbonyl directing groups. High levels of deuterium incorporation (&gt;80% in 37 of the examples) are demonstrated across a range of substrates (5&#8208;, 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered lactams,  cyclic carbamates and ureas, acyclic amides), with tolerance	of a range of common functional groups (aryl, alkoxy, halogen, ester, alcohol, sulfonamide) and predictable regioselectivity. The applicability of this methodology was demonstrated with up to 98% deuterium incorporation observed in a range of challenging bioactive molecules such as Nefiracetam, Praziquantel, and Unifiram. Density functional theory has provided mechanistic insight into the C&#8208;H activation and HIE at both the expected site of incorporation and an unexpected aryl labelling via a 7&#8208;membered metallocyclic intermediate.

The applicability of this methodology was demonstrated with up to 98% deuterium incorporation observed in a range of challenging bioactive molecules such as Nefiracetam, Praziquantel, and Unifiram.

         <title>Synthesizing Silyl Arylsulfonyl Hydrazones as Silyldiazomethane Precursors and Their Use in Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A method for synthesizing silyl arylsulfonyl hydrazones as silyldiazomethane precursors has been developed. Although silyldiazomethanes are an important class of diazo compounds, their use in intramolecular cyclization reactions has not been fully explored despite the rich chemistry of diazo compounds, particularly metal carbenoid chemistry. The fundamental challenge underlying the absence of such studies is the lack of a method for synthesizing silyldiazomethanes with functional groups that can react with metal carbenoids. The method reported here provides access to variety of silyl arylsulfonyl hydrazones with functional groups such as ethers, carbamates, and alkynes, which can serve as reaction sites for metal carbenoids. A one&#8208;pot hydrazone formation using unstable formylsilane formed in&#8197;situ is key to a successful synthesis. The use of 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzenesulfonohydrazide contributed toward achieving broad generality in hydrazone formation. The synthetic potential of this method was demonstrated through the generation of silyldiazomethane and its transformation to several silacycles.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Defluorination to Access 1,1&#8208;Difluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;Enynes</title>

Abstract
Herein, a visible light&#8208;mediated defluorination reaction to access 1,1&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes is described. Compared with previous studies, this protocol employs more readily accessible acids as a radical precursor under redox&#8208;neutral conditions. Moreover, the reaction exhibits high compatibility with diverse primary, secondary and tertiary acids, especially natural amino acids and drug&#8208;derived acids. Preliminary mechanistic investigations reveal that a radical pathway is involved in the catalytic cycle.

Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed difunctionalization of olefins has attracted considerable attention as a method to construct carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;hetero bonds. Herein, the copper&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component radical cross&#8208;coupling of oxime esters, styrenes and AgSCF3 through a visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted iminyl radical&#8208;mediated carbon&#8208;carbon bond cleavage strategy has been described. Utilizing low&#8208;cost copper salt as both photosensitizers and cross&#8208;couplers, this protocol delivers diverse target products, providing a supplementary approach for cyanoalkylation and trifluoromethylthiolation of drug molecules.

Abstract
Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H oxidation of unprotected aniline derivatives under aerobic conditions, which enables the preparation of phenanthridine compounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the pioneering reaction of dehydrogenative C(sp3)&#8722;N bond formation from unprotected anilines under a Cu/O2 system. Notably, various anilines possessing alkyl, methoxy, halogen (fluoride, chloride, bromide, and iodide), trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, cyano, ester, and acetal groups can also participate in the reaction.

Abstract
We report a class of isolable bis&#8208;cyclometallated iridium precatalysts (ImIr) and their use in regioselective ortho&#8722;C&#8722;H borylation of aromatic, heteroaromatic, acrylic, and aliphatic systems. The catalysts consist of two imine ligands and an acetate coordinated to an iridium (III) center. The isolable character of ImIr warrants its compatibility with high&#8208;throughput experimentation, a prerequisite for applications in late&#8208;stage functionalization (LSF) of complex substrates. Initial mechanistic studies point towards an inner&#8208;sphere mechanism involving bis&#8208;cyclometallated species shedding light on the general mechanistic understanding of ortho&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylations.

Abstract
An easily scalable and highly diastereoselective synthesis of challenging 1,2,5,6,11,11b&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;3H&#8208;imidazo[1&#8242;,2&#8242;:1,2]pyrido[3,4&#8208;b]indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones is accomplished through divergent transformation of Ugi 4&#8208;CR products. The trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf) mediated intramolecular condensation of a series of Ugi 4&#8208;CR adducts generates a N&#8208;acylimidinium intermediate which undergoes ring closure to selectively afford the target title compounds in good to high yields.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Five to Eight&#8208;Membered P&#8208;Stereogenic Benzo&#8208;Fused Heterocycles via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
P&#8208;stereogenic benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles is a privileged skeleton due to their outstanding catalytic properties and bioactivities. However, their enantioselective synthesis is still underdeveloped. Here we demonstrate the use of easily accessible racemic H&#8722;P(O) compounds as starting materials and commercial chiral N1, N2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diphenylethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine ligand in combination with Cu(I) catalysts to enable an attractive dynamic kinetic C(sp2)&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reaction. This protocol not only exhibits a broad substrate scope but also provides general access to a diverse range of useful P&#8208;stereogenic five&#8208;, six&#8208;, seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered benzo&#8208;fused O, P&#8208; containing heterocycles with good to high yields and enantioselectivities.

Abstract
A range of densely functionalized ullazines have been synthesized by a one&#8208;pot Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed twofold C&#8722;H activation/oxidative annulation of N&#8208;arylpyrroles with alkynes. Electrophilic bromination at 5&#8208; or 5,7&#8208; positions of the EWG&#8208;substituted ullazine core offers an interesting single or double entry for further extended functionalization. Mechanistic considerations suggest two complementary paths, EWG&#8208;assisted and SEAr, for the C&#8722;H activations. All ullazines exhibit strong fluorescence emissions. Ullazines bearing thiophene and triarylamine units at 5&#8208; and 5,7&#8208; positions show a significant bathochromic shift in their emission spectra, attributed to the more extended electronic circuits present.

This novel approach involves enzymatic reduction of &#945;-gem-difluorinated heterocyclic and carbocyclic ketone derivatives as well as an acyclic gem-difluorinated &#946;-ketosulfone and proceeds under mild conditions at room temperature under aqueous conditions to produce a range of high added value enantioenriched difluorinated alcohols including 3,3-difluorochromanol, 3,3-difluorothiochromanol, 3,3-difluoro-dihydroquinolinol, and &#945;-difluorinated &#946;-hydroxysulfone derivatives. A comparative study between enzymatic reduction and metal-catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation was carried out as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>This study reports the copper&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;indolmethylation of 2&#8208;pyridylacetates with 3&#8208;indoleacetic acids. This reaction offers a approach to generating alkylideneindolenine electrophiles via the oxidative decarboxylation of 3&#8208;indoleacetic acids. The developed reaction system demonstrates good versatility, extending beyond the indolmethylation of 2&#8208; pyridylacetates to include activated esters and nitroalkanes. Moreover, a biological evaluation revealed that several products exhibited antiproliferative activity against different cancer cell lines.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An organocatalyzed three&#8208;component protocol using diazoacetonitrile to access a wide range of cyanopyrazole derivatives has been reported herein. This strategy, which proceeds through a piperidine&#8208;catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation/formal [3+2] cycloaddition/dehydrocyanation sequence, provides an efficient route to construct dicyanopyrazoles from aldehydes, malononitrile, and diazoacetonitrile regioselectively. Interestingly, by engaging cyanoacetate and cyanoacetamide in this protocol, we could achieve cyanopyrazole esters and carboxamides.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Alkynylsilanes: A Review of the State of the Art</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This contribution offers a comprehensive overview of methods for forging sp C&#8211;Si bonds. Over time, alkynylsilanes (silylacetylenes), once considered mere byproducts of hydrosilylation processes, have become essential building blocks in organic synthesis. This literature review traces the evolution of their synthesis, from traditional methodologies relying on organolithium and organomagnesium compounds to more advanced cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving hydro&#8208; and carbosilanes. Focused primarily on the past 25 years (2000&#8208;2024), it also extensively references significant historical breakthroughs. By analyzing synthetic methodologies, the review not only offers a comprehensive survey of the current state of knowledge but also identifies areas for improvement. Furthermore, to emphasize the importance of 1&#8208;alkynylsilanes (1&#8208;silyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkynes), selected applications of these compounds are highlighted, confirming their significant potential in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

Abstract
Herein we report the discovery and development of the first example of a cationic [1,5]&#8208;aryl migration reaction, through an unprecedented phenonium ions. This reaction does not require any acid, base, transition metal&#8208;based catalyst or promoter, instead promoted by the water activated NXS reagents. It provides a highly diastereoselective and rapid access to the medicinally and biologically important tetra&#8208;substituted olefins (allyl alcohols). The involvement of an ipso&#8208;carbon, as well as the phenonium ion during this novel, cationic [1,5]&#8208;aryl migration was strongly supported by the isolation of 2&#8208;oxaspiro[5.5]undecane&#8208;9&#8208;ones. This methodology is highly tolerable for a wide range of propargyl&#8208;benzyl ethers, resulting in a selective construction of structurally divergent library of mono&#8208;halo&#8208;tricarbon&#8208;substituted alkenes. Synthetic application has also been demonstrated by converting two isomeric&#8208;iodo&#8208;olefins to respective E&#8208; and Z&#8208;isomers of tamoxifen in a stereospecific manner.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Di&#8208; and Mono&#8208;Alkylated Indoles via Tunable Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroarylation of Styrenes</title>

Abstract
We report an iron&#8208;catalyzed divergent synthesis of alkylated indoles based on precise control of the activation sites on indoles through the selection of catalysts. Using indoles and styrenes as starting materials, 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;alkylated indoles could be prepared selectively and directly for the first time by treating with a catalytic amount of Fe(OTf)3 and 3&#8208;alkylated indoles were achieved exclusively by adding a catalytic amount of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin as the cocatalyst with Fe(OTf)3. This simple method was demonstrated with 52 examples with high yields and broad functional group compatibilities.

Using indoles and styrenes as starting materials, 3,5-&lt;i&gt;di&lt;/i&gt;-alkylated indoles could be prepared selectively and directly for the first time by treating with a catalytic amount of Fe(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and 3-alkylated indoles were achieved exclusively by adding a catalytic amount of &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-cyclodextrin as the cocatalyst with Fe(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This simple method was demonstrated with 52 examples with high yields and broad functional group compatibilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A Mitsunobu process performed under neat grinding conditions, using a mixer mill, is reported. It proceeds in the absence of reaction solvent and in short reactions times (10&#8211;20&#8197;min). A broad substrate scope encompassing primary and secondary alcohols, as well as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon&#8208;centered nucleophiles is demonstrated. Application to the functionalization of a selection of APIs is shown, also. The developed process is amenable to scale up on a planetary ball&#8208;mill, yielding over 2 grams of product. Finally, a representative alcohol is inverted with excellent stereoselectivity.

Abstract
We report herein a palladium&#8208;catalyzed, site&#8208;selective cyclative annulation of o&#8208;alkynyl arylamides with maleimide for the stereoselective construction of succinimide&#8208;fused benzoxazine derivatives. This operationally simple and modular protocol provides access to polycyclic frameworks. The other associated features are high functional group compatibility, gram&#8208;scale synthetic potential, and downstream transformations. Control and labeling experiments were conducted to get insights into the mechanism.

Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic compounds, in particular, quinolines and quinazolines are frequently used in medicinal chemistry. Therefore, the direct and clean synthesis of these valuable scaffolds has been a great interest for many years. 2&#8208;Aminobenzyl alcohols as an alternative reactant instead of unstable and expensive 2&#8208;aminobenzaldehydes can be used in the construction of N&#8208;fused heterocycles including quinolines, quinazolines, oxazines, thiazines, selenazines, imidazoles, diazepines, etc. In this review article, we have discussed recent developments in the use of 2&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohols in the synthesis of diverse heterocycles.

         <title>Access to 3&#8208;Azetidines via Halogenation of Titanacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Azetidines are valuable nitrogenous heterocycles. Herein, we disclose a strategy for the modular assembly of 3&#8208;azetidines and related spirocyclic congeners featuring all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers. This approach leverages titanacyclobutanes generated from ketones or alkenes. Halogenation of these organotitanium species gives rise to functionalized alkyl dihalides that can be subsequently captured by amines to afford azetidine building blocks. This strategy facilitated the synthesis of a small molecule anti&#8208;tuberculosis drug. It also enabled access to carbon&#8208;13 isotopologs of diazaspiro[3.3]heptane fragments that are challenging to prepare by any other means.

         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed conditions for diazidation or acetoxy/hydroxylation of N&#8208;allyl sulfonamides by using Pd(OAc)2 as the catalyst combined with Mn(OAc)3&#183;2H2O have been developed. The 1,2&#8208;diazidation reaction of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond occurs in mild conditions (i.e. NaN3 as azide source in THF at room temperature), whereas the 1,2&#8208;acetoxy/hydroxylation requires an excess of Mn(OAc)3&#183;2H2O. The well&#8208;known ability of this reagent to act through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) makes plausible a radical mechanism involving high valent palladium complexes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>n&#8208;Bu4NI/K2S2O8 mediated transformylation from p&#8208;anisaldehyde to primary amides is reported. The mechanistic studies suggest the reaction occurs via a single electron transfer pathway.

Abstract
A direct catalytic stereoselective synthesis of C4&#8217; functionalized furanoside and nucleoside derivatives with a tetrasubstituted stereocenter is disclosed. The amine&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective &#945;&#8208;aminomethylation reactions on furanoside&#8208;derived aldehyde derivatives gave the corresponding C4&#8217; functionalized D&#8208; or L&#8208;ribose derivatives in good to excellent yields (67&#8722;94%) with up to &gt;20:1 dr.

Abstract
Copper&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylation of peroxides in the presence of O&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;nitroisourea provides an access to O&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;alkylnitroisoureas, an underdeveloped class of nitrogenated compounds, which can be regarded as isocyanate surrogates and find useful as AB&#8208;type monomers, for polyurethane synthesis.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Ring&#8208;Opening Reactions of 2H&#8208;Indazoles with Alcohols to Obtain Ortho&#8208;alkoxycarbonylated Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A strategy for synthesis of azo&#8208;derived compounds by electrochemical oxidative ring&#8208;opening reactions of 2H&#8208;indazoles with alcohols is reported. The reactions are carried out under galvanostatic electrolysis conditions in an undivided cell without the use of transition metal catalysts. On the basis of cyclic voltammetry and control experiments, a plausible mechanism for this ring&#8208;opening reaction involving the radical pathway is proposed. Furthermore, various 2H&#8208;indazoles and alcohols are suitable in this system, giving the desired ortho&#8208;alkoxycarbonylated azobenzenes in 9&#8211;84% yields.

         <title>Photocatalyzed formation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes using oxime esters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this manuscript a general photocatalytic approach for the synthesis of alkyl&#8208;substituted gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes using readily&#8208;available oxime esters and 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoroprop&#8208;2&#8208;ene (BDFP) has been established. This strategy involving a radical bromo&#8208;elimination provides access to a large variety of value added fluorinated molecules. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with many functional groups including complex natural products or drug molecules. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic investigations indicate that the efficiency of the process relies on the crucial role of imine radical, which is formed after photoexcitation via EnT and decarboxylation of the oxime ester. Indeed, the imine radical would either behave as a bromine radical scavenger or an XAT promoter in this reaction.</dc:description>

Abstract
A synthetic protocol was developed to synthesize highly functionalized 3&#8208;furylmethyl chromones from enynones and o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl enaminones via silver&#8208;catalyzed cascade bis&#8208;heteroannulation reaction. This strategy features broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance. Furthermore, the 3&#8208;furylmethyl chromone skeleton shows the potential synthetic application value through further gram&#8208;scale synthesis and derivatization.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;arylindoles and their Fused Analogues via Intramolecular C&#8208;Arylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
2&#8208;Aminobenzyl cyanide was reacted with nitrobenzenesulfonyl chlorides and alkylated under Mitsunobu or Fukuyama conditions. The resulting intermediates were exposed to basic conditions, which triggered a Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement, leading to intramolecular C&#8208;arylation. This reaction was followed by spontaneous cycloaddition, which yielded 2&#8208;aminoindole derivatives. The developed synthetic route represents a metal&#8208;free approach for accessing 1&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;arylindoles. Furthermore, pyrimido[1,2&#8208;a]indoles and 7,8dihydrobenzo[6,7][1,3]diazepino[4,5&#8208;b]indoles were synthesized through the use of functionalized alcohols.

         <title>Recent Progress in Haloalkene Synthesis by Hydrohalogenation (HX=HCl, HBr, HI) of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Hydrohalogenation of alkynes is one of the fundamental reactions in organic chemistry, as described in textbooks that begins from old time as Reppe's chemistry. This method, which directly affords haloalkenes in a single step, is attractive from both industrial and academic viewpoints. Despite the long history of this reaction, novel efficient catalysts and regioselective and/or stereoselective controlled reactions are still a challenging topic. This review addresses the recent (past decade) advances in this field of organic chemistry.

Despite the long history of this reaction, novel efficient catalysts and regioselective and/or stereoselective controlled reactions are still a challenging topic. This review addresses the recent (past decade) advances in this field of organic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Creating an expedient method for synthesizing biologically significant functionally rich octahydroquinoline is a highly sought&#8208;after yet challenging endeavour. In this report, we document an unprecedented approach to the construction of novel spirooctahydroquinoline oxindole architectures. The reaction proceeds through Pd (II) catalyzed cycloisomerisation and quinine catalyzed [4+2]&#8208;addition sequence to afford the desired adduct in moderate to excellent yield (up to 89%) in a single diastereomer with three contiguous stereocenters including one spirocenter. An overwhelming number of libraries were generated (35 examples) reflecting the synthetic versatility and functional groups/substituents tolerance. Further, the adduct is transformed into medicinally important fluoro&#8208;decahydroepoxyethanoquinoline spirooxindole scaffold with five contiguous stereocenters in excellent yield and selectivity (95% yield and &gt;99:1 dr) through a three steps sequence which signifies the synthetic utility of the developed methodology.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Arylations of Ketimines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Arylation of ketimines is the most straightforward strategy for constructing chiral &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines, important structural motifs found in natural products and biologically active compounds. This comprehensive review highlights the achievements in the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed and organocatalyzed asymmetric arylations of ketimines from the seminal report published in 2010 till November 2023. The review is divided into three chapters: (1) Arylation of diaryl ketimines, (2) Arylation of aryl&#8208;alkyl and aryl&#8208;acyl ketimines, and (3) Arylation of acyl&#8208;alkyl and dialkyl ketimines. Each chapter is further divided into transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions (grouped by individual metals) and organocatalyzed reactions. The covered literature includes emphasis on the advantages of the reported methodology, its scope and limitations, and the description of the transition state (where applicable).

Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric dearomative arylation of 2&#8208;naphthols enabled by the unconventional reactivity of o&#8208;quinone diimides, i.&#8201;e. the 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition on quinone sp2 hybridized carbon, has been established. Under the catalysis of chiral phosphoric acid, various cyclohexaenones bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter have been prepared with excellent yields and enantioselectivities.

         <title>Solvated Electrons: Dynamic Reductant in Visible Light Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Open shell species are alluring significant attention owing to their unique physiochemical properties in redox chemistry for activating remarkably stable bonds. Solvated electrons are one of them that have been extensively investigated due to their high reduction potential (Ered=&#8722;2.9&#8197;V vs SHE in CH3CN), diverse substrate activation, and promising applications. If the activating species have a larger redox potential with a longer lifetime, then the broader range of substrates will be activated. Hence, the solvated electron qualifies as a super&#8208;reductant with these qualities. However, due to safety issues, generating solvated electrons by dissolving alkali metals in an ammoniated solvent limits its use towards complicated organic transformations. Instead photochemically generated solvated electron overcome this limitation and is identified as a user&#8208;friendly, sustainable, and much safer alternative approach for producing solvated electrons. In this minireview, we have comprehensively highlighted the recent key methods to generate the solvated electron photochemically, characterization techniques, and its application in organic transformations with selected examples. The minireview provides new opportunities for chemists to understand the conceptual, physical, and mechanistic chemistry principle of this super reductant for exploiting a new photochemical route for the transformations that are difficult to achieve by other means.

         <title>Oxidative Alkenylation of (Hetero)aromatics with Unactivated Alkenes: Control of the Reaction Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Alkenylbenzene skeletons represent one of the most widely occurring structural motifs in pharmaceutical drugs, natural products, and advanced materials. The construction of alkenylbenzenes is promising through the use of a straightforward oxidative alkenylation protocol, particularly from unactivated alkenes. This is significant because unactivated alkenes are inexpensive raw materials that can be obtained in bulk quantities from petrochemical feedstocks and renewable resources. However, controlling the reactivity and regioselectivity of olefination with unbiased olefins remains a significant challenge, necessitating continuous efforts and potentially having a substantial impact on both organic synthesis and the industry. This review aims to provide an overview of the latest advances in regiocontrol strategies for oxidative alkenylation reactions with unactivated alkenes, which can be categorized into three types: 1) ligand&#8208;promoted/accelerated reactions; 2) prefunctionalized olefins&#8208;facilitated reactions; 3) directing group&#8208;induced reactions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkenylbenzene skeletons represent one of the most widely occurring structural motifs in pharmaceutical drugs, natural products, and advanced materials. The construction of alkenylbenzenes is promising through the use of a straightforward oxidative alkenylation protocol, particularly from unactivated alkenes. This is significant because unactivated alkenes are inexpensive raw materials that can be obtained in bulk quantities from petrochemical feedstocks and renewable resources. However, controlling the reactivity and regioselectivity of olefination with unbiased olefins remains a significant challenge, necessitating continuous efforts and potentially having a substantial impact on both organic synthesis and the industry. This review aims to provide an overview of the latest advances in regiocontrol strategies for oxidative alkenylation reactions with unactivated alkenes, which can be categorized into three types: 1) ligand-promoted/accelerated reactions; 2) prefunctionalized olefins-facilitated reactions; 3) directing group-induced reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
The direct diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective Ru(II)&#8208; catalyzed cyclopropanation reaction of alkenes with ((2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoroethyl)sulfinyl)benzene was described. The desired enantioenriched PhSO2CF2&#8208;cyclopropanes were obtained in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities in the presence of a chiral ruthenium complex Ru(II)&#8208;Pheox (17&#8211;94% yields, &gt;20:1 d.r. and 83:17&#8211;98:2 e.r.). The robustness of the approach was showcased and This methodology gave access to chiral 1,2&#8208;trans difluoro&#8208;methylcyclopropanes.

Abstract
A DBU&#8208;promoted [3+2] cyclization/retro&#8208;Mannich cascade reaction of N&#8208;aminoisoquinolinium and N&#8208;aminoquinolinium derivatives with para&#8208;quinone methides has been established, employing a C=C double bond cleavage. A broad range of N&#8208;aminoquinolinium salts, N&#8208;aminoisoquinolinium salts, and para&#8208;quinone methides are well tolerated, providing the corresponding rearrangement products. Moreover, scaled&#8208;up reactions and diverse derivatizations of the products were also investigated and discussed.

         <title>Electrochemical Hydroxylation of &#945;&#8208;Bromoacetophenones: Access to &#945;&#8208;Hydroxyacetophenones</title>

Abstract
Herein, a new method has been developed for the synthesis of various &#945;&#8208;hydroxyacetophenones via an electro&#8208;oxidation process. It involves electrocatalytic hydroxylation via debromination of C(sp3)&#8722;Br bond. Here, simultaneous breaking of carbon&#8208;bromine (C&#8722;Br) bond and formation of a new carbon&#8208;oxygen (C&#8722;O) bond has been achieved through electrolysis of H2O using binary mixture of water and DMSO. The protocol features easy performance, oxidant and base&#8208;free mild conditions and short reaction time.

         <dc:description>The CPAPhosAuCl bifunctional complexes catalyse the enantioselective tandem cycloisomerization&#8208;nucleophilic addition reactions between 2&#8208;alkynylenones and naphthols, where naphthols behave mainly as O&#8208;nucleophiles. The inherent acidity of the catalysts induces then the isomerization of the O&#8208;addition&#8208; into the C&#8208;addition products with concomitant decrease of their enantiomeric excesses. In depth mechanistic studies have provided insights into these processes. Subsequently, the undesired racemization pathways could be suppressed by using substituted naphthols as nucleophiles, which delivered a large series of chiral bicyclic furanes in high enantioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We described the protein engineering of the halohydrin dehalogenase HheG to enhance its R enantioselectivity for the synthesis of chiral 4&#8208;aryloxazolidinones via &#945;&#8208;regioselective ring&#8208;opening of aryl epoxides with cyanate. Additionally, we achieved the inversion of its regioselectivity and enantioselectivity, resulting in a HheG variant tailored for the synthesis of chiral 5&#8208;aryloxazolidinones via &#946;&#8208;regioselective and S&#8208;enantioselective ring&#8208;opening of aryl epoxides with cyanate. Leveraging these engineered mutants, we developed a biocatalytic platform capable of synthesis of both chiral 4&#8208;aryloxazolidinones (up to 47% yield, 98% ee, and 99% regioselectivity) and chiral 5&#8208;aryloxazolidinones (up to 46% yield, &gt;99% ee, and 98% regioselectivity). Furthermore, a collaborative approach utilizing two regio&#8208; and enantioselective HheG mutants has been demonstrated to enable the simultaneous synthesis of chiral 4&#8208;aryloxazolidinones and chiral 5&#8208;aryloxazolidinones.</dc:description>

Abstract
Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular dual annulation reaction of alkyl nitrile&#8208;containing 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones to synthesize polycyclic quinazolinones. This catalytic reaction can construct the core structure of polycyclic quinazolinone alkaloids; therefore, we also apply this reaction as the critical step to access fifteen relevant alkaloids to demonstrate efficacy.

Abstract
When a mixture containing 1&#8208;halo&#8208;1&#8208;alkyne, a dinucleophilic agent, and a base (Cs2CO3 or K3PO4) was heated in DMF, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective nucleophilic addition of the dinucleophilic agent to the acetylenes occurred. This reaction yielded (Z,Z)&#8208;bis(haloalkene), which subsequently underwent Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclization through C&#8722;H bond activation, resulting in the formation of two&#8208;oxygen&#8208; or &#8208;nitrogen&#8208;containing hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds. N&#8208;(5&#8208;Hydroxynaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methanesulfonamide was treated with 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;chloroethyne followed by 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;hexadecyne. After these reactions, Pd&#8208;catalyzed double C&#8722;H cyclization was employed to produce 1H&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;7&#8208;tetradecylbenzofuro[7,6&#8208;g]indole. Notably, this compound transformed into a fan&#8208;shaped structure at 86&#8201;&#176;C and transitioned into a smectic A phase characterized by a layered structure.

         <title>An Electrochemically Driven Oxidative Strecker Reaction via the Unique Hydroxymethyl Radical Intermediate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Alfa&#8208;aminonitriles are versatile and valuable intermediates in pharmaceutical chemistry. Until now, the Strecker reaction has remained the most efficient tool for synthesizing these compounds. Nevertheless, it is only applicable to aldehyde/imine systems and generally needs metal catalysts and external additives. Herein, an electrochemically driven oxidative Strecker reaction strategy was designed and accomplished for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles with alcohol as the alkylation reagent. The strategy is environmentally friendly, scalable, and compatible with a wide range of functional groups, encompassing aromatic primary amines, secondary amines, and even alkylamine. Utilizing the merits of electro&#8208;organic synthesis, it can be readily magnified from milligram to gram scale by simply adjusting the electrochemical parameters. Emphasized, it testified that a unique intermediate CH2*OH well&#8208;established in fuel cells was involved in the reaction.

Abstract
A Cp*Ir&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation of 1&#8208;isoquinolinone and 2&#8208;pyridones with N&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl as a directing group to afford 6&#8208;phenylpyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and 3&#8208;phenylisoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones by using arylsilanes is described in this paper. This method tolerates a series of functional groups, such as halide, trifluoromethyl, C=C double bond and offers a synthetic approach to the core structure of protoberberine alkaloids. Several experiments on mechanism studies were conducted to reveal the possible process of this Cp*Ir&#8208;catalytic cycle.

Abstract
A base&#8208;and&#8208;additive&#8208;free photo&#8208;induced radical&#8208;mediated cascade cyclization reaction of 1,6&#8208;enyne compounds was presented. In this study, C(sp3)&#8722;H hydrocarbons, including various alkanes and ethers, were activated via Fe&#8208;catalyzed photo&#8208;induced conditions, providing a bunch of &#947;&#8208;lactam products via hydrogen atom transfer and radical addition processes. Control experiments indicated that the reaction proceeded through photo&#8208;induced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) process. Gram scale experiment was also completed by using continuous&#8208;flow&#8208;photocatalytic&#8208;device.

Abstract
A phosphine&#8208;mediated cyclization of benzo[c][1,2]dithiol&#8208;3&#8208;ones and amidines is demonstrated herein. Triphenylphosphine was harnessed as the activating reagent to facilitate the ring&#8208;opening of benzo[c][1,2]dithiol&#8208;3&#8208;ones via S&#8722;S bond cleavage. This PPh3&#8208;Promoted cyclization reaction of benzo[c][1,2]dithiol&#8208;3&#8208;ones enabled to forge a diverse array of 1,3&#8208;benzothiazones in decent yields with wide substrate scope under mild conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Arylazoindoles through Iron(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Azolation of Indoles and Arylhydrazines</title>

Abstract
A variety of functionalized 3&#8208;arylazoindoles were prepared in good to excellent yields through an iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H azolation of 2&#8208;substituted indoles with arylhydrazines under mild reaction conditions. The reaction underwent an initial TBN&#8208;mediated nitrosation, 1,5&#8208;hydrogen migration, intramolecular condensation, and 1,5&#8208;hydrogen migration over four steps in one pot. A paracyclophane&#8208;derived 3&#8208;phenylazoindole could be prepared in 25% yield over three steps and some prepared 3&#8208;arylazoindoles showed a different fluorescence emission wavelength and existed obvious pH conditions response. The present method highlights broad substrate scope of easily available starting materials, wide range of functional group compatibility, gram scalable preparations, high atom economy, avoidance of unstable and explosive azolation reagents, and simple purification operations by extraction, washing, and recrystallization without flash column chromatography.

The present method highlights broad substrate scope of easily available starting materials, wide range of functional group compatibility, gram scalable preparations, high atom economy, avoidance of unstable and explosive azolation reagents, and simple purification operations by extraction, washing, and recrystallization without flash column chromatography.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formal Insertion of a Metal Carbene Complex into a &#963;&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Carbon bond. Gold&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of 3H&#8208;indoles</title>

Abstract
We report here a formal insertion of a metal carbene complex in a single carbon&#8208;carbon bond. This behavior occurs with the participation of an &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene complex, generated from benzofused triazapentalenes or, in a one&#8208;pot procedure, from their 1&#8208;propargyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzotriazole precursors, and gold&#8208;catalytically activated ynamides. As the result, 3H&#8208;indole derivatives were obtained, with formation of a quaternary center. A computational analysis carried out on the reaction mechanism indicates that the bulkiness of the gold ligand plays a key role forcing a conformation, which includes aromatic interactions, that favors the approximation of the carbenic carbon to the reactive site. In addition, a negative crossover experiment rules out a cationic arene migration pathway.

         <title>Tetrafluoropyridinyl Thiolate as a Tool for Enabling Photoredox Alkylation of 1,2,4&#8208;Oxadiazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A method for the radical functionalization of 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazoles using alkyl halides as precursors of radicals is described. The reaction efficiency is determined by potassium tetrafluoropyridinyl thiolate additive, which plays dual role. First, the thiolate converts alkyl halides into more reactive fluorinated aryl sulfides, which undergo photoredox activation of the C&#8722;S bond. Second, the thiolate decreases the unproductive loss of alkyl radicals by converting them back to the sulfides.

         <title>Electrochemical Site&#8208;Selective Alkylation of Tropones via Formal C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The first site&#8208;selective electrochemical alkylation of tropones is realized by reacting 2&#8208;acetoxytropones and redox&#8208;active&#8208;esters (RAEs). The electroreductive protocol enables the preparation of mono&#8208; and disubstituted tropones in high yields (up to 71%) under very mild conditions. Dedicated voltammetric measurements served for the identification of 2&#8208;acetoxytropones as a class of valuable trapping agents of nucleophilic radical species and shed light on the whole mechanistic profile. Wide tolerance towards functional groups (27 examples) and application to late&#8208;stage functionalization of a bioactive compound (i.&#8201;e. Colchicine analogue), emphasize the synthetic impact of the present methodology.

         <title>Cascade Cyclization/Amination of para&#8208;Quinone Methides with &#946;&#8208;Ketodinitriles: Synthesis of Polysubstituted Furans</title>

Abstract
A protocol for the synthesis of trisubstituted furans via phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed regioselective cascade cyclization/amination of para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) with &#946;&#8208;ketodinitriles has been disclosed for the first time. Various kinds of p&#8208;QMs and &#946;&#8208;ketodinitriles can effectively produce the desired polysubstituted furan derivatives in 64&#8211;95% yields, demonstrating high atomic economy and their application in the construction of polysubstituted furan heterocycles. Preliminary biological activity assay suggests that these furans have potential anticancer activities.

         <title>Ruppert&#8208;Prakash Reagent (TMSCF3)&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Esterification of Weinreb Amides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A straightforward TMSCF3&#8208;catalyzed conversion of Weinreb amides into esters through the treatment with sodium alkoxides is reported. The procedure documents a genuine selectivity for the esterification of primary alcohols with Weinreb amides featuring diverse substitution pattern. The constitutive N&#8208;methoxy fragment of these acylating agents is responsible for the unique reactivity they display, thus enabling to explore alkoxides as competent nucleophilic elements. The protocol is compatible with the fully transfer of stereochemical information embodied in the starting material, as well as, guarantees the preparation of pharmaceuticals. Mechanistic investigations revealed that under the adopted reaction conditions (NaOR, R primary) TMSCF3 does not release the trifluoromethyl (CF3&#8722;) anion &#8211; as occurs with tertiary alkoxides &#8211; but rather it catalytically activates the amidic bond.

         <title>Synthesis of Quinine&#8208;Inspired Antimalarials by Ni&#8208;Catalysed Cross Electrophile Coupling</title>

Abstract
We describe the efficient synthesis of novel dehydroxyquinines by arylation of quincorine bromide using Ni&#8208;catalysed cross electrophile coupling. The method demonstrates robust compatibility with (hetero)aryl bromides bearing diverse functional groups. Oxidation at C&#8208;9 of the dehydroxyquinines expediently provided quinine&#8208;inspired pseudo&#8208;natural products (&#8216;quinalogs&#8217;). Investigation of the compound collection against Plasmodium falciparum revealed a new insight into the structure activity relationship of quinine. Analogs bearing specifically functionalised pyridines, in place of the 6&#8208;methoxyquinoline ring of quinine, retained activity at the same order of magnitude, albeit not exceeding the activity of the natural product. This synthetic strategy conveniently enables iteration of the aromatic component of quinine for the first time, and holds promise for the development of effective new antimalarials.

Abstract
The synthesis of chiral succinimides bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters at the C3 position is important, but remains challenging. The present work demonstrates conjugate additions with catalysis by a chiral 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;Pd complex (L1&#8208;PdCl2) that exhibit complete regioselectivity with a high degree of enantioselectivity. These reactions afford chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted succinimides having all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters with 40&#8211;99% ee. Importantly, chiral 3,3&#8208;diaryl succinimides could also be obtained in 35&#8211;98% yields and 40&#8211;99% ee. Moreover, the present L1&#8208;PdCl2&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition could be performed on the gram scale and was also used to introduce such stereocenters into bioactive molecules.

Abstract
2&#8208;Exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones are useful synthetic intermediates with a unique indole scaffold. However, their synthesis has not yet been reported owing to their reactivity and instability. In this study, a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed method for generating 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivatives via the 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#8208;selective cyclization of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;amino)phenyl alkynyl ketones with an alkyne terminus was developed. The subsequent pseudo&#8208;dimerization of the generated 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones and their [4+2] cyclization reactions with 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes afforded spiropseudoindoxyl and pyranoindole derivatives, respectively, in 21% to quantitative yields. Density functional theory calculations of the gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization provided insights into the 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig selectivity. Furthermore, the reactive 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one was isolated for the first time based on the results from 1H NMR spectroscopic monitoring. The isolated product was applied to various transformations. Our synthesis method promotes the development of bioactive agents and functional materials with complex cyclic structures.

&lt;p&gt;2-Exomethylene indolin-3-ones are useful synthetic intermediates with a unique indole scaffold. However, their synthesis has not yet been reported owing to their reactivity and instability. In this study, a gold(I)-catalyzed method for generating 2-exomethylene indolin-3-one derivatives &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; the 5-&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;dig&lt;/i&gt;-selective cyclization of 2-(2-amino)phenyl alkynyl ketones with an alkyne terminus was developed.

         <dc:description>An iodine/DMSO&#8208;promoted metal&#8208;free approach has been developed for the synthesis of indoloquinolines via a sequential sp3 C&#8208;H oxidation/intramolecular cyclization using 2&#8208;(1H&#8208;indol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)anilines and aryl methyl ketones. A wide range of aryl methyl ketones, including drugs and complex bioactive molecule&#8208;derived substrates were compatible in the present reaction with yields in the range of 30&#8208;96%. This protocol proceeds through sp3 C&#8208;H oxidation of aryl methyl ketones to phenylglyoxals, subsequent imine formation, and cyclization to furnish the indoloquinolines. Further, the reaction is applicable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis and is operationally simple.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction, involving cyanoalkylsulfonylation and cyclization, has been devised to enable the synthesis of functionalized sulfonylated quinolino&#8208;quinazolinone alkyl nitriles. This three&#8208;component radical transformation exhibits excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity while functioning without the need for external oxidizing or reducing agents. The cost&#8208;effectiveness of this catalytic system, together with its broad substrate application, which includes drug molecule derivatives, make this approach efficient and adaptable.</dc:description>
