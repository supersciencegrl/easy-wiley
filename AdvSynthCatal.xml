      <dc:description>An unprecedented copper&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and stereoselective hydrodifluoroallylation of terminal alkynes was disclosed. This reaction employs easily available 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3&#8208;difluoropropene (BDFP) as the difluoroallylating reagent and 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDSO) as the hydride source, affording a variety of (E)&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;dienes in moderate to good yields. The synthetic utility of this protocol has been demonstrated through the transformation of resulting (E)&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;diene to difluoromethylated and trifluoromethylated derivatives.</dc:description>

      <title>HFIP&#8208;Mediated Decarboxylative [4+3]&#8208;Annulation of Azaoxyallyl Cations with Isatoic Anhydride</title>
      <dc:description>The first example of a [4+3]&#8208;annulation reaction between in situ&#8208;generated azaoxyallyl cations and isatoic anhydride has been developed for the construction of seven&#8208;membered 1,4&#8208;benzodiazepinediones in moderate to good yields (up to 91% yield). This annulation reaction involves the cascade reaction of decarboxylative addition of hexafluoroisopropanol to isatoic anhydride, addition to the azaoxyallyl cation, and intramolecular substitution to yield 1,4&#8208;benzodiazepinediones.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The first example of a [4+3]&#8208;annulation reaction between in situ&#8208;generated azaoxyallyl cations and isatoic anhydride has been developed for the construction of seven&#8208;membered 1,4&#8208;benzodiazepinediones in moderate to good yields (up to 91% yield). This annulation reaction involves the cascade reaction of decarboxylative addition of hexafluoroisopropanol to isatoic anhydride, addition to the azaoxyallyl cation, and intramolecular substitution to yield 1,4&#8208;benzodiazepinediones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Advances in the Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Atropisomeric Hexatomic N&#8208;Heterobiaryls</title>
      <dc:description>Axially chiral hexatomic N&#8208;heterobiaryls are among the most important class of structures with extensive utility in asymmetric catalysis as chiral ligands and organocatalysts, as exemplified by QUINAP and QUINOX. Besides, these atropisomers have attracted broad attention due to their application in drug discovery. Hence, it is not surprising that extensive efforts have been devoted for the pursue of efficient catalytic asymmetric methods for their direct and atroposelective construction. In addition to the direct heteroaryl&#8208;aryl cross&#8208;coupling, which remains as a challenge, a series of creative catalytic asymmetric strategies based on pre&#8208;formed heterobiaryl systems have been developed by taking advantage of the intrinstic property of N atom on the heteroarenes. Generally, the methods employed extensively involved kinetic resolution, dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation, dynamic kinetic resolution and desymmetrization reaction. A growing number of approaches through stereoselective de novo formation of a six&#8208;membered
N&#8208;heteroaromatic ring have also been reported for specific applications in this field. This review summarizes recent advancements of axially chiral hexatomic N&#8208;heterobiaryls construction by means of asymmetric catalysis, including their scope, limitations, mechanisms and applications.

      <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Alkyne Functionalization by N&#8208;O/S&#8208;O/C&#8208;O Bond Oxidants</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract: Since the beginning of this century, homogeneous gold&#8208;catalyzed alkyne transformations have been an active area of research in pursuit of developing novel and efficient synthetic methodologies. This emerging area of research which at the beginning exploited the mild Lewis acid character of gold and its propensity to form &#960;&#8208;complex with alkyne, has been reinvigorated upon the discovery of gold&#8208;catalyzed oxidative alkyne functionalization in 2007. The gold&#8208;catalyzed alkyne oxidation enabled direct access to &#945;&#8208;oxo gold carbenes and gold alkynal complex with versatile reactivity which has been applied to achieve novel transformations including but not limited to oxyarylation, C&#8722;H, X&#8722;H (X = N, O) insertion, cyclization, cycloaddition, ring expansion, and various novel cascade reaction. This review provides a comprehensive summary of methods, applications and mechanistic insight of gold&#8208;catalyzed oxidative alkyne functionalization by N&#8722;O/S&#8722;O/C&#8722;O bond oxidants covering the literature reports appeared since 2007.</dc:description>

      <title>Double Carbonylation Reactions: Overview and Recent Advances</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. The compounds like amides, carbamates, oxamates, oxamides, &#945;&#8208;keto amides, diketones, esters, ureas, etc. find extensive applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and organic synthesis. The classical syntheses of these compounds often involve cumbersome routes involving toxic chemicals. The carbonylation reactions such as aminocarbonylation, alkoxycarbonylation, oxidative carbonylation and double carbonylation deliver as an efficient and attractive alternative to the conventional synthetic routes even at industrial scale. The catalytic single carbonylation reactions are extensively studied, however, catalytic double carbonylation reactions are not explored for several potential applications. This review covers literature on the use of different types of catalysts involving various	metals like Pd, Cu, Fe, Co, Rh and Ni for double carbonylation reactions along with the chemistry of associated ligands. It also covers double carbonylation used for synthesis of different types of novel substrates with the discussion related to mechanism of formations of mono and di carbonylation products. The notable introduction of several CO&#8208;surrogates and exploration of their efficiency have solved the problems related to the toxicity of CO.  CO&#8208;surrogates used for double carbonylation reactions are also discussed.</dc:description>

      <title>Preparative&#8208;Scale Production of Testosterone Metabolites by Human Liver Cytochrome P450 3A4</title>
      <dc:description>Just like the drugs themselves, their metabolites have to be evaluated to succeed in a drug development and approval process. It is therefore essential to be able to predict drug metabolism and to synthesise sufficient metabolite quantities for further pharmacological testing. This study evaluates the possibility of using in vitro biotransformations to solve both these challenges in the case of testosterone as a representative component for steroids. The application of cells of Pichia pastoris with expressed membrane&#8208;associated human liver cytochrome P450 enzyme (P450) 3A4 in two cycles of a preparative&#8208;scale bioreactor experiment enabled the isolation of the common metabolites 6&#946;&#8208;hydroxytestosterone and 6&#946;&#8208;hydroxyandrostenedione on a 100 mg scale. Side&#8208;product formation caused by enzymes intrinsic to P. pastoris was reduced. In addition more polar testosterone metabolites formed by a P450 3A4&#8208;catalysed bioconversion, than the known mono&#8208;hydroxylated ones, are reported and 6&#8208;dehydro&#8208;15&#946;&#8208;hydroxytestosterone as well as the di&#8208;hydroxylated steroids 6&#946;,16&#946;&#8208;dihydroxytestosterone, 6&#946;,17&#946;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;androstene&#8208;3,16&#8208;dione and 6&#946;,12&#946;&#8208;dihydroxyandrostenedione were isolated and verified by NMR analysis.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Just like the drugs themselves, their metabolites have to be evaluated to succeed in a drug development and approval process. It is therefore essential to be able to predict drug metabolism and to synthesise sufficient metabolite quantities for further pharmacological testing. This study evaluates the possibility of using in vitro biotransformations to solve both these challenges in the case of testosterone as a representative component for steroids. The application of cells of Pichia pastoris with expressed membrane&#8208;associated human liver cytochrome P450 enzyme (P450) 3A4 in two cycles of a preparative&#8208;scale bioreactor experiment enabled the isolation of the common metabolites 6&#946;&#8208;hydroxytestosterone and 6&#946;&#8208;hydroxyandrostenedione on a 100 mg scale.

      <title>Recent Progress in the Construction of C&#8722;N Bonds via Metal&#8208;Free Radical C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds widely exist in pharmaceuticals and multifunctional materials. Thus, the development of C&#8722;N bond formation reactions is of great importance in synthetic chemistry. Since 2014, obvious progress has been made in the construction of C&#8722;N bonds via metal&#8208;free radical C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization, which is one of the major protocols due to its high reaction activity and mild conditions. To the best of our knowledge, there are still no exclusive reviews about the formation of C&#8722;N bonds through metal&#8208;free radical C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. This review aims to highlight the recent advances in this area since 2014, according to the type of the nitrogen source (amines, amides, sulfonamides, azoles, azides and other nitrogen sources). The paper is focused on discussions about the reaction mechanisms and selected examples of substrates have also been listed.

      <title>Phosphoramidates as Transient Precursors of Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Radical Under Visible Light Irradiation</title>
      <dc:description>
Phosphoramidates and especially phosphonohydrazones were, for the first time, used as efficient N&#8208;Centered Radical (NCR) precursors under visible light irradiation. Mechanistic investigations confirmed the formation of an N&#8208;radical from these brand new derivatives, which was able to be engaged in an intramolecular 6&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization to provide phthalazines. Compared to previous pre&#8208;activated moieties, the phosphoramidate group is self&#8208;immolative, thus enhancing its attractiveness for the C&#8722;N bond formation.

Abstract
The enantioselective synthesis of chiral azaarenes by rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of organoboronic acids to carbonyl&#8208;activated alkenyl azaarenes was reported. Diverse chiral azaarenes were produced in up to 99% yield and with up to 99% ee (&gt;60 examples). Catalytic asymmetric syntheses of dexchlorpheniramine and dexbrompheniramine were realized by using the developed method.

      <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Cyanoalkylative Aziridination of N&#8208;Sulfonyl Allylamines</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Reaction of N&#8208;arylsulfonyl allylamines with alkyl nitriles in the presence of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide (DTBP) and a catalytic amount of copper salt afforded homologated aziridines in 43&#8211;86% yield. A sequence involving addition of the in&#8197;situ generated cyanomethyl radical to the double bond followed by a copper&#8208;mediated intramolecular C&#8722;N bond formation accounted for the reaction outcome. 2,3&#8208;Disubstituted allylamines were converted to trisubstituted aziridines in a stereoselective manner. Starting from enantioenriched allylamines, chiral aziridines were obtained diastereoselectively.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaction of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;arylsulfonyl allylamines with alkyl nitriles in the presence of di&#8208;&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;butyl peroxide (DTBP) and a catalytic amount of copper salt afforded homologated aziridines in 43&#8211;86% yield. A sequence involving addition of the in&#8197;situ generated cyanomethyl radical to the double bond followed by a copper&#8208;mediated intramolecular C&#8722;N bond formation accounted for the reaction outcome. 2,3&#8208;Disubstituted allylamines were converted to trisubstituted aziridines in a stereoselective manner. Starting from enantioenriched allylamines, chiral aziridines were obtained diastereoselectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      <dc:description>Metallocene catalysis is widely used in transformations of unsaturated organic compounds, including the bulk industrial synthesis of polyolefins. Over the last few decades, the electronic and structural properties of their &#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;coordinated ligands have been modified by introducing electron&#8208;donating, electron&#8208;withdrawing, and sterically hindered substituents to obtain desirable catalytic properties for the metallocenes.

      <title>Hydrosilylation of Aldehydes and Ketones Catalyzed by Bis(phosphinite) Pincer Platinum Hydride Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Bis(phosphinite) pincer platinum hydride complexes, [2,6&#8208;(R2PO)2C6H3]PtH (R = tBu, 1; iPr, 2), were synthesized, characterized and applied to the hydrosilylation of aldehydes and ketones. NMR study and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicated that the hydrides in these two platinum complexes are comparatively less hydridic: down&#8208;field 1H NMR resonances (0.71 and 0.98 ppm) and weak Pt&#8208;H interactions were observed. Both the platinum complexes were found to be good catalysts for the hydrosilylation of aldehydes and ketones with phenylsilane. The corresponding alcohols were isolated in good to excellent yields following basic hydrolysis of the resultant hydrosilylation products and turnover frequencies (TOFs) up to 3200 h&#8208;1 were achieved at 60&#730;C in toluene, which are much higher than those of the hydrosilylation catalysed by the corresponding nickel pincer hydride complexes.

      <title>Radical C&#8722;C Bond Formation using Sulfonium Salts and Light</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Sulfonium salts are playing an increasingly significant role in contemporary organic synthesis. In particular, the generation of radicals from sulfonium salts is a fundamental process in Nature and has been the subject of investigation for over 50&#8197;years. However, general synthetic methods that use sulfonium salts as radical precursors are rare. The advent of photoredox catalysis has triggered an upsurge of interest in the radical chemistry of sulfonium salts and this review surveys recent applications of aryl&#8208; and alkylsulfonium salts in light&#8208;mediated, radical C&#8722;C bond formation.

Abstract
In this study, a radical&#8208;triggered cyclization of o&#8208;alkenyl aromatic isocyanides prepared from accessible starting materials is developed. The reaction provides a general and efficient method for the synthesis of 4&#8208;CN&#8208;2&#8208;CF3/CF2H&#8208;containing quinolines under copper or visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis in a one&#8208;pot synthetic procedure. This protocol demonstrates good to high yields, broad substrate scope, and good functional group tolerance.
