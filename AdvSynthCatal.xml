         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Reductive Coupling of Cyclobutenes and Aldimines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol for highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling of unactivated cyclobutenes and aldimines promoted by a readily available cobalt&#8208;based catalyst was developed. The process represents the first instance of enantioselective reactions of cyclobutenes with aldimines through oxidative cyclization pathway, enabling introduction of an amino&#8208;containing chiral fragment onto cyclobutanes.

A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed protocol for diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling of unactivated cyclobutenes and aldimines through oxidative cyclization promoted by a chiral bisphosphine&#8211;cobalt is presented. Such processes represent an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis that enable umpolung reactivity of cyclobutenes with imines and incorporation of a chiral amino&#8208;containing fragment onto the four&#8208;membered ring scaffold, delivering a broad scope of enantioenriched cyclobutyl amines in up to 98% yield and&#8201;&gt;99.5:0.5 er as a single diastereomer. Functionalization provided a variety of densely functionalized cyclobutanes that are otherwise difficult to access. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that the reaction proceeded through diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective oxidative cyclization followed by protonation. Density functional theory calculations elucidated the origin of stereoselectivity in detail.

         <title>Organic Halogenation of Alkynes with Inorganic Halides Using Perylenediimide as Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unveils the direct generation of chlorine radicals from sodium chloride under visible&#8208;light perylenediimide photocatalysis. Coupled with N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide as radical cargo, this strategy channels the elusive Cl&#8226; into efficient oxydihalogenation of alkynes.

Harnessing chlorine radicals (Cl&#8226;) for selective organic transformations has remained challenging due to their extreme reactivity and dependence on unstable chlorine precursors. Here, we present a visible&#8208;light strategy that directly generates Cl&#8226; from sodium chloride (NaCl), an abundant, benign, and previously inaccessible chlorine source. Using perylenediimide (PDI) as a sustainable, metal&#8208;free photocatalyst and N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) as a radical cargo, chloride anions were oxidized to Cl&#8226;, which drove efficient oxydihalogenation of terminal and internal alkynes. This approach could overcome long&#8208;standing solubility and redox barriers, affording gem&#8208;dihaloketones in high yields. Mechanistic studies confirmed radical intermediacy and revealed the unprecedented role of NaCl as a chlorine radical progenitor. This work establishes inorganic halide salts as renewable radical precursors and provides a sustainable platform for green halogenation chemistry.

         <title>Synergistic Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution of NiCeOx Bimetallic Oxide Nanosheets and Cadmium Sulfide Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By forming a S&#8208;scheme heterojunction with cadmium sulfide nanorods and simultaneously generating an internal electric field to enhance surface carrier separation, the photocatalytic efficiency is significantly improved.

To address the rapid photogenerated carrier recombination issue that limits the efficiency of photocatalytic applications in semiconductors, this article presents for the first time the application of NiCeOx bimetallic oxides synthesized by the hydrothermal method in photocatalytic hydrogen production. By forming an S&#8208;shaped heterojunction with cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanorods, an internal electric field is simultaneously generated to enhance the efficiency of surface carrier separation. Experimental findings reveal that the hydrogen evolution rate for NiCeOx/CdS achieves 8604.78&#8201;&#956;molg&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. This result indicates that the establishment of this unique heterojunction facilitates more effective electron movement from NiCeOx to CdS, leading to accelerated charge separation and transfer processes. Both experiments and theoretical calculations have jointly demonstrated that the composite material enhances the hydrogen production rate through photocatalysis and have also revealed the charge transfer mechanism of the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction. This research provides a promising strategy for utilizing novel bimetallic oxide within the domain of photocatalysis and realizing directed electron migration in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalyzed Selective Synthesis of 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;Dithianes From Thietanes: An Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 24, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although this article formally presents a regioselective photochemical ring enlargement of thietanes into 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;dithianes, time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations have revealed that 1,3&#8208;dithianes are in fact formed thought photoinduced hydrogen atom transfers from 1,2&#8208;dithianes initially resulting from the ring enlargement using thioaldehyde substrates.

Unlike other sulfur&#8208;containing heterocycles, the potential applications of functionalized dithianes have been less explored to date due to their challenging synthesis. To address this issue, we herein leverage the straightforward access to functionalized thietanes and describe a selective photochemical ring enlargement of the latter to 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;dithianes using thiocarbonyl substrates, which are in&#8201;situ generated via a Norrish&#8208;type II fragmentation reaction. The library of dithianes obtained by this photocatalyzed domino sequence between diversely substituted thietanes and various thiocarbonyls revealed regioselectivity rules: excited thioketones lead exclusively to 1,2&#8208;dithianes, while excited thioaldehydes selectively yield 1,3&#8208;dithianes, where 1,2&#8208;dithianes serve as precursors to their regioisomers. The ring expansion reaction leading to 1,2&#8208;dithianes was also integrated into a triple photochemical cascade, where the thietane intermediates were obtained via a thia&#8208;Patern&#242;_B&#252;chi reaction between Norrish&#8208;II thiocarbonyl products and various alkene partners. These experimental results were complemented with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations, which support the complex chemical pathway, rationalize the observed regioselectivity, and further substantiate mechanistic proposals related to the photolysis of disulfide bridges in peptides.

         <title>Synthesis of an Amphiphilic Polymer With Adjustable Surface Charge and Polarity and its Use for Obtaining Water&#8208;Soluble Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 24, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straighforward encapsulation approach for hydrophobic nanomaterials is presented, that allows tuning of the surface charge and stable dispersion in water.

Amphiphilic copolymers can be effectively used to encapsulate a broad range of nanomaterials. Since the surface charge and charge distribution can strongly affect relevant effects like protein adsorption, effective routes are required to tune it. Herein, a straightforward strategy is presented to tune the formal charge of poly (isobutylene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride), converting it into an amphiphilic polymer with negative charge, zwitterionic character, or positive charge. This is a route of surface modification in which impact on other colloidal parameters apart for surface charge is minimized. The encapsulation of quantum dots are tested with the resulting polymers and confirm their robust stabilization over a range of pH values and ionic strengths.

         <dc:description>
A catalyst&#8208; and transition metal&#8208;free strategy enabling the photoinduced coupling between N&#8208;tosylhydrazones and (thio)phenols under mild conditions has been developed. This methodology demonstrates broad substrate scope and features rapid reaction kinetics. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale synthesis and the generation of pharmaceutical intermediates highlight its practical utility. 

The formation of the C&#63743;O/S bonds is of great importance in the synthesis of biologically active molecules and functional materials. Herein, a catalyst&#8208; and transition metal&#8208;free approach enabling the coupling between N&#8208;tosylhydrazones and (thio)phenols under photoinduced conditions is presented. This strategy exhibits a broad scope of substrates including various N&#8208;tosylhydrazones and (thio)phenols, thus demonstrating the feasibility of this concept for C&#63743;O/S bond formation. Unlike the traditional metal&#8208;catalyzed version, the present reaction offers&#160;the advantages of high reaction speed, permitting the preparation of products within just one hour at room temperature. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of thioethers and the generation of pharmaceutical intermediates highlight its practical applicability.

         <title>Halogen Atom Transfer Enabled Radical Fluoroalkyl&#8208;Thiolation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 24, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an aryl radical&#8208;induced three&#8208;component fluoroalkyl&#8208;thiolation of unactivated olefins is reported through halogen atom transfer process, enabling rapid simultaneous construction of C(sp3)&#63743;Rf and C(sp3)&#63743;S bonds with high regioselectivity. Similarly, direct thiolation of fluoroalkyl iodides in the absence of alkenes affords the fluoroalkylthioethers.

A halogen atom transfer&#8208;enabled radical fluoroalkyl&#8208;thiolation of unactivated alkenes is developed employing fluoroalkyl iodides, TMEDA&#8208;ligated zinc thiolates. Notably, the aryldiazonium salts are utilized as the promoter in the three&#8208;component reaction, providing a powerful tool for simultaneous construction of C&#63743;Rf and C&#63743;S bonds across the C&#63742;C bond. Moreover, direct thiolation of fluoroalkyl iodides without alkene gives the two&#8208;component reaction products. Mechanistic studies support that the interaction between diazonium salt and zinc thiolate plays a crucial role in the transformations.

         <title>Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 24, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two structurally analogous COF photocatalysts of TP&#8208;DADB COF and TP&#8208;TFMB COF with incorporating &#63743;CF3 in the latter is constructed. The introduction of &#63743;CF3 promotes the separation of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs and improves the band structure to enable simultaneous oxygen reduction and water oxidization reactions to produce H2O2. Thereby, TP&#8208;TFMB COF exhibits a 16&#8208;times higher H2O2 production rate than TP&#8208;DADB COF.

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising photocatalysts for the photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, the photocatalytic activity over COFs in pure water is limited due to poor carrier dynamics as well as sluggish oxygen reduction and water oxidation reactions. Herein, two &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COF photocatalysts is designed via solvothermal Schiff&#8208;base condensation: TP&#8208;TFMB COF (with the trifluoromethyl group modification) and TP&#8208;DADB COF (pristine COF). In pure water, TP&#8208;TFMB COF delivers an excellent H2O2 production with a yield rate of 3.83 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 (16 folds higher than that of TP&#8208;DADB COF) under visible&#8208;light irradiation. As demonstrated by experimental results, the superior photocatalytic performance of TP&#8208;TFMB COF stems from the introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing &#63743;CF3 groups, which simultaneously improve charge separation and promoted &#8226;O2&#8722; generation in oxygen reduction as well as critically boost water oxidation. This work provides the insight into the effect of the electron&#8208;withdrawing group on photocatalytic activity for H2O2 generation over COFs and may enlighten the design of catalysts for H2O2 photosynthesis.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Neutral Organophotocatalytic Cascade: Difluoromethylation and Radical Truce&#8211;Smiles&#8208;Driven C(sp3)&#8211;H Functionalization to Access Benzothiazine Dioxides and Oxindoles</title>

         <dc:description>
This study presents a redox&#8208;neutral organophotocatalytic cascade for difluoromethylation and cyclization, enabling the efficient synthesis of benzothiazine dioxides. Concurrently, a radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement driven by 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) achieves C(sp&#179;)&#8211;H functionalization to furnish oxindoles. The developed metal&#8208;free protocol provides a mild, sustainable, and broadly applicable route to structurally diverse heterocycles with high efficiency.

A new photochemical approach has been developed that enables the simultaneous difluoromethylation and radical cascade cyclization of alkenes, providing rapid and efficient access to structurally intricate 1,2&#8208;benzothiazine dioxide derivatives. Importantly, strategic substrate modification expands the utility of this platform to an unprecedented distal &#8216;Radical Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement&#8217; enabled by a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. This C(sp3)&#8211;H activation pathway overcomes conventional proximity constraints, allowing for the streamlined synthesis of valuable oxindole frameworks with high selectivity. The organophotocatalyst 4DPNIPN catalyzes the transformation and proceeds via a radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism initiated through oxidative luminescence quenching. Remarkably, the reaction operates under redox&#8208;neutral conditions, eliminating the need for transition metals, stoichiometric oxidants, or external additives. This sustainable protocol exhibits broad functional group compatibility, operational simplicity, and scalability.

         <title>A Mild and Efficient Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Method for Aldimine Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 24, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, efficient, and broadly applicable iridium&#8208;catalyzed method for aldimine hydrogenation, facilitating access to an array of corresponding amine products in high isolated yields is reported.

This research presents a new mild photocatalytic method enables C&#8208;4 alkylation of chroman&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives with primary alkyl radicals. This radicals are generated via oxidative PCET process. Developed approach offers broad substrate scope, scalability under photo&#8208;flow conditions, and mechanistic evidence supports a decarboxylation pathway under polar conditions.

Chroman&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives are biologically relevant structures that present interesting pharmacological and biological properties, being the C&#8208;4 alkylated derivatives of particular interest. The methods described in the literature allow the C&#8208;4 functionalization of coumarins with secondary and tertiary alkyl radicals, as well as aryl radicals produced under reductive photocatalytic conditions. Herein, we present a method that allows the introduction of primary alkyl radicals prepared through the oxidative&#8208;PCET ring opening of cycloalkanols under very mild reaction conditions. The method presents a broad scope and can be carried out on a large scale under photo&#8208;flow conditions. Moreover, mechanistic investigations allow the corroboration of decarboxylation under polar conditions.

This article reports an electrosynthetic method for vicinal trifluoromethylchlorosulfonylation of alkenes using [Cu(MeCN)4]PF6 and triethylamine, without elaborate ligands. The reaction efficiently adds CF3 and SO2Cl across diverse unactivated alkenes with broad functional group tolerance. The resulting sulfonyl chlorides are versatile intermediates, and mechanistic studies support a Cu&#8208;mediated, electrochemically driven SO2Cl radical transfer pathway.

This article describes an electrosynthetic method for vicinal trifluoromethylchlorosulfonylation of alkenes using the readily available copper salt [Cu(MeCN)4]PF6 and triethylamine, without the need for elaborate ligands. This protocol enables efficient and selective addition of CF3 and SO2Cl groups across a wide range of unactivated alkenes with broad functional group tolerance, including pyrrole, furan, thiophene, thioethyl, and silyl substituents. The sulfonyl chloride products can be readily transformed into sulfonamides, sulfonates, sulfonyl fluorides, and thiosulfonates. Mechanistic studies provide evidence in support of an electrochemically driven, Cu&#8208;mediated SO2Cl radical transfer mechanism.

         <title>Merging Single&#8208;Electron Transfer and Strecker Degradation to Access Densely Substituted Pyridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 24, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work represents the first example of a [4 + 2] annulation of methyl ketoxime acetates to afford polysubstituted pyridine derivatives. This strategy activates all three substrates, generating imine anions and two different aldehydes through the merging of single electron transfer and Strecker degradation. Mechanism studies reveal that the key &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketimine intermediates, generated in situ from ketoxime acetates and phenylglycine, prevent the homo&#8208; and cross&#8208;merization of two distinct &#945;&#8208;amino acids. Additionally, these intermediates are indispensable for shifting the reaction pathway from [3 + 3] to [4 + 2] annulation of ketoxime acetates.

An I2&#8208;mediated three&#8208;component protocol of readily available ketoxime acetates and two structurally distinct &#945;&#8208;amino acids has been developed, merging single&#8208;electron transfer and Strecker degradation to enable the concise synthesis of densely substituted pyridines. The reaction proceeds via an unprecedented [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] annulation, wherein phenylalanines intercept the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines generated in&#8201;situ from ketoxime acetates and phenylglycines. This process features the simultaneous activation of three substrates, and mild reaction conditions, good functional&#8208;group tolerance.

A mild and efficient reductive aldol reaction via dual nickel/photoredox catalysis is developed. Alkyl bromide is used as a mild hydride source and &#945;&#8208;silylamine is used as a robust organic reductant. The reaction exhibits broad substrate scope for both aldehydes and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls, providing an alternative access to a variety of &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl carbonyl compounds.

A dual nickel/photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reductive aldol reaction using readily available alkyl bromide and &#945;&#8208;silylamine as bench&#8208;stable hydride source and organic reductant is reported. A variety of &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl carbonyl compounds can be efficiently synthesized under mild conditions. The reaction exhibits broad substrate scope, accommodating various (hetero)aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes, as well as acyclic and cyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls.

         <title>Photocatalytic Assembly of Structurally Diverse &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Tertiary Amines Using Benign Nitrogen Donors</title>

We developed photocatalytic arylamination and alkylamination of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes using nitriles and oximes as benign nitrogen donors instead of toxic azide reagents, providing a green and mild route to diverse &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl tertiary amines. Only N2 or CO2 are emitted as byproducts. Scalability, broad substrate tolerance and high yields highlight their practicality. The products readily convert to valuable &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl amine derivatives via simple reduction and hydrolysis reaction.

&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl amines are privileged motifs in drug design. Traditional assembly of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl amines relies on harsh conditions and toxic reagents, prompting the demand for milder, atom&#8208;economical methods. While alkene carboamination offers a modular access to diverse amines, the aminative difunctionalization of trifluoromethyl alkenes pose challenges due to facile defluorination. Herein, we report two visible light&#8208;induced protocols for the aminative difunctionalization of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes using benign nitrogen sources&#8212;nitriles and oximes&#8212;instead of prior toxic azides. A photoredox approach leads to the arylamination of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes and radical oxidation, leveraging nitriles to capture benzyl carbocations, while a complementary alkylamination strategy exploits the decarboxylative decomposion of alkyl oxime esters and installs C&#8208; and N&#8208;radicals on the double bond with regiospecificity. These two protocols constitute flexible access to diverse &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl tertiary amines under sustainable conditions. Only N2 or CO2 are emitted as byproducts. Scalability, broad substrate tolerance, and high yields highlight the practicality of this methodology.

This article reports a transition metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free photooxidative azolation of C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds with azoles using CBr4 under 400&#8211;405&#8201;nm irradiation and at room temperature. The amination reaction exhibits broad substrate scope and is applicable to follow&#8208;up transformation of drug molecules.

Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and radical&#8211;polar crossover (RPC) have emerged as a powerful strategy for the C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization of organic molecules. Herein, we disclose a transition metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free photooxidative azolation of C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds with azoles using CBr4. This amination performed at room temperature under 400&#8211;405&#8201;nm irradiation was operationally simple, and tolerated a variety of functional groups. Its utility in synthesis was demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of a drug molecule. CBr4 acted as a HAT agent and oxidant, undergoing photochemical homolysis to promote this cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction.

&#945;&#8208;(Styrylsulfonyl)amides are prepared from &#945;&#8208;bromoamides, SO2, and styrenes in a one&#8208;step photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reaction in the presence of a copper complex. Additionally, related ester analogs could be synthesized following the same procedure. The mechanism of the newly developed method is investigated and model postmodification reactions are carried out.

&#945;&#8208;(Styrylsulfonyl)amides and their related ester analogs are an important class of substances that have been widely used as precursors toward bioactive compounds. While most existing methods for the preparation of related compounds include either multiple steps or the use of precious metals, the method presented in this paper utilizes copper and visible light to produce &#945;&#8208;(styrylsulfonyl)amides and &#945;&#8208;(styrylsulfonyl)esters from &#945;&#8208;bromoamides or esters, SO2 and styrenes in moderate to high yield in a single step. The mechanism of the newly developed method is investigated and likely differs from related methods for the photocatalyzed fixation of SO2 into organic scaffolds.

         <title>P&#8208;Stereogenic Phosphines via Mn(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrophosphination of Vinyl Sulfones: A Case of Solvent&#8208;Induced Stereoinversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 24, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for synthesis of P&#8208;chiral phosphines via manganese&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrophosphination was established. The solvent like iPrOH was found to be able to tune the enantioselectivity of the product, thus providing both enantiomers of P(III)&#8208;stereogenic compounds with a single (Rc, Sp)&#8208;Clarke Mn(I) complex catalyst.

In this work, we report a novel approach for synthesizing P&#8208;chiral phosphines through Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrophosphination of vinyl sulfones. A distinctive feature of this system is its solvent&#8208;dependent stereoinversion, which enables the formation of products with opposite configurations using the same catalyst enantiomer. This phenomenon has been demonstrated across a range of vinyl sulfones and diarylphosphines, providing access to both configurations of P&#8208;stereogenic phosphines with a single catalytic system.

         <title>Ionic Hydrosulfonylation of Alkenes with Sodium Sulfinates for Highly Efficient Synthesis of Benzyl Sulfones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 24, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for the ionic hydrosulfonylation of alkenes lacking electron&#8208;withdrawing groups has been developed. This transformation proceeds smoothly to afford benzyl sulfone products, featuring easy operation, a broad substrate scope, good atomic economy, the use of sodium sulfinates as a safe sulfone source, and water/alcohol as green solvents.

A 1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholene&#8208;catalyzed 1,6&#8208;conjugate reduction of para&#8208;quinone methides and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;vinylcyclohex&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;one is developed.

In the past 10 years, P&#8208;hydrido&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholenes (DAP&#8208;Hs) have been demonstrated to be able to reduce carbonyls, imines, and enones. However, the 1,6&#8208;conjugate reduction transformations catalyzed by DAP&#8208;Hs have been rarely studied. Herein, we developed a DAP&#8208;catalyzed 1,6&#8208;conjugate reduction of p&#8208;QMs with DAP&#8208;Br as the precatalyst. Furthermore, the dienone could also be well tolerated in this transformation.

         <title>Eco&#8208;Friendly and Additive&#8208;Free Synthesis of C&#63743;P Bonds: Synergistic Catalysis by a Polyoxovanadate&#8208;Based Cu&#8211;Organic Framework Using Molecular Oxygen</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel polyoxovanadate&#8208;based copper&#8211;organic framework (Cu&#8208;POV) featuring dual&#8208;active sites was synthesized and used as a heterogeneous catalyst for the additive&#8208;free cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of N&#8208;aryl tetrahydroisoquinolines with diarylphosphine oxides to form C&#63743;P bonds, using molecular oxygen as an oxidant and green ethanol as the solvent, demonstrating excellent catalytic performance, recyclability, and feasibility for gram&#8208;scale reactions.

Development of environmentally benign methods for C&#63743;P bond formation is of great significance due to the extensive applications of organophosphorus compounds in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Herein, we report a polyoxovanadate&#8208;based Cu&#8211;organic framework, [Cu3(pty)2][V8O23]&#183;H2O (Cu&#8208;POV, pty&#8201;= &#8201;4&#8242;&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine), for catalyzing the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of N&#8208;aryl tetrahydroisoquinolines with diarylphosphine oxides to form C&#63743;P bonds using molecular oxygen (O2) as an oxidant in green ethanol medium. The outstanding efficiency of Cu&#8208;POV stems from a synergistic mechanism involving its structural CuII and VV centers: the two activate the N&#8208;aryl tetrahydroisoquinolines through single&#8208;electron transfer and subsequently react with O2 to generate the key superoxide radical species. The catalyst can be recycled at least six times without compromising performance, and applied in gram&#8208;scale reaction with a turnover number of 2025.

         <title>Vinyl and Bromo&#8208;Vinyl Sulfoximine Synthesis via Reactive Sulfonimidoyl Bromide Intermediates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 24, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, catalyst&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot protocol is reported for direct synthesis of vinyl sulfoximines from alkenes, sulfonamides, and thiophenols under oxidative conditions using DBDMH. The intrinsic reactivity of the in&#8201;situ&#8208;generated sulfonimidoyl bromide intermediates eliminates the need for pre&#8208;functionalized halogenated precursors. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory calculations support a radical mechanism. Substituting alkynes for alkenes produces bromo&#8208;vinyl sulfoximines, which are new compounds with high reactivity and structural tunability, offering a versatile C&#8211;Br handle for derivatization and drug development.

Vinyl sulfoximines are valuable scaffolds in drug discovery and chemical biology, but their widespread use is limited by a lack of synthetic methods. Here, a catalyst&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot protocol is presented for the direct synthesis of vinyl sulfoximines from readily available alkenes, thiols, and nitrogen&#8208;containing substrates such as sulfonamides or amides under oxidative conditions using 1,3&#8208;dibromo&#8208;5,5&#8208;dimethylhydantoin. This transformation proceeds via the in&#8201;situ generation of reactive sulfonimidoyl bromide intermediates, which are previously unused versatile synthons that eliminate the need for pre&#8208;functionalized halogenated precursors. Mechanistic investigations and density functional theory calculations provide support for a single&#8208;electron transfer process between sulfonimidoyl bromide and phenylthiolate. Furthermore, using alkynes instead of alkenes allows the first synthesis of bromo&#8208;vinyl sulfoximines, which are reactive and structurally tunable and have a synthetically versatile C&#8211;Br handle, making them promising candidates for drug discovery applications.

Sc(OTf)3 and Ambient Air Promote Radical&#8208;Based Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling Reactions: Reactivity of &#945;&#8208;Enaminone toward Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes</title>

A site&#8208;selective Csp2&#8208;Csp3 cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction is developed for a&#8208;enaminone and donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) in the presence of air and Sc(OTf)3 (30 mol%) through radical pathway, affording tetrahydroquinolinones in good yields with large substrate scope. The utilization of less amount of Sc(OTf)3 (3 mol%) leads to a ring&#8208;opening reaction with good yields and large substrate scope.

A new cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction for tetrahydroquinolinones formation is achieved using &#945;&#8208;enaminones and donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes. Traditional cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions require the presence of a redox&#8208;active metal, and an additional oxidant. This work introduces a new type of catalytic system, which only involves a redox&#8208;inactive rare earth metal and ambient air serving as the oxidant. Mechanistic investigation has revealed a radical pathway for the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative Csp2&#8208;Csp3 coupling reaction and Sc(OTf)3 combined with 3O2 are found to facilitate the critical SET process. When 3 mol% of Sc(OTf)3 is used, &#945;&#8208;enaminone served as nitrogen nucleophile to react with the donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes, resulting in new ring&#8208;opening products. Increasing the catalyst loading to 30 mol%, tetrahydroquinolinones are formed via cross&#8208;dehydrogenative Csp2&#8208;Csp3 coupling reaction. Both reactions give good to excellent yields with broad substrate scopes. Enantiospecific formation of tetrahydroquinolinones is also investigated with high retention of enantiomeric purity (up to 97% ee). The discovery that Sc(OTf)3 and air can promote the formation of &#945;&#8208;enaminone radical and malonic ester radical is unprecedented and is expected to initiate their broad applications in developing novel organic transformations.

In their Research Article (10.1002/adsc.70136), Wolfgang J. Parak and co&#8208;workers show that amphiphilic copolymers with zwitterionic character allow for tuning of the pH&#8208;dependent surface charge of encapsulated nanoparticles while ensuring their colloidal stability, which is relevant for applications in biological systems. A straightforward synthesis approach for such polymers is demonstrated with fluorescent quantum dots as a nanoparticle model system.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 24, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically summarizes recent advances in the synthesis of valuable homoallylic alcohols via photoredox catalysis. We categorize strategies by catalytic method, analyzing substrate scope, mechanisms, and applications in constructing complex targets. The perspective also highlights future challenges and opportunities in this emerging field, underscoring its potential for mild, efficient, and sustainable synthesis. 

The importance of homoallylic alcohols were reflected in the development of remarkable synthetic strategies and the discovery of novel reactivities that enable access to complex molecular targets. Compared to the traditional pathway, the booming single&#8208;electron transfer pathway has demonstrated remarkable potential for the construction of valuable and otherwise difficult to synthesized homoallylic alcohols. Especially, photoredox catalysis has emerged as a alternative and prospective protocol for the synthesis of homoallylic alcohol via radical pathway owing to mild reaction conditions, lower activation energy, eco&#8208;friendly, and excellent compatibility. Thus, this review systematically summarizes the recent important advances in the synthesis of homoallylic alcohols through photoredox catalysis. It categorizes these advancements according to the distinct catalytic methods, providing a concise analysis of substrate scopes, limitations, and mechanistic explores, as well as their applications in the construction of various functionalized molecules, natural products, pharmaceuticals, or bioactive molecules. Furthermore, key challenges and emerging opportunities are highlighted to guide the development of novel strategies and expand their practical applications.

A catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free method for the synthesis of multifunctional oxa&#8208;bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes from &#945;&#8208;diazoketones and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes is presented. Mediated by visible light, the process proceeds under mild conditions via a sequential Wolff rearrangement/[2&#960; + 2&#963;] cycloaddition cascade. The reaction demonstrates broad substrate scope and high regiospecificity. The utility of the products is highlighted through diverse transformations, underscoring their potential in drug discovery.

The development of oxygen&#8208;containing three&#8208;dimensional bicyclic scaffolds as bioisosteres of aromatic rings is of increasing importance for improving physicochemical and pharmacokinetic profiles in modern pharmaceutical development. Herein, we report a catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free strategy to access a series of multifunctional oxa&#8208;bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane derivatives in a single operation from readily accessible &#945;&#8208;diazoketones and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes. The process involves a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated sequential Wolff rearrangement/[2&#960; + 2&#963;] cycloaddition. Generally, this reaction proceeds under mild conditions and features broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and high regiospecificity. The synthetic utility of this method is demonstrated through diverse synthetic transformations of the resulting products. Furthermore, control experiments and mechanistic studies were conducted, and a plausible mechanism is proposed to rationalize the observed efficiency.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining enantioselective catalysis with photocatalysis in flow platforms enables efficient, selective, and scalable transformations. While this merger addresses key limitations of batch protocols, it also introduces new challenges specific to the integration of these methodologies. Recent studies underline both the promise and the need for refined strategies to fully exploit this approach.

The integration of asymmetric catalysis, crucial for the synthesis of structurally complex and enantioenriched target molecules, with photocatalysis, renowned for its atom economy and operational simplicity, offers a synergistic platform with considerable potential. Incorporating this dual strategy into flow systems further enhances the overall efficiency, enabling improved reaction control, scalability, and sustainability. This review provides an overview of recent advancements and discoveries that demonstrate the advantages of this merger, despite its relatively unexplored nature. The advancement of these processes together may uncover new possibilities in catalytic processes.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Enabled Inverse Electron Demand Thermal Decarbonylative Skeletal Expansion: A New Gateway to the Synthesis of Multifunctionalized Quinoline</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have described an efficient AgSbF6&#8208;catalyzed decarbonylative tandem inverse electron&#8208;demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction that proceeds at mild temperatures to produce quinoline derivatives from 2&#8208;(p&#8208;tolyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;one and various internal alkynes. To clarify the function of the Lewis acid, we compared the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps of the complexes formed between the diene and AgSbF6. Density functional theory studies indicate that the reaction strongly favors the inverse electron&#8208;demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder pathway. The generation of carbon monoxide was confirmed by headspace gas chromatography. This strategy offers a convenient one&#8208;pot route to quinoline derivatives with promising applications in drug discovery.

Herein, we have reported an efficient AgSbF6 catalyzed decarbonylative tandem inverse electron demand hetero Diels&#8211;Alder reaction in a very moderate temperature for the construction of quinoline derivatives from 2&#8208;(p&#8208;tolyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;one with a variety of internal alkynes. To understand the role of the Lewis acid in the reaction, highest occupied molecular orbital&#8208;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gaps are compared for the adducts formed between the diene and AgSbF6. A mechanistic investigation, utilizing density functional theory calculations, revealed a clear preference for the inverse electron demand hetero Diels&#8211;Alder reaction pathway. The release of carbon monoxide gas has been detected through headspace gas chromatography analysis. This strategy enables the one pot synthesis of quinoline derivatives which offer substantial potential in drug discovery.

         <title>Electrochemical &#945;&#8208;Selective Chlorination of Indanones with AlCl3/MgCl2</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for the electrochemical chlorination of indanones has been developed using AlCl3 or MgCl2 as the chlorine source and electrolyte. This method can selectively form mono&#8208; or dichlorinated products under mild conditions, and has the advantages of no oxidant and high regioselectivity, providing an efficient and environmental friendly route for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chloroindanone.

We propose an electrochemical regioselective chlorination strategy for the &#945;&#8208;position of indanone. In this strategy, AlCl3 or MgCl2 plays a dual role as both a chlorine source and an electrolyte, allowing for the selective generation of mono&#8208; or dichlorinated products under mild conditions by utilizing AlCl3 or MgCl2 as the chlorine source. This method not only aligns with green chemistry principles but also demonstrates good substrate universality and scalability, providing an efficient and environmentally friendly approach for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chloroindanone.

         <title>Recent Progress in the Moderation Strategies of Bi&#8208;precatalyst Reconstruction for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic electrochemical reconstruction of Bi&#8208;based catalysts during CO2 reduction to formate is a key origin of structural degradation, ultimately undermining long&#8208;term stability and product selectivity. This review provides an overview of recent advances in stabilization strategies that regulate this dynamic reconstruction, which can be broadly classified into three categories: passive suppression, proactive direction, and circumvention strategies. This review aims to construct a rigorous theoretical framework for the rational design and controllable synthesis of advanced Bi&#8208;based catalysts, thereby outlining some potential directions for the future applications.

Bismuth (Bi)&#8208;based materials have emerged as highly promising catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) toward formate production, owing to their high intrinsic catalytic activity and low cost. However, a critical challenge for practical application is the dynamic electrochemical reconstruction of Bi&#8208;based catalysts during CO2RR electrocatalysis, an inherently uncontrollable and indeterminate process that often leads to severe structural degradation of catalysts and a subsequent decay in long&#8208;term stability and selectivity. Herein, this review focuses on the development of stabilization strategies to moderate the dynamic reconstruction of Bi&#8208;based catalysts. In detail, this review systematically analyzes and summarizes three distinct principal strategies: (1) passive suppression strategy, which preserves high&#8208;valent Bi&#948;+ species by suppressing reconstruction; (2) proactive direction strategy, which directs a controllable &#8220;self&#8208;optimization&#8221; reconstruction toward desired active species; and (3) circumvention strategy, which circumvents the complex reconstruction process through direct synthesis and modification of metallic Bi catalysts. This review aims to construct a rigorous theoretical framework for the rational design and controllable synthesis of advanced Bi&#8208;based catalysts, thereby outlining some potential directions for the future industrial applications.

         <title>Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Quinoxalines From &#946;&#8208;Alkyl Nitroolefins and o&#8208;Phenylenediamines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes a copper&#8208;catalyzed cascade synthesis of quinoxalines via allylic C&#63743;H oxidation/cyclocondensation of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted nitroalkenes with o&#8208;phenylenediamines, wherein the diamines function dually as both coupling partners and crucial supporting ligands.

A novel copper&#8208;catalyzed protocol is discovered for the synthesis of quinoxalines through the direct coupling of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted nitroalkenes and o&#8208;phenylenediamines. The cascade transformation proceeds via a mechanistically intriguing pathway involving allylic C&#63743;H bond oxidation followed by cyclocondensation. Remarkably, o&#8208;phenylenediamines are proposed to play a dual role, serving not only as conventional condensation partners but also as essential ligands that facilitate the copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative transformation.

         <title>Thianthrenation&#8208;Enabled Cyanomethylation of (Hetero)Arenes With 2&#8208;Azidoallyl Alcohols via Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complex Photoactivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present here a catalyst&#8208;free approach for the cyanomethylation reaction of thianthrenium salts with 2&#8208;azidoallyl alcohols via electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex photoactivation using DABCO (1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) as the electron donor. A diverse range of (hetero)arylacetonitriles was synthesized in moderate to good yields. The method could be further extended to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules bearing an arene moiety.

A catalyst&#8208;free approach for the cyanomethylation reaction of thianthrenium salts with 2&#8208;azidoallyl alcohols via electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex photoactivation using DABCO as the electron donor is herein described. A diverse range of (hetero)arylacetonitriles was synthesized in moderate to good yields. This approach is compatible with a variety of functional groups and enables late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules bearing an arene moiety. Further synthetic transformations of the products and preliminary mechanistic studies are also presented.

&lt;p&gt;We present here a catalyst-free approach for the cyanomethylation reaction of thianthrenium salts with 2-azidoallyl alcohols via electron donor-acceptor complex photoactivation using DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) as the electron donor. A diverse range of (hetero)arylacetonitriles was synthesized in moderate to good yields. The method could be further extended to the late-stage functionalization of bioactive molecules bearing an arene moiety.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>LMCT Photocatalysis Coupled with Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer (XAT) for Difunctionalizing Alkene Fluoroalkylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a copper LMCT photocatalysis/XAT&#8208;coupled fluoroalkylation of alkenes using bromodifluoroacetic anhydride (BDFAA) and LiCl to form difluorolactones. Essential aspects include solubility&#8208;modulated proximity effect between lithium ion and BDFAA, solvent&#8208;mediated propagative radical relay via HAT/XAT, and thermodynamic control of intermediates, enabling reactivity tuning of radical species for efficient reaction.

Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) photocatalysis, which utilizes simple transition metal salts to enable redox&#8208;potential&#8208;independent conversion of anions into radicals, has recently gained significant interest in organic synthesis. Radical relay, which transforms primary radicals generated via LMCT into secondary radicals through atom transfer, expands the synthetic utility of LMCT photocatalysis. However, the high reactivity of LMCT&#8208;derived radical species strongly limits the reaction modes and applicable substrates. In this study, we successfully couple copper LMCT photocatalysis with halogen atom transfer (XAT) and demonstrate efficient gem&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactone synthesis via difunctionalizing fluoroalkylation of alkenes using bromodifluoroacetic anhydride (BDFAA) and LiCl. Key steps include chlorine radical formation via the LMCT of [CuCl3]Li and bromine atom transfer from BDFAA to generate a fluoroalkyl radical. Although theoretical calculations suggest that chlorine radical addition to alkenes is significantly faster than XAT, the desired yet energetically unfavorable XAT proceeds through solubility&#8208;modulated proximity between the catalyst and BDFAA, as well as a solvent&#8208;mediated radical relay involving hydrogen atom transfer from acetonitrile. This study reveals a novel application of LMCT photocatalysis and proposes a general strategy for tuning radical reactivity through the entire reaction system.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The purpose of this review is to highlight the recent cutting&#8208;edge developments in new domino annulation strategies for synthesizing various carboline derivatives. It emphasizes convenient, multibond forming, and selective domino annulation reactions using easily accessible starting materials, providing novel access to carboline derivatives with broad substrate scope and high efficiency.

Carbolines represent a class of privileged heterocyclic scaffolds that widely exist in natural products, pharmaceutical agents, agrochemicals, and functional materials. Despite their importance, the development of facile and efficient methods for synthesizing carboline derivatives remains a pivotal challenge in modern organic synthesis and heterocyclic chemistry. Domino annulation has evolved as a powerful strategy enabling convenient assembly of diverse heterocyclic molecules. Significant progress has been achieved in this field during recent years. This review highlights the important developments in the novel domino annulations for carboline synthesis since 2019. It aims to provide a valuable resource for organic researchers, offering deeper insights into the reactivity and synthetic potential of these elegant methods. It is also hoped that this review will inspire development of novel domino annulation strategies, thereby expanding the toolbox for N&#8208;heterocycle synthesis.

A remote (4 + 3) cycloadditions of pyrrolidinone&#8208;based Morita&#8722;Baylis&#8722;Hillman carbonates with &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines has been developed. In the presence of PPh3, the reaction could deliver a series of novel and densely substituted fused bicyclic azepines under mild reaction condition in good yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and regioselectivity, along with good substrate applicability.

A mild, synthetically straightforward and selective PPh3&#8208;promoted remote (4&#8201;+&#8201;3) cycloaddition reactions of pyrrolidinone&#8208;based Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines have been first established. This reaction enables the synthesis of a diverse range of synthetically valuable, highly substituted pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;b]azepines bearing three tertiary chiral centers in good yields (up to 87%) with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and diastereoselectivities (all cases&#8201;&gt;25:1 dr). In addition, the synthetic utility of this method was further demonstrated by scale&#8208;up reactions and synthetic transformations of the product. Additionally, molecular docking studies have revealed that the novel fuzed bicyclic privileged structures, which incorporate azepine and pyrrolone motifs, possess potential anticancer activity.

         <title>Revealing the Differences in Enhancing C&#8211;N Coupling Reaction Among Different Types of Semiconductor Catalysts for Electrosynthesis of Urea</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, this study explores the differences in urea synthesis performance by utilizing an n&#8208;type semiconductor catalyst (CeO2) and a p&#8208;type semiconductor catalyst (Co3O4). CeO2 exhibits superior performance in electrocatalytic urea synthesis, achieving a urea yield of 889.4&#8201;&#956;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.45 V versus RHE. These values surpass those of the p&#8208;type semiconductor catalyst Co3O4 (562.2&#8201;&#956;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1). The catalytic performance of CeO2 in urea synthesis was 58.2% higher than Co3O4. Systematic experiments confirm the significant advantage of the n&#8208;type semiconductor catalyst CeO2 in suppressing competing reaction. Its synthesis pathway resembles two racing cars: the &#8220;race track&#8221; of the p&#8208;type semiconductor catalytic system is obstructed by stones, leaving it far behind the performance of the n&#8208;type semiconductor system.

Electrochemical C&#8211;N coupling for urea synthesis reduces greenhouse gas emissions, addressing climate change. Semiconductor catalysts show promise, but how semiconductor type (n&#8208; or p&#8208;) affects C&#8211;N coupling remains unclear. Herein, this study explores the differences in urea synthesis performance by utilizing an n&#8208;type semiconductor catalyst (CeO2) and a p&#8208;type semiconductor catalyst (Co3O4). CeO2 exhibits superior performance in electrocatalytic urea synthesis, achieving a urea yield of 889.4&#8201;&#956;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 18.5% at &#8722;0.45 V versus RHE. These values surpass those of the p&#8208;type semiconductor catalyst Co3O4 (562.2&#8201;&#956;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 and 16.1%, respectively). Electrochemical characterization revealed that CeO2 possesses a significantly greater double&#8208;layer capacitance and a lower charge transfer resistance, as determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, compared to Co3O4, indicating a larger electrochemically active surface area and more facile interfacial charge transfer kinetics. Systematic experiments confirm the significant advantage of the n&#8208;type semiconductor catalyst CeO2 in suppressing competing reaction. In&#8201;situ attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy reveals C&#8211;N bond stretching vibrations at 1458&#8201;cm&#8722;1, confirming C&#8211;N coupling reaction occurs. This study provides deeper mechanistic insights into urea electrosynthesis over semiconductor catalysts and offers guidance for establishing carbon&#8208;cycle&#8208;based economic models.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of 3&#8208;Trifluoroethyl Benzofurans Through Rh&#8208;Catalyzed C&#63743;C Bond Activation Coupled with Transfer Hydrogenation</title>

         <dc:description>
Divergent synthesis of 4&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto&#8208; and 4&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;trifluoroethyl benzofurans has been realized through Rh&#8208;catalyzed atom&#8208;economical skeletal reorganizations of readily accessible trifluoromethyl alkene&#8208;tethered benzocyclobutenols. These transformations proceed via complicated sequences involving C&#63743;C bond activation, migratory insertion, &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination, chain walking, and inter&#8208; or intramolecular transfer hydrogenation.

The strategic incorporation of the pharmacologically privileged trifluoroethyl group into the biologically significant benzofuran scaffold offers considerable potential for medicinal and agrochemical applications. Herein, an atom&#8208;economical synthetic approach to 3&#8208;trifluoroethyl benzofurans through Rh&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of readily available trifluoromethyl alkene&#8208;tethered benzocyclobutenols is reported. This transformation proceeds via a mechanistically intricate sequence involving C&#63743;C bond activation, migratory insertion, &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination, chain walking, and transfer hydrogenation. By modulation of reaction conditions, both intermolecular and intramolecular transfer hydrogenation pathways have been developed, leading to the divergent synthesis of 4&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto&#8208; and 4&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;trifluoroethyl benzofurans.

         <title>Electrochemical Imidoyl Radical&#8208;Involved Functionalization of Isocyanides to Construct Benzotriazole&#8208;Sulfonamide and Guanidine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical synthesis methods are developed for benzotriazole&#8208;benzenesulfonamide derivatives using benzotriazoles, isocyanides, and benzenesulfonamides as substrates, and electrochemical synthesis methods for guanidine derivatives using benzotriazoles and isocyanides as substrates. Both methods require no exogenous chemical oxidants and can be carried out at room temperature.

Benzotriazoles and benzenesulfonamides arewidely present in various bioactive molecules, so the development of mild and convenientsynthetic strategies to synthesize compounds containing these functional groups is crucial for discovering candidate therapeutic drugs with higher efficacy and fewer side effects. Herein, we report an imidoyl radical&#8208;involved electrochemical method for the difunctionalization of isocyanides with benzotriazoles and benzenesulfonamides, and also realize the electrochemical reaction of isocyanides with benzotriazoles to construct guanidine derivatives. This strategy achieves the difunctionalization of isocyanide under the action of a base, with benzotriazole as the radical precursor and sulfonamide as the nucleophile. Either does not require a chemical oxidant and can be carried out at room temperature.

         <title>Harnessing Carbenoid Reactivity From Imidazoles and Oxiranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of azole compounds and oxiranes exhibits carbenoid reactivity at elevated temperatures, as demonstrated by the successful benzoin condensation of aromatic aldehydes. Using this catalytic system to polymerize bifunctional aldehyde/oxirane monomers yields thermosets with glass transition temperatures above 100&#176;C.

The combination of azole compounds, such as 1&#8208;methylimidazole and oxiranes (e.g., phenyl glycidyl ether) gives carbenoid reactivity at elevated temperatures. Benzoin condensation was performed with 5 mol% azole and 10 mol% oxirane under air at temperatures of 70&#176;C and above, achieving conversions of up to 85% of benzaldehyde and yields of up to 64% of benzoin. The lower benzoin yield is due to the formation of oxidative benzoin follow&#8208;up products under these reaction conditions. A variety of combinations of azole compounds and oxiranes have been shown to catalyze benzoin condensation. Thus, a modular, potentially inexpensive method of generating carbenoid reactivity has been revealed. The proposed mechanism for catalyst formation involves oxirane opening by, for example, 1&#8208;methylimidazole, which forms a zwitterionic methylimidazolium adduct with the oxirane. Then, the acidic proton in the 2&#8208;position of the imidazolium core is deprotonated by the zwitterion's alkoxide releasing the corresponding N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC). In addition to its primary function, surplus oxirane serves as a scavenger, removing acidic byproducts that are formed from the aldehyde through oxidative NHC catalysis. This property enables benzoin condensation without the exclusion of oxygen. The practical utility of this catalytic system was demonstrated by polymerizing simple bifunctional aldehyde/oxirane monomers&#8212;namely, 4&#8208;(2&#8208;oxiranylmethoxy)&#8208;benzaldehyde, 3&#8208;(2&#8208;oxiranylmethoxy)&#8208;benzaldehyde, and vanillin&#8208;based 2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8208;oxiranylmethoxy)&#8208;benzaldehyde&#8212;using 5 mol% 1&#8208;methylimidazole in a solventless manner and without excluding air. The monomers polymerized via both the formyl and the oxirane groups, yielded thermosets with glass transition temperatures above 100&#176;C.

         <title>Design and Utilization of Stable Hydrofluoroolefin&#8208;Based Trifluoropropynyl Surrogate for Sonogashira Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel methodology for the construction of aromatic and heteroaromatic trifluoropropynyl derivatives has been developed. The new protocol is based on a tandem Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction between a bench&#8208;stable trifluoropropynyl carbinol reagent, generated from the commercially available and inexpensive hydrofluoroolefin&#8208;1234yf gas, and (hetero)aryl iodides, leading to a wide scope of trifluoromethylated (hetero)arylacetylenes.

The synthesis of aromatic trifluoromethylated scaffolds is of considerable importance in organic chemistry and pharmaceutical research. Herein, a catalytic method with broad functional group tolerance for the construction of aromatic and heteroaromatic trifluoropropynyl derivatives is reported. This methodology is based on a tandem Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction between an hydrofluoroolefins&#8208;based carbinol and (hetero)aryl iodides. The developed protocol employs inexpensive and commercially available HFO&#8208;1234yf gas to generate a bench&#8208;stable trifluoropropynyl carbinol reagent.

A divergent Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed strategy transforms &#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxonium ylides into two distinct scaffolds under mild conditions. With [Ru(p&#8208;cymene)Cl2]2/Cu(OAc)2&#183;H2O, amination with amines yields biologically relevant &#945;&#8208;ketoamides, while homocoupling in their absence affords &#945;,&#945;,&#946;&#8208;tricarbonyl ylides. Both pathways proceed via a common Ru&#8208;carbene intermediate, display broad scope, and enable downstream heterocycle formation and late&#8208;stage modifications.

A divergent Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the efficient transformation of &#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxonium ylides into two distinct molecular scaffolds under mild conditions has been developed. In the presence of [Ru(p&#8208;cymene)Cl2]2 and Cu(OAc)2&#183;H2O, selective amidation with primary or secondary amines provides biologically relevant &#945;&#8208;ketoamides, whereas homocoupling in the absence of amines affords less explored &#945;,&#945;,&#946;&#8208;tricarbonyl sulfoxonium ylides. Both pathways proceed via a common Ru&#8208;carbene intermediate and exhibit broad substrate scope and functional group tolerance. The synthetic utility is further demonstrated by downstream transformations, including heterocycle formation and late&#8208;stage modifications.

         <dc:description>
We disclose an ionic liquid&#8208;catalyzed annulation of 2&#8208;arylanilines and diazo compounds via cascade Wolff rearrangement, which is different from the precedent similar transformation catalyzed by metal or acid via N&#8211;H insertion. A spectrum of diverse diazos are well compatible, especially unsymmetric diazo affords exclusive product through selective Wolff rearrangement. Mechanistic studies revealed that ionic liquid promoted tandem Wolff rearrangement, nucleophilic addition, and cyclization via the electrostatic interaction and hydrogen&#8208;bonding effect.

An acid&#8208;functionalized ionic liquid&#8208;catalyzed annulation of 2&#8208;arylaniline and diazo compound was developed via cascade Wolff rearrangement, which is different from the precedent transformations mediated by metal or acid involving a N&#63743;H bond insertion. A spectrum of diverse diazos were well compatible, in particular, the unsymmetrical diazos provided exclusive product through selective Wolff rearrangement.

         <title>Hydricity Modulated Methylation of Indoles and Nitriles Using Methanol: Selective Synthesis of C3&#8208;Methylated Indoles, Bisindolylmethanes, and &#945;&#8208;Methylated Nitriles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemodivergent functionalization of indoles with methanol via borrowing hydrogen and interrupted borrowing hydrogen pathways was achieved using benzimidazole&#8208;based Ru(II) complexes. The product selectivity between C3&#8208;methylated indoles and bis(indolyl)methanes was effectively governed by tuning the hydricity of the Ru&#8208;H species through ligand backbone modification. This study demonstrates the pivotal role of metal hydricity in directing product outcomes, offering a versatile catalytic system with broad substrate scope.

The selective functionalization of indoles using methanol via borrowing hydrogen (BH) and interrupted borrowing hydrogen (I&#8208;BH) pathways offers a sustainable approach to access value&#8208;added molecules. Herein, the synthesis of a series of benzimidazole&#8208;functionalized cyclometalated (NC)&#8208;Ru(II) and (NN)&#8208;Ru(II) complexes and their application in the chemodivergent functionalization of indoles with methanol are reported, affording either C3&#8208;methylated indoles or bis(indolyl)methanes (BIMs). The product selectivity was governed by the hydricity of the Ru&#8211;H species, which was effectively tuned by ligand backbone modification. This varying catalytic behavior of these complexes under consideration toward the selective formation of different products was fairly understood by analyzing their electronic properties based on electrochemical and density functional theory studies. Additionally, the electron&#8208;rich (NC)&#8208;Ru complex facilitated the &#945;&#8208;methylation of phenylacetonitrile under relatively mild conditions. Finally, an array of control experiments and the identification of different intermediates aided in establishing the proposed mechanism.

A variety of imidazo&#8208;fuzed pyrazino[2,1166b]quinazolinone scaffolds were prepared in good to excellent yields through gold(I)166catalyzed and base166mediated intramolecular hydroamination reactions of N3166alkynyl quinazolinone tethered imidazoles. 5166Methylene imidazo166fuzed pyrazino[2,1166b]quinazolinones were obtained under gold(I)166catalyzed conditions, while base166mediated conditions afforded 5166alkyl imidazo166fuzed pyrazino[2,1166b]quinazolinones. Moreover, the prepared 5&#8208;methylene imidazo166fuzed pyrazino[2,1166b]quinazolinones could be applied in the various metal ions recognition based on their fluorescence properties.

Unlocking sulfonamide diversity through a light&#8208;driven copper catalyst: A one&#8208;step strategy bypasses preactivation, directly transforming these medicinally vital scaffolds into stereocontrolled (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;iodovinyl sulfones&#8212;molecular building blocks primed for drug discovery.

A dual&#8208;catalytic metallaphotoredox strategy repurposes sulfonamides as sulfonylating reagents via radical cascades, leveraging copper's dual role as photoredox mediator and coupling catalyst. Exemplified by iodosulfonylation of alkynes, the protocol achieves in&#8201;situ sulfonamide diazotization to generate sulfonyl radicals, followed by regioselective addition to alkynes and copper&#8208;catalyzed iodination. This all&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy eliminates the need for sulfonamide prefunctionalization, offering step&#8208;economy, operational simplicity, and broad functional group tolerance.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Enabled Organocatalyst&#8208;Assisted Enantioselective Regiodivergent Cascade Reactions: Overriding Intrinsic Reactivity of Vinylogous Pyrazolones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for enantioselective regiodivergent accessing complex spiro&#8208;pyrazolone scaffolds with multiple quaternary stereogenic centers is established. The enantioselective regiodivergent outcome of this protocol is tuned by the polarity of the solvent, thus providing both enantioselective regioisomers using quinine&#8208;derived bifunctional catalysts.

Enantioselective regiodivergent cascade reactions remain a significant challenge due to the dual requirement of achieving precise control over both regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. Herein, a quinine&#8208;derived bifunctional catalyst&#8208;driven strategy is presented for constructing the diverse asymmetric polycyclic spiro&#8208;pyrazolone scaffolds in a cascade manner. The cascade reaction is initiated by the asymmetric vinylogous Michael addition (VMA) of arylidene pyrazolones to the indandione&#8208;derived acceptors, followed by regioselective transformations that lead to structurally diverse products. The divergent reaction outcomes are governed by the interaction between the in situ generated conjugate acid of the catalyst and the anionic intermediate (VMA adduct). These outcomes are further modulated by adjustments in the reaction conditions, particularly the polarity of the solvent. In toluene, the reaction predominantly yields the cage product with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity via a cascade pathway involving asymmetric VMA/acetalization/oxa&#8208;Michael/Michael addition. In contrast, in MeCN, the reaction proceeds through an asymmetric VMA/proton transfer/aldol/acetalization, furnishing the fused product. Mechanistic studies reveal that the formation of the fused product involves an unusual and reversible reaction pathway. Specifically, the catalyst&#8208;controlled 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition of 1,3&#8208;indandione to the diene intermediate occurs under optimal conditions. This strategy demonstrates a versatile foundation for asymmetric regiodivergent cascade reactions.

A copper catalyst&#8208;controlled cascade annulation of CF3&#8208;imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides with activated nitriles has been developed, which enables the divergent synthesis of trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted pyrroles and quinolines, respectively.

A copper catalyst&#8208;controlled cascade annulation of CF3&#8208;imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides with activated nitriles has been disclosed, which enables the divergent synthesis of trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted pyrroles and quinolines. For the synthesis of pyrroles, the [3&#8201;+&#8201;2] annulation proceeds to give the multisubstituted pyrrole products. For the synthesis of quinolines, the CuI&#8208;induced intramolecular cyclization is involved in the reaction with the cleavage of C&#63743;CN bond.

This article presents a catalyst&#8208;free, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven strategy for the direct C&#63743;H functionalization of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. Using ambient air as the sole oxidant, this unified platform enables alkylation, arylation, and acylation under mild conditions. The protocol expands structural diversity of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones, offering a sustainable tool for late&#8208;stage functionalization and drug discovery.

Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and their derivatives constitute a privileged class of bioactive scaffolds with broad pharmacological potential, including anticancer, antibacterial, and neuroregulatory activities. Developing efficient and sustainable strategies for their molecular diversification under mild conditions remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. Here, we report a catalyst&#8208;free, light&#8208;driven C&#63743;H functionalization strategy that exploits visible light and ambient air as the sole oxidant to achieve direct alkylation, arylation, and acylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. This operationally simple protocol features excellent substrate scope and functional group tolerance, delivering a wide range of structurally diverse quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones derivatives in a rapid and sustainable manner. Mechanistic investigations, supported by control experiments and spectroscopic studies, reveal that the transformation proceeds via the excitation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor complexes, which endows this system with the unique capability of enabling efficient C&#63743;H functionalization without the need for any external catalyst.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Chemoselective Amide Bond Cleavage for the Synthesis of N&#8208;Acyl Sulfoximines in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable and metal&#8208;free protocol enables the chemoselective N&#63743;C bond cleavage of amides for the synthesis of N&#8208;acyl sulfoximines. Utilizing bench&#8208;stable N&#8208;acyl saccharin as an acyl source, this green process operates efficiently in both batch and continuous&#8208;flow systems, affording high yields, broad substrate scope, reagent recyclability, and significant reduction in reaction time.

Amides and sulfoximines are pivotal structural motifs in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals; however, sustainable and direct methods for their incorporation remain underdeveloped. Herein, a metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free protocol is presented for the efficient synthesis of N&#8208;acyl sulfoximines via selective N&#63743;C bond cleavage of amides, utilizing bench&#8208;stable N&#8208;acyl saccharin as an acylating agent for NH&#8208;sulfoximines. This transformation proceeds under mild conditions using green solvents and exhibits a broad substrate scope encompassing natural products and drug derivatives. Notably, the method is compatible with both batch and continuous&#8208;flow platforms, achieving a significant reduction in reaction time from 24&#8201;h to 15&#8201;min. The process offers high yields, excellent functional group tolerance, and gram&#8208;scale scalability. Furthermore, the recovery of recyclable saccharin enhances atom economy and minimizes waste generation.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral sulfonimidoyl fluorides enable stereocontrolled SuFEx click chemistry for synthesizing enantioenriched S(VI) compounds, advancing covalent drug discovery and material design.

Sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) has emerged as a powerful click chemistry platform for covalent bond formation, with broad applications in drug discovery, polymer science, and bioconjugation. Among the diverse SuFEx linkers developed in recent years, sulfonimidoyl fluorides (RN=S(&#63742;O)F) have gained prominence due to their tunable electrophilicity, multifunctional modifiable sites, and the presence of chiral sulfur(VI) centers. This reagent exhibits exceptional reactivity in stereospecific SuFEx transformations, offering not only an efficient strategy for the synthesis of enantioenriched sulfur compounds but also a versatile foundation for covalent drug discovery and chemical probe development. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in sulfonimidoyl fluoride chemistry, with an emphasis on the construction of chiral S(VI) centers and stereocontrolled SuFEx reactions. Despite the limited literature in this nascent field, key breakthroughs and discuss future research directions, is consolidated providing forward&#8208;looking perspectives to stimulate further progress in stereospecific SuFEx chemistry.

         <title>Primary Amination of Enones Using Inorganic Ammonium Salts and Nitrogen Isotope Incorporation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, and oxidant&#8208;free amination protocol for enones by employing user&#8208;friendly ammonium carbonate as the primary amino source was developed. When the ammonia surrogate is replaced with a readily available combination of 15NH4Cl and Na2CO3, a variety of completely 15N&#8208;labeled primary &#945;&#8208;aminoenones can be obtained.

Developing efficient methods to incorporate a primary amino group onto small molecules is of great importance in pharmaceutical and agrochemical fields. This significance becomes even more pronounced when it comes to accessing their corresponding 15N isotopologs. Here, we present a mild, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, and stoichiometric oxidant&#8208;free amination protocol for fluoroenones by employing user&#8208;friendly ammonium carbonate as the primary amino source. The protocol demonstrates high atom economy by directly converting starting materials into the &#945;&#8208;aminoenones. When the ammonia surrogate is replaced with a readily available combination of 15NH4Cl and Na2CO3, a variety of completely 15N&#8208;labeled primary &#945;&#8208;aminoenones can be synthesized with excellent functional group compatibility. The critical role of iodine in enhancing primary amination of fluoroenones is revealed by the transient formation of a more reactive iodinated enone, which facilitates downstream nucleophilic amination. Furthermore, the protocol exhibits robust scalability and is compatible with biologically and naturally relevant molecules. Molecular iodine is demonstrated as an inexpensive, environmentally benign, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle additive to pursue primary amination.

We developed a practical, highly atom&#8208;economical and switchable &#945; &#8208;C(sp2) &#8211;H (di)thiocarbamation/chromone annulation reaction for the divergent synthesis of two types of 3&#8208;substituted chromones with mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, gram&#8208;scale preparation and further derivatization.

A practical, highly atom&#8208;economical and switchable &#945;&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H (di)thiocarbamation/chromone annulation reaction for the divergent synthesis of two types of 3&#8208;substituted chromones has been developed. A variety of 3&#8208;dithiocarbamyl chromones and 3&#8208;carbamothioyl chromones were constructed efficiently from readily available o&#8208;hydroxyphenylenaminones (o&#8208;HPEs) and carbon disulfide (CS2) via KIO3/DTBP cooperative catalytic oxidation. Notably, this transformation proceeds efficiently by recycling by&#8208;product dimethylamine and employing equivalent amount of CS2. This strategy features high atom economy, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, gram&#8208;scale preparation and further derivatization.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Aryloxycarbonylayion of Aryl Bromides with Phenols Using Inositol Hexaformate as an Efficient CO Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a novel carbon monoxide surrogate inositol hexaformate (HFI) and applied it to the palladium&#8208;catalyzed aryloxycarbonylation of aryl bromides with phenols. HFI liberates six molecules of carbon monoxide, exhibiting a significantly higher efficiency and CO capacity than the conventional formate surrogates. This surrogate provides a practical and efficient platform for the synthesis of carbonyl&#8208;containing compounds in the laboratory.

Carbonylation represents a straightforward and powerful strategy for installing carbonyl groups into organic molecules. However, the widespread adoption of carbon monoxide gas in laboratories is hampered by its toxicity, flammability, and smell&#8208;less properties. To address these challenges, we developed a new carbon monoxide surrogate, inositol hexaformate (HFI), and demonstrated its utility in the palladium&#8208;catalyzed aryloxycarbonylation of aryl bromides with phenols. Notably, HFI efficiently releases six equivalents of carbon monoxide, showing a significant improvement in efficiency over commonly used formate surrogates. This work provides a practical and robust method for conducting carbonylation reactions, which is expected to broaden the accessibility of this important transformation in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Cascade Annulation of N&#8208;Hydroxybenzamides with CF3&#8208;Ynones Leading to CF3&#8208;Isoxazolidine&#8208;Fused Isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;Ones</title>

Presented herein is a novel synthesis of CF3&#8208;isoxazolidine&#8208;fused isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones through the cascade reaction of N&#8208;hydroxybenzamides with CF3&#8208;ynones. The formation of products is initiated by aryl C&#8722;H bond metalation and insertion of the triple bond, followed by protodemetalation, intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition, and oxo&#8208;nucleophilic addition. In addition, the products thus formed can be transformed into several valuable compounds through easy&#8208;to&#8208;run derivations by taking advantage of the rich chemistry of the functional groups embedded therein.

Both isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;one and isoxazolidine are privileged scaffolds in developing new pharmaceuticals and functional materials. Presented herein is a novel synthesis of CF3&#8208;isoxazolidine&#8208;fused isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones through the cascade reaction of N&#8208;hydroxybenzamides with CF3&#8208;ynones. The formation of product is initiated by aryl C&#63743;H bond metalation and insertion of the triple bond, followed by protodemetalation, intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition, and oxo&#8208;nucleophilic addition. In this cascade process, the N&#8208;hydroxyamide group plays a triple role by acting as: 1) directing group for C&#63743;H bond metalation; 2) N&#8208;nucleophilic site for isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;one ring formation; and 3) O&#8208;nucleophilic site for isoxazolidine ring formation. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report on the concurrent construction of these two privileged cyclic scaffolds in one pot. In addition, the products thus formed can be transformed into several valuable compounds through easy&#8208;to&#8208;run derivations by taking advantage of the rich chemistry of the functional groups embedded therein.

         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective synthesis of Pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]coumarin containing aza&#8208;quaternary stereocenter has been reported. The reaction proceeds via [3+3] annulation of &#945;&#8208;CF3 alkynyl ketimines and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins under metal/organo catalytic system. This method affords CF3&#8208;containing chiral pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]coumarin derivatives in good yields (up to 85%) with outstanding enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee) under mild reaction conditions.

An efficient regio&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]coumarins has been developed via a [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] annulation reaction between &#945;&#8208;CF3 alkynyl ketimines and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins. The reaction proceeds via a squaramide&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific Mannich reaction followed by a Lewis acid&#8208;mediated annulation, enabling excellent control of both regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Notably, this represents the first enantioselective synthesis of pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]coumarin derivatives bearing an aza&#8208;quaternary stereocenter. The methodology exhibits broad substrate compatibility with both steric and electronic variations. Practicality of the protocol is demonstrated by scale&#8208;up reaction as well as diverse downstream functionalizations.

         <title>Stereoselective De Novo Synthesis of Substituted Cyclopentanes via a Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed (3&#8201;+&#8201;2) Cycloaddition of Enamides</title>

A wide range of cyclopentylamine scaffolds can be prepared from various N&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;amides through a stepwise (3&#8201;+&#8201;2) allyl cation cycloaddition. The synthetic method involves the generation of an aurated dithioallyl cation, the reactivity of which is governed by the well&#8208;defined gold(I)&#8208;catalyst that is used, in addition to some remarkable counterion effects that affect the chemoselectivity of the overall process.

A general and stereoselective synthesis of highly substituted cyclopentylamine scaffolds is reported starting from various N&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;amides. The reaction involves the generation of an aurated dithioallyl cation which undergoes a classical stepwise (3&#8201;+&#8201;2) allyl cation cycloaddition with a range of enamide substrates. The close coordination of the reactive intermediates with the well&#8208;defined gold(I)&#8208;catalyst results in a reactivity and selectivity profile that can be readily rationalized on the basis of a nonconcerted carbocationic cycloaddition reaction, and some remarkable counterion effects are seen to effect the chemoselectivity of the overall process.

         <title>Exploring the Uncharted Indolizine Chemical Space: Construction of 5&#8208;Acylindolizines via a Domino Aldol&#8211;Vinylogous Aldol Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A domino aldol condensation&#8211;intramolecular vinylogous aldol condensation process was implemented for the first time to enable access to a wide range of novel 5&#8208;acylated indolizines with a hydrogen, an alkyl, an aryl, or an alkoxy moiety at the C7 site.

Described herein are two annulative functionalization approaches to novel indolizines leveraging a domino aldol condensation&#8208;vinylogous aldol condensation procedure to construct the pyridine moiety of indolizines, enabling installation of an alkyl, an aryl, or an alkoxy group at the C7 position and an acyl group at the C5 position of indolizine framework. In the first approach, aldehyde oxidatively generated in situ from trialkylamine participated in a [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] annulation process with N&#8208;substituted pyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxaldehydes to give rise to 5&#8208;acylindolizines. In the second approach, the use of various aldehydes as reaction partners in this protocol allowed for the introduction of a wide range of substituents at the C7 site of indolizines.

         <title>Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Alkylated Enamides by Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Anti&#8208;Stereoselective and &#946;&#8208;Regioselective 1,2&#8208;Alkylamination of Alkynes</title>

         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;stereoselective and &#223;&#8208;regioselective 1,2&#8208;alkylamination of alkynes with amides and azobis(alkylcarbonitriles) has been developed for the synthesis of substituted &#223;&#8208;alkylated enamides

Polysubstituted alkenes are versatile molecules and their multidimensional transformations have significant promotion for the creation and screening of chemotherapeutic agents and polyolefin functional materials. The difunctionalization of alkynes is an inevitable pathway for the generation of highly substituted alkenes with specific conformations. However, there is currently limited development on the construction of &#946;&#8208;alkylated enamides through 1,2&#8208;alkylamination of alkynes, and the newly generated C&#63743;C and C&#63743;N bonds in traditional reports maintain syn&#8208;stereoselectivity. In addition, the formation of anti C&#63743;C/C&#63743;N bonds through difunctionalization of alkynes via free radical processes is overly dependent on electron deficient fluorinated alkyl radicals. We therefore seek to explore anti&#8208;stereoselective and &#946;&#8208;regioselective 1,2&#8208;alkylamination of alkynes with amides and azobis(alkylcarbonitriles). Dozens of all&#8208;new &#946;&#8208;alkylated enamides, including those containing biologically active patterns, are exported in 38%&#8211;88% yields by combining the addition of alkyl radicals to C&#63743;C triple bonds with copper chelate&#8208;assisted functionalization of vinyl radicals. In addition, extensive mechanism explorations and synthetic applications are also conducted to explore the details and potential of this protocol.

A practical and mild strategy for Me3SiCl&#8208;mediated electrophilic carbocyclization&#8208;phosphorothiolation of alkynes with N&#8208;phosphorothiosuccinimide has been developed.

Heterogeneous Copper Single&#8208;Atom Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Radical Difunctionalization of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst Cu1@NC enables efficient three&#8208;component alkene difunctionalization with quinoxalinones and polyhalogenated alkanes. This versatile protocol features broad substrate scope, excellent catalyst recyclability, and successful late&#8208;stage modification of complex bioactive molecules.

Multicomponent alkene difunctionalization is persistently challenged by the difficult recovery of homogeneous catalysts and limited applicability to unactivated alkenes. While single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) hold promise for overcoming these limitations, their application to such complex transformations remains unexplored thus far. Herein, we developed a Cu SAC (Cu1@NC) featuring atomically dispersed Cu&#8211;N4 sites that enable efficient three&#8208;component coupling of alkenes, quinoxalinones, and polyhalogenated alkanes. This catalytic system simultaneously installs both gem&#8208;dihaloalkyl and quinoxalinone pharmacophores across a broad substrate scope (52 examples), including traditionally challenging unactivated aliphatic alkenes. Remarkably, Cu1@NC maintains excellent catalytic stability over&#8201;&gt;10 cycles with&#8201;&gt;95% of its initial activity retained and demonstrates robust scalability (72%&#8211;77% isolated yields in gram&#8208;scale reactions). Most significantly, this catalytic system enables efficient late&#8208;stage difunctionalization of alkenes derived from complex bioactive molecules (e.g., ibuprofen, borneol derivatives), underscoring its potential for pharmaceutical applications. Mechanistic investigations reveal that Cu1@NC mediates the radical pathway through two essential single&#8208;electron transfer processes: activating TBHP to generate oxygen&#8208;centered radicals and oxidizing intermediate IM&#8208;4 to regenerate the catalytic center. This study delivers an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical route to valuable drug&#8208;like scaffolds, thus opening new avenues for heterogeneous catalysis in multicomponent reactions.

         <title>Breaking Technological Limits in HT Synthesis: A Platform Concept to Unlock Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis in Microplate&#8208;Based SN2 Automation</title>

Unlock phase&#8208;transfer catalysis in microplate&#8208;based SN2 by using covalently functionalized glass microvials.

We report a covalently immobilized crown ether&#8208;based platform that enables phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalyzed SN2 reactions under fully automated microplate conditions. This regenerable system overcomes key limitations of HT synthesis&#8212;solubility mismatches, mixing constraints, and purification demands&#8212;offering a zero&#8208;waste solution for expanding the accessible reaction space in robotized synthetic workflows. The approach relies on silanized glass microvials bearing dibenzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 functionalities, providing a well&#8208;defined catalytic interface between immiscible organic and aqueous phases. The dynamic movement of the phase boundary during orbital shaking ensures continuous reagent exchange without the need for mechanical stirring. Model transformations using benzyl chloride and alkali metal salts (KCN, NaSCN) validated the efficiency of the immobilized phase&#8208;transfer system, showing comparable or superior yields relative to homogeneous conditions. The covalently anchored catalysts remained active over multiple cycles, demonstrating excellent stability and reusability. The results establish a generalizable strategy for integrating biphasic reactions into automated high&#8208;throughput synthesis workflows by eliminating the need for free phase&#8208;transfer catalysts.

   &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;2 reactions under fully automated microplate conditions. This regenerable system overcomes key limitations of HT synthesis&#8212;solubility mismatches, mixing constraints, and purification demands&#8212;offering a zero-waste solution for expanding the accessible reaction space in robotized synthetic workflows. The approach relies on silanized glass microvials bearing dibenzo-18-crown-6 functionalities, providing a well-defined catalytic interface between immiscible organic and aqueous phases. The dynamic movement of the phase boundary during orbital shaking ensures continuous reagent exchange without the need for mechanical stirring. Model transformations using benzyl chloride and alkali metal salts (KCN, NaSCN) validated the efficiency of the immobilized phase-transfer system, showing comparable or superior yields relative to homogeneous conditions. The covalently anchored catalysts remained active over multiple cycles, demonstrating excellent stability and reusability. The results establish a generalizable strategy for integrating biphasic reactions into automated high-throughput synthesis workflows by eliminating the need for free phase-transfer catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Emergence of Phosphinium Radical Cations as Intermediates for Organic Radical Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, phosphinium radical cations (R3P.+) have been involved in an elegant approach to generate organic radicals via either nucleophilic trapping/fragmentation or via radical addition. A wide range of radicals, along with hydrogen atom (H&#8208;atom) equivalents, have been produced from their precursors by tapping these intriguing radical&#8208;cationic intermediates. An account of this recent development is documented in this manuscript.

Development of methods with newer strategies for organic radical generation has been a major thrust area of synthetic organic chemistry in the last decade and a half. Often, the radical generation is aided by photoirradiation or electrochemical activation. Phosphinium radical cations, accessed by single electron oxidation or hydrogen atom abstraction, have recently emerged as a unique tool to furnish a variety of organic radicals leading to diverse functional group installations, reductions, cyclization, rearrangements, etc. Herein, we provide an account for the working model of this chemistry and the recent progress of this elegant approach with exciting prospects in the future.

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Homoallylic Alcohols via a Salt&#8208;Free Three&#8208;Component Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling reaction between an aldehyde, a secondary amine, and butadiene allows a straightforward access to 5&#8208;aminopent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ol scaffolds according to a salt&#8208;free process. Key steps are oxidative coupling reaction between one aldehyde, one butadiene on a low valent nickel precursor, and the nucleophilic attack of a secondary amine on the nickel&#8208;allyl moiety.

In the presence of a catalytic amount (1&#8201;mol%) of Ni(cod)2 and dppmb (1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphinomethyl)benzene)), a three&#8208;component coupling reaction between industrially available aldehydes, buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene, and amines leads to the formation of variety of homoallylic alcohols with a highly functionalized 5&#8208;aminopent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ol structure. The reaction proceeds with 100% atom economy under mild conditions (80&#8201;&#176;C) in isopropanol as solvent. The process accommodates both aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes in combination with cyclic and acyclic secondary dialkyl amines, demonstrating a broad substrates scope. Reaction monitoring shows that the initial rate of the reaction is 39&#8201;h&#8722;1, and the process reaches a maximum within 3&#8201;h of reaction at 80&#8201;&#176;C. A competitive reaction has been identified as the hydroamination of 1,3&#8208;butadiene that affords light butenylamines. The key mechanistic feature of the three&#8208;component nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction is the formation of an &#951;3:&#951;1&#8208;allylalkoxy nickel (II) intermediate obtained from the oxidative coupling reaction between a low valent nickel (0) precursor, buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene, and an aldehyde. The amine subsequently reacts as a nucleophile with the electrophilic allyl moiety of this intermediate, while the alkoxy group acts as an internal base facilitating proton transfer that enables the synthesis of 5&#8208;aminopent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ol derivatives without any base and salt formation.

Chiral potassium base catalysts featuring 1,1&#180;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol&#8208;derived chiral crown ethers as ligands promote a tandem allylic isomerization/asymmetric aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction of allylic alcohols and aldehydes. This method provides enantioenriched 1,3&#8208;diols with excellent diastereoselectivity and high enantioselectivity, thereby expanding the synthetic utility of potassium catalysis.

A series of chiral potassium Br&#248;nsted bases containing 3,3&#8242;&#8208;substituted 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol&#8208;based chiral crown ethers are demonstrated as sustainable metal catalysts for a tandem allylic isomerization/asymmetric aldol&#8211;Tishchenko reaction. The crown ether creates an effective chiral environment around the potassium cation, yielding diverse 1,3&#8208;diols containing three contiguous stereogenic centers with excellent diastereoselectivity and high enantioselectivity. This system allows the use of allylic alcohols instead of enolizable ketones as nucleophiles, thus broadening the synthetic applicability of this reaction.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Covalent Organic Frameworks: Synthetic Strategies and Catalytic Applications in Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically outlines the design, synthesis strategies, structure&#8208;activity relationships, and latest applications of M&#8208;COFs in various organic transformations, such as C&#8211;H bond activation reaction, cross&#8208;coupling reaction, reduction reaction, oxidation reaction, addition reaction, multicomponent reaction, and asymmetric synthesis. It also highlights the advantages and discusses the future development directions in this field.

Metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (M&#8208;COFs) are a class of crystalline porous materials formed by the coordination bonds between metals centers and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). They retain the characteristics of COFs while providing exposed metal active sites. Compared with homogeneous transition metal catalysts, M&#8208;COFs exhibit superior catalytic activity, high stability, tunability, high specific surface area, and ordered pore channels. More importantly, due to their heterogeneous nature, M&#8208;COFs catalysts can be reused multiple times conveniently, avoiding the residual presence of transition metals and reducing resource and environmental consumption. This review introduces the general design strategies and synthesis methods of M&#8208;COFs, briefly discusses the intrinsic relationship between their structure and catalytic activity, and focuses on summarizing their applications in organic transformations. It also highlights the advantages and challenges of M&#8208;COFs in catalyzing organic transformation reactions and discusses the future development directions in this field.

A photocatalyst&#8208;free trifluoromethylation/cyclization of unactivated alkenes with trifluoromethylsulfonyl&#8208;pyridinium salt to access trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted quinazolinones is achieved.

A novel photochemical trifluoromethylation/cyclization of unactivated alkenes to synthesize trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted quinazolinones with trifluoromethylsulfonyl&#8208;pyridinium salt (TFSP) is achieved under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal that an electron&#8208;donating&#8208;accepting complex is formed between the quinazolinone and TFSP, making this the first example of TFSP&#8208;based trifluoromethylation conducted in the absence of expensive iridium photocatalysts.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Insights into On&#8208;Surface Chemistry of Organosilicon Compounds by Scanning Probe Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning probe microscopy techniques enable atomic&#8208;level visualization of Si&#9472;H/O and C&#9472;Si bond activation and aromatic C&#9472;Si bond formation in organosilicon compounds (silane, silyl, and silole). Each class exhibits distinct surface&#8208;mediated transformations and bottom&#8208;up fabrication of functional nanostructures.

Organosilicon compounds (OSCs), which consist of silicon atoms bonded to organic groups, have become vital in fields such as materials science, catalysis, and electronics. Their flexibility comes from the ability to adjust their properties by attaching different organic groups to the silicon framework. Despite many progresses, a key challenge persists in controlling the structure and reactivity of these compounds, particularly on a solid surface. Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques, including scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM), are powerful tools for studying molecular behaviors at the atomic level. These techniques enable real space imaging and precise measurements, making them invaluable for understanding OSCs. This article examines the application of STM, STS, and AFM in the on&#8208;surface chemistry of organosilicon, with a focus on molecular adsorption, self&#8208;assembly, surface&#8208;driven reactions, and innovative synthesis of nanostructures. These techniques can provide valuable insights into surface reactivity, molecular organization, and the formation of nanostructures, driving the development of advanced functional materials. Further, density functional theory offers exciting opportunities for advancing surface chemistry and nanomaterial design. This article highlights the critical role of SPM in pushing forward OSCs research and enabling the development of next&#8208;generation organosilicon nanomaterials.

         <title>Recent Advances in Spirocyclization Reactions of Biaryl Ynones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient dearomative spirocyclization reactions of biaryl ynones have been reported for the construction of various functionalized spiro[5.5]trienones and 3,3&#8208;spiroindanones.

In recent years, special emphasis has been put on spirocyclization reactions of biaryl ynones since these strategies offer versatile platforms for introducing various important functional groups into spirocyclic frameworks in a step&#8208;economical manner, which is conducive to drug discovery. In this regard, various functionalized spiro[5.5]trienones and 3,3&#8208;spiroindanones have been synthesized via the radical, radical cation, or electrophilic process promoted by thermal, photochemical, and electrochemical means. In this invited review, we systematically summarize the spirocyclization reactions of biaryl ynones with diverse organic precursors, highlighting the reaction patterns, mechanistic insights, and synthetic applications.

A Sustainable Electrochemical Platform for Decarboxylative Amidation: Direct Access to N&#8208;Arylamides from &#945;&#8208;Keto Acids and Arylamines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This electrochemical strategy enables the direct synthesis of amides from &#945;&#8208;keto acids and arylamines. Using ferrocene as a redox mediator, the system promotes single&#8208;electron oxidation to generate acyl radicals that couple with anodically oxidized arylamines. Operating under mild, oxidant&#8208;free conditions, the method provides a versatile and sustainable route to valuable N&#8208;arylamides and displays exceptional functional group tolerance, enabling the synthesis of more than 40 structurally diverse amides, including pharmaceutically relevant examples.

Amide bonds are ubiquitous in bioactive molecules, yet their synthesis often relies on prefunctionalized reagents or stoichiometric activators, posing sustainability challenges. Herein, we report a novel electrochemical decarboxylative amidation strategy enabling direct coupling of &#945;&#8208;keto acids with arylamines to access N&#8208;arylamides under mild, oxidant&#8208;free conditions. This redox mediator&#8208;controlled indirect electrolysis harnesses ferrocene to facilitate single&#8208;electron oxidation of &#945;&#8208;keto acids, generating acyl radicals that couple with anodically oxidized arylamine radicals to form amides efficiently. This programmable approach offers operational simplicity and synthetic versatility, providing streamlined access to valuable amide scaffolds with promising applications in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Discovery of Switchable Metal&#8208; and Ligand&#8208;Centered Reactivity via Mechanistic Studies on C&#63743;O Activation of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents two orthogonal reactivities localized at metal and ligand sites separately with tandem Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;O arylation of pyridyl methyl ether and homocoupling of pyridine derivatives: 1) two&#8208;electron C&#63743;O arylation via a Ni(0)/Ni(II) redox manifold with the reactive site located at metal center; 2) one&#8208;electron homocoupling via [IPr&#8211;Ni(0/I)&#8211;pyridyl&#8226;&#8722;] intermediates with the reactive site at ligands.

Metal&#8211;ligand cooperation (MLC) reaction revolutionizes the boundaries of homogeneous catalysis by permitting ligand&#8208;centered reactivity beyond traditional metal&#8208;orientated reactivity. Pyridine is key motif in many pharmaceuticals and agrochemical products, but it also shows promise in participating MLC reaction for further derivatization. However, such unique reaction integration into C&#63743;O bond functionalization remains underexplored, largely due to poorly understood reactivity profiles. In this work, a mechanistic investigation into nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;O bond activation of pyridine&#8208;based aryl ethers is reported to elucidate the electronic and structural features of the active species and MLC/metal&#8211;ligand role reversal (MLRR) pathway. With detailed mechanistic studies including density functional theory calculation, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, and model catalyst, two distinct catalytic cycles are elucidated: 1) a two&#8208;electron&#8208;based C&#63743;O arylation at nickel center and 2) a single&#8208;electron&#8208;driven pyridine homocoupling reaction via MLC and MLRR manifolds. These insights subsequently allow establishment of a synthetic methodology for switchable C&#63743;O bond cleavage and homocoupling in substrate scope studies.

&lt;p&gt;This study presents two orthogonal reactivities localized at metal and ligand sites separately with tandem Ni-catalyzed C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O arylation of pyridyl methyl ether and homocoupling of pyridine derivatives: 1) two-electron C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O arylation via a Ni(0)/Ni(II) redox manifold with the reactive site located at metal center; 2) one-electron homocoupling via [IPr&#8211;Ni(0/I)&#8211;pyridyl&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;] intermediates with the reactive site at ligands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;ligand cooperation (MLC) reaction revolutionizes the boundaries of homogeneous catalysis by permitting ligand-centered reactivity beyond traditional metal-orientated reactivity. Pyridine is key motif in many pharmaceuticals and agrochemical products, but it also shows promise in participating MLC reaction for further derivatization. However, such unique reaction integration into C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O bond functionalization remains underexplored, largely due to poorly understood reactivity profiles. In this work, a mechanistic investigation into nickel-catalyzed C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O bond activation of pyridine-based aryl ethers is reported to elucidate the electronic and structural features of the active species and MLC/metal&#8211;ligand role reversal (MLRR) pathway. With detailed mechanistic studies including density functional theory calculation, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, and model catalyst, two distinct catalytic cycles are elucidated: 1) a two-electron-based C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O arylation at nickel center and 2) a single-electron-driven pyridine homocoupling reaction via MLC and MLRR manifolds. These insights subsequently allow establishment of a synthetic methodology for switchable C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O bond cleavage and homocoupling in substrate scope studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This work merges 1,2&#8208;radical migration (1,2&#8208;RaM) with ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8211;H activation for alkene 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization, enabling distal C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) bond formation. The cascade combines Ru single&#8208;electron transfer (Ru&#8208;SET), acyloxy migration, and radical addition, showcasing broad scope, scalability, and late&#8208;stage applicability. Mechanistic studies support the radical&#8208;involved pathway.

Radical migration, especially 1,2&#8208;radical migration (1,2&#8208;RaM), has emerged as a powerful strategy in reaction discovery and synthetic development, enabling highly selective 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes and granting access to previously unexplored functional molecules and chemical space, with broad implications for complex molecule construction and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report efficient and regioselective catalytic methods that, for the first time, combine 1,2&#8208;radical migration (1,2&#8208;RaM) with ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed remote C&#8211;H activation to achieve difunctionalization at the meta&#8208;position of aromatic C(sp2)&#8211;H bonds and the C3 position of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds. This transformation demonstrates broad functional group tolerance and scalability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, offering a novel approach for the construction of complex molecules.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Atropisomeric Amines via Transaminase&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic kinetic resolution approach is developed for the atroposelective synthesis of heterobiaryl primary amines. Using transaminases and leveraging Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions to induce racemization, a variety of axially chiral primary amines are produced in high yields and enantioselectivities. This mild, metal&#8208;free method expands the scope of biocatalytic asymmetric synthesis.

Atropisomeric heterobiaryl primary amines are of significant interest in both organic and pharmaceutical chemistry. A series of transaminases have been employed to synthesize these valuable compounds with high yields (up to 98% conversion) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to &#8805;99% ee) via dynamic kinetic resolution of the corresponding heterobiaryl aldehydes. This process features a Lewis acid&#8211;base interaction strategy to facilitate labilization of the stereogenic axis.

         <title>Aerobic Oxidative Dethioacetalization Catalyzed by an Iron Phthalocyanine Complex</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protocol for iron octacarboxyphthalocyanine&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidative dethioacetalization in an aqueous solvent is developed. This method can efficiently convert a broad range of dithioacetals into the corresponding carbonyl compounds. Inspired by enzyme&#8208;mediated redox processes, the environmentally friendly catalytic system exhibits remarkable functional group compatibility.

An aerobic oxidative dethioacetalization catalyzed by an iron octacarboxyphthalocyanine complex, which is designed by mimicking enzymatic oxidation, in an aqueous media is developed. The developed method can efficiently convert a broad range of dithioacetals, including those derived from aryl and aliphatic ketones and aldehydes, into the corresponding carbonyl compounds while tolerating various functional groups. This protocol is readily scalable to the gram scale. Mechanistic studies indicate that the iron phthalocyanine complex initiates the reaction by accepting a single electron from the sulfur atom of the dithioacetal, forming a radical cation intermediate. This is followed by unimolecular fragmentation and subsequent degradation of the resulting hemithioacetal to afford the corresponding carbonyl product, along with 1,2&#8208;dithiolane and its oxides.

         <title>Initiation Kinetics of Latent Olefin Metathesis Precatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ready, set, go: Initiation of several latent olefin metathesis precatalysts was measured both by light and heat activation. Sulfur&#8208;chelated ruthenium precatalysts were initiated more efficiently when thermally activated, while the precatalysts with phosphite ligands were more responsive to photochemical stimulation. The initiation results were compared with benchmark RCM and ROMP reactions.

Latent catalysts represent a specialized class of precatalysts that remain dormant under ambient conditions until activated by external stimuli to initiate catalytic activity. This study investigates the initiation behavior of latent olefin metathesis precatalysts, focusing on two different types: sulfur&#8208;chelated systems and phosphite&#8208;ligated ruthenium complexes. The initiation process was first monitored in situ by tracking characteristic proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H&#8208;NMR) signals in the presence of butyl vinyl ether under two activation modes: heating and light irradiation. The analysis for both activation stimuli enabled the determination of initiation rate constants and revealed details of the distinct mechanistic pathways. Moreover, comparing the initiation kinetics and catalytic performance in ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) and ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) established structure&#8211;activity relationships. The ligand environment was found to significantly modulate precatalyst reactivity, with sulfur&#8208;chelated complexes mostly showing enhanced thermal activity, while phosphite systems demonstrated superior photochemical responsiveness. These findings provide support for advancing the development of next&#8208;generation latent metathesis catalysts with tailored activation profiles for precision polymer synthesis and spatiotemporal control of polymerization processes.

         <title>Harnessing the Excited&#8208;State Reactivity of o&#8208;Nitrobenzyl Alcohols for the Rapid Synthesis of N&#8208;Substituted 2H&#8208;Indazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, iron&#8208;catalyzed cascade enables the one&#8208;pot synthesis of 3&#8208;arylamino&#8208;2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2H&#8208;indazoles from readily available o&#8208;nitrobenzyl alcohols and anilines under mild, sustainable conditions. The process involves photoinduced formation of o&#8208;nitrosobenzaldehyde, followed by condensation, cyclization, and aromatization. The resulting indazoles exhibit a selective fluorescence quenching response toward hypochlorite, highlighting their potential for ClO&#8722; detection.

2H&#8208;Indazole scaffolds represent privileged structural motifs prevalent in a wide range of bioactive compounds and pharmaceutical agents. Despite their significance, conventional synthetic approaches to 2H&#8208;indazole derivatives often suffer from limitations such as harsh reaction conditions, the use of expensive or toxic catalysts, and multistep procedures. To address these challenges, we report a cost&#8208;effective, environmentally benign, and one&#8208;pot strategy for the synthesis of biologically and synthetically valuable 3&#8208;arylamino&#8208;2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2H&#8208;indazoles. This method employs readily available o&#8208;nitrobenzyl alcohols as key building blocks and utilizes a Lewis acid iron salt as a catalyst under visible light irradiation, harnessing the excited&#8208;state reactivity of the substrates. The transformation proceeds efficiently without the need for precious metal catalysts, external oxidants, or additives and operates under mild and sustainable conditions. The protocol enables the construction of structurally complex 2H&#8208;indazoles, including those embedded in medium&#8208;sized rings. Notably, the synthesized 3&#8208;arylamino&#8208;2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2H&#8208;indazoles exhibit a selective fluorescence quenching response toward hypochlorite, highlighting their potential as an effective probe for ClO&#8722; detection.

&lt;p&gt;A visible-light-driven, iron-catalyzed cascade enables the one-pot synthesis of 3-arylamino-2-aryl-2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indazoles from readily available o-nitrobenzyl alcohols and anilines under mild, sustainable conditions. The process involves photoinduced formation of &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-nitrosobenzaldehyde, followed by condensation, cyclization, and aromatization. The resulting indazoles exhibit a selective fluorescence quenching response toward hypochlorite, highlighting their potential for ClO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-Indazole scaffolds represent privileged structural motifs prevalent in a wide range of bioactive compounds and pharmaceutical agents. Despite their significance, conventional synthetic approaches to 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indazole derivatives often suffer from limitations such as harsh reaction conditions, the use of expensive or toxic catalysts, and multistep procedures. To address these challenges, we report a cost-effective, environmentally benign, and one-pot strategy for the synthesis of biologically and synthetically valuable 3-arylamino-2-aryl-2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indazoles. This method employs readily available &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-nitrobenzyl alcohols as key building blocks and utilizes a Lewis acid iron salt as a catalyst under visible light irradiation, harnessing the excited-state reactivity of the substrates. The transformation proceeds efficiently without the need for precious metal catalysts, external oxidants, or additives and operates under mild and sustainable conditions. The protocol enables the construction of structurally complex 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indazoles, including those embedded in medium-sized rings. Notably, the synthesized 3-arylamino-2-aryl-2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indazoles exhibit a selective fluorescence quenching response toward hypochlorite, highlighting their potential as an effective probe for ClO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; detection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Domino Synthesis of Functionalized Cyclic Acetals From Organic Carbonates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic carbonates equipped with acrylic functional groups are shown to undergo a domino process in the presence of a suitable alkoxide to deliver novel types of decorated cyclic acetals. The developed protocol combines practical conditions and a wide scope and features a new reactivity modus for these carbon dioxide&#8208;derived heterocyclic precursors.

We report a method for the base&#8208;mediated transformation of ether&#8208;tethered acrylic ester&#8208;based cyclic carbonates into functionalized cyclic acetals. The protocol builds on the use of hydroxyalkyl&#8208;substituted cyclic carbonates that undergo an oxa&#8208;Michael addition reaction in the presence of alkyl propiolates thereby forging (E)&#8208;configured acrylic ether intermediates. The scope of the reaction involves the use of both five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered cyclic carbonates, and correspondingly, both five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered cyclic acetals can be prepared. The amount of reagents, the purification method, and the type of ester substrate all contribute to the efficiency of the transformation. Mechanistic control reactions point at the intermediacy of an alkoxide that induces an intramolecular Michael addition onto the acrylic double bond following alkoxide&#8208;mediated formation of both an alcohol and ester in the final product. These functional groups, among others, further enable easy diversification of acetal&#8208;based synthons.

         <title>Engineering of an Ancestral McbA with Enhanced Domain Mobility Extends Biocatalytic Amide Synthesis Scope</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show how engineered ancestral amide bond synthetases (ABSs) together with cofactor recycling using a single polyphosphate kinase paves the way for chemoenzymatic synthesis of pharmacophores. The figure illustrates how ancestral ABS has a more flexible C&#8208;terminal domain, which is associated with enhanced catalytic performance and expanded amine scope. An ancestral enzyme can thus be robust but still show enhanced interdomain mobility.

Amide bond formation is a basal transformation in synthetic chemistry and the pharmaceutical industry that is traditionally performed under harsh conditions, using excess amounts of amine and relying on coupling agents. Biocatalysis shows great potential in contributing to milder and more sustainable amide bond formation in water, in particular using the emerging family of amide bond synthetase (ABS) enzymes. Here, we use molecular dynamics, biocatalysis, and enzyme engineering to study amide bond formation in extant and ancestral ABS from Marinactinospora thermotolerans (McbA). Our results show that while being more thermostable, the C&#8208;terminal domain that delivers the amine substrate to the adenylated acid intermediate is more flexible in ancestral McbA, presumably leading to an extended amine scope as observed experimentally from a small panel of aliphatic and aromatic substrates. An engineered ancestor of McbA harboring a single mutation that presumptively represent a catalytic shift residue when going from ancestral to modern biocatalyst, show two to ten&#8208;fold improved conversions over its ancestral template while maintaining high thermostability, highlighting ancestral sequence reconstruction as a potent method in protein engineering. Kinetic experiments showed that the engineered ancestral enzyme had 2&#8208;fold higher apparent kcat values in amide formation compared to extant enzyme, concomitant with relaxed substrate inhibition and loss&#8208;of&#8208;dependency on magnesium. Finally, we optimize ATP recycling utilizing a single polyphosphate kinase to showcase how engineered ancestral McbA together with reaction optimization is amenable for pharmacophore synthesis at a preparative scale.

         <title>Enhancing Thermal&#8208;Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 via H2O&#8208;H2 Co&#8208;Feeding in Mg&#8208;Doped Bismuth Catalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
Mg&#8208;doped Bi nanospheres facilitate efficient thermal&#8208;photocatalytic CO2 reduction in a H2O&#63743;H2 atmosphere. In this system, H2O generates active Bi&#63743;OH sites for CO2 adsorption, while H2 drives the reduction by supplying *H species. The synergistic effect achieves a 2.4&#8208;fold enhancement in CO production with 100% selectivity compared to a pure H2 atmosphere.

The rational design of efficient thermal&#8208;photo CO2 reduction catalysts necessitates synergistic integration of structural modulation and reactant activation strategies. Herein, a Mg&#8208;doped Bi nanosphere catalyst is reported, engineered for efficient CO2 reduction under H2O&#8208;H2 co&#8208;feeding conditions. Mg doping not only optimizes the nanostructure by reducing the particle size but also modifies the surface charge distribution and enhances water adsorption, thereby promoting CO2 activation and catalytic performance. Crucially, under H2O&#63743;H2 co&#8208;feeding, H2O interacts with Bi to generate hydroxylated Bi&#63743;OH sites that promote CO2 chemisorption, while H2 supplies hydrogen species (*H) for CO2 reduction. In&#8201;situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy reveals a cooperative mechanism: CO2 adsorbs on Bi&#63743;OH to form *CO32&#8722; intermediates, which undergo sequential reduction facilitated by H2 activation. This synergy achieves a CO production rate of 55.32&#8201;&#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 under 420&#8201;nm illumination with 100% selectivity, which is 2.4 times higher than that under a pure H2 atmosphere. The work highlights the critical role of dopant&#8208;driven active site engineering and reactant synergies (H2O&#63743;H2) in CO2 valorization, providing a scalable strategy for catalytic performance enhancement.

         <title>Phenoxide&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Alkenes from Trifluoromethylated Alkyl Bromides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phenoxide catalyzed elimination reaction enabled by weak interactions.

&#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;substituted alkenes are a class of highly important building blocks. Herein, a new phenol&#8208;based catalytic system is developed that facilitates the elimination of trifluoromethylated alkyl bromides to produce trifluoromethylated alkenes&#8208;a process previously deemed challenging. This method is distinguished by its mild reaction conditions, extensive substrate compatibility, and high chemo&#8208;selectivity and regioselectivity. This facile elimination can be plausibly attributed to phenoxide anion&#8211;secondary trifluoromethylated alkyl bromides weak interactions.

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Chloro and &#945;,&#945; &#8208;Dichloro acetamidines via the Carbenoids Addition to Inherently Low Electrophilic Carbodiimides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hitherto few explored &#945;&#8208;halomethyl amidine motif has been assembled through the addition of a lithiated (di)&#8208;halomethane (i.e. carbenoid) to easily accessible N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl substituted carbodiimides. Despite the inherent low electrophilicity of these heterocumulenes &#8211; as quantitatively determined in Mayr&#8217;s previous studies &#8211; their sp&#8208;hybridized carbon atom acts as a competent site of attack for these tamed nucleophiles. The overall high&#8208;yielding transformation featuring a genuine chemoselective profile &#8211; as documented by employing variously functionalized materials &#8211; is adaptable to the addition of dihalogenated carbenoids. Reaction products could be advantageously employed in nucleophilic substitution sequences, as well as, in further functionalization of the nitrogen atoms due to the constitutive heteroallyl&#8208;type skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>eAmidation: An Electrochemical Amidation of Aldehydes via the Oxidation of N&#8208;Aryl Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the use of electrochemistry has emerged as a powerful yet sustainable means of enabling key transformations. Amidation is one of the most frequently executed transformations in synthetic chemistry, and using an electrochemical approach, the current study has demonstrated the synthesis of amides from aldehydes and amines. Mechanistic work indicates that the reaction proceeds via the oxidation of an intermediate hydrazone to generate an acyl diazene as the acylating species. The protocol developed has enabled the synthesis of a broad range of amides, including access to pharmaceutically relevant products, directly from aldehydes without recourse for hazardous chemical oxidants and activating agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand controlled regio&#8208;divergent [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of alkynes by merging electrochemistry and nickel catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions between three alkynes, a diyne and an alkyne, or a triyne offer a straightforward and typical protocol toward all kinds of polysubstituted benzens. Herein, the synthesis of polysubstituted aromatics through electrochemical nickel catalyzed cyclotrimerization of alkynes is developed. The regio&#8208;divergent cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes was achieved by judicious choice of ligands. And tributylphosphine, sterically hindered bipyridine or &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands delivered 1,2,4&#8208; and 1,3,5&#8208;substituted aromatics with high regioselectivities respectively. Besides, the semi&#8208;intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between	diynes and alkynes are also amenable under this catalytic system. This approach operates without metal reductant, exhibits wide functional groups tolerance, ease of scalability and furnishes 75 examples with moderate to good yields, including some biorelevant compounds. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculation revealed the catalytic pathways of 1,3,5&#8208; and 1,2,4&#8208;cyclotrimerizations, and the origin of the ligand controlled regioselectivity.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydration reactions of diynes to access tetrasubstituted cyclohexenones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;carboalkoxy&#8208;3&#8208;substituted&#8208;cyclohexenones are powerful building blocks for the synthesis of a variety of bioactive target molecules. Their preparations requires multi&#8208;steps sequence involving the use of stoichiometric quantities of various reagents, while the catalytic approaches are limitited to trisubstituted cyclohexenones. We describe here an efficient catalytic approach based on gold(I)&#8208;catalysis starting from unsymmetrical diynyl mono&#8208;ester or symmetrical diynyl di&#8208;ester substrates. The carbon chain linking the two alkyne functions can bear two or one substituent, or even be unsubstituted. Regardless of the nature of the substrates and independently of its substitution, the cyclohexenone derivatives are cleanly produced.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(II) complex dispersed in imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid: Recyclable catalyst system for regioselective and chemoselective hydrobromination and hydrochlorination of alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a recyclable catalyst system combining Cu(II)O and 4,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline in a 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid for the hydrohalogenation of alkynes. The reaction efficiently yields alkenyl bromides and chlorides with good functional group tolerance and regioselectivity across a range of functionalized alkynes. Remarkably, the reaction exhibits unprecedented chemoselectivity for alkyne over alkenes in polyenynes and enables late&#8208;stage modifications to rapidly synthesize brominated polyenes. The catalyst system could be recycled for up to six runs without significant reduction of the reaction yield.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Click reactions display many of the goals desired for more sustainable chemical
conversions.  Yet, the solvent used is an often overlooked aspect in determining the
environmental impact of reactions. In the current paper we develop the first
mechanochemical method for the efficient and solvent&#8208;free SuFEx reaction of sulfonyl
fluorides with a wide range of phenols.  After outlining the optimization process, which
yields an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use and robust method, we provide indications of the very wide

natural phenols that also display other functionalities, and several gram&#8208;scale
