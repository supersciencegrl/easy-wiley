         <dc:description>Carbene insertion into the C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds of internal alkenes was enabled in air by HFIP (1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol) as both the mediator and solvent through its cooperation with borane B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the catalyst. 3&#8208;Diazooxindoles and 3&#8208;diazoindolin&#8208;2&#8208;imines were amenable to work as the carbene precursors, and &#945;&#8208;oxo ketene dithioacetals acted as the internal alkenes at ambient temperature. The present synthetic protocol features metal&#8208;free conditions, diverse substituent tolerance, and 47&#8208;84% yields, offering an efficient route to 3&#8208;vinylated oxindole and indole derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis&#8208;Base Dependent (3 + 3) Annulations of Acetoxy Allenoates with Iminoindolines: &#945;&#8208;Carboline Scaffolds with Varied Substituents</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lewis base dependent (3 + 3) annulations of &#946;&#8242;/&#948;&#8208;acetoxy allenoates with iminoindolines offer &#945;&#8208;carbolines with varying substituents depending on the base used as well as subtle changes in the reaction conditions. The phosphine&#8208;catalyzed annulation of &#948;&#8208;acetoxy allenoates with iminoindolines involves 6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization, tosyl anion elimination/ trapping, and ethyl acetate elimination as key steps in delivering &#946;&#8208;H and &#947;&#8208;tosyl containing &#945;&#8208;carbolines. An unobvious elimination (by C&#945;&#8208;C&#946; bond cleavage) of the &#8208;CH2CO2Et moiety is observed here. The same reactants under DBU catalysis offer &#945;&#8208;carbolines that retain &#8211;CH2CO2Et moiety but are devoid of &#8211;Ts group via 6&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization. The reaction of &#946;&#8242;&#8208;acetoxy allenoate with iminoindolines is completely tertiary amine dependent; the use of DABCO affords tetrahydro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;carbolines exclusively with excellent stereoselectivity while DBU offers substituted &#945;&#8208;carbolines that are distinct from those using DABCO. Several control experiments and HRMS studies have been done in support of a plausible reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>An acid Promoted, Domino Approach for the Selective Synthesis of Spirocyclic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design and development of an acid&#8208;catalyzed domino strategy for the rapid and selective generation of spiro&#8208;polycyclic systems from propargylic alcohols is reported. Isolation of the intermediate olefins and the control experiments suggested and supported the proposed mechanism. The key features of this strategy are the selective access to spiro&#8208;polycyclic systems, broad substrate scope (yields ranging between 50&#8208;95%), high atom economy, and operationally simple reaction procedure. We have extended this approach for the synthesis of spiro&#8208;tetracyclic and spiro&#8208;pentacyclic frameworks of dalesconols, and chamaecydin natural products respectively</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Heteroannulation for the Synthesis of Quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;Carboxamides Bearing Axial Chirality</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An iron(III) triflate&#8208;catalyzed Friedl&#228;nder&#8208;type heteroannulation of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxoamides with &#945;&#8208;methylene carbonyl derivatives has been established, allowing facile access to a range of biologically interesting quinoline&#8208;containing tertiary
amides in good yields. Investigations into the configurational stability of products led to the identification of a new type of stable axially chiral quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxamide bearing a sterically demanding phenylsulfonyl C3&#8208;substituent. Subsequently, an enantioselective catalytic variant was attempted. The employment of copper(&#8545;) catalysis using a chiral bisoxazoline ligand was found to be
capable of providing moderate enantiocontrol.</dc:description>

Abstract
Under the open&#8208;vessel atmosphere conditions, the one&#8208;pot synthesis of bis&#8208;sulfonyl dibenzooxabicyclo[5.5.0]dodecanes was developed by double substitution of 1,3&#8208;dichloroacetone with arenesulfinic acid sodium salts, and C&#8208; and O&#8208;alkylation of the resulting 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;sulfonylacetones with 2&#8197;equivalents of o&#8208;bis(bromomethyl)arenes. A plausible mechanism is proposed and discussed. This high&#8208;yielding protocol provides an intermolecular substitution and an intramolecular ring&#8208;closure via the formations of three carbon&#8722;carbon single (C&#8722;C) bonds, two carbon&#8722;sulfur single (C&#8722;S) bonds, and one carbon&#8722;oxygen single (C&#8722;O) bond.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed multicomponent oxysulfonylation of alkenes with cyclobutanone oxime esters and hydroxamic acids via the insertion of sulfur dioxide has been developed. This reaction uses K2S2O5 as the sulfur dioxide surrogate and the in&#8197;situ generated amidoxyl radical as radical interceptor, thus providing a direct approach to &#946;&#8208;amidoxy sulfones in 35&#8211;90% yields. Mechanistic studies revealed that a radical&#8208;radical coupling reaction of the alkyl radical and amidoxyl radical might be involved in this transformation.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Perfluoroalkylation/Cyclization of Unactivated Alkenes: Synthesis of Perfluoroalkylated Tricyclimidazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed cascade difunctionalization of unactivated olefins with readily available Rf&#8208;I reagents to construct Csp3&#8722;CF2/C&#8722;C bonds has been reported. This strategy provides a convenient access to a variety of useful perfluoroalkylated tricyclimidazole derivatives in reasonable yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the present reaction probably undergo a radical/SET (single electron transfer) pathway. The transformation features mild condition, simple operation, atomic economy, and broad substrate scope.

Abstract
We report a strategy for the preparation of 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl sulfoxonium ylides from &#945;&#8208;diazoketones and sulfoxonium ylides. The transformation is achieved based on the blue&#8208;LEDs&#8208;promoted Wolff rearrangement of the &#945;&#8208;diazoketones, and the nucleophilic nature of the sulfoxonium ylides. A large array of products was prepared to demonstrate the substrate scope and functional group tolerance. A plausible mechanism was proposed for this transformation based on the experimental results. Furthermore, the synthetic utility of the products was explored.

         <title>Recent Advances in Catalytic Asymmetric Syntheses of Functionalized Heterocycles via Halogenation/Chalcogenation of Carbon&#8208;Carbon Unsaturated Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Halogen (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine) or chalcogen (sulfur, selenium)&#8208;containing heterocycles are widely recognized as key building blocks in many natural products and bioactive targets. Catalytic asymmetric halogenation/chalcogenation of carbon&#8208;carbon unsaturated bonds via onium ion transformations are efficient methods to obtain diverse chiral heterocyclic backbones. In the past few years, catalytic enantioselective versions of halo/thio/seleno&#8208;functionalizations with various halogen and chalcogen electrophiles have experienced constant development. This review highlights those advances in preparing functionalized heterocycles promoted by chiral organocatalysts or metal&#8208;based catalysts.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Carboxylic acid compounds are important structural units that exist widely in nature; the only byproduct in the decarboxylation process is carbon dioxide, which is non&#8208;flammable, non&#8208;toxic, and easy to remove. Therefore, decarboxylative reactions are of great importance in synthetic chemistry. Heterocyclic compounds are important backbones that constitute a variety of biologically active molecules; therefore, research into the development of new synthetic tactics for heterocyclic derivatives based on decarboxylative cyclization is of great interest. In this paper, we describe metal&#8208;catalyzed, visible light&#8208;driven, electrochemically enabled, decarboxylative cyclization reactions, as well as other types, that have been rapidly developed in the past five years; moreover, for some of these methods, we discuss the scope of their application and the mechanism of the reaction. 1.

         <title>Photobiocatalytic Cascades for Acylating N&#8208;Heterocycles with Natural Amino Acids via the 2&#8208;Keto Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Photobiocatalysis fully utilizing the unique reactivity of photocatalysis and efficient transforming biobased feedstocks of biocatalysis represents a promising approach for future green synthesis. However, photobiocatalytic cascade with biobased starting substrates has been rarely reported. Here, we present photobiocatalytic cascades that modify the N&#8208;heterocycle with keto acids biocatalytically synthesized from natural amino acids. The types of aliphatic, aromatic, and polar natural amino acids are compatible with the photobiocatalytic cascades system. In addition, the cascade is compatible with a range of N&#8208;heterocycles with moderate to good yield (up to 82%). Furthermore, the cascade system can reach gram scale (0.91&#8197;g) with a good separation yield, demonstrating the potential for scaling up production to practical application. This photobiocatalytic cascade can synthesize a range of important N&#8208;heterocyclic derivatives from natural amino acids in a green fashion and paves the way for greener synthesis by combining biocatalysis and photocatalysis.

Here, we present photobiocatalytic cascades that modify the N-heterocycle with keto acids biocatalytically synthesized from natural amino acids. The types of aliphatic, aromatic, and polar natural amino acids are compatible with the photobiocatalytic cascades system. In addition, the cascade is compatible with a range of N-heterocycles with moderate to good yield (up to 82%). Furthermore, the cascade system can reach gram scale (0.91&#8197;g) with a good separation yield, demonstrating the potential for scaling up production to practical application. This photobiocatalytic cascade can synthesize a range of important N-heterocyclic derivatives from natural amino acids in a green fashion and paves the way for greener synthesis by combining biocatalysis and photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
K3PO4&#8208;mediated cycloannulation of (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;iodovinyl sulfones with ortho&#8208;hydroxy chalcones/ortho&#8208;hydroxy cinnamates has been realized to access 2,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted&#8208;4H&#8208;benzopyran derivatives. A metal&#8208;free tandem oxa&#8208;Michael addition and cycloannulation allows the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of the corresponding 3&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;4H&#8208;benzopyrans in good to high yields. More importantly, one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component reaction between (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;iodovinyl sulfones, 2&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehydes, and phosphonium ylides has been established for the synthesis of 4H&#8208;chromene derivatives in moderate to good yields. Notably, this metal&#8208;free process features a broad substrate scope and easy elaboration into numerous multifaceted chromene products, including bioactive estrone&#8208;derivative. The present protocol is sustainable at the gram scale reactions, and post&#8208;synthetic applications were also demonstrated. A plausible mechanism is also presented on the basis of existing experimental results.

Abstract
The synthesis of fused dihydropyran isoxazole derivatives has been developed by employing an intermolecular inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of readily available alkylidene isoxazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones with unactivated alkenes. The reaction was promoted by inexpensive and commercially available BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O without the use of metal Lewis acids. This cycloaddition transformation could proceed under mild conditions with broad substrate scope, providing a variety of bicyclic 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrano[3,2&#8208;d]isoxazoles.

Abstract
A metal&#8208;free cascade annulation of propagylamines with amidines for divergent synthesis of polysubstituted imidazoles and 4&#8208;alkenylquinazolines has been developed. The reaction is believed to proceed by sequential 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition of amidines to propargylamines, 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig annulation/aromatization to form the polysubstituted imidazoles, and nucleophilic addition/elimination/aromatization to quinazoline skeleton. In this reaction, a broad range of electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;neutral, and electron&#8208;deficient propagylamines react well with amidines to give polysubstituted imidazoles and 4&#8208;alkenylquinazolines in 53&#8211;93% yields. Moreover, the utility of this method was showcased by gram&#8208;scale experiments and synthetic transformations of the product.

Abstract
Synthesis of heterocycles from 1,2&#8208;diarylalkene derivatives through electrosynthesis under metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions has been discovered. Cathodic reduction of 2&#8208;alkenylbenzoic acid or anodic oxidation of 2&#8208;alkenylbenzamide, 2&#8208;alkenylphenol and 2&#8208;alkenylaniline leads to the formation of reactive radical intermediates which afford corresponding phthalide, isochroman&#8208;1&#8208;one, isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;one, benzofuran, and indole in satisfying yields with good functional group tolerance. Interestingly, different chemoselectivities were found in different reaction solvents. Several mechanistic investigations including cyclic voltammetry studies and control experiments were carried out to elucidate the reaction mechanisms.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction for selective aerobic oxidative C&#8722;C bond cleavage of &#946;&#8208;alkyl nitroolefins and subsequent oxidative amidation with amines or amides was reported. The reaction all exhibited high selectivities and gave the corresponding &#945;&#8208;ketoamides with 66&#8211;88% yields.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copper-catalyzed cascade reaction for selective aerobic oxidative C&#8722;C bond cleavage of &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl nitroolefins and subsequent oxidative amidation with amines or amides was reported. The reaction all exhibited high selectivities and gave the corresponding &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-ketoamides with 66&#8211;88% yields. The mechanistic study revealed that the NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-directed aerobic oxidative C&#8722;C bond cleavage occurred on more electron-rich allylic nitro tautomers, which originated from the equilibrium of conjugated nitroalkenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
We have developed an electrochemical method for phosphorothiolation of 2H&#8208;indazoles using S&#8208;hydrogen phosphorothioates via cross dehydrogenative coupling reaction under metal&#8208;free and electrolyte&#8208;free conditions. This protocol is compatible with electron donating groups like &#8722;Me, &#8722;OMe, halogen and elctron withdrawing groups such as &#8722;COOEt, affording respective indazolyl phosphorothioates in 62%&#8208;91% yields. Comprehensive mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds through a radical pathway.

         <title>Organocatalyzed One&#8208;Pot Sequential Deracemization of Aromatic Ketones Bearing a Tertiary Stereogenic Center</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An organocatalyzed one&#8208;pot sequential deracemization of aromatic ketones bearing a stereogenic center at the &#945;&#8208;position was achieved thanks to an acid&#8208;base strategy involving an enantioselective protonation reaction as a key step. This simple and efficient protocol yields enantioenriched ketones in up to 89% ee without the need to isolate sensitive intermediates such as silyl enolates. The key role of water in this process was underlined. This one&#8208;pot sequence constitutes a useful extension to previously reported chemically driven red&#8208;ox protocols, thus increasing the panel of molecules eligible to a deracemization strategy.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Carbothiolation via Rearrangement of S&#8208;Propargyl Group: An Access to 3&#8208;Allenyl or 3&#8208;Indenyl Benzo[b]thiophenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of 3&#8208;allenyl benzo[b]thiophenes were synthesized through a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction. The process consists in a 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization with C&#8208;S bond formation and consecutive S&#8208;to&#8208;C propargyl migration via [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic Claisen rearrangement. With aryl substituents on both triple bonds of the substrate, subsequent intramolecular hydroarylation on the formed allenyl system led to 3&#8208;indenyl benzo[b]thiophenes. From a substrate bearing a 3&#8208;butynol moiety diverse fused O&#8208;heterocycles have been obtained via intramolecular hydroalkoxylation. A gold&#8208;mediated 1,3&#8208;migration involving allenyl to propargyl rearrangement is also described.</dc:description>

Abstract
Benzannulation and N&#8208;annulation of &#946;&#8208;ketoenamines by the in&#8208;situ generated methyl(methylene)sulfonium ion from the reaction of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane (DBE) was achieved. The &#946;&#8208;ketoenamines underwent N&#8208;annulation to pyridine derivatives, while the N&#8208;alkylated enamines were benzannulated to afford substituted anilines. The utility of the intermediate methyl(methylene)sulfonium ion was further extended for synthesizing methylene&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds.

         <title>RuH&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Diaryl Ketones via Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aromatic Enones with Aromatic Aldehydes and Mechanistic Insights</title>

Abstract
RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of alkenyl ketones with aldehydes has been extended to the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;diaryl 1,3&#8208;diketones. The reaction has been successfully applied to the synthesis of PPT (propyl pyrazole triol), a selective estrogen receptor modulator compound. A study of the stoichiometric reaction of phenyl vinyl ketone with RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 has revealed that the &#946;&#8208;ruthenium ketone PhCOCH2CH2RuCl(CO)(PPh3)2, a five&#8208;membered ruthenacycle is formed with liberation of one molecule of PPh3. The observed catalytic activity of this ruthenacycle in the presence of PPh3 suggests that it serves as a resting state, in equilibrium with an oxa&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl ruthenium species, which is the key coupling partner with aldehyde substrates.

Abstract
A set of complex tricyclic compounds containing several functional groups and multiple stereogenic centers has been prepared in only two steps with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The synthesis takes advantage of the highly versatile and enantioselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution of simple cyclic allylic acetates or carbonates to form chiral 1,6&#8208;, 1,7&#8208; and 1,8&#8208;enynes, which are then diastereoselectively transformed to the corresponding cyclopentenone&#8208; and cyclobutene&#8208;based tricyclic compounds.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Oxygen Transfer to Alkynylsulfones: A Diazo&#8208;Free Route to 4&#8208;Sulfonyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;Oxazoles</title>

Abstract
The gold&#8208;catalyzed annulation of alkynylsulfones, involving pyridine N&#8208;oxides (as O&#8208;atom transfer reagents) and nitriles (as C=N synthons), comprises a diazo&#8208;free route to valuable 4&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazoles. This reaction operates under relatively mild conditions (IPrAuNTf2 5&#8197;mol&#8201;%, rt or 60&#8201;&#176;C), and a number of functionalities was compatible (35 examples; 14&#8211;95%). In most cases, the SO2 fragment, which is typically expulsed in the previously reported Au&#8208;catalyzed O&#8208;transfers to alkynylsulfones, retains in the heterocyclic products. The postulated reaction mechanism suggests a key role of reactive gold &#945;&#8208;oxo carbene intermediates formed via the O&#8208;atom transfer.

Abstract
3&#8208;(2H)&#8208;isoxazolone is an important skeletal structure in medicinal and agricultural chemistry. However, its synthetic methodology has limited substrate scope and requires unconventional substrate synthesis. Meanwhile, gold&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular oxidative cross&#8208;coupling involving the 5/6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of substrates bearing an ynone structure has not been reported because of an undesirable protonation as a side&#8208;reaction. Thus, we hypothesized that the reactivity of cyclic N&#8208;alkoxypropiolamides would suppress protonation and allow dual functionalization. As a result, sequential gold&#8208;catalyzed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization, oxidative cross&#8208;coupling, and hydroxylation of N&#8208;alkoxypropiolamides was developed to synthesize 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;(2H)&#8208;isoxazolones with a hydroxy group. In an optimization study, dimethylformamide (DMF) and H2O were effective solvents for the sequential reaction. This method enabled 3&#8208;(2H)&#8208;isoxazolone backbone synthesis with the introduction of an aryl and hydroxy group in a single procedure. Moreover, a tolerance toward reactive functional groups, such as ketocarbonyl groups, was observed. Some chemical transformations of the synthesized 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;(2H)&#8208;isoxazolone were conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of functional group interconversion, C&#8722;C bond formation, and additional heterocycle synthesis. Notably, a fluorescent tetracyclic heterocycle was obtained by intramolecular oxidative cross&#8208;coupling. Control experiments indicated that the reactivity for protonation was suppressed by an alkoxyamide moiety. Therefore, the chemoselectivity of oxyarylation was improved. Finally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to estimate the reaction pathway, which suggested that ring&#8208;opening involving solvents (H2O or DMF) is important for these sequential reactions.

Abstract
Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of maleimides followed by an annulation sequence for the synthesis of polycyclic azaheterocycles in one pot. The reaction proceeds under redox&#8208;neutral conditions and is compatible with various functional groups. Notably, the as&#8208;prepared product exhibits potential photophysical properties.

Abstract
Herein, we report a gram&#8208;scale synthesis of perdeuterated linoleic acid&#8208;d31. The starting materials for the synthesis are two saturated fatty acids, azelaic acid&#8208;d14 and pentanoic acid&#8208;d9, which can be obtained by metal catalysed hydrothermal hydrogen&#8208;deuterium exchange. The synthesis utilises the fatty acids directly via decarboxylative coupling. Copper catalysed coupling of a terminal alkyne intermediate with a propargyl bromide derivative affords a skipped diyne, which can be reduced using P&#8208;2 nickel to obtain the desired cis,cis&#8208;diene geometry. The subsequent synthesis of the tail&#8208;deuterated phospholipid, 1&#8208;palmitoyl&#8208;2&#8208;linoleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine&#8208;d62 (PLPC&#8208;d62) is also described. Optimised reaction conditions were developed to access this phospholipid and its regioisomeric purity was characterised by two complementary mass spectrometry techniques.

Abstract
The combination of organolithium chemistry with gold catalysis has enabled the development of a synthetic strategy for accessing polysubstituted indoles and carbazoles from readily available starting materials. This method is based on a &#8220;back&#8208;to&#8208;front&#8221; approach from ketopyrroles, generated by intramolecular carbolithiation of N,N&#8208;bis&#8208;(2&#8208;lithioallyl)amines that evolve into 3,4&#8208;bis(lithiomethyl)dihydropyrrole intermediates capable of reacting with carboxylic esters and Weinreb amides. These ketopyrroles have demonstrated to be excellent precursors of mono or bis(alkynols)pyrroles that, under gold&#8208;catalysis, experience a benzannulation reaction providing access to regioselectively substituted indoles or carbazoles.

Abstract
Lewis base and Br&#248;nsted base controlled chemodivergent annulations of &#945;&#8208;methyl substituted allenyl imide and o&#8208;aminotrifluoroacetophenones are realized to afford highly valuable furo[3,2&#8208;b]indol&#8208;2&#8208;ones and dihydroquinolines bearing a CF3&#8208;substituted quaternary stereogenic center. The possible reaction mechanisms are proposed through deuterium labelling experiments. This work demonstrates the unprecedented dual reactivities of &#945;&#8208;methyl substituted allenyl imide with electrophilic&#8722;nucleophilic compounds in annulation reactions, and features chemodivergence in transforming allenyl imide through &#946;&#8217;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization via phosphine catalysis and &#946;/&#947;&#8208;bisfunctionalization via Br&#248;nsted base catalysis.

The front cover image illustrates the successful production of &#8220;heavy&#8221; deuterated linoleic acid. Deuterium was installed at the beginning of the synthesis via hydrothermal deuteration of readily available saturated fatty acids. The fatty acids were stitched together to ultimately afford the requisite cis,cis&#8208;skipped diene of linoleic acid. Deuterated linoleic acid is required for the production of labelled biologically relevant linoleoyl lipids, whereby deuteration facilitates various experimental techniques. This was demonstrated by the synthesis of tail deuterated 1&#8208;palmitoyl&#8208;d31&#8208;2&#8208;linoleoyl&#8208;d31&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine (PLPC&#8208;d62).

Abstract
Electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWG) have emerged as a powerful tool for the activation of various arenes to promote nucleophilic dearomative additions for the construction of complicated chiral cyclic structures under asymmetric catalytic systems. Nitro&#8208;indoles, nitro&#8208;benzofurans/benzothiophenes, and related nitro&#8208;heteroarenes are widely applied in the reaction with various nucleophiles to construct various enantioenriched polycyclic skeletons via the asymmetric dearomatization process. Meanwhile, the electron&#8208;deficient azo&#8208;group and nitroso&#8208;group are an alternative powerful tool for the activation of arenes, which enable formal nucleophilic aromatic arylations with various electrophilic aromatics to construct novel chiral biaryl atropisomers. Besides, azo&#8208;naphthanenes are served as dipolar surrogates in the reaction with nucleophilic dipolarophiles to proceed asymmetric cycloadditions to construct chiral polycyclic skeletons. The EWG&#8208;tethered arene has proven to be a versatile protocol for the construction of structurally diversified chiral backbones. This review summarizes the latest progress of the EWG&#8208;tethered arenes involved asymmetric transformations under organo&#8208; or transition metal catalysis.

Abstract
A K2S2O8&#8208;promoted nitration/spirocyclization of biaryl ynones using inexpensive NaNO2 as nitro source has been described. This cascade reaction is triggered by nitration of alkyne and followed by 6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig spirocyclization, dearomatization, forming the NO2&#8208;containing spiro[5.5]trienones in 63&#8211;85% yields. The present reaction also provides a practical method for the synthesis of nitrated indenones and thioflavones with 58&#8211;85% yields.

Abstract
The synthesis of benzofurans from readily accessible sulfur ylides and ortho&#8208;hydroxy aryl alkynes is reported. The transformation proceeds through an isomerization/nucleophilic addition/cyclization/aromatization cascade. The substrate scope is very general with respect to both reactants and the products are afforded in 43&#8211;94% yield under conditions which are catalyst&#8208;free and additive&#8208;free.

Abstract
A metal&#8208;free hydrogenation of quinoxalines and indoles with Me3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3 and TFA in water at room temperature is reported. The protocol is featured with the usage of environmentally friendly water as the solvent, no need of metal catalyst and broad substrate scope. Sensitive functional groups such as OH&#8208;, NH2&#8208;, Cl&#8208;, Br&#8208;, especially &#8208;CN and &#8208;CO2Me were well tolerated. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested that TFA and Me3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3 provided the proton and hydride sources for the product, respectively.

Abstract
A manganese&#8208;catalyzed regioselective ring&#8208;opening peroxidation of cyclobutanols has been disclosed. With this protocol, the C(sp3)&#8722;OOBu&#8208;t bond could be efficiently constructed via the radical&#8208;mediated C&#8722;C bond cleavage/coupling, allowing the facile access to a variety of 4&#8208;oxo peroxides. Besides, the obtained peroxidation products could be readily transformed into other synthetically attractive skeletons.

         <dc:description>An efficient synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQ) via a Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of ortho&#8208;bromophenethyl tosylamides with aryl N&#8208;tosylhydrazones in the presence of base was developed. The reaction is believed to proceed via the oxidative addition of palladium with ortho&#8208;bromophenethyl tosylamides, followed by carbene insertion and cyclization. The carbene species were generated in&#8208;situ from the aryl N&#8208;tosylhydrazones and KOtBu.

Abstract
An I2/K2S2O8 mediated multiple &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization reaction for the construction of polysubstituted furans has been established from readily available ethyl ketones and dimethyl sulfoxide. This transformation features dimethyl sulfoxide as a multipurpose precursor, acting as the precursor of the oxygen, methyl, and sulfur methyl units. Six new chemical bonds, involving two C&#8722;C, two C&#8722;O, and one C&#8722;S bonds were formed sequentially during the intermolecular oxidative annulation process.

         <title>Unexpected Stereoselective Access to 2&#8208;Aminooxazolines from Propargyl Ureas by Silver Salts under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Propargyl ureas can lead to a range of possible heterocyclic compounds, mainly depending on the employed catalyst. Silver salts are known to promote the N&#8208;5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization mode to imidazolidinone derivatives. Conversely, a versatile and stereoselective O&#8208;5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization of propargyl ureas to 2&#8208;aminooxazolines by Ag(I) catalysis is here disclosed. Good to excellent yields and complete stereoselectivity of the external double bond have been achieved under milder reaction conditions (50&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C). A one&#8208;pot protocol starting from the corresponding propargylic amines and isocyanates has been developed as well. N,N&#8217;&#8208;Dipropargyl ureas underwent a uncommon O&#8208;5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig/N&#8208;5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig double cyclization sequence. Finally, insights into the tautomeric equilibrium of 2&#8208;aminooxazoles and on their relative reactivity are provided.

Abstract
Polycyclic heterocyclic derivatives have been synthesized in one step by a carbonylative double cyclization approach starting from readily available starting materials. The method is based on a regioselective 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig heterocyclization &#8211; cyclocarbonylation sequence catalyzed by the PdI2/KI catalytic system under oxidative conditions, with CO (5&#8211;10&#8197;atm) as the carbonylating agent and O2 (from air, 35&#8211;70&#8197;atm) as the external oxidant and formation of water as benign coproduct. Starting from thiophenecarboxylic acids bearing an &#969;&#8208;hydroxyalkynyl substituent in vicinal position, previously unknown 1H&#8208;furo[3,4&#8208;b]thieno[3,2&#8208;d]pyran&#8208;1,5(3H)&#8208;diones, 4H&#8208;furo[3,4&#8208;b]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]pyran&#8208;4,8(6H)&#8208;diones, 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H,6H&#8208;pyrano[4,3&#8208;b]thieno[3,2&#8208;d]pyran&#8208;1,6&#8208;diones, and 6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H,9H&#8208;pyrano[4,3&#8208;b]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]pyran&#8208;4,9&#8208;diones were obtained in 45&#8211;86% yields over 21 examples.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced acylation aromatization of para&#8208;quinone methides to access &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diarylated ketones was realized with cheap and readily available carboxylic acids as acylating reagents via deoxygenation. The synthetic method avoids the tedious preparation of reactants or catalysts and shows a broad substrate scope (34 examples) under mild conditions. Notably, the late&#8208;stage functionalization of some drug molecules could also be achieved via this protocol.

         <title>Synthesis of Phenanthrene&#8208;Based Polycycles by Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of Biphenyl&#8208;Embedded Trienynes</title>

Abstract
Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of o&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;o&#8217;&#8208;alkynylbiaryls in the presence of external or internal nucleophiles provides a straightforward access to phenanthrene&#8208;based polycycles, which are of considerable interest in materials science. Thus, their reactions with alcohols yield functionalized dihydrophenanthrenes, in a process that can also be carried out intramolecularly, to provide phenanthrene&#8208;derived heteropolycyclic compounds. Moreover, benzo[b]triphenylenes can be synthesized from o&#8208;methoxyvinyl&#8208;o&#8217;&#8208;alkynylbiaryls, in a reaction in which an (hetero)aryl substituent at the triple bond acts as an internal nucleophile.

         <title>Photoredox/Ti Dual&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydroxylation of Cyclobutanone Oximes for &#947;&#8208;Cyanoalkyl Radical Generation: Access to Cyanoalkyl&#8208;Substituted Oxoindolines</title>

Abstract
In this work, we have established a photoredox/Ti dual&#8208;catalyzed dehydroxylation of cyclobutanone oximes. The resulting &#947;&#8208;cyanoalkyl radicals undergo a cascade radical addition/cyclization with N&#8208;acrylamides to afford cyanoalkyl substituted oxoindolines under mild conditions. This reaction also exhibits broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance. Furthermore, it is applicable to late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules and gram&#8208;scale synthesis, which illustrates its potential value in organic synthesis.

Abstract
A controlled access to 1&#8208;aryl 2,3&#8208;diiodo&#8208;carbazoles involving iodine transposition has been accomplished directly from acyclic precursors. The 2,3&#8208;diiodo&#8208;carbazole core was prone to further chemoselective decoration at C3&#8722;I or double difunctionalization.

         <title>Selective Intermolecular Dual Amino&#8208;Trifluoromethylation of Alkenes by High&#8208;Valent Cu(III)&#8722;CF3 Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A selective intermolecular amino&#8208;trifluoromethylation of alkenes is developed to produce a range of biologically active &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethyl amines. This method exploits a crucial high&#8208;valent Cu(III)&#8722;CF3 complex as a combined source of CF3 radical and Cu(II) oxidant through homolytic Cu(III)&#8722;CF3 bond cleavage. This unique mode of CF3 radical generation is distinct from current dominant methods that rely largely on photoredox catalysis or the use of sacrificing radical initiator. This represents a significant advantage in that it greatly simplifies the reaction conditions, brings about operational convenience, and is beneficial to suppress various side reactions under otherwise more complicated conditions. A tertiary alkyl radical generated from addition of CF3 radical to alkenes is proposed to react with amines to enable C&#8722;N formation with the assistance of in&#8208;situ Cu(II) oxidant. This reaction shows good chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectivity, suppressing a number of potential side reactions. The free manipulation of readily available Cu(III)&#8722;CF3 compound and feedstock compounds of alkenes and anilines greatly broadens the reaction scope. The good chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, and operational convenience make this reaction attractive from the synthetic viewpoint. The reactivity of high&#8208;valent Cu(III)&#8722;CF3 compounds disclosed in this study may be exploited to develop other interesting reactions, and to enrich the currently underdeveloped Cu(III) chemistry.

Abstract
The electrochemical intramolecular cross&#8208;dehydrogenative C(sp2)&#8722;H/N&#8722;H coupling of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazones resulting in substituted pyrazoles has been discovered. The process is catalyzed by hypervalent iodine species generated in&#8197;situ through anodic oxidation of aryl iodide in fluorinated alcohol media. The formation of hypervalent iodine compound and its key role in the construction of a new C&#8722;N bond was confirmed with CV and NMR experiments. A wide range of substituted pyrazoles were obtained in yields ranging from 46% to 88%.

Abstract
Several cobalt(II) complexes supported by tetradentate aminobenzimidazole (N4) ligands and a tridentate nitrogen (N3) ligand have been prepared and characterized. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis indicates that the cobalt complex of BPMB (BPMB=1,2&#8208;bis((S)&#8208;2&#8208;(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) pyrrolidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane) ligand shows a distorted octahedral configuration. These cobalt(II) complexes can catalyze the transfer hydrogenation reaction of simple olefins with ammonia borane as a hydrogen source, and a variety of terminal olefins can be reduced to corresponding alkanes in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. Note that Co&#8722;N3 complex provides an inferior outcome than those of Co&#8722;N4 complexes.

         <dc:description>Herein, we report the catalytic 1,6&#8208;addition of chiral alkyl copper nucleophiles, in&#8208;situ generated from borylalkenes and a copper&#8208;hydride catalyst under mild conditions. Chemo&#8208; and stereoselective control was crucial in this reductive coupling process of borylalkenes and para&#8208;quinone methides, sequentially forming adjacent stereogenic centers with good diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Through the multicomponent and catalytic tandem reactions, asymmetric 1,6&#8208;adducts of p&#8208;quinone methides were efficiently synthesized.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Structurally Diverse (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;Lactams via an Engineered Amine Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optically pure lactams have a wide diversity of applications, one of which is serving as important intermediates in the synthesis of agricultural bioactive compounds or pharmaceuticals. Efficient stereoselective synthesis of chiral lactams with low&#8208;cost amine donors under mild conditions is desired for manufacturing of these important chemicals. Herein, a two&#8208;step chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy has been designed to produce (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;lactams by engineering a natural amine dehydrogenase from Thermoanaerobacter thermohydrosulfuricus (TtherAmDH). TtherAmDH was subjected to eight cycles of directed evolution to enhance its reductive amination activity toward keto acid substrates. The variants showed improved specific activity toward 6 tested substrates and gave high stereoselectivities of up to 99% in the asymmetric synthesis of &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208; lactams. In particular, TtherAmDHV8 showed a 237&#8208;fold higher specific activity toward the model substrate levulinic acid and gave (S)&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone in 99% ee with a space&#8208;time yield of 75.3 g L&#8722;1 d&#8722;1. These results indicate that the engineered amine dehydrogenase TtherAmDH can serve as an efficient biocatalyst for the manufacture of highly valued chiral lactams.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Enhanced C&#8208;H Amination of Cyclic Ethers with Iminoiodinanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A two&#8208;step protocol allowing the C&#8208;H amination of cyclic ethers with iminoiodinanes, followed by the reduction of the resulting intermediate has been developed for the preparation of amino alcohols. The initial C&#8208;H functionalization is accelerated by visible light, improving the reactivity compared to the thermal process performed in the dark. The effect of different substituents on the photochemical reactivity of iminoiodinanes has been studied both experimentally and computationally. Photophysical measurements and DFT calculations were performed to better understand the observed reactivities and corroborate the proposed mechanistic proposal.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Bromotrimethylsilane (TMSBr) promoted benzannulation of o&#8208;alkynylbenzaldehydes and alkynes to yield 1&#8208;naphthyl aryl ketones is reported. The reaction condition is mild, free of metal and pretreatment/protection of the substrates. We found that aryl propargyl alcohols were very effective substrates for this reaction, comparing with other alkynes. Studies on the reaction scope, monitoring the reaction progress by 1H NMR and theoretical calculations suggest that isochromenylium (benzopyrilium) ion is the key reaction intermediate.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we disclosed an electrochemically induced method for the regio&#8208; and stereoselective (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C(sp2)&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of enamides by employing readily available and inexpensive Langlois&#8217; reagent (CF3SO2Na). Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate the involvement of free radicals in the process. The exogenous oxidant&#8208;free reaction proceeds in an undivided electrochemical cell under mild conditions and allows for the accomplishment of the trifluoromethylation products with exclusive E&#8208;selective control. The methodology is featured by catalyst&#8208;free, simple setup, and broad substrate scopes of enamides with good functional group tolerance. Using ArSO2Na as the coupling partner, the corresponding (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C(sp2)&#8208;H arylsulfonylated enamides products are obtained under standard reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A chemo&#8208; and enantioselective protocol for the N&#8208;alkylation of indoles with imines was developed. This process was catalyzed by a BINOL&#8208;derived phosphoric acid catalyst to give the corresponding acyclic aminals of indoles in 46&#8208;99% yields with 70&#8208;98% ee. The application of this method for the &#8220;late&#8208;stage&#8221;  functionalization of a bioactive compound was performed with high efficency. The products showed good stability and enabled many further transformations.</dc:description>

Abstract
A cascade cyclization from Weinreb amide&#8208;tethered methylenecyclopropanes and alkynes has been disclosed in this paper, which extends the umpolung ring opening of methylenecyclopropanes, giving a synthetic approach for the construction of polycyclic cyclopenta[b]naphthalenol framework. In the protocol, four carbon&#8208;carbon bonds and two carbocycles are formed without the use of transition metals, providing a tool for constructing the structure&#8208;related polycyclic compounds.

Abstract
A variety of functionalized 3&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyaryl)indazoles and N&#8208;(tetrahydrofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyaryl)indazoles were prepared in moderate to good yields through a transition metal&#8208;free radical O&#8208;arylation and sequential [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement cascade strategy from N&#8208;hydroxyindazoles and diaryliodonium salts. The equivalents of diaryliodonium salts controlled the formation of the product structures. Mechanistic studies revealed that the O&#8208;arylation and N&#8722;O bond cleavage via [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement involved an intermolecular radical process. The reaction tolerated various sensitive functional groups, such as halides, ester, and aldehyde groups.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Coupling of Potassium Vinyltrifluoroborate with Arenes: A Direct Access to Functionalized Styrene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Herein, we report a Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed direct alkenylation of arenes with readily available vinyltrifluoroborate to direct access to functionalized styrenes. This method tolerates a wide range of functional groups in 33&#8197;examples with excellent site&#8208; and regioselectivity under mild conditions. The synthetic utility was demonstrated through the further transformation of thus&#8208;obtained functionalized styrenes. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that the reaction probably proceeds through an Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation/Suzuki coupling pathway.

Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction followed by dual annulation has been achieved for the synthesis of various triazolo/pyrrolo fused benzofuro&#8208;quinolines from readily available starting materials. The developed protocol proceeds through palladium&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling, benzannulation followed by C&#8722;H activation triggered second annulation reaction cascades in a single pot. In particular, the polycyclic compound formed by this method consists of three different heterocyclic structures: benzofuran, quinoline, and triazole/pyrrole. The method provides simple access to obtain a range of fused benzofurotriazalo/pyrrolo&#8208;quinolines in good to moderate yields.

Abstract
An asymmetric synthesis of a series of tricycle&#8208;fused dispirooxindoles frameworks assembled in different rings was disclosed via multicomponent cascade 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyrones and trifluoroethylisatin ketimines under the catalysis of hydroquinine or (DHQD)2PHAL with 61&#8594;99%&#8197;ee and &gt;19:1&#8197;dr. Meanwhile, these potentially biologically important dispirooxindoles fused pyrrolidinyl/tetrahydropyranone/pyrrolidinyl frame&#8208;works bear eight contiguous stereocenters and functionalized pharmacophores which could further transfer to linaer dispirooxindoles and spirooxindoles bearing epoxyethyl moiety with retentive enantioselectivity.

         <title>Pincer&#8208;Ruthenium Catalyzed Oxygen Mediated Dehydrative Etherification of Alcohols and Ortho&#8208;Alkylation of Phenols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
In the current report, a dehydration strategy has been formulated for the selective etherification of secondary alcohols catalyzed by NNN pincer&#8208;ruthenium(II) carbonyl complexes based on bis(imino)pyridine ligands in the presence of molecular oxygen under solvent&#8208;free and base&#8208;free conditions at 140&#8201;&#176;C. Under these conditions, very high yields (up to 92%, ca. 6133 TON) of the corresponding ethers are obtained at a very low catalyst loading (ca. 0.015&#8197;mol%). Mechanistic studies provide key evidence for the various events that occur during the catalytic cycle. While iodometric titration gives quantitative proof for the liberation of hydrogen peroxide in catalytic amounts and hence confirms the role of oxygen as a co&#8208;catalyst, DFT, HRMS, IR and 13C&#8197;NMR analysis are indicative of the non&#8208;labile nature of the ancillary CO ligand. On the other hand, DFT, NMR and HRMS studies reveal the hemi&#8208;labile nature of the pincer&#8208;ligand in the presence of oxygen. EPR analysis provide conclusive evidence for generation of Ru(III) species via single electron transfer (SET) from O2. Apparently the Ru(III) species (Ph2NN)RuCl2(CO)(OH) is the resting&#8208;state of the etherification reaction and several of its derivatives have been detected by HRMS analysis. The pincer&#8208;ruthenium catalyzed etherification of 1&#8208;phenyl ethanol has been successfully extended not only to various aromatic secondary alcohols but also to the cross&#8208;etherification and/or o&#8208;alkylation of 1&#8208;phenyl ethanols with a variety of phenols.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current report, a dehydration strategy has been formulated for the selective etherification of secondary alcohols catalyzed by NNN pincer-ruthenium(II) carbonyl complexes based on &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;(imino)pyridine ligands in the presence of molecular oxygen under solvent-free and base-free conditions at 140&#8201;&#176;C. Under these conditions, very high yields (up to 92%, ca. 6133 TON) of the corresponding ethers are obtained at a very low catalyst loading (ca. 0.015&#8197;mol%). Mechanistic studies provide key evidence for the various events that occur during the catalytic cycle. While iodometric titration gives quantitative proof for the liberation of hydrogen peroxide in catalytic amounts and hence confirms the role of oxygen as a co-catalyst, DFT, HRMS, IR and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&#8197;NMR analysis are indicative of the non-labile nature of the ancillary CO ligand. On the other hand, DFT, NMR and HRMS studies reveal the hemi-labile nature of the pincer-ligand in the presence of oxygen. EPR analysis provide conclusive evidence for generation of Ru(III) species via single electron transfer (SET) from O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Apparently the Ru(III) species (&lt;sup&gt;Ph2&lt;/sup&gt;NN)RuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)(OH) is the resting-state of the etherification reaction and several of its derivatives have been detected by HRMS analysis. The pincer-ruthenium catalyzed etherification of 1-phenyl ethanol has been successfully extended not only to various aromatic secondary alcohols but also to the cross-etherification and/or &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-alkylation of 1-phenyl ethanols with a variety of phenols. Readily available oxygen and tiny amounts (0.015&#8197;mol%) of pincer-Ru catalyst are the only requirement for this atom-economical and environmentally benign dehydrative etherification reaction which apparently has not been reported thus far.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Exposure of 2b to one atmosphere of dihydrogen gas afforded the diiridium tetrahydride [(1)2Ir2H4][Al{OC(CF3)3}4]2 (3b). The molecular structures of 2a, 2b, and 3b were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. In the latter complex, the positions of the hydrogen atoms in the Ir2H4 core could be refined freely, which had previously proved impossible for the corresponding complex 3a containing the BArF24 anion. Since 2a is an established catalyst for ortho&#8208;directed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE), the performance of 2a and 2b in deuterium labelling reactions was compared for various substrates, including phenylacetic acid derivates and nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Organocatalyzed Functionalization of Tetramic and Tetronic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Organocatalyzed Michael addition of N&#8208;substituted tetramic acids to nitroalkene acceptors followed by O&#8208;alkylation gave polyfunctionalized tetramic acid (31 examples, 59&#8211;94% ee). The enantioselectivity of the product was influenced by the N&#8208;substituent of the substrate. Quantum chemical methods provided the mechanistic insights of the studied transformation. The preferred reaction pathway follows the model proposed by P&#225;pai et&#8197;al. Single crystal structure confirmed the absolute configuration, which was in line with the ECD measured and calculated structure. Additionally, a comparative study of the alkylation of a selected tetramic and tetronic acid with trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene is disclosed. Follow&#8208;up amidations demonstrated the applicability of this class of compounds for the incorporation into both dipeptide and depsipeptide sequences.

         <title>Gold Catalysis: 2,3&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;Addition to Butadiynes</title>

Abstract
In the past, numerous impressive methodologies have been developed in homogeneous gold catalysis, typically using alkynes, allenes, or different non&#8208;conjugated diyne systems as starting materials. While there are applications catalyzed by other transition metals, the use of 1,3&#8208;butadiyne derivatives has been largely neglected in gold catalysis. In this work we present an efficient gold&#8208;catalyzed method focusing on the functionalization of this specific type of diynes. The starting materials can be synthesized via simple Glaser Coupling, starting from cheap, highly variable, terminal alkynes. These homocoupling products, which are often observed as undesirable side&#8208;products in Sonogashira reactions, can be converted into versatile 1,3&#8208;butadiene derivatives in alcohol as a solvent and nucleophile under mild conditions. The possible field of application of the 1,3&#8208;butadiene derivatives known from the literature is very broad and ranges from a use as transistor or OLED material to a use as an enzyme inhibitor. The approach presented here offers an attractive and highly effective way to versatile functionalized 1,3&#8208;butadiene derivatives.

         <title>Merging Gold(I) Catalysis with Amine Transaminases in Cascade Catalysis: Chemoenzymatic Transformation of Propargylic Alcohols into Enantioenriched Allylic Amines</title>

Abstract
The compatibility between gold(I) catalysts and amine transaminases has been explored to transform racemic propargylic alcohols into enantioenriched allylic amines in a straightforward and selective manner. The synthetic approach consists of a gold(I)&#8208;catalysed Meyer&#8208;Schuster rearrangement of a series of 2&#8208;arylpent&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;2&#8208;ols and a subsequent stereoselective enzyme&#8208;catalysed transamination of the resulting &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated prochiral ketones. The design of cascade processes involving sequential or concurrent approaches has been studied in our search for ideal reaction conditions to produce the desired amines. Thus, the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complex [1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene]&#8208;[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)&#8208;imide]gold(I) ([Au(IPr)(NTf2)] (A) in aqueous medium was found to be an ideal catalyst, while selective, made&#8208;in&#8208;house and commercial amine transaminases permitted the asymmetric synthesis of both (E)&#8208;4&#8208;arylpent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;amine enantiomers in good isolated yields (53&#8211;84%) and excellent stereoselectivities (97 to &gt;99% enantiomeric excess).

&lt;p&gt;The compatibility between gold(I) catalysts and amine transaminases has been explored to transform racemic propargylic alcohols into enantioenriched allylic amines in a straightforward and selective manner. The synthetic approach consists of a gold(I)-catalysed Meyer-Schuster rearrangement of a series of 2-arylpent-3-yn-2-ols and a subsequent stereoselective enzyme-catalysed transamination of the resulting &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated prochiral ketones. The design of cascade processes involving sequential or concurrent approaches has been studied in our search for ideal reaction conditions to produce the desired amines. Thus, the N-heterocyclic carbene complex [1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]-[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-imide]gold(I) ([Au(IPr)(NTf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;) in aqueous medium was found to be an ideal catalyst, while selective, made-in-house and commercial amine transaminases permitted the asymmetric synthesis of both (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-4-arylpent-3-en-2-amine enantiomers in good isolated yields (53&#8211;84%) and excellent stereoselectivities (97 to &amp;gt;99% enantiomeric excess).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zincate&#8208;Mediated Remote Functionalisation of p&#8208;Iodobenzyl Derivatives Through Metallotropy in 2&#8208;Methyltetrahydrofuran as Key Solvent.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

The front cover picture illustrates the 1,5&#8208;rearrangement of lithium benzyl(dibutyl)zincate derived from p&#8208;iodobenzyl mesylate. This key elementary step is integral to a complex reaction sequence allowing the remote functionalisation of such a derivative with a wide range of aldehydes (see fruits in the tree). As a remote leaving group (here OMs) is required to trigger the chemical event, the release of LiOMs can be seen as a driving force (LiOMs is thus the driver of the boat). Details can be found in the Research Article by Alexandre Vasseur and co&#8208;workers (A. Pierret, C. Denhez, P. C. Gros, A. Vasseur, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2022, 364, xxxx&#8211;xxxx; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202200475)

The front cover picture illustrates the Strecker reaction of formaldehyde, primary amines and TMSCN. HCOOH and TBAF were used as cocatalysts and the TMSCN was used to work as both the cyanide source and protecting reagent. As a result, the side reactions were suppressed efficiently and a broad range of aromatic and aliphatic amines were efficiently monocyanomethylated. This work is dedicated to Shenyang University of Chemical Technology on the occasion of its 70th anniversary. Details can be found in the Communication by Jin, Ryu, Zhang and co&#8208;workers. (Y.

Abstract
Herein, we report a chiral phosphine&#8208;triazole ligand for the Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of exocyclic benzofused alkenes. Overcoming previous limitations, the catalytic system is able to successfully hydrogenate exocyclic olefins bearing a benzofused five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered ring motif (ee's between 92 to 99%). The catalyst tolerates well the presence of several substituents and substitution patterns at both aromatic rings. The absence of a competing isomerization process together with the perfect fit of the olefins in the catalyst chiral pocket are key to surpass the previous limitations in the hydrogenation of both 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered ring benzofused exocyclic olefins.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrohydrazonemethylation of Styrenes: Access to Chiral Hydrazones, Hydrazides, Hydrazines and Amines.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates the variety of products accessible through the newly developed asymmetric hydrohydrazonemethylation (HHM). The devised hydroformylation/condensation sequence leads to stable and versatile &#947;&#8208;chiral N&#8217;&#8208;substituted aceto&#8208;hydrazones. They can be reduced in one&#8208;pot to the corresponding &#947;&#8208;chiral N&#8217;&#8208;substituted acetohydrazides, and after deprotection, to &#946;&#8208;chiral hydrazines. They can be also reduced and hydrogenolysed to the &#946;&#8208;chiral primary amines or serve as substrates for diastereoselective C&#8208;C coupling.

&lt;p&gt;The front cover picture illustrates the variety of products accessible through the newly developed asymmetric hydrohydrazonemethylation (HHM). The devised hydroformylation/condensation sequence leads to stable and versatile &#947;-chiral N&#8217;-substituted aceto-hydrazones. They can be reduced in one-pot to the corresponding &#947;-chiral N&#8217;-substituted acetohydrazides, and after deprotection, to &#946;-chiral hydrazines. They can be also reduced and hydrogenolysed to the &#946;-chiral primary amines or serve as substrates for diastereoselective C-C coupling. The high enantioselectivity reached for all product types makes the molecular peacock proud of its pluridecorated tail. Details can be found in the communication by Franci&#242; and co-workers (M. N.

         <title>Strecker Reactions of Formaldehyde with TMSCN, Catalyzed by TBAF and Formic Acid: N&#8208;Monocyanomethylation of Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A set of conditions for the Strecker reaction of formaldehyde, amines, and TMSCN that affords three&#8208;component coupling adducts as the major products is reported. HCOOH and TBAF are used as cocatalysts and the TMSCN functions as both cyanide source and protecting reagent for amines. As a result, the side reactions were suppressed efficiently and a broad range of aromatic and aliphatic amines were mono&#8208;cyanomethylated in 52&#8211;99% yield. Furthermore, this protocol was successfully applied toward the synthesis of meta&#8208;diamide insecticides.

         <title>Controllable Access to Furans and Dihydrofurans through Cyclization/Coupling of Internal Acetylenic &#946;&#8208;Ketoesters with Aryl Bromides</title>

Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed tandem cyclization/coupling of internal &#946;&#8208;propargylic&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters with (hetero)aryl bromides is described. Two protocols are established which selectively lead to 2&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;dihydrofurans, when isomerization is inhibited under mild conditions (temp. &#8804;40&#8201;&#176;C and weak base &#8211; K2CO3), or to 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;furans when base&#8208;induced aromatization is enabled. A catalytic cycle involving oxidative addition, substitution of bromide with alkyne, rate limiting anti&#8208;selective 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig oxocyclization followed by fast deprotonation of the oxonium intermediate, and reductive elimination is proposed based on detailed experimental and theoretical studies.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrohydrazonemethylation of Styrenes: Access to Chiral Hydrazones, Hydrazides, Hydrazines and Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric hydroformylation of styrenes was combined with condensation of the resulting aldehydes with acetohydrazide as nucleophile leading to &#947;&#8208;chiral N&#8217;&#8208;substituted aceto&#8208;hydrazones. This cascade reaction is called hydrohydrazonemethylation (HHM) in analogy to similar hydroformylation/condensation sequences. The catalyst was formed in&#8197;situ from the commercially available chiral phosphine&#8208;ligand (R,R)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE and [Rh(acac)(CO)2] and used at a loading of 0.2&#8197;mol%. The stable condensation products are not prone to tautomerization providing versatile chiral intermediates. Their one&#8208;pot reduction with DMAB/TsOH resulted in the corresponding &#947;&#8208;chiral N&#8217;&#8208;substituted acetohydrazides (14 examples) with yields ranging from 73% to 91% and enantioselectivities from 77% to 97% ee. Deprotection of the acetohydrazides led to the corresponding &#946;&#8208;chiral hydrazines. Reduction and hydrogenolysis of the hydrazones over Raney&#8208;Ni yielded the corresponding &#946;&#8208;chiral primary amines with 95% ee. Diastereoselective functionalization of the C=N bond of the hydrazones is a further synthetic option, as demonstrated by allylation with (allyl)SiCl3.

         <title>Zincate&#8208;Mediated Remote Functionalisation of p&#8208;Iodobenzyl Derivatives Through Metallotropy in 2&#8208;Methyltetrahydrofuran as Key Solvent</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
2&#8208;MeTHF (2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran) promotes the zincate&#8208;mediated remote functionalisation of p&#8208;iodobenzyl derivatives through metallotropy with a broad scope. This biosourced solvent remarkably impacted all the key elementary steps involved in the tandem reaction. The method tolerates a wide range of sensitive functionalities within the substrates as well as enolisable and activated or deactivated aromatic aldehydes as reaction partners. A challenging benzyl naphthalene derivative was even reacted through an original dearomatisation/rearomatisation/metallotropy chain.

Abstract
A ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of allenoates with arylamines has been developed. This strategy provides an approach to synthesize E&#8208;allylic amines in good yields with high atom&#8208;economy and high levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and E&#8208;selectivities with a broad substrate scope.
