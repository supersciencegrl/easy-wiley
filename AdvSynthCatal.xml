         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;catalyzed silylarylation of N&#8208;(arylsulfonyl)acrylamides via a tandem silyl radical addition/1,4&#8208;aryl migration/desulfonylation sequence has been developed. This method employs silanes as the precursor of silyl radical and di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide (DTBP) as the initiator. By using this cascade procedure, a series of &#946;&#8208;silyl amide&#8208;pharmaceutical hybrids which contain an &#945;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter were facilely synthesized.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Sequential C(sp2)&#8211;H/C(sp3)&#8211;H Annulation of Indoles with Propargylic Alcohols to Access Hydrobenzo[b]carbazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe an efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed sequential C(sp2)&#8211;H/C(sp3)&#8211;H annulation of indoles with propargylic alcohols for the synthesis of diversely functionalized hydrobenzo[b]carbazole scaffolds. The reaction involves a Friedel&#8208;Crafts addition, 1,5&#8208;H shift, 6&#960; electrocyclization, and dearomatization&#8208;aromatization cascade. Importantly, this is the first report of the use of 2&#8208;(diarylmethyl)indoles as three&#8208;carbon synthons in a (3+3) annulation reaction involving C(sp3)&#8211;H indole functionalization under oxidant&#8208;free conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Vinyl and 1,3&#8208;Dienyl Sulfones Enabled by Photochemical Excitation of Halogen&#8208;Bonding Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photochemical catalyst&#8208;free radical&#8208;based synthesis of vinyl and 1,3&#8208;dienyl sulfones is disclosed. Mechanistic investigations support that the transformations rely on a visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted activation of a halogen&#8208;bonding complex, which is formed between an alkenyl (or 1,3&#8208;dienyl) bromide and a sodium sulfinate salt. The reactions exhibit a wide functional group tolerance (compatible with heteroatoms, electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating groups), finding application in the structural modification of biologically relevant molecules. Eventually, a continuous flow protocol was developed to upscale these transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Acceleration of the Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction between 9&#8208;Functionalized Anthracenes and C60/C70 in the Cavity of a Water Soluble Subphthalocyanine Cage</title>

Abstract
Herein we report on the acceleration of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between a series of 9&#8208;functionalized anthracenes and C60/C70 encapsulated in a water&#8208;soluble metallo&#8208;organic Pd(II)&#8208;subphthalocyanine cage (SubPc&#8208;cage), which performs as a catalytic molecular reactor that provides a beneficial hydrophobic environment. Negatively and positively charged anthracenes do not react either with C60 or C70, due to a favored solvation in water medium and/or to detrimental interactions with positively&#8208;charged Pd(II) corners of SubPc&#8208;cage. Experiments with C60 and C70 rendered parallel results, although C70 proved more reactive, leading to anthracene cycloadducts by reaction in the &#945; bonds. All the results have been rationalized by theoretical calculations at the GFN2&#8208;xTB level.

         <title>Borylated Cyclopentanes via Atom Transfer Radical [3+2] Annulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An atom transfer radical [3+2] annulation (ATRAn) reaction involving alkenyl boronic esters and homoallylic iodides provides a rapid access to polysubstituted borylated cyclopentanes. A variety of &#945;&#8208;substituted vinylboronic esters are suitable substrates and offer unique opportunities for further modification of the formed 5&#8208;membered ring. For instance, the oxidation of the boronic ester to an alcohol allows the preparation of products that corresponds to an annulation involving the enol form of acetone. Substitution of the iodide by a nucleophile such as lithium methoxide without modifying the boronic ester moiety is also feasible. Finally, by using a (3&#8208;acetoxyprop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;yl)boronic ester, a facile 1,2&#8208;elimination reaction provided a methylenecyclopentane. In this case, the alkenylboronate radical trap acts as an equivalent to allene, a building block so far elusive for preparative radical reactions.

         <title>Aryl Ketone&#8208;Catalyzed Light&#8208;Driven Radical Oxy&#8208;Functionalization of Non&#8208;Acidic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds Enabled by Triple Role of TEMPO</title>

Abstract
A light&#8208;driven radical oxy&#8208;functionalization of non&#8208;acidic aliphatic and benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds was achieved with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) in a single&#8208;step by employing an aryl ketone as a sole catalyst. The transformation was initiated by homolysis of a C(sp3)&#8722;H bond in the starting substance by the photo&#8208;excited aryl ketone. The derived carbon radical was then promptly trapped by TEMPO leading to the formation of the TEMPO&#8208;adduct. The derived TEMPO&#8208;adduct is synthetically versatile as an alcohol equivalent since it can be readily converted to the corresponding ketone by oxidation and to the corresponding alcohol by reduction. The key to realizing the present catalytic reaction relies on the distinctive triple role of TEMPO, which acts as the precursor of the oxygen functionality, the oxidant to regenerate the aryl ketone, and the protective group for the derived TEMPO&#8208;adduct from over&#8208;oxidation.

         <title>Direct Intramolecular Coupling of Primary/Secondary Alcohols with Secondary Alcohols for Macrocyclic Alkenylation Using Ni&#8208;Zeolite Catalyst Under Continuous&#8208;Flow Conditions</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report the direct intramolecular coupling of primary and secondary alcohols for the selective synthesis of macrocyclic olefins in the presence of Ni&#8208;zeolite catalyst under continuous flow. This reaction proceeds via dehydration of secondary alcohols to alkenes, which subsequently undergo intramolecular dehydrative coupling reaction with a primary alcohol to obtain moderate yields of macrocyclic olefins. This reaction is also effective for the coupling of secondary&#8208;secondary alcohols and alkene&#8208;alcohols to produce diverse macrocyclic olefin products. This unique approach has various advantages including step&#8208;economy, no additives and pre&#8208;functionalization required, inexpensive and reusable catalyst, and exemplification with 23 macrocycles in different ring sizes. The continuous flow macrocyclisation afforded higher productivity and space&#8208;time yield than the batch reaction conditions.

         <title>Indolyl&#8208;Ynones: Building Blocks for Molecular Diversity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
This review centers on the synthetic strategies employed with indolyl&#8208;ynones. Indolyl&#8208;ynone, owing to its highly reactive ynone moiety, frequently partakes in dearomatizing spirocyclization reactions and subsequent rearrangement reactions when subjected to various reaction conditions. Hence, various heterocycles such as densely functionalized spiroindolenines, carbazoles, quinolines and carbo&#8208;and hetero&#8208;cycle substituted indoles are synthesized from indolyl&#8208;ynones. In addition to this, the versatile spirocyclic indole scaffold exhibits the capability to produce tetracyclic and polyclic structures through intricate skeletal rearrangement processes. Moreover, the total synthesis of natural products using the indolyl&#8208;ynone moiety was also compiled in this review.

Abstract
An organocatalytic remote stereocontrolled 1,8&#8208;conjugated addition of in&#8197;situ formed propargylic aza&#8208;p&#8208;QMs from &#945;&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl) propargylic alcohols and indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates was developed, affording axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes in 62&#8211;99% yield with 52&#8211;99% ee. The synthetic strategy not only enriches the chemistry of aza&#8208;p&#8208;quinone methides, but also provides an alternative tool for the preparation of axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes.

         <title>Synthesis of Styrenes and E&#8208;Stilbenes by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Vinylation of Aryl Iodides with 1,2&#8208;Dibromoethane</title>

Abstract
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed vinylation reactions of aryl iodides using 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane is developed for the synthesis of styrenes and stilbenes. In these reactions, vinyl bromide is generated from 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane and then undergoes reductive cross&#8208;coupling with aryl iodides, affording styrene products. Under slightly modified reaction conditions, styrenes can continue reacting with vinyl bromide to form E&#8208;stilbenes, which provides a one&#8208;pot synthetic method for stilbenes. Alcohols, including iso&#8208;propanol and methanol, are employed as the reductant in these reductive cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Asymmetric Hydrogenation for the Synthesis of an (S)&#8208;Metolachlor Intermediate Using Catalysts Immobilized on a Core/Shell&#8208;Type Support</title>

Abstract
Here we show continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of a key inter&#8208;mediate of (S)&#8208;Metolachlor, which is a widely used agrochemical that is in huge demand, with asymmetric hydrogenation using a heterogeneous catalyst immobilized on a core/shell&#8208;type support. We have immobilized a homogeneous catalyst onto a core/shell&#8208;type heterogeneous support that was developed in our laboratory, which showed high turnover frequency and turnover number over a long period (over 120&#8197;h) when used in a solvent&#8208;free continuous&#8208;flow manner. This result demonstrates the feasibility of continuous&#8208;flow production of chiral agrochemicals with packed&#8208;bed heterogeneous catalysts. Moreover, the heterogenization protocol was shown to be applicable to elaborate practical catalysts used in industry, especially the group of phosphine ligands.

The chemical and reaction spaces are incredibly vast and special procedures are required to study them. Their complex and multiparametric nature encompass myriads of compounds and interactions and endless modifications involving the distinct impact of relevant variables (temperature, solvent, stoichiometry, etc.). This often calls for the design, collection, and analysis/interpretation of large datasets. Reaction charting, the systematic scanning, description, analysis, and guided modifications of a given process, stands as the most promising approach. It offers fast and accurate solutions as well as expanding the knowledge about the systems. This deeper understanding enables reliable predictions, improvement of the productivity (yields, scope), eventually leading to sustainable, economic, and safe applications. The present review introduces the topic, analyzing selected examples and recent advancements in different organic chemistry&#8208;related fields. The covered methodologies range from classical experimentation modifying one factor at a time, to Design of Experiments and more modern computational approaches involving Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. In this way, the impact of charting in process development, biological and medicinal chemistry, catalysis, reaction discovery and computational methods is accounted. Finally, the conclusion/outlook section gives a general appraisal and a prospect on the future implementation of the methodology.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of chlorosilanes with organometallic reagents is an old and well&#8208;developed approach to organosilicon compounds, however , its application was limited due to the sensitivity of organometallic reagents to air, water. Here we display a mechanochemical access to arylsilanes via Barbier&#8208;type reaction of chlorosilanes with aryl halide with magnesium. By treatment of the two halides with Mg powder under electromagnetic milling, a series of arylsilanes are obtained within 15 minutes. Taking the advantages of the electromagnetic milling, this protocol features transition&#8208;metal free, good functional group tolerance, air stable and mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Atroposelective Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Involving Ring Manipulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral architectures exist widely in natural products, biologically relevant molecules, chiral ligands and catalysts as well as functional materials. Therefore, catalytic asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers has become one of the most fast&#8208;growing fields in the community of chemistry and rapid advances have occurred. Among different methods reported, the organocatalytic atroposelective dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) involving ring manipulations stands out as a cutting&#8208;edge technology to construct axial chirality from
the point of atom/step economy. In this DKR strategy, the configurational lability of starting materials originates from chirally&#8208;labile ring structure of cyclic substrates/intermediates or transient ring formation through noncovalent interactions from acyclic substrates. The two
atropisomers of starting material are in equilibrium in the reaction medium, ensuring the constant transformation of the less reactive atropisomer into the more reactive one, and then to a single enantiopure product in the presence of an appropriate organocatalyst. This review summarizes recent advancements on this topic, including their scopes, limitations, mechanisms, applications and provides some
insights into further developments.

2. DKR via Ring Opening of Biaryl Lactones/Lactams

         <title>Integrating Chemocatalysis and Enzyme Engineering for Coproduction of Bioplastic Precursors Butanediol and Succinic Acid from Xylose</title>

Abstract
Polybutylene succinate (PBS) is one of the most important biobased plastics, based on the amount produced. Owing to its high melting point and resemblance to petroleum&#8208;based plastics (i.&#8201;e. PP), PBS becomes one of the emerging bioplastics with an array of applications. PBS is manufactured by polymerization of 1,4&#8208;butanediol and succinic acid. Thus, it is of great importance to ensure the use of renewable resources to produce the PBS precursors. As the second most abundant carbohydrate monomer on Earth, D&#8208;xylose will be a suitable candidate for this purpose. In this work, we combined protein engineering with chemical oxidation by gold catalyst to enable transformation of D&#8208;xylose to 1,4&#8208;butanediol and succinic acid simultaneously. In silico docking studies and semi rational design were employed to create variants of the key enzyme, branched chain &#945;&#8208;keto acid decarboxylase (KdcA) with higher affinity for the intermediates in the production of 1,4&#8208;butanediol and succinic acid. Direct enzymatic biotransformation would result in a production of both monomers with 3:1 ratio, thus not readily suitable for a direct polymerization to PBS. By developing a one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;step chemo&#8208;enzymatic approach with a gold catalyst to perform the first oxidation step, we could achieve a final product ratio of 1:1. Application of an engineered KdcA variant allowed us to achieve &gt;98% yield after four hours transformation. In contrast, after 24&#8197;h transformation, &gt;10% intermediate was still observed when the original variant was used. We anticipate this new approach could serve as an alternative route for biotechnological productions of PBS and its precursors.

Abstract
An operationally simple anhydrous carbene insertion reaction to construct DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DEL) is reported. The developed reaction employs visible light photolysis of diazo compounds and Reversible Adsorption to Solid Support (RASS) strategy. From readily available amines, alcohols, phenols, and carboxylic acids, a variety of high&#8208;value molecules, including useful unnatural amino acids, ethers, and esters, promising clinical drug derivatives, and bioactive molecules have been constructed.

Abstract
Asymmetric three&#8208;component, 1,2&#8208;aminoxy&#8208;trifluoromethylation of styrenes with N&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;benz/naphthoxazine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones (i.&#8201;e., N&#8208;OH&#8208;(B/Np)OxzOn) catalysed by chiral vanadyl complexes derived from N&#8208;salicylidene&#8208;L&#8208;t&#8208;leucinate were explored. Among 14 different solvents and 13 different catalysts screened, the best reaction scenarios were in 2&#8208;propanol with 3&#8208;(2,5&#8208;dimethyl)phenyl&#8208;5&#8208;bromo (DMP), or 3&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;5&#8208;bromo substituted catalysts that led to the corresponding complementary (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;products with potential biological activities in 45&#8211;91% yields and up to 85 and 75% ee, respectively. Further optimisation with the DMP catalyst led to the best combination of 3&#8208;halo/3,5&#8208;dihalo&#8208;styrenes with 6&#8208;/7&#8208;Br&#8722;N&#8722;OH&#8208;(B/Np)OxzOn as the trapping agents. The corresponding eight different products were isolated in 52&#8211;75% yields with ees in a range of 88&#8211;93% (R). Based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations with conformational searches, the origin of enantiocontrol and the working mechanism were proposed by resorting to a bidentate&#8208;chelation between the amide or carbamate C=O group and N&#8722;OH group in the trapping agent to the vanadyl center followed by asymmetric benzylic radical trapping in an SH2 fashion. Subsequent Fragment Molecular Orbital (FMO)/Pair Interaction Energy Decomposition Analysis (PIEDA) calculations with the DMP catalyst were carried out to rationalize the extent of asymmetric induction. One representative product derived from p&#8208;methyl&#8208;styrene and NpOxzOn was hydrolyzed in basic MeOH with decarboxylation to unmask its carbamate moiety. The resulting chiral (R)&#8208;N&#8208;benzoxy&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;naphthamide was subjected to aerobic, oxidative homo&#8208;coupling catalysed by the DMP catalyst in CCl4. The corresponding 2,2&#8208;binaphthol product was isolated in 90% (brsm) yield with nearly complete diastereo&#8208;control at the created (M)&#8208;axial chirality, allowing for sequential, bi&#8208;functional asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling applications.

Abstract
We studied a reaction of chromone&#8208;containing acrylonitriles and cyanoacrylates with acid hydrazides. This reaction turned out to be a method for the synthesis of salicyloyl&#8208;substituted 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines. The synthesis developed is a tandem ring&#8208;opening/double ring&#8208;closing process. This synthetic approach is characterized by low toxic solvents (ethanol, butanol) and mediator (Et3N), 37&#8211;84% yields, non&#8208;chromatographic isolation of products, and substrate tolerance (59 examples).

Abstract
An electrooxidative reconstruction of the indole core under ambient conditions is reported, resulting in the construction of tryptanthrins. This electrochemical strategy simplifies molecular skeleton&#8208;hopping by employing commercially available NH&#8208;indole feedstock as the starting materials. Furthermore, the synthetic value of this skeletal reconstruction was demonstrated by divergent further transformations. A preliminary mechanistic investigation involving control experiments and cyclovoltammetric studies showed the indispensability of electricity, as well as the importance of oxygen and TEMPO, thereby revealing a possible reaction pathway.

Abstract
A cascade one&#8208;pot strategy to construct 31 examples of furo&#8208;fused quinoxalines in up to 88% yields has been devised from readily accessible &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides and quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;ones in open flask at room temperature under TBHP mediated conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed that the overall reactivity relies on the seamless integration of intermolecular radical coupling and intramolecular cyclization via desulfhydration of C=S bond cleavage. Generation of H2S as the only by&#8208;product makes this process highly attractive. Furthermore, the photophysical behavior of the furo&#8208;fused quinoxalines has also been studied.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrochemical [3+2] Cycloaddition between &#945;&#8208;Amino Carbonyls and Tosylmethyl Isocyanide en route to Substituted Imidazoles</title>

Abstract
The established strategy unveils a metal and mediator&#8208;free electrochemical [3+2] cycloaddition approach among &#945;&#8208;amino carbonyls and tosylmethyl isocyanide (TosMIC) fabricating substituted imidazole scaffolds. Implementation of electro&#8208;redox conditions on this cycloaddition approach eliminates the essential requirement of transition metal catalysts and chemical oxidants. A wide variety of different functionalities are well tolerated under this reaction condition, contributing to the substrate scope and applicability. Several control experiments and cyclic voltammetry studies suggest an electro&#8208;oxidation triggered successive C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formations followed by rapid aromatization for constructing the five&#8208;membered core structure.

&lt;p&gt;The established strategy unveils a metal and mediator-free electrochemical [3+2] cycloaddition approach among &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-amino carbonyls and tosylmethyl isocyanide (TosMIC) fabricating substituted imidazole scaffolds. Implementation of electro-redox conditions on this cycloaddition approach eliminates the essential requirement of transition metal catalysts and chemical oxidants. A wide variety of different functionalities are well tolerated under this reaction condition, contributing to the substrate scope and applicability. Several control experiments and cyclic voltammetry studies suggest an electro-oxidation triggered successive C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formations followed by rapid aromatization for constructing the five-membered core structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Laetevirenol A via Regioselective Gold&#8208;Catalyzed and Acid&#8208;Promoted Cyclizations</title>

Abstract
The total synthesis of Laetevirenol A, a natural product with antioxidant activity, has been achieved. A gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of an o&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;o&#8217;&#8208;alkynylbiphenyl has been used as the key step for the construction of the phenanthrene moiety present in Laetevirenol A. Several studies in model substrates have been carried out to unveil the effect of substituents in different locations in the outcome of this cyclization, which allowed the design of an appropriate precursor for the fundamental gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization. The suitably functionalized phenanthrene intermediate obtained in this key step could be further transformed into Laetevirenol A via a Friedel&#8208;Crafts cyclization, which also turned out to be dependent on the nature of the substituents. Finally, Laetevirenol A was obtained in 10 steps from commercially available substrates, with a 20% global yield.

Abstract
The catalytic deoxygenative reduction of hydrazides to the corresponding alkyl hydrazine with PhSiH3 via B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation is reported. This metal&#8208;free protocol is compatible with various acylhydrazides and diacylhydrazides, giving rise to a variety of structurally diverse alkyl hydrazine products in 63&#8211;95% yields. The proper selection of borane catalyst and hydrosilane reductant is essential for catalysis. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the reaction involves a hydrazone intermediate.

Abstract
Here we present a [3+2] cycloaddition of rationally designed trisubstituted cyclic &#945;&#8208;chloroamides, primarily those incorporating pharmacological pyrazolone cores, as potent synthons for synthesizing valuable spirocyclic &#947;&#8208;lactam architectures. This protocol exhibits 52&#8211;96% yields, impressive substrate compatibility, and scale&#8208;up capacity. Importantly, this study also represents one of the rare examples that harness enaminone C&#8722;N bond cleavage to engineer relevant spirocyclic &#947;&#8208;lactam skeletons of biological interest. Moreover, we propose a plausible mechanistic explanation to elucidate the outstanding chemical outcomes observed, thereby enriching the synthetic toolbox for pyrazolone chemistry and &#945;&#8208;haloamide&#8208;mediated reactions.

Abstract
A domino SNAr&#8208;ihDA/rDA reaction was developed from rarely exploited 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazines with bifunctional alkyne tethered nucleophiles to construct various fused non&#8208;aromatic/heteroaromatic bicycles in yields ranging from 56 to 99%, notably within the family of valuable spirooxindole derivatives. In this study, the challenging enantioselective phase&#8208;transfer catalyzed arylation of a sulfonyl&#8208;triazine was also demonstrated with up to 66%&#8197;ee. In both racemic and asymmetric processes, the nature of the leaving group at C3 was key to successfully achieve these sequences.

         <title>An Organocatalytic Route to endo&#8208;Vinylene Carbonates from Carbon Dioxide&#8208;Based exo&#8208;Vinylene Carbonates</title>

Abstract
An organocatalytic route has been developed for the isomerization of exo&#8208;vinylene carbonates (exo&#8208;VCs) to endo&#8208;vinylene carbonates (endo&#8208;VCs). The exo&#8208;VC starting material can easily be obtained from propargylic alcohols via cyclization with carbon dioxide. In this study, these exo&#8208;VCs are shown to isomerize to the thermodynamically more stable endo&#8208;VCs in the presence of an N&#8208;heterocyclic base and phenol. Density functional theory (DFT) studies were conducted to elucidate the mechanism, tackling difficulties of the description of charge separation steps. This isomerization process delivers an ample diversity of endo&#8208;VCs in good to excellent yields and chemoselectivities under mild reaction conditions.

The front cover picture illustrates the reaction between 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl and double bonds to afford 1,5&#8208;diketones, known as the De Mayo reaction. This reaction discovered in the mid&#8208;20th century represents a powerful tool for synthesis, since it allows the preparation of complex structures in one simple step using the energy of light. This review article presents a detailed overview on the evolution and impact of this reaction from its use in natural&#8208;product preparation to more recent photocatalytic approaches. Details can be found in the Review by Salaverri, Alem&#225;n and Marzo (N. Salaverri, J. Alem&#225;n, L. Marzo, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2024, 366, 156&#8211;167; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202300647)

Abstract
In 1962, Paul&#8197;J. de&#8197;Mayo initially described the photochemical reaction involving 1,3&#8208;diketones and double bonds, resulting in the formation of 1,5&#8208;diketones. Since then, this reaction has been extensively utilized for the synthesis of a wide range of fascinating natural products. Over time, this synthetic methodology has been applied to various carbonyl systems, including locked enol&#8208;tautomers of diketones, &#946;&#8208;keto esters, and &#946;&#8208;enaminones. Additionally, it has found application in other unsaturated systems such as allenes and alkynes. In this review article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the classical de Mayo reaction, highlighting its scope and potential. Furthermore, we focus on recent advances achieved through photocatalytic conditions. Special emphasis is placed on the regioselectivity of the process and the underlying reaction mechanism, particularly within the context of photocatalysis.

Abstract
Photoinduced chemical transformations have become a promising aspect of organic synthesis. This review focuses on the recent advancements in harnessing photoinduced processes for the formation of carbon&#8208;chalcogen (C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, C&#8722;Se, and C&#8722;Te) bonds under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. These pathways typically involve either a radical mechanism or the creation of electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes. The review explores the intricacies of the underlying mechanisms, discusses limitations, and evaluates the applicability of various methodologies in this field. Notably, photocatalyst and transition metal&#8208;free photochemical reactions offer effective alternatives to enhance sustainability in this research area.

         <title>Electrochemical Selenylation&#8208;Induced Annulation of Alkenyl Ureas to Access Cyclic Isoureas</title>

Abstract
A direct electrosynthesis of cyclic isoureas from N&#8208;allyl ureas and diselenides has been described. This protocol proceeds without any additional catalyst and oxidant, at room temperature under air, providing the desired products in 71&#8211;91% yield. In addition, the synthesis of cyclic isoureas containing five to seven&#8208;membered rings has also been achieved by the employment of this strategy. On the basis of the mechanism experiments and previous research works, a probable mechanism is proposed.

         <title>The Synthesis of (E)&#8208;Vinyl and Alkynyl Sulfones by the Formation of an Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex Using Thiosulfonates and Sodium Iodide Under Visible Light</title>

Abstract
A method for the synthesis of (E)&#8208;vinyl sulfones and alkynyl sulfones through the cleavage of thiosulfonate promoted by the formation of EDA complexes under visible light irradiation at room temperature without the need for other metal catalysts is described. The mechanism study shows that sodium iodide and thiosulfonate form EDA complexes under visible light irradiation, resulting in a single&#8208;electron transfer cleavage to generate sulfonyl radicals, which then react with olefins or alkynes to produce (E)&#8208;vinyl sulfones or alkynyl sulfones, respectively. This method is applicable to 44 olefin and alkyne substrates, with yields ranging from 38% to 90%, providing a radical synthesis approach for the preparation of sulfonylated compounds.

Abstract
Herein, we report a strategy for pyrimidination of inert alkanes via synergistic visible light&#8208;driven redox reaction and FeCl3 catalysis. This transformation involves C&#8722;H activation by a chlorine radical generated during the iron&#8208;promoted ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer process, triggering subsequent C&#8722;H pyrimidination. The substrates and catalysts are inexpensive and readily available, while the reaction conditions and procedures are simple without the need for external oxidants. This work provides a practical approach for synthesizing pyrimidine derivatives with high structural diversity.

Abstract
An assorted set of sulfonyl arenes such as &#946;&#8208;naphthylamines, &#946;&#8208;naphthols, phenols and naphthalenes could be accessed in a divergent manner by base&#8208;mediated annulation of sulfonyl enynals. The strategy is extended to the synthesis of heterocycles such as carbazole, quinoline and benzothiophene. Benzannulation is demonstrated on derivatives of natural steroids like estrone and cholesterol.

Abstract
Herein a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H silylation of o&#8208;alkynylanilines with hexamethyldisilane for the synthesis of disilylated 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles is reported. In this reaction, o&#8208;alkynylanilines undergo an aminopalladation, C&#8722;H activation, and dealkylation sequence to form five&#8208;membered C,C&#8208;palladacycles, which then couple with hexamethyldisilane to construct one C&#8722;N bond and two C&#8722;Si bonds. This method provides an alternative strategy for C&#8722;H silylation.

Abstract
An iron&#8208;catalyzed direct C3&#8722;H radical trifluoromethylthiolation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones has been developed. This protocol uses earth&#8208;abundant FeSO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7H2O as the catalyst, and AgSCF3 as the trifluoromethylthiolating reagent to provide various SCF3&#8208;containing quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives in 26&#8211;88% yields. Preliminary mechanistic investigations indicate that the reaction proceeds through a radical pathway.

Abstract
Herein, we present a method for electrochemical&#8208;induced 1,3&#8208;oxohydroxylation of arylcyclopropanes with H2O as the green oxygen source. This transformation offers a regioselective route to highly functionalized &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketones under oxidant&#8208; and metal&#8208;free conditions. Notably, this electrochemical approach features simple operation, good regioselectivity, high functional group tolerance, and easy derivatization of the products. Mechanistic studies have provided solid evidences that 1,3&#8208;diol acts as the crucial intermediate in this reaction, leading to the observed regioselectivity.

         <title>Organocatalytic activation of pyruvates toward Michael addition to nitroalkenes: synthesis of &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the significant role of pyruvic acid in biotransformations, the utilization of pyruvates in the field of catalytic asymmetric synthesis has been unexpectedly limited. This statement also applies to enamine catalysis, in which pyruvates seem to be challenging substrates. Recently, the first illustration of the asymmetric addition of pyruvic acid to &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes, catalyzed by a NahE enzyme using the enamine mechanism, has appeared in the literature. Now, we demonstrate pyrrolidine&#8208;based catalyst can mimick enamine mechanism used by this enzyme to activate pyruvates in the asymmetric addition to structurally diverse nitroalkenes to produce highly enantioenriched Michael adducts without the limitations in substrate structures associated with biocatalysts. In addition to confirming that optically pure pyrrolidines can serve as ultimately small organic catalysts in pyruvate activation, we present an exceedingly simple and versatile method for the synthesis of optically pure &#947;&#8208;nitro acids, which are precursors for well&#8208;known active pharmaceutical ingredients namely GABA derivatives</dc:description>

Abstract
This study presents a protocol for the direct site&#8208;selective difunctionalization of pyrazoles under mild reaction conditions. This protocol showcase a notable site&#8208;selectivity and encompasses a wide substrate scope. Detailed mechanistic investigations elucidate the dual role of the sulfonium salt acting both as the reaction substrate and acid donor, thereby effectively catalyzing the reaction. The demonstrated one&#8208;pot synthesis, scale&#8208;up reaction and subsequent product modifications can assist in advancing the potential application of this protocol in organic synthesis and its associated domains.

         <title>Synthesis and Organo&#8208;Catalyzed Ring&#8208;Opening of a Six&#8208;Membered Heterocycle Combining Phosphonate and Ester Functions</title>

Abstract
The synthesis of a difunctional P&#8208;heterocycle combining phosphonate and ester moieties in a six&#8208;membered ring is described. Using trifluoromethane sulfonic acid HOTf as organocatalyst, ring&#8208;opening with neopentyl alcohol readily occurs with complete selectivity for O&#8208;acyl bond cleavage. In turn, ring&#8208;opening polymerization proceeds in a controlled manner when an excess of P&#8208;heterocycle is used. Copolymerization with &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone is also reported and semi&#8208;batch conditions are shown to enable regular incorporation of the phosphonate moieties along the polymer chains.

Abstract
Thanks to an unprecedented gem&#8208;dialkyl substituent effect, an efficient synthesis of tetrahydro oxepine derivatives is achieved by ring expansion of vinyl oxetanes using acceptor(&#8722;acceptor) diazo reagents under Cu(II)&#8208;catalysis. A large scope of 2&#8208;vinyl oxetanes and either diazo mono or diester reagents give access to a series of functionalized oxepines.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Organocatalysis Enabled Photocatalytic Intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The combination of organocatalytic activation and photocatalysis for enabling the intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of enone&#8208;ene substrates bearing one Lewis base binding site is reported. While in a variety of solvents a poor conversion or no reaction takes place in the absence of a hydrogen bonding catalyst, the corresponding ring&#8208;fused cyclobutane products could be built in moderate to good yields using a synergistic dual iridium&#8208;urea co&#8208;catalytic system. Control and mechanistic studies supported the postulated interaction between the organocatalyst and the substrate, which proved essential for an efficient energy transfer from the photosensitizer.

While in a variety of solvents a poor conversion or no reaction takes place in the absence of a hydrogen bonding catalyst, the corresponding ring-fused cyclobutane products could be built in moderate to good yields using a synergistic dual iridium-urea co-catalytic system. Control and mechanistic studies supported the postulated interaction between the organocatalyst and the substrate, which proved essential for an efficient energy transfer from the photosensitizer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
We report herein a chiral CpXRh(III)&#8208;catalyzed domino cyclization/C3&#8208;arylation process using 2&#8208;alkynylanilines and 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones as viable substrates, delivering indole&#8208;based derivatives endowed with axial chirality. The method features high enantioselectivity, broad substrate scope, and robust functional group tolerance. Subsequent functionalization of the synthesized scaffolds underlines the practicality of this approach in the design of indole&#8208;derivated axially chiral frameworks, demonstrating its substantial promise in synthetic and medicinal chemistry applications.

         <title>Enantioselective Flow Synthesis of a Tetrahydroquinoline SERM Enabled by Immobilized Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalysis and Diboronic Acid Mediated Selective Nitro Reduction</title>

Abstract
An asymmetric enantioselective flow process is reported for the formal synthesis of a 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline selective estrogen receptor modulator. Starting from an easily available 2&#8208;nitrochalcone, the first part of the process comprised a telescoped nitro reduction/intramolecular cyclocondensation sequence using diboronic acid as a simple reductant. Subsequent enantioselective transfer hydrogenation in the presence of an immobilized phosphoric acid organocatalyst followed by telescoped N&#8208;alkylation furnished the targeted chiral intermediate. The approach ensures flexibility regarding the scale of the synthesis, whilst minimizing the need for intermediate purifications and ensuring environmentally benign metal&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Electronic and Steric Effects in a Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Activation Reaction of 1&#8208;Bromoalkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The functional group compatibility of our recently disclosed gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1&#8208;bromoalkynes is studied in detail. Two main features are addressed, the minimum distances at which polar functional groups are tolerated and the influence of both electronic and steric effects on the performance of aryl ether derivatives. Moreover, robustness assessment experiments have been carried out shedding light on the factors dictating functional group tolerance. In addition, the reaction has been applied to the synthesis of a key intermediate in the total synthesis of a natural product and a heterobifunctional molecule. DFT calculations have shed light on the mechanistic features behind the observed reactivity trends. On one hand, the destabilization of the TS by the proximity of the polar group may hamper the reactivity for proximal functional groups. On the other hand, some polar functional groups are not tolerated regardless of their position due to the preferential coordination of gold to the oxygen atom over the alkyne, resulting presumably in competitive catalyst deactivation pathways.

         <title>A Silica&#8208;Supported Yttrium Triflate Packed Bed Reactor for Continuous Flow Michael Addition of Indoles to Benzylidene Malonates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The catalytic properties of packed bed reactors filled with Y(OTf)3 immobilised onto functionalised silica have been tested in the Michael addition of indoles to benzylidene malonates under flow conditions, providing improved productivity over the batch conditions, a greater ease of recovery of the final products and a prolonged life of the catalyst. Noteworthy, the same catalytic reactor, after being used for five days, was employed to perform a different reaction, a stereoselective Diels Alder cycloaddition in flow, with a 24&#8197;times higher productivity compared to the in&#8208;batch reaction.

         <title>FeCl3/KI&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Oxidative Cyclization for Switchable Total Synthesis of Luotonin A, B and Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A total synthesis strategy was developed for the synthesis of luotonin A, B and their analogues using synergistic FeCl3/KI&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization. This protocol utilizes cheap and widely available N&#8208;propargyl 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;quinazolinones and arylamines under mild conditions, and it has a wide substrate scope and high atom economy. Different natural products (luotonin A, B and derivatives) can be synthesized via a unique switchable approach. Further transformations from luotonin B to luotonin E and structural modification of natural products demonstrate the potential applications of this method. Moreover, camptothecin can also be modified with the reported protocol to afford the hydroxyl&#8208;substituted product.

         <title>Weak&#8208;Chelation Assisted Regioselective Indole C(4)&#8208;Alkynylation via Six&#8208;Membered Cobaltacycle Intermediate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein a regioselective indole C4&#8208;alkynylation has been uncovered utilizing an earth&#8208;abundant cobalt(III)&#8208;catalyst. For this process, (bromoethynyl)benzene was used as an alkynylating agent. Also, after screening various amide&#8208;protected chelating groups we found dimethyl&#8208;amide is optimal for the in&#8208;situ generation of cobaltacycle intermediate. The six&#8208;membered cobaltacycle intermediate has been detected through high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry HRMS, which is a key intermediate for this conversion. Further, mechanistic studies were performed such as KIE experiments, and reactions with radical scavengers, and based on the results a plausible mechanism has been proposed. Moreover, to show the application of this methodology, the product has been oxidized to diketone, monoketone, alkene, alkane and further derivatized to a tricycle indole derivative, which is a core structure of many natural products.

         <title>Engineered Immobilised Organocatalysts for the Synthesis of Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The art of tuning functional polymeric materials through the covalent incorporation of organocatalysts lies at the core of creating asymmetric immobilized chiral catalysts that mimic the enzymatic action. Herein, we explore diverse synthetic techniques to immobilize l&#8208;proline&#8208;derived N&#8208;carbonyl amides on functional polymeric matrices, transforming them into chiral Lewis bases for facilitating the asymmetric reduction of ketimines with HSiCl3. A comprehensive examination of the design factors, encompassing linker selection, anions, and polymeric support characteristics, enables precise adjustment of steric and electronic features in these immobilized catalysts. This approach establishes structure&#8208;performance relationships, ultimately enabling the development of an engineered immobilized organocatalytic system that meets the desired criteria for activity, stability, and selectivity.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Pyridination of Benzylic and Allylic C&#8213;H bonds via Radical&#8208;Radical Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of site&#8208;selective radical reaction is a long&#8208;standing challenge in synthetic chemistry. One important advance in this area has been the Minisci&#8208;type reaction, which has proven to be a powerful tool for functionalizing medicinally&#8208;relevant heterocycles by allowing nucleophilic carbon radicals to add to heteroarenes. Herein, we report a modular photocatalytic platform for the site&#8208;selective pyridination of saturated hydrocarbon compounds employing organic photoredox catalysis to forge new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. The site&#8208;selective C&#8213;H pyridination could successfully couple benzylic/allylic C&#8213;H bonds with pyridylphosphonium salts, which installed directly and regioselectively from C&#8213;H heteroarenes through a radical&#8208;radical cross coupling mechanism. This synthetic methodology could tolerance a variety of functional groups, complex heteroarenes, even late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals selectively and efficiently.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroformylation of Alkynyl Sulfides: A Stereo&#8208; and Regioselective Route to &#945;&#8208;Sulfenyl Acroleins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation of alkynyl sulfides under mild conditions is described. The method gives access to &#945;&#8208;sulfenyl acroleins with good regioselectivities (ratio &#945;/&#946; up to 89/11) and is applicable to variously substituted substrates. It is effective even on more complex substrates, such as cysteine and cholesterol derivatives. To demonstrate the synthetic potential of the obtained products, (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;cyclohexyl&#8208;2&#8208;methylsulfenyl acrolein was selected as an example and its sulfur atom selectively oxidized to the corresponding sulfoxide or sulfone. Acid&#8208;promoted (Z) to (E) isomerization of the double bond occurred during oxidation. The three obtained sulfenyl&#8208;, sulfinyl&#8208;, and sulfonyl&#8208;functionalized acroleins have been then used as dienophiles to access cyclohexene carbaldehydes.</dc:description>

The reaction involves the use of a PdII catalyst and norbornene as a transpositional co&#8208;catalyst, in which a pyrrole&#8208; and norbornyl&#8208;fused palladaheterocycle forms as the key intermediate. The 2&#8208;substituted pyrroles, and other 2,3&#8208;disubstituted pyrroles underwent the selective C5 glycosylation.  This reaction is compatible with a various types of glycosyl chlorides including D&#8208;mannose, L&#8208;rhamnose, D&#8208;mannofuranose, and D&#8208;ribofuranose. The viability of this strategy is showed by gram&#8208;scale, various synthetic transformation and functionalization.</dc:description>

Abstract
Lewis base dependent (3+3) and (4+2) annulations of &#946;&#8242;&#8208;acetoxy allenoates with N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines offer m&#8208;teraryl and fused dihydropyridines with varying substituents depending on the tertiary amine as well as subtle changes in the reaction conditions. The triazabicyclodecene (TBD)&#8208;catalyzed (3+3) annulation involves 1,2&#8208;elimination followed by 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization as key steps in delivering fused 1,4&#8208;hydropyridines. The same reactants under DMAP catalysis offer m&#8208;teraryl via Mannich coupling, rather than 1,2&#8208;elimination followed by C&#8722;N bond cleavage/aromatization. Key intermediates have been identified by HRMS studies.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis base dependent (3+3) and (4+2) annulations of &lt;i&gt;&#946;&#8242;&lt;/i&gt;-acetoxy allenoates with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-sulfonyl ketimines offer &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-teraryl and fused dihydropyridines with varying substituents depending on the tertiary amine as well as subtle changes in the reaction conditions. The triazabicyclodecene (TBD)-catalyzed (3+3) annulation involves 1,2-elimination followed by 6-&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-dig cyclization as key steps in delivering fused 1,4-hydropyridines. The same reactants under DMAP catalysis offer &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-teraryl &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; Mannich coupling, rather than 1,2-elimination followed by C&#8722;N bond cleavage/aromatization. Key intermediates have been identified by HRMS studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Two Ru(II)&#8208;catalytic systems were developed for anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselective hydroacyloxylations of terminal alkynes to vinylic esters. [Ru(NCCH3)6][(BF4)2] favors (E)&#8208;vinylic ester products with arylacetylenes and select carboxylic acids, whereas a Ru scorpionate complex with two electron&#8208;withdrawing ligands favors (Z)&#8208;vinylic ester isomers.

         <title>A Mechanistic Insight on CuI&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Oxazolidinones through a Four&#8208;Component Reaction</title>

Abstract
In this contribution, we describe a straightforward and efficient synthesis of oxazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones through a Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component coupling of amines, aldehydes, terminal alkynes, and CO2 via carboxylative cyclization of propargylamine intermediates. This strategy enables the selective synthesis of a variety of (Z)&#8208;5&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;oxazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones substituted in positions 3, 4 and 5 of the heterocyclic core with a variety of functional groups, well&#8208;tolerated in terms of scope. A mechanistic study was carried out monitoring the process in solution by different techniques (operando FTIR, multi&#8208;nuclear NMR), with the aim of identifying the intermediates, both organic compounds and Cu(I) coordination complexes, which showed the plausible multi&#8208;metallic nature of the catalytic intermediates (identified by X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses on monocrystal).

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Gas Triphasic Hydrogenation of Bicarbonate to Formate in a Continuous Flow Tubular Reactor</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Multiphasic reaction of bicarbonate hydrogenation to form formate using homogeneous Ru PNP pincer catalyst in a continuous flow tubular reactor is reported. The reaction system consists of three phases. Catalyst is dissolved in toluene while potassium bicarbonate is dissolved in water. The significance of efficient mixing among the organic phase, aqueous phase and gaseous hydrogen to improve hydrogenation reaction by using different inert packing materials is studied by operando visualization and also quantitatively discussed. The bicarbonate conversion of up to 67% is achieved after optimization of important reaction and reactor parameters. The designed reactor setup comprised of effective recycling system that recycles the catalyst with &gt;99% activity.

         <title>Expanding the Synthetic Toolbox: Discovery of a Robust Aldehyde Dehydrogenase for Integrated Chemocatalysis and Enzyme Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Chemobiocatalysis has recently emerged as a promising tool in organic synthesis; nonetheless, chemobiocatalytic transformations remain challenging due to the incompatibility between the two types of catalysts. Many enzymes, especially aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs), are readily inactivated under the chemocatalytic conditions. Herein, we present a robust NADP+&#8208;dependent p&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaHBDH) for integrated chemocatalysis and enzyme catalysis. Apart from good activities toward a number of aromatic aldehydes, PaHBDH showed excellent thermal and storage stability in the absence of any stabilizer, but was also highly tolerant toward various organic solvents. The usefulness of PaHBDH in integrated catalysis was demonstrated by the synthesis of a group of aromatic carboxylic acids in good yields by combining with photo&#8208;/electrochemical NADP+ regeneration. The photoenzymatic approach was further extended by integrating with a chemo(bio)catalytic cascade in one pot to allow for the conversion of furfural into value&#8208;added C4 chemicals. The finding of this work may expand the synthetic toolbox for integrated catalysis.

Abstract
In this study, a synthetic method to access benzo[4,5]imidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines is developed by the reaction of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromoaryl)benzimidazoles with 1,3&#8208;diketones under basic conditions. A reaction pathway involving the initial formation of a C&#8722;C coupled intermediate by nucleophilic aromatic substitution and subsequent deacylative cyclocondensation is proposed for this process.

Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative annulation of 2&#8208;alkenylanilines with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl diazoester or diazoketones is described. The reaction has broad substrate scope, affording a range of gem&#8208;difluorocyclobutane&#8208;fused indolines in moderate to good yields with cis&#8208;configuration. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the reaction proceeds through a sequential N&#8722;H insertion/C&#8722;F bond cleavage/[2+2] cycloadditon process. &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazo reagents serve as gem&#8208;difluorinated C2 subunits by cleaving one C&#8722;F bond.

         <title>Application of Solid Me3 SiZnI for the Synthesis of Aryl and Alkyl Trimethylsilanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal catalysis employing disilanes and silylboranes for synthesizing organosilanes circumvents the limitations of conventional hydrosilylations. While disilanes require special conditions, silylboranes have yet to be developed as TMS sources. Functional group compatibility renders silylzinc reagents desirable; however, their development is hindered by their synthesis using pyrophoric silyllithium and dissolved lithium salts. Our solid Me3SiZnI circumvents these limitations and herein, we demonstrate its significance in the cross&#8208;coupling of aryl and alkyl bromides.</dc:description>

Abstract
This research presents a method for the oxidative selenylation and thiolylation of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman adducts through constant&#8208;current electrolysis in an undivided cell at room temperature. The reaction enables direct production of trisubstituted (Z)&#8208;allyl aryl selenides and sulfides with yields of 27&#8211;98%. A wide variety of different functionalities are well tolerated under these reaction conditions. This strategy could be carried out on gram scale and several synthetic transformations were accomplished for the construction of other allyl selenide derivatives. Control experiments and mechanistic studies indicate a radical or an ionic addition pathway for this electrochemical transformation.

         <title>B(C6F5)3&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Allylation of Hydrazines with Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An N&#8208;allylation of monosubstituted acyl hydrazines with allylic alcohols has been developed by using B(C6F5)3 catalysis. This protocol allows for convenient access to various synthetically useful N&#8208;allylated hydrazine products in 48&#8211;96% yields with broad substrate scope and wide functional group compatibility. The operationally simple reaction proceeds without calling for stringent removal of air and moisture, and can be readily scaled up to gram scale. Preliminary mechanistic studies support the generation of an allylic carbon cation that is involved in the catalytic cycle, and the reaction proceeds via the in&#8197;situ formation of diallyl ethers as intermediates.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Amination of Chloro(hetero)aryl Triflates Enabled by Alkyl&#8208;Pyrazole&#8208;Based Phosphine Ligands</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study describes the palladium&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective amination of chloro(hetero)aryl triflates in the C&#8722;Cl bond for the first time. A newly designed and synthesized alkyl&#8208;pyrazole&#8208;based phosphine ligand, &lt;b&gt;L26&lt;/b&gt; (BirdPhos), which is featured with the pyrazole ligand core and the cyclohexyl group at the C3 and C5 positions, was key to the success of this reaction. A variety of chloro(hetero)aryl triflates coupled with aromatic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic amines smoothly afforded the corresponding products up to 97% yields with general chemoselectivity (&gt;99%) in the C&#8722;Cl bond. Drug analogs were also synthesized via the chemoselective intermolecular amination. This study attempts to investigate the structure&#8208;activity relationship of this new class of ligand through experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnesium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Thia&#8208;Michael Addition With Broad Substrate Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate the application of chiral magnesium complexes in an asymmetric carbon&#8208;sulfur bond&#8208;forming reaction. Enantioselective and cost&#8208;effective methodology under mild condition for the thia&#8208;Michael addition, utilizing an in situ generated chiral dinuclear magnesium&#8208;ProPhenol complex, has been developed. The versatility of this protocol is demonstrated with a broad range of thiol nucleophiles and a wide selection of enones. Enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;ketosulfides are obtained in good to excellent yields and moderate to excellent enantioselectivity. The presented catalytic system exhibits excellent tolerance for structurally different substrates while maintaining high enantioselectivity. This observation aligns with proposed mechanism, wherein the sulfur atom coordinates to the catalyst in close proximity to the reaction center.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalyzed [3+3] Annulation for the Enantioselective Synthesis of Benzopyranothiazinones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design, inspired by the core&#8208;structure of oxicam has allowed the enantioselective synthesis of benzopyranothiazinone motifs employing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. The NHC&#8208;mediated transformation involves the reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes with suitable substituted benzothiazinone derivatives. This process encompasses the initial formation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acylazoliums from ynals and concurrent generation of enolates from benzothiazinone. The culmination of these reactions results in an efficient annulation, yielding the desired products with reasonable yields and high stereoselectivities. This study underscores the potential of NHC catalysis in the streamlined synthesis of complex heterocyclic structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective (4+2) Annulation of Cyclopropane Carbaldehydes with 2&#8208;Mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;Arylethanones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report the organocatalytic enantioselective synthesis of dihydrothiopyran derivatives from trans racemic donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane carbaldehydes (DACCs) and 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;arylethanone via formal thio (4+2) cycloaddition involving thia&#8208;Michael aldol condensation and annulation. Mechanistic studies indicate a typical kinetic resolution (KR) is involved in this transformation, which results in moderate yields and enantiomeric ratios. Remarkably, this method is characterized by its one&#8208;pot simplicity, mild reaction conditions, and resilience towards air and moisture interference.</dc:description>

         <title>A Three&#8208;Component Domino Reaction Enabled by Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis for the Assembly of 3&#8208;Thioquinoline&#8208;2,5&#8208;Diones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalytic domino reaction involving cyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione&#8208;derived enaminones, 5&#8208;alkenyl rhodanines, and haloalkanes has been developed. This protocol produces a wide range of 3&#8208;thioquinoline&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones in yields of 52&#8211;81%. The construction of a C&#8722;S bond at the C&#8208;3 position of the quinoline&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione framework expands its structural diversity. Studies into the reaction mechanism revealed that the reaction undergoes a conjugate addition, ammonolysis, elimination, and nucleophilic substitution sequence. The synthetic potential of the reaction was demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale syntheses of representative products. Chloroalkyl chains were installed on the sulfur atoms of most products obtained in this reaction. Diversified product derivatives were obtained by exploiting the favorable leaving nature of chloride moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Reaction of 2&#8208;Styrylbenzaldehydes with Indoles in the Synthesis of 1H&#8208;Indenes via 4&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cascade reaction between 2&#8208;styrylbenzaldehydes and indoles has been developed for the synthesis of 1H&#8208;indenes. An iodine&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic addition of indoles to an aldehyde group of 2&#8208;styrylbenzaldehydes leads to the formation of carbocation intermediates that undergo 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization to give indenes with a trisubstituted double bond. These indenes are transformed into thermodynamically more stable products with a fully substituted double bond under the reaction conditions. Minor quantities of indolylbenzo[b]carbazoles are also produced as by&#8208;products.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Cyclization Reactions of 1,6&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elaborated molecular architectures, specifically those bearing one or more carbon stereocenters, stand as an important class of carbocyclic and heterocyclic frameworks because they are frequently occurring core structures in numerous natural products and biologically active pharmaceutical molecules. Over the past few decades, the development of novel and versatile synthetic approaches via cascade cyclization reactions of 1,6&#8208;enynes for the construction of a series of fused and spiro compounds has been the focus of a great deal of research initiatives. These synthesis strategies are peculiarly fascinating in the context of the assembly of a wide array of pharmaceutical molecules, natural products, agrochemicals, and functional materials. In this review, recent developments in the transformations of 1,6&#8208;enynes with diverse coupling reagents are summarized since 2018, which could be divided into five categories: 1) Introduction; 2) Transition metal catalyzed cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes; 3) Metal&#8208;free cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes; 4) Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes; 5) Electrocatalytic cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Construction of Substituted Purine Esters with Tunable N&#8208;9/N&#8208;7 Regioselectivity via Enzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>

Abstract
We report an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution protocol for the one&#8208;pot asymmetric synthesis of substituted purine derivatives. The controllable N&#8208;9/N&#8208;7 substitution, which posed formidable challenges in organic synthesis, could be accomplished by choosing different types of enzymes as catalysts. This method was proved scalable and was used to prepare a series of prodrugs of medicinally active acids. In addition, the recyclability test of the biocatalysts indicated the potential of this strategy for applications in the pharmaceutical industry.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed &#947;&#8208;Arylation of Acylketene Synthons with Aryl Chlorides Enabled by Ylide&#8208;Functionalized Phosphines (YPhos)</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalyst system based on palladium 2&#8208;methylnaphthyl complexes bearing ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines (YPhos) was found to enable the selective &#947;&#8208;arylation of 1,3&#8208;dioxinone derivatives with diversely functionalized aryl, heteroaryl, and vinyl chlorides. The products were further converted into 1,3&#8208;diketones and heterocycles, highlighting their function as synthetic hubs. Experimental and computational studies revealed that bulky, electron&#8208;rich YPhos ligands are uniquely effective because they enable the oxidative addition of aryl chlorides at room temperature while at the same time efficiently promoting the rate&#8208;limiting reductive elimination step of the thermally sensitive enolates.</dc:description>

         <title>Shifting Access from Pyrimidine&#8208;Spirofused to Fused Benzoheterocycles by Modifying the Activated Group Position</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of pyrimidine&#8208;spirofused indolines from 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes with 2&#8208;sulfonyliminoindolines has been achieved under catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions, in which five atoms of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes were introduced to the spiro&#8208;annulation products via a (5 + 1) pathway. Subsequently, this strategy was extended to 3&#8208;aminoindoles and 3&#8208;aminobenzothiophenes, but a different reaction pathway (3 + 3) was observed. In these cases, three&#8208;atoms of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes were incorporated into pyrimidine&#8208;fused indoles/benzothiophenes. These two transformations demonstrate the potential and versatility of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes to construct nitrogen&#8208;heterocycles.</dc:description>

Abstract
A class of 3&#8208;(azidomethyl)&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine has been obtained through a copper&#8208;catalyzed diazidation of allenes and a subsequent azirination involving vinyl azides. A variety of functional groups in the allenes are well tolerated, providing a series of 3&#8208;(azidomethyl)&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine motifs in 51%&#8208;93% yields (26 examples).

         <title>Regioselective 1,2&#8208;Dicarbofunctionalization of Silylated 1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;regioselective dicarbofunctionalization of silylated 1,3&#8208;dienes with functionalized solid organozinc pivalates and alkyl bromides is disclosed, thus affording the alkylarylated and dialkylated silanes in a regioselective manifold. Herein, regioselectivity is steered by steric hindrance of the bulky silyl groups, which could prohibit the formation of the flexible &#960;&#8208;allylcobalt intermediate. Furthermore, derivatizations of the resulting products and modifications of bioactive molecules demonstrate the synthetical utility of our method.

Abstract
We report a strategy for stereoselective O&#8208;aryl&#8208;glycoside synthesis by copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of a variety of anomeric sugars and (hetero)aromatic iodides. Stereocontrol of the &#945;/&#946; selectivity can be successfully realized by slight structural modifications of the oxalic diamide ligands. Mechanistic studies indicated a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) reaction mechanism controlled by the ligand structures. This reaction could be performed on gram scale, and has also been applied to the synthesis of some natural products.

This reaction could be performed on gram scale, and has also been applied to the synthesis of some natural products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
The stereoselective reaction of &#945;&#8208;amido&#8208;substituted malonic acid half oxyesters (&#945;&#8208;amido&#8208;MAHOs) with isatins was developed. A cinchona alkaloid thiourea catalyst gave products bearing a tetrasubstituted stereogenic centre in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (75&#8211;99% yield, 83:17&#8211;97:3 dr, 92:8&#8211;99:1 er). The obtained products can be converted into some chiral compounds without loss of enantiopurity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to clarify the origin of stereoselectivities, and suggested that the first stereogenic centre is set in the decarboxylation, the second in the protonation.

         <title>Regioselective Ring&#8208;Opening of Oxetanes Catalyzed by Lewis Superacid Al(C6F5)3</title>

Abstract
This study details an aluminum&#8208;catalyzed regioselective isomerization of 2,2&#8208;disubstituted oxetanes to yield homoallylic alcohols. The reaction takes place in toluene at 40&#8201;&#176;C, employing 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of Al(C6F5)3 as catalyst. This catalytic system shows a wide substrate scope (12 examples). The optimized conditions are especially useful for electron&#8208;rich aryl oxetanes, completely suppressing the formation of allyl isomers and reducing the amount of the dimer by&#8208;product. The synthetic applicability of the reported methodology is demonstrated by the enantioselective formal synthesis of curcuquinone and the &#963;1 receptor agonist RC&#8208;33.

Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H acyloxylation of 2&#8208;aroyl pyridine derivatives with simple sodium carboxylate utilizing transformable directing groups is described. This protocol features broad functional group tolerance and chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectivity, providing the acyloxylation products in 45%&#8208;84%yield. Furthermore, the synthetic utility of this protocol was demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical compounds. Notably, the acyloxylation products could be further transformed into a variety of useful heterocycles under mild conditions.

         <title>Continuous Manufacturing of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients: Current Trends and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The pharmaceutical industry has traditionally employed batch processing as a means of synthesizing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) on a commercial scale. Batch manufacturing enables API synthesis in large quantities in order to meet regulations. Yet, this strategy remains cumbersome, is labor&#8208;intensive, and creates complex logistical networks. In recent decades, batch API processing has gradually eroded American economic competitiveness and has led to the offshoring of API manufacturing from the United States. Today it is estimated that +80% of APIs are manufactured overseas.[1] Meanwhile, disruptions from the Coronavirus Disease (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) have exacerbated weaknesses in the global supply chain, culminating with widespread shortages of critical life&#8208;saving drugs.[2] These shortages have emphasized the importance of reshoring drug manufacturing to the U.S. and fostered a regulatory landscape that seeks advanced methods of API manufacturing in order to bolster America's supply chain resiliency.[3] Recently, increased attention has been directed towards continuous drug manufacturing to enable nonstop API production within modular stand&#8208;alone flow systems. Continuous manufacturing (CM) facilitates modular automation, offers new avenues towards process intensification, and even enables in&#8208;line analytical monitoring from raw materials to packaged products. This strategy offers better conversion, increased safety, reduced waste, and overall cost savings versus traditional batch&#8208;style processing. The rise of advanced API manufacturing, coupled with the current regulatory landscape, offers a rare window of opportunity to convert traditional batch pharmaceutical processes into continuous, streamlined production systems to on&#8208;shore API manufacturing and eliminate drug shortages. This review will outline the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the CM of APIs and will highlight the translation of chemistry and unit operations from batch processes to modular CM systems.

Abstract
We report a vinyl cyanation reaction of vinyl triflates and readily available 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene through a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling process. The reaction is operated under mild conditions with remarkable functional&#8208;group compatibility. Cyclic vinyl triflates with various ring sizes and substituents at different positions all reacted smoothly. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by the derivatization of pharmaceutical and natural compounds, a scale&#8208;up synthesis, and various functional group transformations. Preliminary mechanistic studies demonstrate that vinyl triflates are more reactive than 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene towards the oxidative addition to nickel catalyst.

         <title>Regioselective Reductive Elimination from Bismuth(V) Compounds for Aryl Transfer to Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We demonstrate that regioselective aryl transfer to the nucleophile occurs rapidly under mild conditions via reductive elimination and show that regioselectivity is primarily governed by steric factors imparted by ortho substituents on the recipient ring. Computational modeling and x&#8208;ray crystallography confirm that the recipient aryl ring is positioned in the equatorial coordination site and oriented orthogonally to the axial X&#8722;Bi&#8722;Ph bond (X=nucleophile) in a trigonal bipyramidal structure. The orientation of the ortho&#8208;substituted aryl ring allows the appropriate orbital to overlap between its ipso carbon and nucleophile, which enhances the rate of aryl transfer to the nucleophile and dictates the regioselective reductive elimination from Bi(V) compounds. This level of stereoelectronic control results in significantly enhanced reaction rate and selectivity and creates an opportunity to rationally design ligand systems for selective aryl transfer reactions.

         <title>Ru(II) Catalyzed Oxidative Dehydrogenative Annulation and Spirocyclization of Isoquinolones with N&#8208;Substituted Maleimides</title>

Abstract
A Ruthenium(II) catalyzed additive&#8208;free oxidative, dehydrogenative annulation of different malemides on 3,4&#8208;disubstituted isoquinolone to afford fused and spiro&#8208;cyclized isoquinolo&#8208;isoquinolone and isoindolo&#8208;isoquinolone derivatives is reported here. By simply changing solvent and oxidizing agents, under two different conditions, this methodology produced two different poly&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclized products. Isoquinolone&#8208;NH was strategically used as the internal directing group in the ortho C&#8722;H activation using Ru(II) catalyst. Mechanistically dehydrogenative, oxidative C&#8722;C followed by C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling and aza&#8208;michael reaction pathway led to the corresponding fused and spiro&#8208;products respectively. A diversified library of eighty&#8208;one (81) such two products were synthesized by employing this methodology. The fused and the spirocyclized polyheterocyclic compounds absorbed at &#955;max 240&#8211;270&#8197;nm range, however only spiro&#8208;compounds produced blue fluorescence at &#955;em 391&#8211;450&#8197;nm range.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prospect of developing methods to control the reactivity of metal(oxo) holds appeal for both synthetic and bioinorganic chemistry. In this study, we observed that carboxylic acids enhance reactivity in C&#8211;H oxidation by forming hydrogen bonds with the oxo ligand, thereby increasing the basicity and electrophilicity of the oxo intermediate. Additionally, we discovered that H&#8208;dicarboxylate ligands, such as oxalate, malonate, and maleate, significantly improve the catalyst turnover frequency (up to 760/h) in unactivated C(sp3)&#8211;H oxidation. Furthermore, the addition of maleic acid was also found to activate Fe and Mn(pdp)&#8208;catalysed C&#8211;H oxygenation. Notably, Ru(bpga)(H&#8208;maleate)2 3&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization exhibited a broad functional group tolerance, including bromine, hydroxyl, benzoate, nitro, nitryl, sulfonate, imide, sulfonylamide, and carbamate, yielding up to 98% in a site&#8208; and chemoselective manner with only 0.1&#8208;2.0 mmol% loading.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrosonium ion catalyzed oxidative bromination of arenes.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A nitrosonium catalyzed bromination of electron&#8208;rich arenes has been developed, using bromide salts as bromine sources, oxygen gas as a terminal oxidant and Br&#248;nsted acids (sulfuric acid, TFA or HBr). This arene bromination process is free of transition metals, proceeding in acetic acid and under mild temperatures (25&#8208;50 &#176;C) to give brominated arenes with good to excellent yields. Our mechanistic studies indicated that this oxidative bromination of arenes reaction is catalyzed by nitrosnium ion (NO+), without the involvement of Br2 or Br+. The kinetic isotope effect of this reaction was measured using pentadeuteriophenyl phenyl ether (kH/kD = 1.1).</dc:description>

         <title>Organo&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Dehydrative Coupling Reaction to Prepare Arylacetic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, the use of triphenylmethylium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate as an efficient catalyst for the intermolecular dehydrative coupling of p&#8208;hydroxymandelic acid hydrate with substituted aromatic amines and (thio)phenols was developed, which allows for the preparation of arylacetic acid derivatives in a convenient manner. Notably, this method offers several advantages, including being prefunctionalization free, high atom efficiency, and high regioselectivity. Additionally, it exhibits a broad substrate scope, enabling the synthesis of a range of arylacetic acid derivatives. Furthermore, this method can also be applied to the etherification of arylthiol derivatives, facilitating the preparation of various thiolated products, which would enhance the applicability and potential utility of this method in organic synthesis.

         <title>Stereospecific Indium(III)&#8208;Catalysed Tandem Cycloisomerization of Functionalized 1,6&#8208;enynes: Scope and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Tandem cycloisomerization reactions of functionalized 1,6&#8208;enynes under indium(III) catalysis are described. This atom&#8208;economic transformation proceeds smoothly with 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig regioselectivity using commercial In(III) halides and 1,6&#8208;enynes furnished with alcohol, carboxylic acid or amine functional groups to give bicyclic structures in good yields and diastereoselectivities. The reaction with enynals involves a three&#8211;step mechanism to give an oxatricycle and a conjugated 1,3&#8208;diene. In the absence of the internal nucleophile the enyne cycloisomerization evolves through a skeletal rearrangement or a cyclopropanation reaction after the regioselective 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization. The 1,6&#8208;enyne cycloisomerization is stereospecific and the stereoselectivity appears to be independent of the internal nucleophile. Experimental data support a common reaction mechanism involving an initial alkyne electrophilic &#960;&#8208;coordination of In(III) followed by Markovnikov electrophilic alkene addition and ring&#8208;closure by nucleophilic attack. DFT studies hold up a stepwise mechanism involving the formation of a chiral non&#8208;classical carbocation intermediate that determines the diastereoselectivity of this tandem cycloisomerization reaction.

         <title>Photocatalytic Dehydrogenative 6&#960;&#8208;Photocyclisation of Indole Derivatives via Successive Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, a successive energy transfer (sEnT) strategy to enable a dehydrogenative 6&#960;&#8208;photocyclisation, without the need for an external oxidant is reported, in which the energetically unfavourable dehydrogenation is driven by energy transfer. The valuable applicability of this method was demonstrated by the scaffold hopping of indole containing bioactive molecules, as well as by the succinct synthesis of naturally occurring tetracyclic furocarbazole alkaloids. Moreover, experimental and computational studies were conducted to elucidate the reaction mechanism.

Abstract
We report a process to access a variety of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluorinated alcohols. A Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation method was developed in 85&#8211;98% yields and enantiomeric excesses ranging from 52% to &gt;99%. The reduction proceeds under mild conditions with a range of difluorinated molecules including 3,3&#8208;difluorochromanone, 3,3&#8208;difluorothiochromanone, 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;dihydroquinolinone and &#945;&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;ketosulfone derivatives to provide the desired enantioenriched difluorinated alcohols which are valuable fluorinated building blocks.

Abstract
A four&#8208;component reaction of N&#8208;arylpropiolamides, Hantzsch esters, Na2S2O5 and water via a radical cascade cyclization process with the insertion of sulfur dioxide mediated by K2S2O8 is reported. A series of alkylsulfonated spiro[4,5] trienones are prepared up to 86% yield with a good functional group tolerance and substrate applicability. Preliminary mechanism experiments indicate that carbonyl oxygen of spiro[4,5] trienones originated from water.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Length Scale Communication Effects in Catalysis: Thinking Big and Acting Small</title>

Abstract
The use of hierarchically structured materials as catalysts has been finding increasing application in the past years. For these catalytic systems, not only the nano&#8208;scale matters: a high degree of order across multiple length scales, along with its control and analytical assessment, is of paramount importance to obtain innovative properties that can find application in catalysis. Most reviews dealing with hierarchically structured materials are concerned with the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; transfer of structural information along the different length scales, with special emphasis on the transmission of chirality. Due to their mesoscale size together with their complex behaviour, these systems are often susceptible to feel the effects of macroscopic forces, that can exert a &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; control of their catalytic properties, so that an external stimulus, acting at the level of the supramolecular architecture of the catalyst, can ultimately determine the outcome of the catalyzed reaction at the molecular level. We review in this paper some recent reports that deal with the experimental implementation of this concept, either by using a mechanical force in a full range direct transmission to the reaction coordinate, or by means of a stepwise relay transmission from the macroscopic level (purely supramolecular chirality) to the nanoscopic one. We focus in this review on these multi&#8208;length scale communication control effects, identifying the different mechanisms that are affecting the catalytic activity.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of 2&#8208;(Quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzyl Alcohols by Biocatalytic Dynamic Kinetic Resolutions</title>

Abstract
A highly enantioselective biocatalytic dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of 2&#8208;(quinoline&#8208;8&#8208;yl) 3&#8208;methylbenzaldehydes and 1&#8208;naphthaldehydes is described. The reaction proceeds by atroposelective carbonyl reduction catalyzed by commercial ketoreductases (KREDs), generally reaching high conversions and excellent enantiomeric excesses. Both atropoisomers of the final alcohols can be obtained by a proper selection of the biocatalyst. The DKR strategy relies in the racemization of the stereogenic axis that takes place thanks to a transient Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction (LABI) between the nitrogen in the quinoline and the carbonyl group.

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidative Cleavage of Alkenes Followed by Carbonyl Stereoselective Bioreduction for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Oxidative alkene cleavage of a series of (hetero)aryl alkyl styrenes in aqueous medium has been developed using either 9&#8208;mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methylacridinium perchlorate ([AcrMes]ClO4) and sodium anthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonate (SAS) as photosensitizers under blue LED irradiation. Reaction conditions were studied to find a suitable media for the development of a linear cascade after subsequent stereoselective reduction of the corresponding ketone intermediate. The use of cesium carbonate provided an adequate pH to the reaction medium for the alcohol dehydrogenase action. [AcrMes]ClO4 was found to be the best photocatalyst, allowing the development of concurrent or sequential cascades depending on the ability of the photosensitizer to oxidize back the chiral alcohol to the ketone. Overall, the photobiocatalytic approach has allowed the synthesis of a wide number of alcohol compounds, the formation of (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;enantiomers being attained with excellent stereoselectivity and moderate to good yields.

         <dc:description>Abstract. A previously undescribed aryne derived from a &#960;&#8208;extended biphenylene, 2,3&#8208;didehydrobenzo[b]biphenylene, has been developed. The participation of this new aryne building block in [4+2] and palladium&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions has been applied to the synthesis of a variety of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) with appealing structures which combine (aromatic) benzene and (antiaromatic) cyclobutadiene (CBD) rings. Among them, a family of unsubstituted (or barely substituted) CBD&#8208;oligoacenes has been accessed by iterative Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of the new aryne with furans and/or isobenzofurans, followed by deoxygenative aromatization of the resulting 	epoxy&#8208;derivatives. The experimental and computational studies of the newly synthesized PCHs suggest an important degree of electron delocalization along the polycyclic skeleton, more pronounced in the linearly fused derivatives. The computed ACID plots reveal clockwise current density vectors at the peripheral bonds, originating from the sigma contributions of the antiaromatic cyclobutadiene rings..</dc:description>

Abstract
In this paper, we present a one&#8208;pot protocol that enables a straightforward and selective transformation of alkyl benzothiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl and phenyltetrazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl sulfones and acyl chlorides into ketones, E&#8208;olefins, Z&#8208;olefins, and even pyrroles. The final product of the reaction depends on the proper choice of the reaction workup. Notably, the protocol designed for olefin formation allows a switch between E&#8208; and Z&#8208;olefin formation by the correct choice of the reaction workup. These developed protocols facilitate the formation of all compounds under mild reaction conditions, as evidenced by the synthesis of (nitro)&#8208;fatty acids, and the concept can be extended to other product formations, as demonstrated by the synthesis of pyrroles.

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we present a one-pot protocol that enables a straightforward and selective transformation of alkyl benzothiazol-2-yl and phenyltetrazol-2-yl sulfones and acyl chlorides into ketones, E-olefins, Z-olefins, and even pyrroles. The final product of the reaction depends on the proper choice of the reaction workup. Notably, the protocol designed for olefin formation allows a switch between E- and Z-olefin formation by the correct choice of the reaction workup.

         <title>Chiral 1&#8208;Phosphabarrelene&#8208;Pyridines as Suitable Ligands for the Rh/Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Olefins</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of chiral phosphabarrelene&#8208;pyridine ligands. Their synthesis benefit from modified reaction conditions to overcome the low yields normally associated with the [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of phosphinines with hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;butyne, which is a key to install the P&#8208;stereocenter in the phosphabarrelene. Their potential as chelating ligands in asymmetric catalysis was assessed in the Rh&#8208; and Ir&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of cyclic &#946;&#8208;enamides and &#946;&#8208;dehydroamino acid derivatives. The catalytic system containing a tert&#8208;butyl substituent at the ortho position of the phosphabarrelene moiety successfully hydrogenates a range of cyclic &#946;&#8208;enamides (ee's between 92% to 94%) and &#946;&#8208;dehydroamino acid derivatives (ee's between 93% to 95%). Moreover, the reactions can be carried out in the environmentally friendly 1,2&#8208;propylene carbonate as solvent with no loss of enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies with the Rh/P,N catalytic systems agree with the Landis&#8208;Halpern mechanism and explain the influence of the substituent at the phosphabarrelene on enantioselectivity. Finally, the hydrogenation reactions can be carried out at large scale maintaining high enantioselectivities.

Abstract
Ortho&#8208;directed electrochemical C&#8722;H functionalization of aromatics with boron&#8208;based coupling partners has been achieved under ruthenium catalysis through an oxidatively induced reductive elimination mechanism. Our method provides a single set of conditions delivering C&#8722;H arylation, alkenylation and methylation, yielding ortho&#8208;functionalized products with good functional group tolerance, including examples of late&#8208;stage functionalization in synthetically useful yields. By harnessing electricity as a &#8216;green&#8217; oxidant, this method circumvents the need for stoichiometric quantities of chemical oxidants, enhancing our sustainability metrics.

Abstract
An electrochemical methodology for the construction of &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;substituted carbonyl compounds in moderate to good yields under exogenous metal and oxidant&#8208;free conditions has been developed. The protocol involves the single&#8208;electron oxidation of the aryl ring to generate a radical cation followed by a three&#8208;electron SN2 reaction resulting in the formation of &#945;&#8208;CF3 substituted ketones.

         <title>Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloaddition of C60 with Enynes: Unveiling the Mechanistic Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
In this study we present a method for functionalizing C60 through a Rh&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction with 1,6&#8208;enynes, resulting in the formation of a fused bicyclic structure. Additionally, fullerene derivatives are further functionalized through regioselective photooxygenation reactions. Our DFT calculations reveal two distinct reaction pathways: one involving rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of the enyne followed by Diels&#8208;Alder with C60, and the other featuring a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of enyne and C60 followed by isomerization. Surprisingly, both pathways exhibit nearly identical energy barriers. However, experimental tests indicate that the predominant pathway varies depending on the substitution motifs of the substrates.

         <title>Accessing Borazine Substitution Patterns through Late&#8208;Stage Iodination</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We have defined a procedure for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of aryl borazines to facilitate the synthesis of a diverse array of borazine derivatives with varying substitution patterns, paving the way for further exploration of the field. More in detail, we have studied and disclosed a simple iodination procedure that could be applied to several differently substituted substrates (1&#8201;a&#8211;i) with mostly good to excellent yields (47&#8211;96%). The representative iodinated compounds 2&#8201;b and 2&#8201;e, were utilized to test their use in further representative functionalization steps such as cyanation, Heck, and Sonogashira reactions. All products 3&#8201;a&#8211;e were obtained in satisfactory good to very good yields considering the multiple (three or six times) concomitant reactions.

Abstract
A direct thiocyanatosulfonation of alkynes with sulfinic acids and potassium thiocyanate was developed at room temperature. This method provided a efficient and practical pathway to selectively access (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;(thiocyanato)vinyl sulfones by two C&#8722;S bonds formation in one step under metal&#8208;free condition. The advantages of this method included simple reaction conditions, easily available starting materials, good functional group compatibility, high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity and good to excellent yields of products.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of Polysubstituted Carbazoles from Indoles and Simple Dicarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polysubstituted carbazoles were efficiently synthesized through direct benzannulation reaction between 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds and indoles with catalytic amount of inexpensive zirconium(IV) chloride. This transformation proved to be regioselective and furnishes 1,4&#8208;disubstituted and 1,2,4&#8208;trisubstituted carbazoles with yields ranging from 26% to 91% and broad substrate scope. Moreover, this protocol benefits from using readily accessible starting materials without the need of their pre&#8208;functionalization. The synthetic utility of the products was exemplified by functionalization of an iodocarbazole by means of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions and by the synthesis of a 3&#8208;deaza&#8208;derivative of the natural product canthin&#8208;6&#8208;one.</dc:description>

         <title>The Intermolecular Pauson&#8208;Khand Reaction: Applications, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The rapid assembly of complex organic molecules from simple and structurally diverse building blocks is a prevalent challenge in organic synthesis. The Pauson&#8208;Khand reaction (PKR) is a method of choice for the construction of five membered rings that has historically been popularized as a late&#8208;stage intramolecular cyclization method. The intermolecular version of the PKR, on the other hand, constitutes a powerful approach for the rapid assembly of densely functionalized cyclopentanic cores at early stages of a synthetic sequence. Despite its potential, the intermolecular PKR is much less prevalent in the organic synthesis literature due to several historical limitations, most importantly a reduced scope with respect to the alkene component of the reaction. The last decade has witnessed important developments in the area including a) experimental and theoretical studies that provide a good mechanistic understanding of the reaction and its selectivity, b) methodological developments that have broadened the scope of potential alkene partners, and c) the development of catalytic enantioselective versions that provide useful levels of enantioselectivity. In parallel, remarkable synthetic applications of the intermolecular PKR have emerged, including (enantioselective) total syntheses of complex natural products (polycyclic terpenes, alkaloids, prostanes) as well as examples of industrial relevance. A fundamental limitation of the PKR that needs to be addressed in the future is the current lack of a ligand&#8208;accelerated version of the reaction, which would be a promising advance towards developing more efficient and general catalytic (enantioselective) reactions.
