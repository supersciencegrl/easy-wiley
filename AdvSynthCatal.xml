      <title>Development of an enzymatic process for the synthesis of the key intermediate of telotristat ethyl</title>
      <dc:description>(R)&#8208;1&#8208;(4&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;(3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl) phenyl)&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethan&#8208;1&#8208;ol [(R)&#8208;2] is a key chiral intermediate in the synthesis of telotristat ethyl, an anti&#8208;carcinoid syndrome drug. However, the synthetic methods for (R)&#8208;2 mainly include chemical reductions, rarely involving biocatalysis or bioreduction for the moment. Here, we report a method for obtaining (R)&#8208;2 by biocatalytic reduction of corresponding prochiral acetophenone (1) with bulky o&#8208;substitution using recombinant Lactobacillus fermentum short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase 1 (LfSDR1) as a biocatalyst. Further engineering of LfSDR1 variants could access asymmetric reduction of 1 and yield (R)&#8208;2 with a &gt;99% ee value and a &gt;99% conversion. In addition, through the test of different co&#8208;solvents and a series of initial substrate concentrations, substrate 1 with the concentration of 60 g/L can be completely converted into (R)&#8208;2 on a preparative scale (1.13 g, 3.93 mmol, 75.6% isolated yield) in 24 hours. This study presents an efficient enzymatic process for the biocatalytic synthesis of key chiral intermediate (R)&#8208;2 in the synthesis of telotristat ethyl.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Developments in Radical Cross&#8208;Coupling of Redox&#8208;Active Cycloketone Oximes</title>
      <dc:description>Recent years have witnessed a renaissance of radical cross&#8208;coupling of cycloketone oximes which served as active cyanoalkyl radical via ring fragmentation in various transformations. It provided an efficient and practical strategy to introduce cyanoalkyl groups into organic compounds without using toxic cyanide sources. In this review, a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the field of redox&#8208;active cycloketone oximes&#8208;based cross&#8208;couplings were covered. This review was categorized into two broad parts: non&#8208;photocatalyzed and photocatalyzed cross&#8208;couplings according to the reaction conditions. Moreover, the two broad parts were further divided into several sub&#8208;sections depending on the nature of the bond formation. Some representative examples along with reaction mechanisms were also discussed.</dc:description>

      <title>Organic Azides: Versatile Synthons in Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;H Amination/Annulation for N&#8208;Heterocycle Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Organic azides are highly reactive, which have long established as versatile building blocks in the assembly of structurally diverse N&#8208;containing heterocycles. The conversion of organic azides into high&#8208;value compounds is of great importance and a subject of enormous current interest.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Organic azides are highly reactive, which have long established as versatile building blocks in the assembly of structurally diverse N&#8208;containing heterocycles. The conversion of organic azides into high&#8208;value compounds is of great importance and a subject of enormous current interest. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;H amination/annulation of organic azides provides a powerful tool for the transformation of organic azides into a wide range of biologically important heterocyclic frameworks. In this review, we aim to summarize the recent progress on organic azides&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8211;H amination/annulation for N&#8208;heterocycle synthesis enabled by transition metal catalysts.

      <title>Recent Achievements in the Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Concise Construction of Medium N&#8208;Heterocycles, Azepines and Azocines</title>
      <dc:description>Medium N&#8208;heterocycles, azepines and azocines, serve as important skeletons that occurred widely in natural products, however, due to the lack of efficient synthetic methodologies, their application potential in biologically active molecules, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals remained to be explored. In this context, rhodium catalysis in this field featured good reactivity and functional group tolerance, with readily available starting materials, and enabled rapid access to the azepines and azocines. Delightfully, great achievements in the concise construction of these 7 and 8&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles under Rh&#8208;catalysis have been made, which mainly included cycloisomerization of unsaturated C&#8210;X bonds (which might also combine the ring&#8208;opening strategy on strained rings), metal carbenoid or nitrene insertion involved transformations, and direct C&#8210;H activation reactions. Considering the great performance of rhodium catalyst in the synthesis of azepines and azocines, herein, we summarized the recent results in this field, and wish to give further insight and inspired more encouraging methodologies and new drug discovery based on these 7 and 8&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A direct carbocyclization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophthalazine&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones is achieved using isocyanates as carbonyl source via Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed sequential ortho&#8208;amidation followed by intramolecular nucleophilic substitution, delivering substituted indazolo[1,2&#8208;b]phthalazine&#8208;triones in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. For ortho&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophthalazine&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones, the corresponding amidated products were also isolated in excellent yields by modifying the reaction parameters. Application of isocyanate as carbonyl source, high functional group tolerance on the two coupling partners and diverse chemical transformation of the synthesized fused and functionalized phthalazinones are the key highlights of the work.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A direct carbocyclization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophthalazine&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones is achieved using isocyanates as carbonyl source via Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed sequential ortho&#8208;amidation followed by intramolecular nucleophilic substitution, delivering substituted indazolo[1,2&#8208;b]phthalazine&#8208;triones in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. For ortho&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophthalazine&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones, the corresponding amidated products were also isolated in excellent yields by modifying the reaction parameters. Application of isocyanate as carbonyl source, high functional group tolerance on the two coupling partners and diverse chemical transformation of the synthesized fused and functionalized phthalazinones are the key highlights of the work.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Biaryls using Biaryl 2,5&#8208;Diphenylphospholanes as Ligands for Palladium&#8208;Catalysed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Here we describe the development of biaryl 2,5&#8208;diphenylphospholanes as a new class of C2&#8208;symmetric, monodentate ligands for asymmetric Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura (ASM) reactions. Screening of a series of exemplary phospholanes led to the identification of two ligands that were used to prepare a range of atropisomeric biaryl and heterobiaryl products with good to excellent levels of enantioselectivity (up to 97:3 e.r.) under mild conditions. DFT studies suggest that the formation of a constraining ligand pocket and coordination of one of the biaryl methoxy groups in the optimised ligands to the metal centre is crucial for restricting conformational freedom in the bond&#8208;forming step.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A Ni/Co co&#8208;catalyzed reductive hydrocyanation of various alkynes is developed for the production of saturated nitriles. Hydrocyanic acid is generated in situ from safe and readily available formamide. Formamide played multiple roles as a cyano source, dehydrant, and reductant for the NiII pre&#8208;catalyst and vinyl nitriles, along with acting as the co&#8208;solvent in this reaction. Detailed mechanistic investigation supported a pathway via hydrocyanation of C&#8801;C bond and the subsequent reduction of C=C bond. Wide substrate scope, the employment of a cheap and stable nickel salt as pre&#8208;catalyst, a safe cyano source, and convenient experimental operation render this hydrocyanation practical for the laboratory synthesis of saturated nitriles.</dc:description>

      <title>Stepwise Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling of Triborylalkenes Derived from Alkynyl&#8211;B(dan)s: Regioselective and Flexible Synthesis of Tetrasubstituted Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>Alkenes with 3 boryl groups of distinct different reactivity were synthesized for the first time, and were thus demonstrated to cross&#8208;couple with aryl halides step&#8208;by&#8208;step to provide regioselectively&#8208;well&#8208;controlled tetrasubstituted alkenes. The triborylalkene, which is readily derived from the platinum&#8208;catalyzed diboration of alkynyl&#8211;B(dan)s with B2(pin)2, is our original template. Due to the high/exclusive regioselectivity and reaction efficiency of each step from the alkynyl&#8211;B(dan), tetrasubstituted alkenes with a desired carbon framework at a desired position can be prepared in high yields. For example, the alkene with four different aryl groups of p&#8208;MeOC6H4, p&#8208;CF3C6H4, p&#8208;MeC6H4, and p&#8208;NCC6H4 can be obtained in 71% overall yield via six steps (see 9a in Scheme 5), starting with the dehydrogenative borylation of p&#8208;MeC6H4C&#8801;CH with HB(dan), which is also our original reaction. Moreover, a variety of tetrasubstituted alkenes, which include regio&#8208; and stereoisomers of 9a, AIE&#8208;active TPTPE and derivatives thereof, and also (Z)&#8208;tamoxifen well&#8208;known as a drug for breast cancer, were found to be target structures accessible by this strategy.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Developments in Photo&#8208;Catalyzed/Promoted Synthesis of Indoles and Their Functionalization: Reactions and Mechanisms</title>
      <dc:description>The use of clean and renewable light sources is increasingly common in organic synthesis due to its safety, practicality and economy. Recently, photoredox catalysis has shown great application values in organic transformations because of its advantages of environmentally friendly and abundant resources. Indoles and their derivatives (indolines, oxindoles and isatins) are the core skeletons of some important organic compounds and widely&#8208;present in various natural products and pharmaceuticals with different biological activities. Therefore, the research on the synthesis and modification of indoles is particularly important for chemists and pharmacologists. This review summarizes the effects of photocatalysis on indoles synthesis and modification in recent decades. These transformations are	accomplished by using metal photocatalysts (i.e., Ir, Ru, Ni, Cu, Fe, Au, Rh, TiO2, etc.) or non&#8208;metallic photocatalysts (i.e., Rose Bengal, Eosin Y, quinones, naphthols, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, carbazoles, pyrylium salts, etc.), or without the need of photocatalysts. The detailed mechanisms of these photo&#8208;catalyzed/promoted organic reactions are also highlighted deeply. And we hope this review will be helpful to researchers interested in this promising field of photocatalyzed transformations.</dc:description>

      <title>Methyl Radical Initiated Kharasch and Related Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>An improved procedure to run halogen atom and related chalcogen group transfer radical additions is reported. The procedure relies on the thermal decomposition of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylhyponitrite (DTBHN), a safer alternative to the explosive diacetyl peroxide, to produce highly reactive methyl radicals that can initiate the chain process. This mode of initiation generates byproducts that are either gaseous (N2) or volatile (acetone and methyl halide) thereby facilitating greatly product purification by either flash column chromatography or distillation. In addition, remarkably simple and mild reaction conditions (refluxing EtOAc during 30 minutes under normal atmosphere) and a low excess of the radical precursor reagent (2.0 equivalents) make this protocol particularly attractive for preparative synthetic applications. This initiation procedure has been demonstrated with a broad scope since it works efficiently to add a range of electrophilic radicals generated from iodides, bromides, selenides and xanthates over a range of unactivated terminal alkenes. A diverse set of radical trap substrates exemplifies a broad functional group tolerance. Finally, di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxyoxalate (DTBPO) is also demonstrated as alternative source of tert&#8208;butoxyl radicals to initiate these reactions under identical conditions which gives gaseous byproducts (CO2).</dc:description>

      <title>Propargylic Alcohols as Coupling Partners in Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Arene C&#8208;H Activation</title>
      <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed site selective arene C&#8208;H bond activation concomitant functionalization with various coupling partners gain magnificent attraction in synthetic organic chemistry as complementary to traditional transformations. Mechanistically, these C&#8208;H functionalization approaches involve directing group assisted concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation (CMD), migratory insertion, and reductive elimination sequences. In this realm, diverse categories of coupling partners were employed as C&#8208;H functionalization buddies. Particularly alkynes gain enormous  attention as annulating agents. These units coordinates with metalcycle through &#7467;&#8208;interaction produce annulation outcomes in a straightforward manner.
Very recently, propargylic alcohols were appointed as valuable archetypes in arene C&#8208;H activation armoury, as they have shown regio&#8208; and chemoselective migratory insertion into primary metalcycle species via hydroxy chelation. The influential regioselectivity was drawn by dual coordination of metal complexes with the pendent directing group and a propargylic hydroxyl group. In this review, we focused on annulations and functionalization of arenes and propargylic alcohols, which afford intricate cycles as well as complex acyclic motifs in a trouble&#8208;free manner. We categorized these transformations based on number of atoms  of propargylic alcohols involved in annulation along with some addition reactions. We anticipate to pave a way towards enhanced endeavours for discovering novel reaction avenues.</dc:description>
