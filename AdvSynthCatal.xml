         <title>Single Electron Transfer&#8208;Induced Selective &#945;&#727;Oxygenation of Glycine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modification of amino acids is an important strategy in organic and bioorganic chemistry. In contrast to common side&#8208;chain functionalization, backbone modification is much less explored. Especially glycine units seem to be attractive and versatile since a wide range of functionality can be potentially introduced. We report here oxidative modification of glycinates that are stable and enable further functionalization. Selective glycinate enolate oxidation by TEMPO or a FeCp2PF6/TEMPO reagent combination provides stable alkoxyamines in good to excellent yields. The methodology is expanded to glycine&#8208;containing dipeptides demonstrating selective oxygenation at the glycine unit. The orthogonal reactivity potential of oxygenated glycines for transformation to other amino acid derivatives is explored.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric addition and cycloaddition reactions with ylidene&#8208;five&#8208;membered heterocycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Five&#8208;membered heterocycles bearing an exocyclic double bond have been successfully used as substrates in asymmetric addition and cycloaddition reactions. Ylidene&#8208;heterocycles are attractive substrates due to its high functionalisation and the presence of an electrophilic conjugated exocyclic double bound that can participate in nucleophilic addition reactions as well as cycloaddition reactions, which may be triggered by the formation of aromatic intermediates or products in many cases. During the last decades, catalytic methodologies have been developed using ylidene&#8208;heterocycles as substrates in order to synthetize useful optically active heterocyclic derivatives. 4&#8208;Ylidene&#8208;isoxazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ones, pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones, 2,3&#8208;dioxopyrrolidines, rhodanines, oxazolidindiones, Erlenmeyer&#8208;Ploch azlactones and 5&#8208;ylidene&#8208;thiazolones have been successfully used as substrates in asymmetric reactions. This review collects the powerful research in asymmetric addition and cycloaddition reactions where ylidene&#8208;five&#8208;membered heterocycles have been used</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Hydroperoxylation of Aziridines and Epoxides Only with Aqueous Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalyst and organic solvent&#8208;free regioselective hydroperoxylation of aziridines and epoxides, including spiroaziridine&#8208; and spiroepoxy oxindoles have been explored with commercially available 50% aq. H2O2. This method provides easy and direct access to secondary benzylic &#946;&#8208;hydroperoxy amines and &#8208;alcohols and tertiary 3&#8208;hydroperoxy oxindoles. The protocol has also been applicable to the less reactive alkyl aziridines. Furthermore, an acid&#8208;catalyzed Kornblum&#8208;DeLaMare type rearrangement of secondary benzylic hydroperoxide has also been revealed to afford amino&#8208; and hydroxyl ketones.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A gold&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular tandem cyclization of alkynol&#8208;tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes was reported in this paper, providing a synthetic route to access naphthalene&#8208;fused eight&#8208; to eleven&#8208;membered cyclic ether derivatives in moderate to good yields. On the basis of control experiments and DFT calculations, a reasonable reaction mechanism involving gold carbene intermediate was proposed, which was formed via the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig enyne cyclization process.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>









Abstract
An iodine&#8208;catalyzed double [4+2] oxidative annulation of ketones and diamines is described. A multi&#8208;pathway coupled domino strategy has been developed for the synthesis of substituted dimeric pyrazines under metal&#8208;free conditions. One C&#8722;C and four C&#8722;N bonds are formed during this double [4+2] oxidative annulation process from two ketones and two diamines.

         <dc:description>
The front cover picture, designed by Pavel G. Sergeev and Daria I. Filina, illustrates the comparison between reactivities of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes and styrylmalonates in the Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed formal cycloadditions with conformationally non&#8208;rigid azadienes. On transition from one synthetic analogue to another, the regioselectivity of the addition can change dramatically from the (3+2)&#8208; to the (4+2)&#8208;pathway. The choice of styrylmalonates has been shown to be preferred in these reactions. The (4+2)&#8208;cycloaddition between styrylmalonates and azadienes was optimized to provide access to the diastereoselective synthesis of substituted tetrahydropyridines in high yields.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, ten &#969;&#8208;transaminases (&#969;&#8208;TAs) have been investigated to efficiently catalyze the synthesis of twenty&#8208;four functionalized benzylamines and pyridylmethylamines. We optimized the reactions, screened suitable amino donors and compared &#969;&#8208;transaminases activities for all aromatic aldehyde substrates. Under the optimized conditions, eighteen aromatic amines have been obtained with 60.4%&#8208;96.6% conversions and isolated only via simple extraction and recrystallization with 18.5%&#8208;81% yields on a preparative scale. Furthermore, we first immobilized the Bm&#8208;STA onto the MOFs via the physical adsorption to overcome the limitation of free enzyme and improve their industrial applications. The obtained Bm&#8208;STA/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 composites exhibited not only high enzymes loading (80.4 mg&#183;g&#8208;1) and enzyme activity recovery (95.8%), but also the better reusability, storage stability, pH stability and the tolerance to acetone and DMF.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Functionalization of Imidazopyridine and Indazole: An Overview</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis offers a mild, simple, and efficient tool for the preparation of interesting and useful molecules, thus eluding severe chemical oxidizing and reducing agents used in conventional synthetic methods. In particular, electrochemical C&#8722;H activation is expected to play an important role in the direct functionalization of heterocyclic compounds. Over the past few decades, the research interest in imidazopyridine and indazole has increased significantly due to their multipurpose uses in medicinal and industrial chemistry. Therefore, structural modification of these heterocycles using electro&#8208;oxidation has become one of the important research topics among synthetic organic chemistry in recent time. This review provides a comprehensive discussion of electrochemical functionalization of indazoles and imidazopyridines published so far. A summary of the current challenges and the future direction for the development of efficient and green electrochemical methods for functionalization of these heterocycles is also presented.

         <dc:description>









Abstract
We communicate two mild, solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical coupling transformations of CF3 group with nitro compounds into amides or Schiff bases employing Ytterbia as a catalyst. This process proceeds via C&#8722;F bond activation, accompanied with utilisation of Si&#8208;based reductants/oxygen scavengers &#8208; reductants of the nitro group. The scope and limitations of the disclosed methodologies are thoroughly studied. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first example of mechanical energy promoted transformation of the inert CF3 group into other functionalities.

         <title>Iodine Catalyzed C2&#8208;H Formamidation of Quinoline N&#8208;Oxides using Isocyanides: A Metal&#8208;Free Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A molecular iodine catalyzed regioselective insertion of isocyanide into C2&#8208;H of quinoline N&#8208;oxides has been developed. The reaction proceeds through the nucleophilic addition of isocyanide on quinoline N&#8208;oxides followed by rearrangement in presence of iodine. This metal&#8208;free reaction affords rapid access to quinoline 2&#8208;formamides with exceptional functional group tolerance, broad substrate scope and 100% atom&#8208;economy. A library of 33&#8197;N&#8208;(2&#8208;quinolinyl)formamides are synthesized, which may find applications in pharmaceuticals and synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Regioselective Deaminative Alkylation of Coumarins via Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
3&#8208;Alkylated coumarins have many applications in medicinal chemistry, however, methods access to such structures are still limited. Herein, we report a site&#8208;selective photocatalytic deaminative alkylation of coumarins utilizing pyridinium&#8208;activated aliphatic primary amines as alkylation reagents. The protocol was highlighted by its mild reaction conditions, operational simplicity, and broad functional group compatibility. Moreover, this strategy enables late&#8208;stage modification of some pharmaceuticals and natural products, thus providing an appealing approach to valuable molecules in medicinal chemistry.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3-Alkylated coumarins have many applications in medicinal chemistry, however, methods access to such structures are still limited. Herein, we report a site-selective photocatalytic deaminative alkylation of coumarins utilizing pyridinium-activated aliphatic primary amines as alkylation reagents. The protocol was highlighted by its mild reaction conditions, operational simplicity, and broad functional group compatibility. Moreover, this strategy enables late-stage modification of some pharmaceuticals and natural products, thus providing an appealing approach to valuable molecules in medicinal chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Copper Catalyzed Synthesis of 3&#8208;Nitro&#8208;Quinolines from Nitro&#8208;Olefins and Anthranils: Its Application in the Synthesis of Quindoline</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Copper&#8208;catalyzed routes have been achieved for the synthesis of 3&#8208;nitroquinolines from readily available nitroolefins and anthranils. This reaction proceeds via the [4+2] cycloaddition between anthranils and nitro&#8208;styrenes under mild reaction conditions to obtain biologically important heterocycles. A wide range of diversely substituted nitro&#8208;olefins and anthranils are successfully employed in this reaction to access a series of 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;quinolines in 81&#8211;93% yields. The synthetic utility of the present methodology is also illustrated in this manuscript.

         <title>Cobalt Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Selective Dioxygenation of Styrenes Using N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide with Molecular Oxygen</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed selective dioxygenation of styrenes with N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) was developed using molecular oxygen as the terminal oxidant. Alcohol and ketone products can be selectively formed from identical substrates by catalyst control. The reaction was applicable to a broad range of styrenes and exhibited good functional group tolerance. It provided a method for preparation of 1,2&#8208;diol or &#945;&#8208;hydroxyketone derivatives.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Alkylated Ketones via Dehydrogenative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Primary and Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we describe an isolable, air&#8208;stable, homogeneous, nickel catalyst that performs dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling reaction between secondary and primary alcohols to result &#945;&#8208;alkylated ketone products selectively. The sequence of steps involve in this one&#8208;pot reaction is dehydrogenation of both alcohols, condensation between the ketone and the aldehyde, and hydrogenation of the in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone. Preliminary mechanistic investigation hints a radical mechanism following borrowing hydrogen reaction.

Abstract
A strategy for the immobilization of chiral 2,3&#8208;bisaminocyclopropenium salt (pre&#8208;catalyst) onto polystyrene and silica supports is presented together with a suitable procedure for the conversion into the corresponding cyclopropenimine superbase catalysts. The activity and recyclability of polystyrene&#8208; and silica&#8208;supported cyclopropenimines were initially tested under batch conditions in a model Michael addition detecting comparable efficiencies but a superior stability of the latter heterogeneous catalyst (5 cycles, accumulated TON of 27.1). The preferred silica&#8208;supported cyclopropenimine behaved very similarly to the soluble counterpart in the reaction of glycine imine with different Michael acceptors (48&#8211;92% yield; 60&#8211;98% ee) and it could be utilized as packing material for the fabrication of fixed&#8208;bed mesoreactors (pressure&#8208;resistant stainless&#8208;steel columns). Continuous&#8208;flow experiments were performed with satisfactory long&#8208;term stability (24&#8197;h on stream) with unaltered conversion efficiency and enantioselectivity.

Abstract
A metal&#8208;free oxidative cyclization of readily available trifluoroacetimidohydrazides with D&#8208;glucose for the assembly of 3&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoles has been disclosed. D&#8208;glucose is applied as C1 synthon to provide methine source in the reaction. Control experiments have been conducted to shed light on the reaction mechanism. The synthetic utility of the protocol has been explored by the implementation of scale up reaction and the synthesis of the key skeleton of NKI&#8208;receptor ligand.

Abstract
We report a chemoselective, phosphine&#8208;catalyzed semireduction of primary and secondary propiolamides. In the presence of stoichiometric pinacolborane and catalytic n&#8208;tributylphosphine, a variety of propiolamides were successfully converted to the corresponding acrylamides in excellent yield with (E)&#8208;stereoselectivity. The reaction condition is tolerant of various functional groups including alkene, alkyne, ketone, or ester. Deuterium labeling studies established that the hydride from activated pinacolborane is added to the &#945;&#8208;carbon and the proton on the amide nitrogen is abstracted by the &#223;&#8208;carbon to furnish the (E)&#8208;acrylamides. DFT calculations revealed a clear energetic driving force for the (E)&#8208; over the (Z)&#8208;isomer.

Deuterium labeling studies established that the hydride from activated pinacolborane is added to the &#945;-carbon and the proton on the amide nitrogen is abstracted by the &#223;-carbon to furnish the (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-acrylamides. DFT calculations revealed a clear energetic driving force for the (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)- over the (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-isomer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Cross&#8208;coupling Reaction between Aliphatic Aldehydes and Sulfonium Salts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted electron&#8208;deficient alkenes is often accomplished via cross&#8208;coupling of diazo compounds in the presence of a metal catalyst. Herein, we report an organocatalytic protocol that enables the direct coupling of aliphatic aldehydes with sulfonium ylides. A key carbene mimetic, &#945;&#8208;iodoenamine/enol, is believed to engage in direct cross&#8208;coupling with a sulfonium ylide, delivering &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds with a formyl substituent. The reaction demonstrated remarkably mild conditions, convergence, and control of olefin geometry.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Sulfonyl Fluorides from Arylazo Sulfones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Sulfonyl fluorides are useful motifs for a wide range of applications in organic synthesis including sulfur (VI) fluoride exchange&#8208;based &#8220;click chemistry.&#8221; Herein, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthesis of sulfonyl fluorides from arylazo sulfones is described. In the present study, K2S2O5 and N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) were used as the sulfonyl source and fluorinating agent, respectively, for visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated fluorosulfonylation of arylazo sulfones to prepare various sulfonyl fluorides in 60&#8211;85% yield. This protocol is a synthetic approach to provide useful sulfonyl fluoride structures at room temperature.

         <title>Recyclable, Immobilized Transition&#8208;Metal Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of transition&#8208;metal complexes as photocatalysts have allowed the performance of diverse organic transformations in an outstanding manner, characterized not only by high yields, TOF, and selectivity values, but also by modulating and providing access to novel molecular structures that, without them, would be difficult if not impossible. However, one of the biggest concerns regarding the use of these photocatalysts relies on the difficulties associated with their isolation from reaction media and reutilization once the chemical process ends. The above, besides contaminating reaction products and requiring out tedious purification processes, prompts the inevitable loss of the catalyst, directly affecting its recyclability. In addition, this situation results in negative outcomes from an economic and environmental perspective, since transition&#8208;metal complexes are usually expensive materials, and their unsuccessful recovery could result in leakage into the environment.  

	These drawbacks served as inspiration for the elaboration of the present review focused on the development of novel strategies developed during the last decade for the successful recovery of these species.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The use of transition-metal complexes as photocatalysts have allowed the performance of diverse organic transformations in an outstanding manner, characterized not only by high yields, TOF, and selectivity values, but also by modulating and providing access to novel molecular structures that, without them, would be difficult if not impossible. However, one of the biggest concerns regarding the use of these photocatalysts relies on the difficulties associated with their isolation from reaction media and reutilization once the chemical process ends. The above, besides contaminating reaction products and requiring out tedious purification processes, prompts the inevitable loss of the catalyst, directly affecting its recyclability. In addition, this situation results in negative outcomes from an economic and environmental perspective, since transition-metal complexes are usually expensive materials, and their unsuccessful recovery could result in leakage into the environment.  

	These drawbacks served as inspiration for the elaboration of the present review focused on the development of novel strategies developed during the last decade for the successful recovery of these species. The strategies summarized herein, whether for homogeneous or heterogeneous systems, are based on the use of thermotropic solvents, changes in the hydrophilic balance of the catalyst, the employment of polymers, copolymers, porous macromolecular structures, and inorganic nanostructures as support of these entities. Moreover, the use of organized and confining media, such as micelles and gels in this context, is also discussed. We hope that this review will motivate the search for new strategies to develop novel catalytic systems, understanding that high performance is based not only on yields but also on recyclability, sustainability, and responsibility to the environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Propargylic glycols, 2&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;1&#8208;(indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols, react with thiols undergoing a complex but selective gold&#8208;catalyzed transformation that gives rise to &#945;&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl &#945;&#8208;((Z)&#8208;2&#8208;thioalkenyl) ketones. The sequence is triggered by the regioselective thiolation of indolyl diols followed by an attack of the sulfur instead of the indole over the activated alkyne. The final compounds are obtained in remarkably high yields and arise from simple starting materials such as indolyl acyloins, ethynyl magnesium bromide and thiols.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Alkynylation of C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Alkynylation reactions are one of the most sought&#8208;after synthetic methodologies due to the versatility of C&#8722;C triple bond diversifications. Sonogashira coupling was widely used for the synthesis of alkynylated molecules; however, this methodology requires the use of previously halogenated substrates, which is a major drawback. To overcome this issue, a complimentary method, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkynylation, was emerged as an alternative tool in the recent years. Though the initial reports required the use of either specific directing groups or strong alkynylating agents for effective functionalization, recent studies indicate that transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed site selective alkynylations can be carried out using mild and readily available alkynylating agents under moderate reaction conditions. In this review, we explain the transition metal cataluyzed site selective alkynylation both C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds by emphasizing to the reaction mechanism.

Abstract
A polyprenyl side chain could be introduced into the heterocyclic quinoline moiety through Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of the corresponding quinoline&#8208;N&#8208;oxide with a polyprenyl boronic acid. This tool could be utilized for the synthesis of the natural product Aurachin B from the myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca. This prenylated quinoline could then be transformed into the related Aurachin A through an epoxidation&#8208;ring opening cascade.

Abstract
A Ag(I)&#8208;catalyzed annulation of 1&#8208;aminobutadiynes with anilines was described. By tuning the steric and electronic properties of anilines, 2&#8208;aminoquinoline scaffold was constructed instead of the literature&#8208;reported 2&#8208;amidopyrroles. Notedly, the reactions of polyaromatic amines also proceed smoothly to afford nitrogen&#8208;containing polyaromatics.

Abstract
A phosphine&#8208;mediated reaction for the construction of spirocyclopenta[c]chromene&#8208;indolinones is reported via a Rauhut&#8208;Currier (RC)&#8208;type/acyl transfer/Wittig sequence. This methodology attributes the chemoselective phosphine addition to the alkynoate which generates the phosphorus zwitterion via RC&#8208;type reaction, and that further undergoes O&#8208;acylation to form the seven&#8208;membered betaine intermediate with acyl chloride in the presence of base. Extensive investigations reveal that the exceptional &#948;&#8208;acylation occurs through the C&#8722;O bond cleavage upon the seven&#8208;membered betaine, and the subsequent Wittig reaction preferentially result in the aforementioned spiro compounds. Furthermore, our protocol could also be applicable to different alkynoates to provide a series of spirocyclopenta[c]chromenones bearing privileged skeletons.

Abstract
The selective &#945;&#8208;deuteration of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitriles using the strong base tBuOK or a metal&#8208;ligand cooperative Ru pincer catalyst is described. With D2O as deuterium source and glyme as solvent at 70&#8201;&#176;C, tBuOK is an efficient catalyst for deuteration at the &#945;&#8208;C(sp2) position of cinnamonitriles, providing access to a broad range of deuterated derivatives in good to excellent yields and with very high levels of deuterium incorporation. While the tBuOK&#8208;catalysed protocol does not tolerate base&#8208;sensitive functional groups, cinnamonitrile derivatives containing a benzylic bromide or ester moiety were deuterated in excellent yields using Milstein's ruthenium PNN pincer catalyst. Moreover, the activity for H/D exchange of the metal&#8208;ligand cooperative Ru catalyst is found to be significantly higher than that of tBuOK, allowing reactions to proceed well even at room temperature. A mechanistic proposal is put forward that involves deprotonation of the cinnamonitrile &#945;&#8208;CH position when using tBuOK as catalyst, whereas H/D exchange catalysis with the Ru PNN pincer likely proceeds via (reversible) oxa&#8208;Michael addition of D2O.

         <title>A Tetraarylpyrrole&#8208;Based Phosphine Ligand for the Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Amination of Aryl Chlorides</title>

Abstract
A tetraarylpyrrole&#8208;based phosphine ligand L1 in combination with Pd(dba)2 provided a catalyst for the Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination reaction. A variety of amines were rapidly coupled with aryl chlorides at a Pd loading of 0.5&#8197;mol%. The selective monoarylation of aliphatic primary amines was achieved in the presence of 0.8&#8197;equiv. water. Comparison experiments were also conducted, which revealed that the catalytic activity of L1 is superior to representative phosphine ligands in the Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N coupling of various amines.

         <title>Base Metal&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;Methylation Reactions Using Methanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
C&#8208;methylation is a vitally important reaction applicable in chemical synthesis and structure&#8208;based drug design. Notably, the &#8220;magic methyl&#8221; effect has become decisive in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery for the modulation of bio&#8208;active properties in life science molecules. In this regard, C&#8208;methylation reaction is widely applied chemical modification in various biomolecules, pharmaceuticals, and natural products. In general, this reaction often relies on activated, hazardous and uneconomical methyl sources such as diazomethane, dimethyl sulfate, and methyl halides. To achieve methylation reactions in a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective manner, the use of &#8216;ideal&#8217; C1 source is crucial. In this regard, methanol constitutes an expedient &#8208;CH3 source because this simple alcohol is less&#8208;hazardous, inexpensive, and abundantly available platform chemical as well as it produces only water as the by&#8208;product in methylation processes. Regarding potential catalysts to perform C&#8208;methylation using methanol by hydrogen borrowing methodology, non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based catalysts are highly preferable due to their unique advantages such as more abundance, inexpensive and low&#8208;toxicity. In recent years, chemists made significant contributions towards catalytic valorization of methanol as C1 source to insert methyl groups via C&#8722;H activation in a variety of compounds and life science molecules. Consequently, in this minireview we summarize the C&#8208;methylation process using methanol by applying Fe&#8208;, Mn&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Ni&#8208;based catalysts as well as metal free catalysts.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Enzymatic Cascade Reactions for the Synthesis of cis,cis&#8208;Muconic Acid</title>

Abstract
Lignin valorization allows the generation of a number of value&#8208;added products such as cis,cis&#8208;muconic acid (ccMA), which is widely used for the synthesis of chemicals for the production of biodegradable plastic materials. In the present work, we reported the first multi&#8208;enzymatic, one&#8208;pot bioconversion process of vanillin into ccMA. In details, we used four sequential reactions catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, O&#8208;demethylase LigM (and the tetrahydrofolate&#8208;regeneration enzyme methyl transferase MetE), decarboxylase AroY (based on the use of E. coli transformed cells) and catechol 1,2&#8208;dioxygenase CatA. The optimized lab&#8208;scale procedure allowed to reach, for the first time, the conversion of 5&#8197;mM vanillin into ccMA in &#8764; 30&#8197;h with a 90% yield: this achievement represents an improvement in terms of yields and time when compared to the use of a whole&#8208;cell system. This multi&#8208;enzymatic system represents a sustainable alternative for the production of a high value added product from a renewable resource.

         <title>Investigating the Structure&#8208;Reactivity Relationships Between Nicotinamide Coenzyme Biomimetics and Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate Reductase</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Ene reductases (ERs) are attractive biocatalysts in terms of their high enantioselectivity and expanded substrate scope. Recent works have proved that synthetic nicotinamide coenzyme biomimetics (NCBs) can be used as easily accessible alternatives to natural cofactors in ER&#8208;catalyzed reactions. However, the structure&#8208;reactivity relationships between NCBs and ERs and influence factors are still poorly understood. In this study, a series of C&#8208;5 methyl modified NCBs were synthesized and tested in the PETNR&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reductions. The physicochemical properties of these NCBs including electrochemical properties, stability, and kinetic behavior were studied in detail. The results showed that hydrophobic interaction caused by the introduced methyl group contributed to the stabilization of binding conformation in enzyme active site, resulting in comparable catalytic activity with that of NADPH. Molecular dynamics and steered molecular dynamics simulations were further performed to explain the binding mechanism between PETNR and NCBs, which revealed that stable catalytic conformation, appropriate donor&#8208;acceptor distance and angle, as well as free dissociation energy are important factors affecting the activity of NCBs.

         <title>Z&#8208;Selective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Sulfanyl Carbonyl Compounds from Internal Alkynes and Thiols via Photoredox Catalysis</title>

Abstract
A synthetically useful Z&#8208;selective cascade formal thiyl radical addition, 1,3&#8208;double bond isomerization, oxygen trapping reaction, can be promoted by Eosin B under visible light, leading to the construction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208; and alkylthio enone derivatives in good yields. An accurate study on the reactivity of different thiols and the screening of the reaction conditions, allowed us to extend this reaction to a large number of substrates, showing a good functional groups tolerance while highlighting the limitations of this procedure.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A synthetically useful &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selective cascade formal thiyl radical addition, 1,3-double bond isomerization, oxygen trapping reaction, can be promoted by Eosin B under visible light, leading to the construction of 2-aryl- and alkylthio enone derivatives in good yields. An accurate study on the reactivity of different thiols and the screening of the reaction conditions, allowed us to extend this reaction to a large number of substrates, showing a good functional groups tolerance while highlighting the limitations of this procedure. Background experiments and mechanistic studies were also. performed to rationalize this cascade process. The usefulness of this methodology was finally demonstrated via the transformation of a series of &#945;-sulfanyl-enone adducts through selected oxidation reactions, stereoselective synthesis of cyclopropyl ketones, indanones, and pyrazole compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Selenaheterocycles via Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Radical Cyclization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An approach for the synthesis of selenaheterocycles starting from aryl diazonium salts was developed. Recently, the synthesis of selenaheterocycles has drawn a great deal of attention from the synthetic community because they can be employed as organic semiconductors in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). In this study, the one&#8208;pot process and subsequent visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated silver&#8208;catalyzed cyclization enabled the synthesis of selenaheterocycles in the absence of a photocatalyst. The reactions were carried out under mild conditions without the use of toxic or sensitive reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Activated Hoveyda&#8208;Grubbs Olefin Metathesis Catalysts Derived from a Large Scale Produced Pharmaceutical Intermediate &#8211; Sildenafil Aldehyde</title>

Abstract
Two EWG&#8208;activated Hoveyda&#8208;Grubbs&#8208;type ruthenium complexes (Sil&#8208;II and Sil&#8208;II&#8217;) were obtained, characterized, and screened in a set of olefin metathesis reactions. These catalysts were conveniently synthesized from a commercially available pharmaceutical building block &#8211; Sildenafil aldehyde &#8211; in two steps only. Stability and catalytic activity tests disclosed that the bulkier NHC&#8208;ligand bearing catalyst Sil&#8208;II&#8217; is visibly more stable and productive than its smaller NHC&#8208;analogue Sil&#8208;II. Good application profile of catalyst Sil&#8208;II&#8217; was confirmed in a set of diverse metathesis reactions including ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) and cross&#8208;metathesis (CM) of complex polyfunctional substrates of medicinal chemistry interest, including a challenging macrocyclization of the Pacritinib precursor. Compatibility of the new catalyst with various green solvents was checked and metathesis of Sildenafil and Tadalafil&#8208;based substrates was successfully conducted in acetone. The mechanism of Sil&#8208;II&#8217; initiation has been investigated through kinetic experiments unveiling that the decrease of the steric hindrance of the chelating alkoxy moiety (from iPrO to EtO) favors the interchange initiation pathway over the typical dissociation pathway for other popular 2nd generation Hoveyda&#8208;Grubbs catalysts.

         <title>Biochemical and Structural Characterization of an (R)&#8208;Selective Transaminase in the Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Hydroxy Amines</title>

Abstract
An (R)&#8208;selective transaminase RbTA with excellent stereoselectivity (&gt;99% ee) in the asymmetric amination of hydroxy ketones was identified. Biochemical characterization showed that RbTA exhibited the highest activity toward 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone among reported enzymes, and that it has broad substrate specificity, including for aliphatic, aromatic, and alicyclic ketones. Crystallization of RbTA were performed, as were molecular docking and mutagenesis studies. Residue Tyr125 plays a key role in substrate recognition by forming a hydrogen bond with hydroxy ketone. The applicability of the enzyme was determined in preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of (R)&#8208;3&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;butanol, demonstrating the potential of RbTA as a green biocatalyst for production of value&#8208;added chiral hydroxy amines. This study provides an efficient tool for enzymatic synthesis of chiral hydroxy amines, as well as structural insight into substrate recognition by transaminases in the asymmetric amination of hydroxy ketones.

Abstract
This paper reports the transition metal&#8208;free C(sp3)&#8722;H sulfenylation of arylacetamides by using thiophenols as the sulfenyl reagents. The reactions take place in the presence of only K3PO4. Control experiments indicate that the reactions proceed via a featured sulfur&#8208;centred free radical intermediate. In addition, the synthesis of 2&#8208;thiomethyl benzoxazoles has been realized via the p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (p&#8208;TSA) promoted annulation of the sulfenylated products.

Abstract
The iodine&#8208;promoted oxidative domino annulation and carbonylation process has been developed for the synthesis of biologically important azaarene&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;b:4&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;e]pyridines (BPPs), diuracilpyridines and o&#8208;amino diheteroaryl ketones. The domino procedure proceeded with easily available methyl azaarenes, 5&#8208;aminouracils and substituted 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles. This protocol is a simple and metal&#8208;free approach which exhibits high functional group compatibility and broad substrates scope. Moreover, this transformation can be applied for the preparation of dipyrazolo/diuracil&#8208;fused pyridines on a gram scale.

Abstract
A catalytic carbonylative approach to the multicomponent synthesis of benzothiophene derivatives from simple building blocks [1&#8208;(2&#8208;(methylthio)phenyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ols, carbon monoxide, and an alcohol)] is presented. It is based on an S&#8208;cyclization&#8208;demethylation&#8208;alkoxycarbonylation&#8208;reduction sequence promoted by the PdI2/KI catalytic system, occurring under relatively mild conditions (40&#8197;atm, 80&#8201;&#176;C, 15&#8197;h). Benzothiophene&#8208;2&#8208;acetic esters are obtained in moderate to good yields (35&#8211;70%) starting from variously substituted substrates in combination with different alcohols as external nucleophiles (17&#8197;examples).

         <title>Indene Derived Phosphorus&#8208;Thioether Ligands for the Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Olefins with Diverse Substitution Patterns and Different Functional Groups</title>

Abstract
A family of phosphite/phosphinite&#8208;thioether ligands have been tested in the Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of a range of olefins (50 substrates in total). The presented ligands are synthesized in three steps from cheap indene and they are air&#8208;stable solids. Their modular architecture has been crucial to maximize the catalytic performance for each type of substrate. Improving most Ir&#8208;catalysts reported so far, this ligand family presents a broader substrate scope, covering different substitution patterns with different functional groups, ranging from unfunctionalized olefins, through olefins with poorly coordinative groups, to olefins with coordinative functional groups. &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated acyclic and cyclic esters, ketones and amides were	hydrogenated in enantioselectivities ranging from 83 to 99% ee. Enantioselectivities ranging from 91 to 98% ee were also achieved for challenging substrates such as unfunctionalized 1,1&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted olefins, functionalized tri&#8208; and 1,1&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted vinyl phosphonates, and &#946;&#8208;cyclic enamides. The catalytic performance of the Ir&#8208;ligand assemblies was maintained when the environmentally benign 1,2&#8208;propylene carbonate was used as solvent.

Abstract
A protocol for the synthesis of terminal N&#8208;vinylazoles from aromatic aldehydes, DMSO, and azoles has been reported. In this strategy, DMSO was involved in the construction of the C=C bond as a terminal carbon synthon. Both aromatic aldehydes and azoles could be well tolerated and give the corresponding terminal N&#8208;vinylazoles in 52&#8211;91% yields. Based on preliminary experiments, a plausible mechanism is proposed.

Abstract
Non&#8208;activated allyl alcohols are utilized as allylating agent for thiocarbamate&#8208;directed allylation of pyrrole and indole. The synthetic methodology is accompanied by advantages like silver&#8208;free conditions and generates water as the by&#8208;product. A wide range of substituted pyrroles and indoles along with several structurally different allyl alcohols took part in the reaction. Among notable examples, biologically relevant prenylation, geranylation, and synthesis of 1,3&#8208;dienes are achieved. Selective mono allylation of pyrrole, gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and ready deprotection of directing group are the other key highlights of this method.

Abstract
A variety of chromeno[4,3&#8208;c]isoxazolidines were prepared in good yields through visible light promoted Chan&#8208;Lam reaction and [3+2] cycloaddition cascade reaction in one pot. Mechanistic studies showed that visible light promoted both Chan&#8208;Lam reaction and cycloaddition. The obtained products were converted to various useful chromenone derivatives. Moreover, the reaction was easily performed at gram scales with the purification of products without column chromatography and used to efficiently synthesize estrone&#8208;derived chromeno[4,3&#8208;c]isoxazolidine.

The inside cover picture, designed by Fabrice Goursaud, holder of a PhD in organic chemistry and recently graduated from art school, illustrates the stereoselective synthesis of tetrahydro[2,3&#8208;b]pyridine frameworks via one&#8208;pot metal&#8208;organo relay catalysis. The strategy, which involves a gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization and a chiral amine mediated cycloaddition reaction, provides the targeted molecules in yields ranging from 27 to 90% and high levels of stereoselectivity (de&gt;95%, 93&#8211;99% ee). Details can be found in the Communication by Manon Genet, Abdelilah Takfaoui, J&#233;r&#244;me Marrot, Christine Greck and Xavier Moreau. (M. Genet, A. Takfaoui, J. Marrot, C. Greck, X. Moreau, Adv.

The front cover picture, designed by J&#232;ssica Margalef, illustrates the usefulness of a modular and easy&#8208;to&#8208;assemble catalyst design for asymmetric hydrogenation. By choosing the appropriate sulfur and phosphorus substituents on new Ir&#8208;P,S&#8208;catalysts, it is possible to hydrogenate substrates of very different nature (50 olefins in total). Improving on most catalysts reported so far, di&#8208; and E/Z&#8208;trisubstituted olefins with a variety of functional groups and coordination ability can be reduced with excellent enantioselectivities.

Abstract
Indole&#8208;based heterocycles containing sulfur or nitrogen atoms are important frameworks that occur widely in biological active natural products and drugs. Consequently, several novel chemical transformations and new catalytic strategies have been developed for the preparation of these skeletons in a highly efficient and selective manner. This review focuses on recent advancements in the construction of indole&#8208;fused heterocyclic compounds by using iminoindolines, 3&#8208;diazoindol&#8208;2&#8208;imines, 2&#8208;thioxoindolines, and their derivatives as starting materials.

Abstract
Over the past few decades, organophosphorus catalysis has emerged as a robust platform for the preparation of highly functionalized molecules with excellent control of reactivity and selectivity. Organophosphorus catalysis has the advantages of mild and metal&#8208;free reaction conditions. The easy&#8208;to&#8208;tune electronic and steric properties of phosphorus provide an easy handle for developing efficient synthetic methodologies with high stereochemical fidelity. This review describes the efforts to introduce boron and silicon functionalities into organic substrates catalyzed by organophosphorus compounds. These catalysts are categorized into nucleophilic, electrophilic, and biphilic phosphorus catalysts. Phosphorus compounds efficiently catalyze hydroboration of various unsaturated systems, carbonyl compounds, imines, etc.; hydro&#8208;/cyano&#8208;silylation of carbonyls; and silylation of alcohols. The present review emphasizes the scope of nucleophilic, electrophilic, and biphilic phosphorus&#8208;based catalysis to introduce boron and silicon functionalities into organic compounds, mainly from the recent decade.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed/TsOH&#8208;promoted one&#8208;pot tandem annulation of 1,6&#8208;allenynes with organic azides was reported, providing N&#8208;allyl 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;fused structures in moderate to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. Moreover, the late&#8208;stage diversification of the N&#8208;allyl products can be realized by chemoselectively reducing to the N&#8208;alkyl counterparts.

&lt;p&gt;A copper-catalyzed/TsOH-promoted one-pot tandem annulation of 1,6-allenynes with organic azides was reported, providing &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-allyl 1,2,3-triazole-fused structures in moderate to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. Moreover, the late-stage diversification of the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-allyl products can be realized by chemoselectively reducing to the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed tandem intermolecular ylide formation/intramolecular cycloaddition of diazo compounds and aldehyde&#8208;tethered&#8208;cyclohexadienones was reported, chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectively providing oxapolycyclic frameworks in moderate to excellent yields under mild conditions. This reaction creates two C&#8722;C bonds and one C&#8722;O bond with five stereocentres including two all&#8208;carbon quaternary centres. Moreover, the late&#8208;stage diversification of products can be realized via chemoselective substitutions.

Abstract
A two&#8208;step transition metal&#8208;free methodology for the C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) functionalisation of saturated N&#8208;heterocyclic systems is disclosed. First, aminal derivatives are generated through the anodic oxidation of readily accessible carboxylic acids. Then, in the presence of BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2, iminium ions are unmasked and rapidly alkylated by organozinc reagents under flow conditions. Secondary, tertiary and quaternary carbon centers have been successfully assembled using this methodology. Such an approach is especially relevant to drug discovery since it increases C(sp3)&#8208;functionalities rapidly within a molecular framework. As proof of concept, our methodology was applied to derivatization of peptides and an API.

         <title>Radical Promoted Synthesis of Furoquinolines via Anomalous Dakin&#8208;Type Reaction</title>

Abstract
A radical promoted approach for the selective synthesis of furo[3,2&#8208;b]quinolines and benzylidene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydrofuro[3,4&#8208;b]quinolines have been achieved from 2&#8208;alkynyl quinoline&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehydes by fine&#8208;tuning of base and oxidant in good yields. In the presence of an oxidant, the reaction afforded the 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclized furoquinolines by decarbonylative intramolecular cyclization via a Dakin&#8208;type reaction; however, in the absence of oxidant, 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclized products were obtained selectively through reductive intramolecular cyclization. The formation of furoquinolines was further supported by X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies. The proposed mechanism was well supported by the control experiments.

Abstract
Both enantiomers of cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclohexane have been obtained enantioselectively through engineered amidase&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of meso carbocyclic 1,2&#8208;dicarboxamides under mild condition. Based on the enzyme&#8208;substrate binding model suggested by molecular docking, the amplification and reversal of enantioselectivity of amidase was quickly achieved through generating and testing only 8 variants. The origin of enantiopreference for amidase was revealed by MD simulations and the reason for the reversal of enantioselectivity towards amidase variant was disclosed. The synthetic application of biocatalytic meso&#8208;desymmetrization was demonstrated by straightforward transformation of the products to enantiomerically pure heterocyclic compounds.

Abstract
The first enantioselective vinylogous Mannich reaction of acyclic vinylketene silyl acetals with acyclic ketimines derived from alkynyl ketoesters was developed. Excellent yields and enantioselectivities were obtained from the reaction using bis(imidazoline)&#8208;Zn(II) catalyst. Based on experiments and MO calculation, a plausible transition state was proposed to explain the stereoselectivity of the reaction. The obtained products were converted into various amines and a lactam. This process provides an efficient route for the synthesis of acyclic &#948;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and their derivatives.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed (Pd(PPh3)4/Ag2O/PivOH) C2&#8208;regioselective direct dehydrogenative alkynylation of unsubstituted selenophene was achieved. The selenophenes substituted with R1 groups at 2&#8208;position can be C5&#8208;alkynylated with a variety of 4&#8208;substituted phenylacetylenes (R2 groups). The R1 and R2 can be either electron&#8208;withdrawing or electron&#8208;donating groups, demonstrating a wide range of substrate scope with various functional group tolerance. The mono/C2&#8208;alkynylated selenophenes can subsequently undergo the second direct alkynylation at C5&#8208;position to afford symmetrical or unsymmetrical donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor 2,5&#8208;dialkynylated selenophenes.

Abstract
A series of enantioenriched 4,5,6,7&#8208;tetrahydrofuro[2,3&#8208;b]pyridines were accessed by a cycloisomerization/cycloaddition strategy. Starting from ynamide derivatives and aldehydes, yields ranging from 27 to 90% and high levels of stereoselectivity (de&gt;95%, 93&#8211;99% ee) were obtained through sequential relay catalysis. The concurrent use of a gold complex with a diphenylprolinol silyl ether was applied to a combination of diversely functionalized substrates.

         <title>Allenamides Playing Domino: A Redox&#8208;Neutral Photocatalytic Synthesis of Functionalized 2&#8208;Aminofurans</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photoredox catalytic synthesis of functionalized 2&#8208;aminofurans is proposed starting from &#945;&#8208;halo carbonyl substrates and N&#8208;allenamides. The protocol proves to be efficient and sustainable thanks to: i) the use of visible light as green energy source, ii) the redox&#8208;neutral nature of the transformation, allowing to avoid additives and strong oxidants, iii) the mild reaction conditions and the functional groups tolerance, iv) the low photocatalyst loading and the absence of excess reagents, v) the one&#8208;pot formation of three new bonds in a domino sequence. According to our mechanistic hypothesis, the transformation is configured as a double radical&#8208;polar crossover reaction, in which the photocatalyst is excited, oxidized and reduced twice for each molecule of 2&#8208;aminofuran produced. The novelty of the designed synthetic approach also lies in the use of N&#8208;allenamides as substrates, which, after the addition of the first electrophilic radical, preserve a further reactive &#960;&#8208;system, making possible the addition of a second &#945;&#8208;keto radical and enabling the installation of a keto functionality at a remote position. The good yields, the broad scope, and the possibility to further synthetically elaborate the obtained furans make this protocol particularly promising for the construction of useful products.</dc:description>

Abstract
A catalytic Lewis acid regulated reaction between quinone imine ketals (QIKs) and 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds provides a divergent and tunable approach to a variety of skeletons, including a series of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds, indoles, and benzofurans. The use of lithium chloride and ferrous bromide gives C3&#8208; or C2&#8208;alkylation products of the QIKs. The combination of ferrous bromide and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid delivers indole derivatives. Sequential hydrolysis and C3&#8208;alkylation occur in the presence of ytterbium (III) trifluoromethanesulfonate and stoichiometric amounts of water. When the reaction is performed with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and stoichiometric amounts of water, benzofuran is obtained. This protocol utilizes mild conditions, exhibits regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity, and has broad functional group tolerance.

         <title>Z&#8208;Selective Fluoroalkenylation of (Hetero)Aromatic Systems by Iodonium reagents in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Directed C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct and catalytic incorporation of fluorine containing molecular motifs into organic compounds resulting high&#8208;value added chemicals represents a rapidly evolving part of synthetic methodologies, thus this area is in the focus of pharmaceutical and agrochemical research. Herein we report a stereoselective procedure for direct fluorovinylation of aromatic and heteroaromatic scaffolds. This methodology development has been realized by palladium&#8208;catalyzed ortho C&#8208;H activation reaction of aniline derivatives featuring the regioselectivity via directing groups such as secondary of tertiary amides, ureas or ketones. The application of non&#8208;symmetrical aryl(fluoroalkenyl)&#8208;iodonium salts as fluoroalkenylating agents allowed mild reaction conditions in general for this transformation. The scope and limitations have been thoroughly investigated and the feasibility has been demonstrated by more than 50 examples.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Domino Cyclization/Phosphorylation of gem&#8208;Dibromoolefins with P(O)H Compounds: Synthesis of Phosphorylated Heteroaromatics</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We presented a palladium&#8208;catalyzed domino cyclization/phosphorylation of gem&#8208;dibromoolefins, which utilize H&#8208;phosphinates and secondary phosphine oxides as the phosphine sources, respectively. A vareity of phosphorylated heteroaromatics were obtained in moderate to good yields with wide functional group compatibility. This one&#8208;pot reaction enables multiple bond&#8208;forming events including C&#8211;X (X = O, N, S) and C&#8211;P bonds using easily available starting materials. Moreover, this protocol can be easily applied to large&#8208;scale preparation and late&#8208;stage functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Enzyme Cascade Catalyzed Asymmetrization of Primary Alcohols: Synthesis of Enantiocomplementary Chiral &#946;&#8208;Nitroalcohols</title>

Abstract
Biocatalytic asymmetrization of inexpensive and stable primary alcohols to prepare enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols is an important development in green chemistry for the production of chiral pharmaceutical intermediates. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step cascade reaction sequence in which first benzylic alcohols were oxidized to produce corresponding benzaldehydes using horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH). The in&#8197;situ generated aldehydes were then reacted in a biphasic medium with nitromethane by Arabidopsis thaliana hydroxynitrile lyase (AtHNL) or Baliospermum montanum HNL (BmHNL) catalyzed Henry reaction to produce stereoselective &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols with (R) or (S) configuration, respectively. Using HLADH&#8208;AtHNL, (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols were obtained in up to 64% conversion, and HLADH&#8208;BmHNL, (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols in up to 70% conversion, while in both cases excellent stereoselectivity (up to &gt;99% ee) was achieved. The concept was proven by functionalization of sp3 C&#8722;H bond of ten simple achiral benzylic alcohols to enantiocomplementary chiral &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols.

         <dc:description>This report discloses an electrochemical oxidative C&#8208;H/N&#8208;H cross coupling method for the synthesis of C&#8208;2/C&#8208;3 azolated halo&#8208;indoles/thiophenes under metal catalyst&#8208;free and external chemical oxidant free condition. Hydrogen gas was the only byproduct of this C&#8208;H/N&#8208;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The remarkable synthetic utility of this electrochemical approach is highlighted by its easy scalabity and compatibility with highly functional indoles and azoles. The retention of halogen on the heterocycles could serve as a useful handle for future late&#8208;stage modifications.</dc:description>

Abstract
A three&#8208;component thioamination reaction has been developed in the presence of phenyliodonium(III) diacetate (PIDA) leading to the formation of a thioaminated products. This catalytic approach represents a method for the metal&#8208;free thioamination of 1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone. It was observed that maleimides also work smoothly under this metal&#8208;free reaction condition. This present method implies the oxidative coupling reaction through a one&#8208;step process with the generation of C&#8722;N and C&#8722;S bonds. Various aromatic and aliphatic thiols and amines provided the corresponding thioaminated compounds in 62&#8211;88% yields. A plausible reaction pathway has been predicted according to few control experiments.

         <dc:description>








Abstract
Due to the versatile reactivity and molecular complexity, as well as diversity, electron&#8208;rich alkenes bearing nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atoms have been regarded as versatile reagents in organic synthesis. This review mainly focuses on the recent advances in the reaction development of electron&#8208;rich alkenes since 2000, including mono&#8208;/difunctionalization reactions, cyclization reactions, and cross&#8208;metathesis reactions. Numerous protocols enabling facile and efficient transformations of electron&#8208;rich alkenes to valuable compounds have been developed, which are discussed with special emphasis placed on the mechanistic aspects and the synthetic utilities. We hope that this review will help inspire future studies and promote developments in this area.

         <title>Overview of Regioselective and Stereoselective Catalytic Hydroboration of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Hydroboration of alkynes is of special interest to researchers since it is the most straightforward process for the synthesis of highly important vinylborane synthetic intermediate compounds. It is significant in terms of both regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, since several positional isomers are formed during the process of hydroboration. Given the importance of this class of compounds, an extensive study has been carried out regarding catalytic condition development and detailed mechanistic studies for selectively obtaining a single isomer. This review comprehensively summarizes both the regioselective and stereoselective catalytic hydroboration of alkynes. It is aimed at giving readers accurate knowledge of the catalytic systems available for the hydroboration of certain alkynes. We anticipate that this inclusive review will encourage researchers to explore more new types of catalytic systems to achieve the remarkable process of hydroboration of alkynes.

         <title>Application of Mutualism in Organic Synthetic Chemistry: Mutually Promoted C&#8722;H Functionalization of Indole and Reduction of Quinoline</title>

Abstract
Here we reported a one&#8208;pot, metal&#8208;free B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed strategy for simultaneous synthesis of C3&#8208;regioselective functionalization of indoles and complete reduction of quinolines. It turned out that by sharing a quinolinium hydridoborate intermediate, the original determining steps with high energy barrier in both the convergent disproportionation of indole and reduction of quinoline could be realized at room temperature, thus furnishing both the C3&#8208;borylated (or silylated) indoles and N&#8208;borylated tetrahydroquinolines in up to 98% yields at room temperature. Mechanistic studies suggested that both reactions would consume a product generated from the other reaction such that they can mutually promote each other, thus producing desirable products in a high atom&#8208;economy and low energy&#8208;cost manner. This strategy opened the gate to introducing mutualism to the field of chemistry.

         <title>Isocyanide&#8208;Induced Esterification of Sulfinic Acids to Access Sulfinates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The isocyanide&#8208;induced esterification of sulfinic acids with alcohols or thiophenols access to sulfinates has been developed. Various primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols could be compatible with the established protocols. Notably, such an isocyanide&#8208;induced synthetic strategy presented the advantages of simple operation, good functional group tolerance, and more than 40 examples up to 99% yields.

Abstract
Here we report a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed and atom&#8208;economical ortho&#8208;N&#8208;indolyl&#8208;N&#8208;pyrazolylbenzene synthesis from 1,2,3&#8208;triazapentalenes and ynamides. The reaction occurs through the cleavage of the triazole ring and formation of a &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene intermediate. An aza&#8208;Nazarov&#8208;type cyclization with participation of an arene ring is involved. The reaction consists in a formal [4+1] heterocycloaddition where the four&#8208;carbon synthon is provided by the ynamide. Finally, indole synthesis could also be performed in a one&#8208;pot procedure from their 1&#8208;propargyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzotrizaole precursors.

         <title>Bu4NHSO4&#8208;Catalyzed Direct N&#8208;Allylation of Pyrazole and its Derivatives with Allylic Alcohols in Water: A Metal&#8208;Free, Recyclable and Sustainable System</title>

Abstract
Allylic amines are valuable and functional building blocks. Direct N&#8208;allylation of pyrazole and its derivatives as an atom economic strategy to provide allylic amines has been achieved only using commercial Bu4NHSO4 as the metal&#8208;free catalyst and water as the solvent without any additives. 11&#8211;93% isolated yields were obtained for the N&#8208;allylation of pyrazole and its derivatives with allylic alcohols. Bu4NHSO4 could be reused for six times by simple extraction nearly without loss of catalytic activity and was also suitable for a gram&#8208;scale production. The reaction of allylic ether and pyrazole did not occur to give the desired product indicated that allylic ether was not the active intermediate in the pathway. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that there are hydrogen bonding effects among substrates, solvent and catalyst, especially the one formed between allylic alcohol and H2O. Control experiments in different protic solvents further demonstrate the intermolecular hydrogen bonding of allylic alcohol and water.

Abstract
The rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed aryl borrowing amination of various diaryl methanols with sulfonamides have been developed. The amination of alcohols via C&#8722;C bond activation is less developed and remains a challenge. These aryl borrowing reactions feature mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance, and compatibility with a wide range of alcohols, overall comprising an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic procedure. Mechanistic studies indicate that a rhodacycle complex exist during the aryl borrowing amination reaction.

         <title>Tailoring the Reactivity of the Langlois Reagent and Styrenes With Cyanoarenes Organophotocatalysts under Visible&#8208;Light.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective one&#8208;step access to fluoroalkylated hexestrol derivatives, nonsteroidal estrogens, is achieved in good to excellent isolated yields under organophotoredox conditions by using the stable and easy to handle Langlois reagent. Furthermore, the challenging selective hydrotrifluoromethylation of styrenes proceeds under mild reaction conditions without the requirement for any additive. We assume that the solvent drives the reaction pathway towards either the reduction or the dimerization of the radical intermediate generated after initial addition of the fluoroalkyl radical to the styrene. The versatility of the developed system is also extended to encompass radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling as exemplified here using cyanopyridine. Mechanistic investigations including luminescence and EPR spectroscopy allow to shed the light on the different mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>ortho&#8208;Allylation of 2&#8208;Arylindazoles with Vinyl Cyclic Carbonate and Diallyl Carbonate via Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>

Abstract
A manganese&#8208;catalyzed directed C&#8722;H allylation of 2&#8208;arylindazole has been developed. Both vinyl cyclic carbonate and diallyl carbonate are effectively used for ortho&#8208;allylation via decarboxylation. The mechanism was investigated and possibly Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation is not involved in the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Synthesis of Poly&#8208;Functionalized Indolizines via [5+1] Annulative Access to Pyridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Multi&#8208;functionalization of the pyridine motif of indolizine was achieved through [5+1] annulative construction of pyridine from 2&#8208;hydroxyacetophenone and pyrrole derivative in the presence of Cs2CO3. The reaction is proposed to take place via domino aldol&#8208;oxa Michael&#8208;Michael&#8208;elimination&#8208;oxidation procedure, leading to installation of three different functional groups at the C5, C6, and C7 positions of indolizines. Solvent (2&#8208;MeTHF) and the hydroxyl of 2&#8208;hydroxyacetophenones seemed to play crucial roles for this successful cyclization event. Further elaboration of the resulting scaffold and expansion of this protocol using other methyl ketones were demonstrated as well.

         <title>Thiofunctionalization of Electron&#8208;Rich Heteroarenes through Magnesiation and Trapping with Octasulfur</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein we report a site&#8208;selective and thiol&#8208;free thiofunctionalization of electron&#8208;rich heteroarenes. After a selective ortho&#8208;magnesiation, the use of S8 followed by an electrophile allows direct access to S&#8208;alkyl or &#8208;aryl derivatives. In situ oxidation provides the corresponding sulfoxide and sulfone derivatives. Applying this protocol, Cerlapirdine was prepared in 4 steps with 28% overall yield.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Fused Indolin&#8208;3&#8208;Ones via a [3+3] Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A formal [3+3] cycloaddition reaction of azaoxyallyl cations and isatogens generated in&#8197;situ from &#945;&#8208;halo hydroxamates and o&#8208;nitroalkynes, respectively, was developed. The cycloisomerization of the o&#8208;nitroalkynes, followed by base&#8208;mediated elimination of hydrogen halide and 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of the azaoxyallyl cations with the isatogen intermediates, were hallmarks of this one&#8208;pot tandem reaction. A series of tricyclic fused indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones were obtained under very mild reaction conditions with high atom economy, and the reaction exhibited excellent functional group tolerance. In addition, the reaction was highly scalable to multigram quantities. The obtained indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones exhibited robust DNA staining patterns in agarose gel electrophoresis. Coupled with the fluorescence properties of the products, these results highlight the potential utility of tricyclic fused indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones in various fluorescence and cell&#8208;staining applications.

Abstract
Aryl enol acetates and DMF could promote radical difluoroalkylation of aryl enol acetates to generate &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;ketoacetates without a catalyst, an oxidant, or a base. When using different bases, &#946;&#8208;fluoroenones and &#946;&#8208;enaminones were synthesized by controllable C&#8722;F bond activation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aryl enol acetates and DMF could promote radical difluoroalkylation of aryl enol acetates to generate &#945;,&#945;-difluoro-&#947;-ketoacetates without a catalyst, an oxidant, or a base. When using different bases, &#946;-fluoroenones and &#946;-enaminones were synthesized by controllable C&#8722;F bond activation. These transformations provide an alternative method for the cascade difluoroalkylation and C&#8722;F bonds activation of aryl enol acetates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
A metal&#8208;free multi&#8208;component sulfur dioxide insertion reaction of alkynes, sodium metabisulfite, aryldiazonium, and quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;ones has been developed under visible&#8208;light&#8194;photoredox&#8208;catalysis. This photocatalytic tandem reaction would be conducted at room temperature by using of Rhodamine 6G as organic photocatalyst and sodium metabisulfite as the SO2 surrogate. This protocol provides a synthetic strategy for the construction of various quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;one&#8208;containing vinyl sulfones with favourable functional group tolerance, in which one C&#8722;C bond and two C&#8722;S bonds were constructed in one pot procedure.

         <title>Access to Unsymmetrically Substituted Diaryl Gold N&#8208;Acyclic Carbene (NAC) and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) Complexes via the Isonitrile Route</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A variety of unsymmetric diaryl gold N&#8208;acyclic carbene (NAC) complexes was synthesized via the isonItrile route by three different methods: (a) solvent free in a melt, (b) mechanochemically and (c) in THF at room temperature. The latter method can also be used to synthesize unsaturated gold NHC complexes.
These methods overall offer access to a broad array of new complexes and remove one of the previous limitations of the
isonitrile route to NAC and NHC complexes of gold, namely the inability to react with the less nucleophilic aromatic amines. The new complexes also proved to be successful as pre&#8208;catalysts in the gold&#8208;catalyzed phenol synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Enantioenriched Amines by Iron&#8208;Catalysed Amination of Alcohols Employing at Least One Achiral Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture, designed by Anastasiia Afanasenko, illustrates the methodology for the synthesis of enantioenriched amines by the direct Fe&#8208;catalysed coupling of amines with alcohols through the borrowing hydrogen strategy, while at least one of these substrates is achiral. As in the well&#8208;known &#8220;The Tortoise and the Hare&#8221; fable by Aesop, tortoise &#8208; stands for chiral amine &#8211; won the race retaining the stereochemical integrity in the final product, whereas beta&#8208;branched enantioenriched primary alcohol &#8211; depicts by the hare &#8211; lost the competition due to its racemization that led to the partial loss of the chirality in the target amine. Details can be found in the Research Article by Katalin Barta and collaborators (G. Bottari, A. Afanasenko, A. A. Castillo&#8208;Garcia, B. L. Feringa, K. Barta, Adv. Synth.

         <dc:description>









Abstract
The synthesis of complex C&#8208;glycoconjugates is presented here using a key directed nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkynylation step. Thanks to a bidentate amidoquinoline&#8208;type directing group, the insertion of diverse alkynyl moieties onto the pseudo&#8208;anomeric position of glycal substrates was performed on ten examples in moderate to good yields. These platforms were used as starting substrates in a click reaction with complex azides to form original C&#8208;glycoconjugates. By this route, a C&#8208;glycosylated amino acid, a C&#8208;linked disaccharide and a C&#8208;glycosylated biotin derivative were synthesized. Preliminary conditions to remove the directing group are also proposed.

Abstract
An organocatalytic 1,6&#8208;addition using 4&#8208;(alk&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;3&#8208;cyanocoumarins as acceptors has been developed. Dienolates derived from 5&#8208;substituted&#8208;furan&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;ones have been employed as pronucleophiles, therefore, enabling the synthesis of hybrid molecules bearing two biologically relevant units. Appropriate design of substrates and the application of quinine&#8208;derived catalyst resulted in very good site&#8208;selectivity as well as chemical and stereochemical efficiency of the process.

This study has developed a method to prepare diastereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective indoline&#8208;fused 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine scaffolds. The synthetic process involved an Ugi four&#8208;component reaction in which readily available starting materials were used and a metal&#8208;free intramolecular post&#8208;Ugi tandem consecutive 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig/6&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization under basic conditions. The plausible mechanism and substrate structures were elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and supported by density functional theory calculations.

Abstract
Substrate&#8208;controlled cascade reactions between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes or their analogues and 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzyl chloride in the presence of a chiral secondary amine as the catalyst and base were developed, to obtain a broad spectrum of &#945;&#8208;benzylated enals and enantioenriched cyclopropane&#8208;fused chroman&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives. The cyclopropane&#8208;tethered iminium ion clearly served as a key intermediate in these reactions to trigger stereochemical outcomes, one of which was supported by a control experiment.

         <title>Oxoammonium Salt&#8208;Mediated Vicinal Oxyazidation of Alkenes with NaN3: Access to &#946;&#8208;Aminooxy Azides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An approach to the vicinal oxyazidation of alkenes has been achieved under mild and transition metal&#8208;free conditions. This method utilizes NaN3 as the azidation agent and 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxoammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEMPO+BF4&#8722;) as the single&#8208;electron oxidant as well as the oxygen source. By using this protocol, various &#946;&#8208;aminooxy azides were synthesized and several complex bioactive molecules were functionalized.

         <title>Organocatalytic Synthesis of Substituted Vinylene Carbonates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The organocatalytic synthesis of substituted vinylene carbonates from benzoins and acyloins was studied using diphenyl carbonate as a carbonyl source. A range of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) precursors were screened and it was found that imidazolium salts were the most active for this transformation. The reaction occurs at 90&#8201;&#176;C under solvent&#8208;free conditions. A wide range of substituted vinylene carbonates (symmetrical and unsymmetrical, aromatic or aliphatic), including some derived from natural products, were prepared with 20&#8211;99% isolated yields (24 examples). The reaction was also developed using thermomorphic polyethylene&#8208;supported organocatalysts as recoverable and recyclable species. The use of such species facilitates the workup and allows the synthesis of vinylene carbonates on the preparative scale (&gt;30&#8197;g after 5 runs).

Abstract
Radical cascade cyclization of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazones/oximes has recently emerged as an efficient and powerful protocol for the construction of diverse and valuable functionalized pyrazolines and isoxazolines. In this review, three catalytic ways of radical cascade cyclization of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazones/oximes are summarized and classified; these are transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed systems, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free systems, and photo&#8208;/electrocatalytic systems, respectively. Through these methods, various functional groups are installed on the pyrazoline and isoxazoline skeletons to enrich the small organic molecule library.

         <title>Umpolung Strategy for Arene C&#8722;H Etherification Leading to Functionalized Chromanes Enabled by I(III) N&#8208;Ligated Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>

Abstract
The direct formation of aryl C&#8722;O bonds via the intramolecular dehydrogenative coupling of a C&#8722;H bond and a pendant alcohol represents a powerful synthetic transformation. Herein, we report a method for intramolecular arene C&#8722;H etherification via an umpoled alcohol cyclization mediated by an I(III) N&#8208;HVI reagent. This approach provides access to functionalized chromane scaffolds from primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols via a cascade cyclization&#8208;iodonium salt formation, the latter providing a versatile functional handle for downstream derivatization. Computational studies support initial formation of an umpoled O&#8208;intermediate via I(III) ligand exchange, followed by competitive direct and spirocyclization/1,2&#8208;shift pathways.

         <title>Divergent Access to Benzocycles through Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylative Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed chemodivergent approach to five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered benzocycles from dienyl arenes tethered with a ketone has been developed. Through proper choice of coordinating ligands and catalytic conditions, copper&#8208;catalyzed borylative cyclization of a single dienyl arene can be diverted to two different pathways, leading to indanols and dihydronaphthalenols with high stereoselectivity. The chiral bidentate bisphosphine ligand (S,S)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE was optimal for asymmetric copper&#8208;allyl addition to a tethered ketone via a boat&#8208;like transition state, whereas NHC ligands led to boro&#8208;allyl addition producing indanols with high diastereoselectivity.

Abstract
Tunable C&#8722;H activation cascade reactions between quinazolinones and cyclopropenones have been developed. Notably, cyclopropenones, acting as multi&#8208;functional building blocks, could be assembled to construct up to 10&#8197;distinct heterocyclic scaffolds in a one&#8208;pot manner.

         <title>Domino Ring&#8208;Opening of N&#8208;Tosyl Vinylaziridines Triggered by Aryne Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>

Abstract
The reactivity of N&#8208;tosyl vinylaziridines toward arynes has been demonstrated under mild and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions to yield 2&#8208;(phenanthren&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;sulfamides in moderate to good yields. The selective synthesis of N&#8208;H and N&#8208;aryl products was accomplished using CsF in MeCN and KF/18&#8208;C&#8208;6 in 1,4&#8208;dioxane, respectively. This cascade process involves a sequential Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, ring&#8208;opening aromatization, ene&#8208;reaction, and selective N&#8208;arylation reaction.

         <title>Indium Catalyzed Sequential Regioselective Remote C&#8722;H Indolylation and Rearrangement Reaction of Peroxyoxindole</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Indium&#8208;catalyzed sequential remote C&#8722;H functionalization (C&#8208;6 position) and C3&#8208;indolylation of peroxyoxindole using indole is described for the synthesis of terindolinone derivatives. Whereas, N&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;phenyl peroxyoxindole derivatives undergoes consecutive skeletal rearrangement to generate transient carbocation, which has been trapped with indole nucleophile to generate 2&#8208;(1H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazin&#8208;3(4H)&#8208;one derivatives. In contrast with Indium (III) Chloride, FeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O facilitates oxidative cleavage of the peroxyoxindole (Hock cleavage) and further reaction with indole to afford biologically important trisindoline derivatives. A plausible mechanism has been proposed for these reactions with experimental evidences.

Abstract
A synthesis of spiroindolinone&#8208;isoindolinone skeletons is presented. The protocol is through a Ugi four&#8208;component reaction followed by highly efficient and mild copper&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular tandem C&#8722;N/C&#8722;C coupling process. Control experiments demonstrated that the formation of C&#8722;C bond is a copper catalyzed coupling process rather than base promoted nucleophilic aromatic substitution pathway which proposed in Prof. Van der Eycken's palladium catalyst system previously.

Abstract
2&#8208;Imino&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;selenadiazole derivatives can be synthesized from hydrazides and isoselenocyanates by sequential oxidation and a tributylphosphine (PBu3)&#8208;promoted annulation reaction at room temperature. In this synthetic process, crude less stable N&#8208;aroyldiazene intermediates generated by I2&#8208;mediated oxidation of hydrazides were used directly in a subsequent annulation reaction to afford the selenadiazole products. The merits of the present synthetic strategy also include absence of transition metals and gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

Abstract
The construction of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides has gradually become a hotspot of carbohydrate chemistry in recent years. In this work, we present an efficient, regioselective, stereoselective and widely applicable strategy for the synthesis of 2&#8208;indolyl&#8208;C&#8208;deoxyglycosides via Ir(I)&#8208;catalyzed, pyridine&#8208;group&#8208;directed C&#8722;H functionalization.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The construction of 2-deoxy-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-glycosides has gradually become a hotspot of carbohydrate chemistry in recent years. In this work, we present an efficient, regioselective, stereoselective and widely applicable strategy for the synthesis of 2-indolyl-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-deoxyglycosides &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; Ir(I)-catalyzed, pyridine-group-directed C&#8722;H functionalization. This method exhibits high tolerance for the functional groups of indoles and the protecting groups of carbohydrates. Moreover, this protocol has good stereoselectivity and mainly produces &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-configuration products. Gram-scale synthesis and several practical transformations were conducted for further applications. Meantime, we also explored the mechanism of this method and proposed a catalytic cycle&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
