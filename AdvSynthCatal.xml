      <title>Stereoselective Construction of (E,Z)&#8208;1,3&#8208;Dienes and Its Application in Natural Product Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>The E,Z&#8208;configured 1,3&#8208;diene unit is a common motif in numerous bioactive natural products. Although several powerful methods are available to produce these motifs with high levels of selectivity, their construction within a complex, polyfunctionalised structure, such as a natural product, requires well&#8208;defined strategies to avoid undesirable reactions and low&#8208;to&#8208;moderate selectivities. The aim of this review is to provide a full account of the stereoselective strategies for building E,Z&#8208;configured 1,3&#8208;dienes, as well as to highlight selected total syntheses that employ them.</dc:description>

      <title>Radical&#8208;Mediated Non&#8208;Dearomative Strategies in Construction of Spiro Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>In recent years, spirocyclic compounds have attracted a significant interest in medicinal chemistry due to their considerable biological activities. The general and widely used concept for spirocyclic compound synthesis is related with dearomatization of starting material. However, most of the libraries prepared using this concept comprise structure similarity. Therefore, preparation of structurally distinct libraries comprising varied functionality requires different approaches and that includes non&#8208;dearomative pathways. In given review recent advance in the synthesis of structurally varied spirocycles via radical&#8208;mediated non&#8208;dearomative strategies is discussed. In this context, application of radical initiators or photoredox catalysis is described. The variety of the presented examples indicates the high potential of the visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced methodologies in spirocyclic compound synthesis, which can act as a very efficient green alternative to known procedures, offering mild reaction conditions and high functional group tolerance.</dc:description>

      <title>Tris(benzhydryl) and cationic bis(benzhydryl) Ln(III) complexes: exceptional thermostability and catalytic activity in olefin hydroarylation and hydrobenzylation with substituted pyridines</title>
      <dc:description>A series of Ln(III) tris(benzhydryl) complexes [(p&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4)2CH]3Ln (Ln = La (1), Nd (2), Y (3)) were synthesized by the salt metathesis reactions of LnHal3(THF)3.5 (Ln = La, Nd, Hal = Cl; Ln= Y, Hal = I) and [(p&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4)2CH]Na. In 1&#8208;3 the benzhydryl ligands are linked with the metal centres in &#951;4&#8208;coordination mode. For diamagnetic complexes 1 and 3 a fluxional behaviour was detected in solution. Complexes 1&#8722;3 proved to be thermally stable: no decomposition was observed even after heating their solutions in toluene&#8208;d8 at 140 &#176;C during 72 h. The reactions of 1 and 2 with B(C6F5)3 allowed for the synthesis of base&#8208;free cationic complexes [(p&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4)2CH]2Ln[(p&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4)2CHB(C6F5)3] (Ln = La (4), Nd (5)) which adopt the structure of a contact ion pair. 
	Combinations of 1&#8722;3 and borane ((B(C6F5)3, [Me2NHPh] [B(C6F5)4], [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4]) as well as 4 and 5 were found to be highly efficient, regio&#8208; and chemoselective catalysts for hydroarylation and hydrobenzylation of C=C bonds of a variety of substrates with substituted pyridines. These catalysts enable highly challenging transformations such as hydrobenzylation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted and internal C=C bonds.</dc:description>

      <title>Differences in the Performance of Allyl Based Palladium Precatalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Palladium(II) precatalysts are used extensively to facilitate cross&#8208;coupling reactions because they are bench stable and give high activity. As a result, precatalysts such as Buchwald&#8217;s palladacycles, Organ&#8217;s PEPPSI species, Nolan&#8217;s allyl&#8208;based complexes, and Yale&#8217;s 1&#8208;tert&#8208;butylindenyl containing complexes, are all commercially available. Comparing the performance of the different classes of precatalysts is challenging because they are typically used under different conditions, in part because they are reduced to the active species via different pathways. However, within a particular class of precatalyst, it is easier to compare performance because they activate via similar pathways and are used under the same conditions. Here, we evaluate the activity of different allyl&#8208;based precatalysts, such as (&#951;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;allyl)PdCl(L), (&#951;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;crotyl)PdCl(L), (&#951;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;cinnamyl)PdCl(L), and (&#951;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;1&#8208;tert&#8208;butylindenyl)PdCl(L) in Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions. Specifically, we evaluate precatalyst performance as the ancillary ligand (NHC or phosphine), reaction conditions, and substrates are varied. In some cases, we connect relative activity to both the mechanism of activation and the prevalence of the formation of inactive palladium(I) dimers. Additionally, we compare the performance of in situ generated precatalysts with commonly used palladium sources such as tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;dba&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), bis(acetonitrile)dichloropalladium(II) (Pd(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and palladium acetate. Our results provide information about which precatalyst to use under different conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Reprogramming epoxide hydrolase  to improve enantioconvergence in hydrolysis of styrene oxide scaffolds</title>
      <dc:description>Enantioconvergent hydrolysis by epoxide hydrolase is a promising method for the synthesis of important vicinal diols. However, the poor regioselectivity of the naturally occurring enzymes results in low enantioconvergence in the enzymatic hydrolysis of styrene oxides. Herein, modulated residue No. 263 was redesigned based on structural information and a smart variant library was constructed by site&#8208;directed modification using an &#8220;optimized amino acid alphabet&#8221; to improve the regioselectivity of epoxide hydrolase from Vigna radiata (VrEH2). The regioselectivity coefficient (r) of variant M263Q for the R&#8208;isomer of meta&#8208;substituted styrene oxides was improved 40&#8211;63&#8208;fold, and variant M263V also exhibited higher regioselectivity towards the R&#8208;isomer of para&#8208;substituted styrene oxides compared with the wild type, which resulted in improved enantioconvergence in hydrolysis of styrene oxide scaffolds. Structural insight showed the crucial role of residue No. 263 in modulating the substrate binding conformation by altering the binding surroundings. Furthermore, increased differences in the attacking distance between nucleophilic residue Asp101 and the two carbon atoms of the epoxide ring provided evidence for improved regioselectivity. Several high&#8208;value vicinal diols were readily synthesized (&gt;88% yield, 90%&#8211;98% ee) by enantioconvergent hydrolysis using the reprogrammed variants. These findings provide a successful strategy for enhancing the enantioconvergence of native epoxide hydrolases through key single&#8208;site mutation and more powerful enzyme tools for the enantioconvergent hydrolysis of styrene oxide scaffolds into single (R)&#8208;enantiomers of chiral vicinal diols.</dc:description>

      <title>Advances in Asymmetric Amino Acid Synthesis Enabled by Radical Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral amino acids (AAs), being the main &#8220;building&#8221; blocks of the living organisms, are also an important class of organic compounds which broadly applied in synthetic chemistry, biochemistry, catalysis and the designing of new drugs. According to the industrial&#8208;commodity market, chiral non&#8208;proteinogenic AAs containing various functional groups come to the fore. To date, radical cross&#8208;coupling reactions are becoming an option as an attractive powerful tool for AA syntheses. Owing to mild reaction conditions and high functional&#8208;group tolerance, radical chemistry represents an ideal strategy for the synthesis of challenging complex non&#8208;proteinogenic AAs. Moreover, the radical cross&#8208;coupling allows introducing AA residue into drug scaffolds and natural compounds. In the present review, we wish to summarize and discuss all the reported to date methods of the asymmetric synthesis of AAs using radical chemistry by presenting a comprehensive account of the literature in this &#64257;eld going back to 1990. We especially emphasize on a radical chemistry approach and, exclusively, on stereoselective synthesis of various &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;AAs and derivatives employing a different type of radical initiators starting from AIBN and organostannes and ending with powerful photoredox catalysis.

Furthermore, the mechanism of the reported reactions will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Synthesis of 1,4&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of &#945; Chlorocarbonyls and Enol Acetates</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report a protocol for visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated radical coupling reactions of &#945;&#8208;chloroketones and enol acetates to afford 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds, which are important precursors and intermediates in organic synthesis. The reaction involves photoredox&#8208;catalyzed activation of the &#945;&#8208;chloroketone upon photoelectron transfer, carbon&#8211;chlorine bond cleavage, and coupling of the resulting radical with the carbon&#8211;carbon double bond of the enol acetate. This mild protocol has a wide substrate scope and moderate to good yields.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Amines represent an important class of industrial feedstock as many pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, petrochemicals, and healthcare products are derived from them. Researchers around the globe are investing their time and efforts in developing novel methodologies for the functionalization of aliphatic and aromatic amines by improving their functional group tolerance, regioselectivity, chemoselectivity, and time efficiency. Among the most studied methods for the derivatization of amines, C&#8210;H activation is gaining significant interest due to easy to follow, environmentally friendly, and time economic protocols. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8210; and C(sp2)&#8210;H  activation is a fascinating field of chemistry where the electronics of the structure, functional group characteristics, and nature of the directing group (DG) decide the outcome of the chemical reaction. Under carefully tailored reaction conditions and by a selection of the correct substrates/reagent, site&#8208;specific C&#8210;H functionalization can be achieved at different positions with respect to the amine group.

      <title>A Convoluted Polyvinylpyridine&#8208;Palladium Catalyst for Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling and C&#8208;H Arylation</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. The development of highly active and reusable supported catalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling and catalytic C&#8208;H arylation is important for fundamental and applied chemistry, with these reactions being used to produce medical compounds and functional materials. Herein, we found that a mesoporous composite made of a linear poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) and tetrachloropalladate acted as a dual&#8208;mode catalyst for a variety of cross&#8208;coupling reactions, with both Pd nanoparticles and a Pd complex catalyst being observed under different conditions. The polyvinylpyridine&#8208;palladium composite 1 was readily prepared via the molecular convolution of poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) and sodium tetrachloropalladate to provide a hardly soluble polymer&#8208;metal composite. The Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling and the C&#8208;H arylation of aryl chlorides and bromides with arylboronic acids, thiophenes, furans, benzene, and anisole proceeded in the presence of 0.004 mol% (40 mol ppm) to 1 mol% Pd of 1 to afford the corresponding coupling products in high yields.
Furthermore, the catalyst was reused without an appreciable loss of activity. Pharmaceutical compounds and functional materials were synthesized via the coupling reactions. N2 gas adsorption/desorption analysis indicated that the catalyst had a mesoporous nature, which played a crucial role in the catalysis. In the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings, in situ generated palladium nanoparticles in the polymer matrix were catalytically active, while a polymeric Pd(II) complex was crucial in the C&#8208;H arylations. These catalytic species were investigated via XAFS, XPS, far&#8208;infrared absorption, and Raman spectroscopies, as well as DFT calculations.</dc:description>

Cyclohexane are more easily to be functionalized in this reaction than toluene, which could be rationally explained by polarity&#8208;match principle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Strategy for Accessing Aldehydes via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;O/C&#8208;N Bond Cleavage in the Presence of Hydrosilanes</title>
      <dc:description>We report the catalytic reduction of both active esters and amides by selective C(acyl)&#8211;X (X = O, N) cleavage to access aldehyde functionality via a palladium&#8208;catalyzed strategy. Reactions are promoted by hydrosilanes as reducing reagents with good to excellent yields and with excellent chemoselectivity for C(acyl)&#8211;N and C(acyl)&#8211;O bond cleavage. Carboxylic acid C(acyl)&#8211;O bonds are activated by 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;4,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (CDMT) to form triazine ester intermediates, which further react with hydrosilanes to yield aldehydes in one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step procedures. We demonstrate that C(acyl)&#8211;O cleavage/formylation offers higher yields and broader substrate scopes compared with C(acyl)&#8211;N cleavage under the same reaction conditions.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Abstract. A colloidal catalyst was developed by complexation of copper chloride in polydiacetylene micelles. The latter were designed to accommodate and stabilize copper salts, by providing a suitable liganded environment. Micelles were valorized as nanoreactors for the promotion of the Huisgen cycloaddition reaction in water thanks to their central hydrophobic core which permitted not only aqueous dispersion, but also concentration of the reagents at the vicinity of the catalyst.

      <dc:description>
The front cover picture, provided by Sung&#8208;Gon Kim and his co&#8208;workers, illustrates an efficient [4+3]&#8208;annulation reaction between in situ generated azaoxyallyl cations and isatoic anhydride to afford seven&#8208;membered 1,4&#8208;benzodiazepinediones. This annulation involves the cascade reaction of decarboxylative addition of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) to isatoic anhydride, addition to the azaoxyallyl cation generated from &#945;&#8208;halohydroxamate, and intramolecular substitution to yield 1,4&#8208;benzodiazepinediones.

      <title>Recent Progress on Reductive Coupling of Nitroarenes by Using Organosilanes as Convenient Reductants</title>
      <dc:description>Nitroarenes are stable, low&#8208;cost, and readily available starting materials. The directly utilize nitroarenes in synthetically valuable C&#8211;N bond formation is of great significance, because the pre&#8208;reduction step to corresponding amines can be avoided. Previously, phosphines and carbon monoxide (CO) are the most widely used reductants in the reductive cyclization or/and carbonylation of nitroarenes. Currently, much attention has been attracted to organosilanes as new potential reducing agents, not only because they are inexpensive, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, and mild reagents, but also various novel reaction models of nitroarenes have been explored. In this review, we mainly summarize the recent progress on the reductive coupling of nitroarenes by using organosilanes as the end reductants. We hope that a deep understanding of the reaction model and underlying working mechanism can provide a timely guideline for researchers who are interested in this fantastic area, leading to further exploration of practical and efficient reductive coupling of nitroarenes for C&#8208;N bond formation and N&#8208;heterocycle synthesis.</dc:description>
