         <title>Witnessing the Birth of Directed Evolution of Stereoselective Enzymes as Catalysts in Organic Chemistry</title>

Abstract
This invited essay outlines how the idea of directed evolution of stereoselective enzymes was born and implemented experimentally at the Max&#8208;Planck&#8208;Institut f&#252;r Kohlenforschung in M&#252;lheim/Germany during the period 1994&#8211;1998, a time when Andreas Pfaltz was present in the Institute. As the new and sole director of the MPI, I initiated new research projects, and also started to restructure the Institute with the establishment of five departments, all dedicated to some form of catalysis and to be led by five independent directors. Andreas Pfaltz was the first director whom I hired, heading the Department of Homogeneous Catalysis. During his stay in M&#252;lheim until 1998, the Pfaltz group invented effective chiral ligands for a number of particularly challenging enantioselective transformations. During this period, Andreas Pfaltz witnessed the birth and development of directed evolution of stereoselective enzymes as a new research direction in the Reetz group. Indeed, he was one of the very few organic chemists who realized at the time that a door to a novel research area had been opened. The widespread application of enzymes was hampered for decades due to limited enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and regioselectivity, which was the reason why organic chemists were not interested in biocatalysis. This attitude slowly changed with the advent of directed evolution of stereoselective enzymes in 1997, in a publication from the Reetz group. Methodology development with emphasis on stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity as well as activity followed, the techniques and strategies becoming more and more rational. Today, semi&#8208;rational approaches and so&#8208;called rational enzyme design have merged, as evidenced, inter alia, by the development of focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis (FRISM). The toolbox of organic chemists now includes enzymes, primarily because the possibility of controlling stereoselectivity by protein engineering has ensured reliability when facing synthetic challenges.

         <title>Insight into the Stereocontrol of DNA Polymerase&#8208;Catalysed Reaction by Chiral Cobalt Complexes.</title>

The front cover picture, provided by Li Wu and her co&#8208;workers, illustrates stereocontrol of DNA polymerase&#8211;catalysed reaction by chiral cobalt complexes, which might seem like &#8220;chiral environmental agents&#8221;. One chiral enantiomer of the cobalt complexes interacts with substrate&#8208;binding site of DNA polymerase, exhibiting inhibition or acceleration of DNA polymerase&#8211;catalysed reaction, whereas the other chiral enantiomer does not bind to the key site, causing little effect on the polymerase reaction. Details can be found in the Research Article by Li Wu and co&#8208;workers (Y. Wu, X. Bu, Y. Ke, H. Sun, J. Li, L. Chen, W. Cui, Y. He, L. Wu, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2022, 364, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202200418)

         <dc:description>A copper&#8208;catalyzed acylhalogenation reaction of 3&#8208;methylanthranils with acid halides, which utilizes the acyl halide as both the acylating and halogenating source, is described. This process involves N&#8208;O/C&#8208;H/C&#8208;X bond cleavages and C&#8208;N/C&#8208;X bond formations to furnish N&#8208;(2&#8208;(2&#8208;haloyl)phenyl)amides. Furthermore, this difunctional conversion using the N&#8208;O bond and oxygen as oxidants displays good tolerance for different functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Dialkylphosphites from White Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Dialkyl phosphites (DAPIs), traditionally prepared from hazardous and corrosive PCl3, are the fundamental reactive starting materials used in organophosphorus chemistry. Here, a KBr&#8208;mediated synthesis of DAPIs involving P4, alcohols and water is presented. With the use of silica gel as the catalyst, oxone as the safe oxidant, industrially important (EtO)2P(O)H, (i&#8208;PrO)2P(O)H and (MeO)2P(O)H are prepared in 70&#8211;90% yields. Furthermore, rare metal extractant bis(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphate (D2EHPA) is obtained in 73% yield. The reaction is characterized by a complete conversion of white phosphorus. Moreover, this method can be easily adapted to large&#8208;scale preparation.

Abstract
Direct N&#8208;functionalization of benzimidazoles and related azaheterocycles has been achieved using readily accessible &#945;&#8208;acyloxy sulfides under transition metal&#8208;free conditions. In the presence of the base, potassium carbonate, a variety of N&#8208;functionalized azaheterocyclic compounds bearing an N&#8208;alkyl ester moiety were synthesized from corresponding heterocyclic precursors. The present reaction does not use transition metals, is operationally simple, and has broad substrate scope.

The front cover image illustrates the complex mixture of a selective copper&#8208;mediated reaction of a bromobenzene bearing a bromoalkanoyl chain to an amine&#8208;azide. It proceeds stepwise via a bis&#8208;azide intermediate and produces copper nanostructures simultaneously, which grow on the PTFE stirring bar. The copper in the reaction mixture is responsible for the aryl azide reduction, and the mild protocol is broadly applicable for bromobenzenes with electron withdrawing groups. Furthermore, the copper nanostructures can mediate azide&#8208;alkyne click reactions. Details can be found in the Research Article by Max Roemer and co&#8208;workers (M. Roemer, I. Luck, N.

Abstract
Using chiral phosphoric acids as organocatalysts, a formal asymmetric (4+2) cycloaddition of 3&#8208;methylene isoindolinone and in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated ortho&#8208;quinone methide substrates is disclosed. This reaction exhibited a broad substrate scope with various substituted cyclic enamides and ortho&#8208;hydroxybenzyl alcohol derivatives to construct a series of spiro chroman&#8208;isoindolinones containing spiro&#8208;N,O&#8208;heterocycles with 56 to 93% ee. This strategy demonstrates significant potential towards establishing a chiral spiro&#8208;N,O&#8208;aminal systems bearing two chiral carbon centers, including a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter.

Abstract
Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) possess an unnatural activity of introducing functionalities such as N3, CN, NO2 etc., into a molecule through the ring&#8208;opening reaction of epoxides. The enantioselectivity of HHDHs is substrate&#8208;dependent and not always high enough for synthetic applications. B&#8208;group of HHDHs has been neglected in the past, due to observed low enantioselectivity based on performance on a relatively limited number of substrates. Extensive screening of substrates on HheB2 from Mycobacterium sp. GP1 and HheB from Corynebacterium sp. N&#8208;1074 was performed. Several highly enantioselective reactions were discovered (E&gt;200), with HheB showing higher enantioselectivity and activity toward larger panel of substrates compared to HheB2. Enzymes HheB and HheB2 are highly homologous; they differ by only 4 residues. By using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, residues 120 and 125 were found to be responsible for higher enantioselectivity of HheB compared to HheB2. Computational analysis supported experiments and provided evidence that kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of reactions within HheB enzymes are crucial in determining the observed enantioselectivities. Due to remarkable activity and enantioselectivity, B&#8208;group HHDHs emerged as a catalyst of choice for the synthesis of bulky tertiary alcohols, as shown in this work.

Abstract
We present an efficient method for forming C&#8722;N bonds via intramolecular amidation catalyzed by well&#8208;defined Cp*Co(N,O)I complexes. The reaction has been operate under mild conditions and produced a regioselective amidation product without the use of a bulky counter anion or expensive fluorinated solvents. The Cp*Co(N,O)&#8208;I catalyst is very effective for intramolecular benzylic, tertiary, and internal C(sp3)&#8722;H bond amidation, but ineffective for intramolecular C(sp2)&#8722;H bond amidation.

         <title>Diastereoselective and Synergistic Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Bispropargylation of Xanthones and Thioxanthones: An Access to Xanthene Derivatives</title>

Abstract
A gold&#8208;catalyzed bispropargylation of xanthone derivatives is described. The use of propargylsilanes permits to achieve a deoxygenative bispropargylation through a double catalytic addition of the corresponding allenylgold intermediate to the synergistically activated carbonyl moiety. This methodology works in a diastereoselective manner either with xanthone or thioxanthone derivatives. Monopropargylated xanthydrol silyl ethers were isolated as reaction intermediates and these species could be transformed into symmetrical and non&#8208;symmetrical bispropargylated xanthenes. The formation of non&#8208;symmetrical bispropargylated xanthenes could also be achieved through an one&#8208;pot procedure. Finally, other interesting structures, such as propargylxanthylidenes, propargylxanthenes and bispropargylated xanthenes replacing the silicon moiety, were accessible following different one&#8208;pot synthetic methodologies. In addition, bispropargylated xanthenes could perform a carbonylative [2+2+1] formal cycloaddition.

Abstract
A catalytic asymmetric vinylogous Mannich/annulation/acylation reaction of 2&#8208;ethylidene 1,3&#8208;indandiones with isatin N&#8208;Boc ketimines has been developed, which furnished a series of chiral spiro&#8208;oxindole piperidine derivatives with polyaromatic scaffolds in 30&#8211;67% yield and 93&#8211;98% ee. The DFT computational calculation is used to probe and explain the origin of the enantioselectivity and observed formation of O&#8208;acetylated products.

&lt;p&gt;A catalytic asymmetric vinylogous Mannich/annulation/acylation reaction of 2-ethylidene 1,3-indandiones with isatin &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Boc ketimines has been developed, which furnished a series of chiral spiro-oxindole piperidine derivatives with polyaromatic scaffolds in 30&#8211;67% yield and 93&#8211;98% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;. The DFT computational calculation is used to probe and explain the origin of the enantioselectivity and observed formation of &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-acetylated products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Ring Closure of Nitroalkylmalonates for the Synthesis of Isoxazolines under the Acylation Conditions</title>

Abstract
Acylation of nitroalkylmalonates was found to yield substituted isoxazoline derivatives. This redox&#8208;neutral transformation has a wide substrate scope and produces target products with yields up to 92%. Various substituents (aryl, alkyl, and ester) at the C3 and C4 positions of the resulting isoxazolines were also tolerated. A quick assembly of the isoxazoline ring starting from nitroalkenes and malonates was successfully developed. Control experiments showed that the intramolecular ring closure is the most likely key mechanistic step. Subsequent transformations into pyrrolidine and furane derivatives demonstrated the synthetic utility of the obtained products.

Abstract
An electrochemical oxidative C&#8722;H/S&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction between acetonitrile and heteroaryl thiols has been developed. Me4NBr is employed as a redox catalyst to oxidize both the Csp3&#8722;H of acetonitrile and S&#8722;H of heteroaryl thiols. Heteroaryl vinyl sulfides were afforded under metal&#8208;free and oxidant&#8208;free reaction conditions in good yields and stereoselectivities with excellent functional group tolerance. The synthetic applicability of the electrochemical method was further highlighted by its easy scalability.

Abstract
A general photocatalytic substrate&#8208;controlled chemodivergent strategy starting from monoalkynes with polyhalomethanes such as BrCCl3 and CBr4 was develop, enabling Kharasch&#8208;type addition/nucleophilic substitution cascade to selectively produce &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;dihalovinyl ketones and chromen&#8208;2&#8208;ones with moderate to good yields. Use of monoalkynes without additional nucleophilic sites furnished &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;dihalovinyl ketones through a Kharasch&#8208;type addition and intermolecular allylic substitution cascade whereas the latter transformation of 2&#8208;ethynylphenols allowed the full breaking of carbon&#8208;halogen bonds of BrCX3 to access functionalized chromen&#8208;2&#8208;ones. The late&#8208;stage application of these resulting &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;dihalovinyl ketones demonstrates the versatility of their derivatization.

Abstract
A strategy to synthesize 3&#8208;alkyl quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and other alkyl N&#8208;heteroarenes via a photocatalyzed decarbonylative alkylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and simple N&#8208;heterocycles with commercially available aliphatic aldehyde under ambient conditions using phenanthrenequinone as a photocatalyst was developed. In this transformation, various 3&#8208;alkyl quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and other alkyl N&#8208;heteroarenes were generated in 58&#8211;87% isolated yields with good functional&#8208;group tolerance.

Abstract
A FeCl2&#8208;catalyzed homocoupling of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketoximes in batch and flow is reported. This protocol demonstrates broad substrate scope and functional group tolerance, providing an alternate route toward the synthesis of 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted pyrimidines under mild conditions. Also a gram&#8208;scale reaction has been performed to evaluate the applicability of this method.

Abstract
In this article, bismuth triflate (Bi(OTf)3)&#8208;controlled intermolecular multi&#8208;component condensation of oxygenated arylacetic acids with electron&#8208;withdrawing nitroarylaldehydes or electron&#8208;donating trimethoxybenzene provide 1&#8208;aryl isoquinolinones or o&#8208;diaryl pyrimidines in acetonitrile at 60&#8201;&#176;C. The uses of various metal triflates and reaction conditions are investigated in the one&#8208;pot reaction. Only water is generated as the byproduct via (4C+1C+1N) and (2C+1N1C+1N1C) annulation routes. Plausible mechanisms have been proposed.

Abstract
A cascade C&#8722;H activation, annulation, and etherification of N&#8208;hydroxybenzamides with propargylamines provides a flexible route to N&#8208;alkoxylated 3&#8208;arylisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones. Three new bonds (C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O) are generated to afford a series of isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones bearing a tetrasubstituted carbon in 49&#8211;82% yield. The utility of this method was showcased by gram&#8208;scale synthesis and synthetic transformations of the product to access structurally diverse isoindolinones.

It depicts the halohydrin dehalogenase&#8208;catalysed conversion of epoxides. Extensive screening of enzymes from group B revealed several highly enantioselective transformations, with HheB showing higher enantioselectivity and activity toward a larger panel of substrates compared to HheB2. By using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, residues 120 and 125 were found to be responsible for higher enantioselectivity of HheB compared to HheB2. Due to remarkable activity and enantioselectivity, B&#8208;group HHDHs emerged as a catalyst of choice for the synthesis of bulky tertiary alcohols.

Abstract
Over the past decades, aspidosperma and kopsia alkaloids have attracted significant interest by the organic synthetic community owing to their intricate fused&#8208;ring structures and broad biological activities. Consequently, numerous strategically distinct total syntheses have been accomplished, among which tetracyclic pyridocarbazoles have seen widespread adoption as versatile building blocks. In this review, we elaborate and discuss the synthesis of such tetracyclic pyridocarbazoles according to the different approaches for the establishment of the all&#8208;carbon quaternary center at C5. This includes (1) classic synthetic reactions (cycloaddition, Michael addition, nucleophilic substitution, and Claisen rearrangement), (2) palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric decarboxylative allylation reactions, and (3) thiourea&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Michael addition reactions. Furthermore, we also describe the late&#8208;stage key transformations in the realm of the total syntheses of aspidosperma and kopsia alkaloids.

         <title>Alkyne&#8208;Based Syntheses of Carbo&#8208; and Heterohelicenes</title>

Abstract
[n]Helicenes are polycyclic aromatic molecules in which n ortho&#8208;condensed benzene or other aromatic rings give rise to helical chiral and highly conjugated structures. The unique screw shape, helically extended &#960;&#8208;system and intriguing electronic and chirooptical properties of these molecules have attracted scientific interest for decades. The applications of helicenes have now expanded into several fields including material science, nanoscience, biochemistry, supramolecular and polymer chemistry. Despite the great theoretical and practical interest in helicenes, their synthesis remains a challenge. Among synthetic approaches to helicenes, alkyne cyclizations have great potential, since carbon&#8208;rich high&#8208;energy alkynes can form aromatic rings via cycloisomerizations. These processes are atom&#8208;economic. In addition, alkyne reactions are highly favorable thermodynamically. This review focuses on alkyne&#8208;based syntheses of carbo&#8208; and heterohelicenes (2000&#8211;2022). These syntheses are obviously multistage. In the review, they are systematized in terms of the key step leading to the formation of a helical shape. The methods are grouped into two categories: (a) metal&#8208;free syntheses and (b) transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed syntheses. This division is very arbitrary, since catalytic Sonogashira and Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions and others are often used to prepare starting materials in the syntheses of the first group. Most of the publications on the topic are related to transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed syntheses of helicenes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]Helicenes are polycyclic aromatic molecules in which n &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-condensed benzene or other aromatic rings give rise to helical chiral and highly conjugated structures. The unique screw shape, helically extended &#960;-system and intriguing electronic and chirooptical properties of these molecules have attracted scientific interest for decades. The applications of helicenes have now expanded into several fields including material science, nanoscience, biochemistry, supramolecular and polymer chemistry. Despite the great theoretical and practical interest in helicenes, their synthesis remains a challenge. Among synthetic approaches to helicenes, alkyne cyclizations have great potential, since carbon-rich high-energy alkynes can form aromatic rings via cycloisomerizations. These processes are atom-economic. In addition, alkyne reactions are highly favorable thermodynamically. This review focuses on alkyne-based syntheses of carbo- and heterohelicenes (2000&#8211;2022). These syntheses are obviously multistage. In the review, they are systematized in terms of the key step leading to the formation of a helical shape. The methods are grouped into two categories: (a) metal-free syntheses and (b) transition-metal-catalyzed syntheses. This division is very arbitrary, since catalytic Sonogashira and Suzuki-Miyaura reactions and others are often used to prepare starting materials in the syntheses of the first group. Most of the publications on the topic are related to transition-metal-catalyzed syntheses of helicenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Tetrahydroxydiboron&#8208;Mediated Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenative Transfer Hydrogenation of Aryl Ketones</title>

Abstract
We describe a palladium&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenative transfer hydrogenation of ketones using B2(OH)4 as the sole additive. Deuterium labeling experiments using B2(OD)4 show that the incorporated protons originate exclusively from the diboron reagent. Spectroscopic evidence implicates the intermediacy of a borate ester. A variety of aromatic ketones can be deoxygenated using this approach.

Abstract
A defluorinative heteroarylation of trifluoropropanamides through N&#8208;chelation&#8208;assisted palladium&#8208;catalyzed selective C&#8722;F activation has been developed. This reaction is compatible with a variety of trifluoropropanamides and indoles under mild reaction conditions to provide the stereospecific (Z)&#8208;N&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluorovinylindoles in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Synthesis of Bis(&#946;&#8208;Oximinoalkyl)malonates and Their Catalytic Reductive Cyclization to Piperidines</title>

Abstract
Hitherto unknown bis(&#946;&#8208;oximinoalkyl)malonates were demonstrated to be convenient platforms for the synthesis of saturated N&#8208;heterocycles. Upon heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation, these dioximes undergo reductive cyclization to give substituted piperidine&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxylates, which are valuable building blocks in medicinal chemistry. By using dioximes bearing an additional ester group in the side chain, tandem piperidine/pyrrolidinone ring closure leading to indolizidinone framework was showcased in this work. A modular synthesis of initial bis(&#946;&#8208;oximinoalkyl)malonates (both symmetrically and unsymmetrically substituted) was accomplished via a sequential Michael addition of two nitrosoalkene molecules to malonic ester. The mechanism of the reductive cyclization of dioximes to piperidines was investigated by isotope scrambling experiments and isolation of intermediates.

Abstract
A diastereoselective and enantioselective conjugate addition of &#945;&#8208;substituted acyl imidazole to nitroalkene catalyzed by nickel bisoxazoline complex and B(C6F5)3 has been developed. This reaction tolerated a wide range of acyl imidazoles and nitroalkenes, affording a series of conjugate adducts in yields ranging from 38% to 99% with 4:1 to 99:1 dr and 13% to 98% ee. The use of strong Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 as co&#8208;catalyst proved vital to the success of this process. The potential scalability and utility of the current protocol are demonstrated by a reaction on a 3&#8197;mmol scale and further transformations of the product.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of ortho&#8208;Amino Aryl Ketones by Aerobic Electrooxidative Cleavage of the C(2)=C(3)/C(2)&#8722;N Bonds of N&#8208;Boc Indoles</title>

Abstract
The previous strategies for oxidative cleavage of 2,3&#8208;double bond of substituted indoles generally suffered from usage of heavy metals, stoichiometric chemical oxidants or hash conditions. Herein, we reported an electrochemistry&#8208;driven aerobic cleavage of C(2)=C(3)/C(2)&#8722;N bonds of indoles. Through an undivided cell, various indoles and its derivatives can be converted into the corresponding ortho&#8208;amino aryl ketones. This method features metal&#8208;free, air&#8208;as&#8208;oxidant and easy scalability.

         <title>Rhodium(CAAC)&#8208;Catalyzed Arene Hydrogenation of Benzo&#8208;Fused N&#8208;Heterocycles to Saturated Building Blocks with an all&#8208;cis Configuration</title>

Abstract
Saturated carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic building blocks can be readily obtained by the hydrogenation of aromatic carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. Although a variety of methods have been established to accomplish this transformation for simple arenes, the hydrogenation of aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles is less explored. We herein report a diastereoselective arene hydrogenation which was applied to an array of benzo&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocycles. A total of 48 saturated heterocycles was obtained by hydrogenation in the presence of the rhodium complex Cy(CAAC)Rh(cod)Cl in yields of 72&#8211;98% with moderate to high diastereoselectivities exhibiting the hydrogen atoms in an all&#8208;cis arrangement. The high tolerance towards functional groups enables the formation of valuable saturated products, which offer a starting point for further derivatization.

         <title>Tandem Asymmetric Cycloaromatization/ Intramolecular Pictet&#8208;Spengler&#8208;Type Reaction. An Entry to Polycyclic Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The asymmetric synthesis of tetracyclic pyrroles bearing a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter has been accomplished through a one&#8208;pot sequence that comprises a cross metathesis reaction followed by a tandem cycloisomerization/ intramolecular Pictet&#8208;Spengler&#8208;type reaction. This sequence took place on conveniently functionalized chiral amino acids to render the final products in good overall yields and diastereoselectivities up to 20:1. Those pyrrole&#8208;containing scaffolds are present in a variety of biologically relevant compounds.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Arylacetaldehydes from Aryl Aldehydes or Diaryl Ketones via One&#8208;Carbon Extension by Using the System of DMSO/KOH/Zinc</title>

Abstract
A one&#8208;step protocol is described for the synthesis of arylacetaldehydes from aryl aldehydes or diaryl ketones by using the system of DMSO/KOH/zinc. In this transformation, DMSO provides a methine fragment that converts the &#8722;CHO structure in aryl aldehydes or the &#8722;CO&#8722; structure in diaryl ketones to the &#8722;CH2CHO structure in arylacetaldehydes via a one&#8208;carbon extension. This protocol could also be used to synthesize arylacetaldehyde acetals from aryl aldehydes or diaryl ketones when zinc was replaced by diols. In this protocol, 25&#8197;examples of arylacetaldehydes and 26&#8197;examples of arylacetaldehyde acetals have been synthesized from aryl aldehydes or diaryl ketones. Based on control experiments and the literature, a plausible reaction mechanism is proposed in our work.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Cyclization of Alkenyl Vinylogous Carbonates for Stereoselective Synthesis of Substituted Tetrahydrofurans, Tetrahydropyrans and Chromans</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A practical method for the stereoselective synthesis of substituted tetrahydrofurans (THFs), tetrahydropyrans (THPs) as well as chromans using intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) followed by intramolecular radical cyclization of alkenyl vinylogous carbonates is described. This Fe(acac)3&#8208;catalyzed reaction uses PhSiH3 as H&#8208;source and works under ambient conditions in HFIP/ethylene glycol (5:1 mixture) as solvent. The methodology developed has broad substrate scope and is amenable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis. The method gives ready access to even hexa&#8208;substituted cyclic ethers containing two quaternary carbons.  This strategy is used in the construction of oxaspirocyclic systems. Diastereoselective synthesis of fused bicyclic as well as tricyclic motifs could be achieved. The stereochemistry of the products was assigned using NOE experiments and was further confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies on two derivatives.</dc:description>

A reaction between pyrazolones and secondary phosphonates in the presence of TBAI/TBHP combination could result in the N&#8211;P bond formation at N2 position. Meanwhile, the C&#8211;P bond coupling at C3 position could be obtained from a reaction of N2&#8208;substituted pyrazolone substrates with secondary phosphine oxides using Selectfluor.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Bisphenols and Diaryl Ethers by Metal Compatible Organocatalytic Aerobic Oxidation of Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activation of dioxygen by monooxygenase enzymes enables the oxidation of a rich variety of substrates mainly due to the compatibility of this process with redox active metals. The current study shows that similarly to monooxygenases, pyrrole&#8208;proline 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine (DKP) organocatalyst, in the presence of Hantzsch ester and HFIP is compatible with copper(II) salts for the activation of dioxygen. These findings allow to selectively diverge the oxidation profile of boronic acids for the synthesis of phenols, bisphenols and diaryl ethers by DKP&#8208;promoted aerobic oxidation and subsequent metal oxidative&#8208;coupling or Chan&#8208;Lam&#8208;Evans type reaction of the formed phenols.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. In this review, the coupling of two carbene precursors for the synthesis of alkenes is surveyed. The key to selective carbene coupling is the difference in the rate of carbene generation between the two carbene precursors. This strategy requires judicious selection between two carbene precursors as well as fine&#8208;tuning of reaction conditions to obtain desired chemo and stereoselectivity. These couplings were carried out in the presence and absence of the metal catalyst. The present review describes inter and intramolecular coupling of diazo compounds and cross&#8208;coupling between diazo and non&#8208;diazo compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report on the photocatalytic reaction of acceptor/acceptor diazoalkanes with terminal alkynes. Experimental and computational studies suggest the formation of a key triplet carbene intermediate that undergoes an addition reaction to the alkyne followed by cyclization to give furan heterocycles (31 to 90% yield). This reaction was studied with a broad range of alkynes and acceptor/acceptor diazoalkanes and now provides access to furans under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Dearomatization of N&#8208;Alkylquinolinium and Pyridinium Salts under Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Conditions</title>

Abstract
Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction employing N&#8208;alkylquinolinium salts as electrophiles has been developed. The reaction is promoted by DBU, which acts both as a catalyst activating the electron&#8208;poor olefin as well as a base. The dearomatization occurs regioselectively at the C&#8208;2 position, delivering a broad range of &#945;&#8208;(1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)vinyl esters, ketones, and sulfones. The scope of the transformation has also been extended to N&#8208;alkylpyridinium salts. For this class of substrates a presence of at least moderately electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent in the ring is necessary to attain good reactivity. In particular, N&#8208;alkylpyridinium salts containing an ester group undergo the dearomatization regioselectively at the C&#8208;4 position, while nitrile and nitro moieties cause the non&#8208;selective formation of products of the C&#8208;2 and C&#8208;6 additions.

The reaction is promoted by DBU, which acts both as a catalyst activating the electron-poor olefin as well as a base. The dearomatization occurs regioselectively at the C-2 position, delivering a broad range of &#945;-(1,2-dihydroquinolin-2-yl)vinyl esters, ketones, and sulfones. The scope of the transformation has also been extended to &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkylpyridinium salts. For this class of substrates a presence of at least moderately electron-withdrawing substituent in the ring is necessary to attain good reactivity. In particular, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkylpyridinium salts containing an ester group undergo the dearomatization regioselectively at the C-4 position, while nitrile and nitro moieties cause the non-selective formation of products of the C-2 and C-6 additions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of 1,2,4&#8208;Triazoles via a [3+2] Cycloaddition of Azinium&#8208;N&#8208;Imines and Nitriles</title>

Abstract
We report here a mechanochemical Cu&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition of azinium&#8208;N&#8208;imines with nitriles under solventless grinding conditions. Various 1,2,4&#8208;triazolos derivatives were obtained in 51&#8211;80% yields. The developed protocol offers advantages in functional&#8208;group compatibility, scalability, no use of solvents, shorter reaction time, and without external heating. In addition, heterocyclic N&#8208;imines such as quinolinium and isoquinolinium salts are also suitable substrates, resulting in the production of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]quinoline and 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives under mechanochemical conditions.

Abstract
Tandem one&#8208;pot regioselective synthesis of C4&#8208;difluoroalkylated phthalazin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones from readily available hydrazines, 2&#8208;formylbenzoic acids and bromodifluoroacetate derivatives under visible&#8208;light photocatalysis is reported. This mild protocol provides straightforward access to various C4&#8208;difluoroalkylated phthalazin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones, and displays broad substrate scope and wide functional group tolerance. Moreover, this process is also suitable for the synthesis of C4&#8208;trifluoromethylated and perfluorobutylated phthalazin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones. The use of fac&#8208;[Ir(ppy)3] photocatalyst and the introduction of an organic base additive are pivotal to catalysis.

Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of 2,3&#8208;allenols with amines was carried out to construct conjugated polyenes with allylic amino and hydroxy groups. [Pd(&#960;&#8208;allyl)Cl]2/P(2&#8208;furyl)3&#8208;catalyzed reaction in MeOH led to (Z)&#8208;configurated [3]dendralene derivatives and Pd(OAc)2/P(2&#8208;furyl)3&#8208;catalyzed reaction in iPrOH resulted in (1Z,3E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene derivatives.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Sequential C&#8722;H Activation/Amination of 2&#8208;Iodobiphenyls with Benzoisoxazoles for Synthesis of Carbazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A coupling reaction of 2&#8208;iodobiphenyl with benzoisoxazole under the cooperative catalysis of Pd(CH3CN)2Cl2 and P(4&#8208;F&#8208;Ph)3 is disclosed. The reaction proceeds via intramolecular C&#8208;H activation/N&#8208;O cleavage/migratory insertion sequence to give an array of N&#8208;arylcarbazoles with an aldehyde or a ketone. The employment of benzoisoxazoles as an amination agent obviates the need for stoichiometric amount of oxidants.</dc:description>

         <title>NIS/HFIP&#8211;Mediated Synthesis of Indene&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;Iodoalkenyl Sulfides from Propargylic Sulfides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A tandem 1,3&#8208;sulfur migration followed by iodocyclization reaction of propargylic sulfides in the presence of NIS in HFIP has been developed to synthesize indene&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;iodoalkenyl sulfides. The choice of the reaction media is crucial to promote the reaction. The proposed mechanism involving the initial NIS activation by HFIP and favoring the sulfur migration of the starting propargylic sulfide via cationic intermediates is experimentally supported. In addition, the suitability of selected indene&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;iodoalkenyl sulfides as building blocks for subsequent C&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming reactions has been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed transannulation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles with carboxylic esters followed by acid&#8208;mediated aromatization has been developed, affording a variety of 2,5&#8208;substituted oxazole derivatives in good to high yields under mild reaction conditions. The present transformation is proposed to involve the intermolecular carbonyl ylide formation between in situ generated &#945;&#8208;imino rhodium carbene and carboxylic esters, which undergoes nucleophilic attack of the neighboring &#945;&#8208;imino moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Frustrated Lewis pair&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of nitriles: FLP versus borenium catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A frustrated Lewis pair&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of aromatic and aliphatic nitriles was developed. The catalyst provides the primary amines in high yields of 77&#8208;99% with catalyst loading as low as 2 mol%. The reaction displays high functional group tolerance towards esters, amides, nitro groups and aliphatic halides. The addition of the diborylated amines to ethyl 3&#8208;phenylpropiolate proceeds with Z&#8208;selectivity with d.r. of &gt; 99:1 in 77&#8208;90% yield over two steps. The reaction mechanism was investigated by control and computational experiments.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free olefinic C&#8722;H azidoalkylthiolation protocol was efficiently developed through C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;S bond cleavage of vinylsulfonium salts with sodium azide in air under aqueous conditions. An interrupted Pummerer/nucleophilc azidoalkylation cascade was developed for such a process. The practicability of the synthetic protocol was demonstrated by scale&#8208;up preparation of the azidoalkylthiolated tetrasubstituted alkene products and their transformations to diverse triazole and tetrazole derivatives as well as azidoalkylthio&#8208;funtionalized N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds. The present synthetic methodology features broad substrate scopes and good functional group tolerance under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Diverse Indol&#8208;3&#8208;Yl&#8208;Substituted Tetrahydropyridines through Three&#8208;Component Reactions</title>

Abstract
Two classes of indole&#8208;tetrahydropyridine hybrid molecules were synthesized via three&#8208;component reactions of: (i) 1&#8208;amino&#8208;3,3&#8208;diethoxypropane, diethyl acetylenedicarboxylate and indole; and (ii) ethyl 3&#8208;aminocrotonate, acrolein and 2&#8208;methylindoles. These one&#8208;pot reactions provided straightforward ways to access indole&#8208;tetrahydropyridine hybrid molecules with enriched molecular diversity. The reactions were most likely triggered by Michael addition, and the generated adducts were trapped by the indole component, leading to the formation of indol&#8208;3&#8208;ylimine intermediate. The obtained indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl&#8208;substituted tetrahydropyridines could be converted into indole&#8208;pyridine hybrid molecules with the aid of DDQ.

         <title>Carbonylative Suzuki Coupling Catalyzed by Pd Complexes Based on [N,P]&#8208;Pyrrole Ligands: Direct Access to 2&#8208;Hydroxybenzophenones</title>

Abstract
The Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling is one of the most useful synthetic tools to build C&#8722;C bonds, but the use of hydroxyaryl halides to direct access hydroxy&#8208;byaryls still remains a challenge. For the carbonylative version of the reaction, the synthesis of hydroxybiaryl ketones is commonly solved by protecting group strategies. In this work, we report a protocol of carbonylative Suzuki&#8208; Miyaura coupling catalysed by a [N,P]&#8208;PdCl2 complex using aryl halides, various aryl boronic acids and CO. We were able at first to obtain biphenyls, finding a singular reactivity towards 2&#8208;bromophenol, that later was extended to the carbonylation reaction, resulting in methodology that allows the obtention of 2&#8208;hydroxybiaryl ketones, with a functional group tolerance toward amines, alkoxy, ketones, esters, and halides.

         <title>Tripeptide Organocatalysts for Stereoselective Conjugate Addition Reactions with N&#8208;Heterocyclic Substituents</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic moieties are abundant among pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, but a challenge for metalorganic and organocatalytic transformations. We present tripeptides of the type H Pro&#8208;Pro&#8208;Xaa as catalysts for stereoselective conjugate addition reactions between N heterocyclic substituted aldehydes and electrophiles. Alkyl substituents at the N terminal proline, the reactive site, were crucial for high chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Different N heterocyclic moieties, even at both reaction partners, were readily tolerated and products were obtained in yields of 61 95% and enantioselectivities of up to 98% ee.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective C4 Functionalization of Indoles with Quinones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel synthetic strategy for the installation of diversely functionalized quinones at the C4 position of indoles is developed via palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H and double C&#8722;H functionalization. This synthetic protocol provides a rapid route to a variety of 4&#8208;quinonylindoles via the direct coupling of 3&#8208;formylindoles with quinones. Furthermore, this synthetic methodology also efficiently affords biologically interesting bis(indol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)quinones in good yields by direct one&#8208;pot double C&#8722;H activation of 3&#8208;formylindoles with the corresponding quinones.</dc:description>

A modular approach to a wide range of 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;3&#8208;(hetero)arylindolizines through aldol&#8208;cyclopropanation&#8208;oxidative cycloisomerization is described where DDQ was utilized for the regioselective synthesis of the pyrrole units from cyclopropyl pyridines for the first time. A key to success is regioselective oxidation of benzylic position by DDQ, which enabled us to access to one regioisomer out of two possible ones. Homo&#8208;dimerization at the C2, C5, or C7 sites of indolizines in the presence of DDQ has been discovered for the first time as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Imine Azaenolates: Synthesis, Reactivity, and Outlook</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Azaenolates are, quite simply, the aza variant of enolates. Compared to their oxygen counterparts, additional control of the reactivity of azaenolates can be achieved by altering the substituent on the nitrogen atom as well as the metal counterion. Since the seminal examples reported in the early 1960s, azaenolates of various metals have been shown to react with a diverse set of electrophilic partners, including challenging electrophiles such as alkyl fluorides, epoxides, and oxetanes. This review describes in detail the current state of the art of the chemistry of azaenolates derived from imines, with a particular focus on the comparison of the reactivity exhibited with different metal counterions.

Abstract
Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed selective transformation of levulinic acid and primary amines into pyrrolidines and pyrrolidinones under H2 has been developed. The catalyst system consisting of Co(NTf2)2, 1,1,1&#8208;tris(di(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)phosphinomethyl) ethane ((p&#8208;anisyl)triphos) and Me3SiOTf works well for the synthesis of pyrrolidines via reductive amination/cyclization/deoxygenative reduction of amide, and using Co(NTf2)2/1,1,1&#8208;tris(diphenylphosphinomethyl) ethane (triphos) as the catalyst under reduced hydrogen pressure results in exclusive formation of pyrrolidinones. Both aryl and alkyl primary amines are suitable substrates, and a variety of functional groups are tolerated. Meanwhile, 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;arylbutanoic acids, 5&#8208;oxohexanoic acid, 6&#8208;oxoheptanoic acid, 2&#8208;formylbenzoic acid, 2&#8208;acetylbenzoic acid and 2&#8242;&#8208;acetyl&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid are also applicable, allowing for convenient access to cyclic amines and lactams with different ring size.

         <title>A Sphingolipid Fatty Acid Constituent Made by Alkyne trans&#8208;Hydrogenation: Total Synthesis of Symbioramide</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A scalable approach to (2R)&#8208;hydroxyoctadec&#8208;3&#8208;enoic acid ((&#8722;)&#8208;2) is reported, which is the fatty acid constituent of numerous sphingolipids of biological significance. Key to success was the chemoselective trans&#8208;hydrogenation of a functionalized propargylic alcohol precursor with [Cp*RuCl]4 as the catalyst, followed by lipase&#8208;catalyzed resolution of the racemic product. (&#8722;)&#8208;2 then served the shortest total synthesis of the marine natural product symbioramide known to date.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Supported Tetrahydropyran&#8208;Based Hybrid Dipeptide Catalysts for Michael Addition of Aldehydes to Nitrostyrenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The heterogenization of homogeneous catalysts onto a solid support is a step towards a more sustainable chemistry. The recovery and reuse of catalysts is extremely important from a practical, economic and environmental point of view. In this regards, we report a series of polymer&#8208;supported tetrahydropyran&#8208;based hybrid dipeptides that serve as active catalysts for the enantioselective Michael addition of aldehydes to &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes. These supported catalysts have been designed considering the optimal anchor position and orientation between the catalyst and the solid support. Additionally, the influence of the linker length on the catalytic efficiency was studied. The catalysts allowed the transformation of a variety of substrates in 76&#8211;98% yield and with 94&#8211;97% enantiomeric excess. Detailed deactivation studies have provided important information, which allows to increase the useful life of these immobilized catalysts.

Abstract
The reactivity of 1,2&#8208;dihalobenzenes in palladium catalyzed polyheteroarylation via C&#8722;H bond functionalization was investigated. The first catalytic cycle using thiophene as the heteroarene gives the expected 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromophenyl)thiophenes. In the course of the second catalytic cycle, in the presence of heteroarenes having a free C3&#8208;position, a partial Pd&#8208;1,4&#8208;migration occurred giving rise to aryl&#8208;substituted biheteroarenes such as 2&#8242;&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;bithiophenes as well as the expected 1,2&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzenes. The best selectivities in favor of the formation of 2&#8242;&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;bithiophenes were obtained with electron&#8208;rich 1,2&#8208;dihalobenzenes. A wide variety of thiophene derivatives bearing useful functions such as formyl, acetyl, cyclopropylmethanone, 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane, ester, nitrile or chloro was tolerated allowing to prepare poly&#8208;functionalized 2&#8242;&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;bithiophenes. Moreover, this one pot preparation of 2&#8242;&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;bithiophenes employs a low loading of an air stable commercially available palladium source associated to an inexpensive base.

Abstract
A metal&#8208;free, base&#8208;mediated decyanation of &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles has been developed to synthesize secondary and tertiary amides using O2 or air as an amide oxygen source. Radical scavenging studies disclosed that the cleavage of C&#8722;CN bond may proceed via an anionic pathway. The practicality of the work was also demonstrated through an in&#8197;situ generated &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles from corresponding aldehydes and amines to afford amides. The important features of this work include broad functional group compatibility, 41% to 89% product yields, gram&#8208;scale synthesis of 2&#176; and 3&#176; amides, broad substrate scope, and an umpolung strategy.

         <title>Cooperative NHC/Photoredox Catalysis: Three Component Radical Coupling of Aroyl Fluorides, Styrenes and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cooperative NHC/photoredox catalysis has emerged as an important research field in recent years. Herein, the use of tertiary alcohols as alkyl radical precursors to perform three component radical coupling with styrenes and aroyl fluorides for the preparation of &#945; arylated alkyl aryl ketones is described. Reaction of an aroyl fluoride with the NHC catalyst provides an acyl azolium ion that can be reduced by the photoredox catalyst to the corresponding ketyl radical anion. Oxidatively generated C&#8208;radicals derived from the alcohol add to the styrene derivative and subsequent cross coupling of the adduct radical with the ketyl radical delivers after NHC fragmentation the targeted ketone.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Pharmaceutically Relevant Bulky Arylbutylamines Using Engineered Transaminases</title>

Abstract
ATAs engineered for having an enlarged small binding pocket were applied for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure (R)&#8208;benzo[1,3]dioxol&#8208;5&#8208;yl&#8208;butylamine, a chiral component of human leukocyte elastase inhibitor DMP 777 (L&#8208;694,458). Kinetic resolution of the racemic amine was performed by using the L59A variant of the (S)&#8208;selective ATA from Chromobacterium violaceum (Cv&#8208;ATA), providing the residual (R)&#8208;enantiomer in excellent yield and &gt;99% ee. At moderate enzyme loading and absence of co&#8208;solvent, high volumetric productivity of 0.22&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 (42.5&#8197;g L&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) was achieved. Complementarily, the (S)&#8208;enantiomer was generated via kinetic resolution using the (R)&#8208;selective ATA&#8208;117&#8208;Rd11 from Arthrobacter sp. with acetone as the amino acceptor. In an alternative approach, we employed ATA&#8208;117&#8208;Rd11 for the asymmetric amination of the prochiral ketone precursor, which at 86% conversion gave the (R)&#8208;benzo[1,3]dioxol&#8208;5&#8208;yl&#8208;butylamine with excellent &gt;99% ee. We further evaluated the utility of Cv&#8208;ATA L59A for the asymmetric synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant (S)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylbutan&#8208;1&#8208;amine, a chiral component of the deubiquitinase inhibitor degrasyn (WP1130). The enzyme showed good tolerance to high concentrations of isopropylamine, producing (S)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylbutan&#8208;1&#8208;amine in enantiomerically pure form (&gt;99% ee).

         <title>Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenases Catalyse Steroid Nucleus Hydroxylation with Regio&#8208; and Stereo&#8208;Selectivity</title>

Abstract
Steroids are the second largest class of drugs with a wide range of pharmacological properties. Hydroxylation of steroids seriously affects their biological activities and other properties. However, steroids are mostly sp3 hybridized carbons with numerous C&#8722;H bonds far from the functional group that can activate them, and achieving regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective hydroxylation on steroids is a highly challenging task that is almost impossible to achieve using modern organic synthesis techniques. Interestingly, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases possess the ability to catalyse regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective oxidations of nonactivated C&#8722;H bonds in complex organic molecules under mild conditions. This review summarizes the P450s identified and engineered in recent years that can catalyse steroid nucleus hydroxylation stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectively.

Abstract
C&#8208;Aryl glycoside is a class of structural motifs with important medicinal value. Herein, a remote C&#8722;H glycosylation strategy enabled by Ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed with mostly &#945;&#8208;stereoselectivity is described. This approach exhibits great functional group compatibility with various glycosides and arylamides. A series of experiments provided strong evidence for the free radical mechanism and reversible C&#8722;H activation process, and a possible mechanism was proposed.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalysis Enabling &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Ketones by Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones utilizing a secondary alcohol has been accomplished by an isolable, bench&#8208;stable, inexpensive nickel catalyst affording high yields of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted products. This report contributes a nickel catalyst in the pool of a few scarce examples of base metal discovered for this purpose. The substrate scope can span a wide range including aliphatic, alicyclic, and cyclic secondary alcohols. Functionalization of a cholesterol molecule is also possible following this methodology. The catalyst can interconvert between azo and hydrazo form in a reversible fashion to enable this chemical transformation.

&lt;p&gt;The &#945;-alkylation of ketones utilizing a secondary alcohol has been accomplished by an isolable, bench-stable, inexpensive nickel catalyst affording high yields of &#946;,&#946;-disubstituted products. This report contributes a nickel catalyst in the pool of a few scarce examples of base metal discovered for this purpose. The substrate scope can span a wide range including aliphatic, alicyclic, and cyclic secondary alcohols. Functionalization of a cholesterol molecule is also possible following this methodology. The catalyst can interconvert between azo and hydrazo form in a reversible fashion to enable this chemical transformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot strategy for the synthesis of 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;furylisoindolinone derivatives is reported. The reaction proceeds via a copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cascade inter&#8208;molecular double cyclization of 2&#8208;iodobenzamide derivatives and propargyl dicarbonyl compounds in the presence of oxygen. The strategy involves several reactions including cyclization/coupling/double C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization in a cascade manner. A wide range of 2&#8208;iodobenzamide substrates containing different substituents as well as various propargyldicarbonyl compounds and propargylsulfonyl aryl ketones can be used to access a variety of 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;furylisoindolinone derivatives.

         <title>Dual Photoredox and Nickel Catalysed Reductive Coupling of Alkynes and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A regioselective vinylation of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes promoted by the merging of photoredox and nickel catalysis is here reported. A comprehensive investigation on the reaction conditions allowed the disclosure of a valid and reproducible protocol based on a nickel&#8208;mediated reductive coupling approach under visible light irradiation. The employment of 3CzClIPN (2,4,6&#8208;tris(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;5&#8208;chloro&#8208;isophthalonitrile) as the photocatalyst and Hantzsch's ester as the sacrificial organic reductant replace the use of boron&#8208;, silicon&#8208; or zinc&#8208;based reducing agents, making this method a worthy alternative to the already known protocols. The developed mild reaction conditions allow the access to a wide range of substituents decorating both the aldehyde and the alkyne. Moreover, careful photophysical investigations shed light on the mechanism of the reaction.

         <title>Electrochemical [3+2] Cycloaddition of Anilines and 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds: Construction of Multisubstituted Indoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Indoles, especially multisubstituted ones, are privileged scaffolds found widely in natural products, bioactive molecules, fine chemicals, and organic functional materials. Although several intramolecular electrochemical cyclization reactions of vinyl anilines to construct indoles have been reported in recent years, the intermolecular process between simple anilines and other readily available synthons, even though dominant, remains relatively unexplored. Herein, we report the intermolecular electro&#8208;oxidative cycloaddition of anilines and commercially available 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. This method provides an alternative route for the synthesis of a broad range of multisubstituted indoles without a transition&#8208;metal catalyst or external chemical oxidant.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidation&#8208;Induced Oxyphosphorylation of Alkenes and Alkynes with Water via Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>

Abstract
A metal&#8208; and exogenous&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free oxidation&#8208;induced oxyphosphorylation of alkenes and alkynes with water for &#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates has been developed through the radical coupling under electrochemical conditions. This protocol is compatible with a wide range of alkenes, alkynes, and diarylphosphorus derivatives, and enables the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of &#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates. The mechanistic study revealed that the P radicals were generated via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) event jointly mediated by tetrabutylammonium acetate and anode oxidation process.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed domino cyclization/direct aminosulfonylation of aryl iodides with amines via the insertion of SO2 (from SOgen) was presented. This method could produce a series of oxindole&#8208;based sulfonamides in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields. A scale&#8208;up reaction and two synthetic applications demonstrated the robustness and practicality of this transformation.

         <title>Cu(I) Mediated Azidation of Halobenzenes, and Cu Catalysed Selective Azide Reduction to Corresponding Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Aryl amines are synthesized from halobenzenes via copper mediated reactions employing sodium azide under mild conditions in ethanol/water. The reaction proceeds stepwise via the aryl azide, which is reduced to the corresponding amine in&#8208;situ. The methodology allows syntheses of amines from corresponding para&#8208;, meta&#8208; and ortho&#8208;bromobenzenes bearing electron withdrawing groups. Bifunctional halobenzenes bearing alkanoyl chains with terminal bromides are selectively transformed, generating an aniline and an aliphatic azide, as this azide position is stable to reduction. A one&#8208;pot multistep sequence for preparation of the target amines was designed. The azide formation is mediated by CuI while elemental Cu is generated simultaneously, which is deposited onto the employed PTFE stirring bar used in the reaction. The Cu films were quantified and analysed by SEM/EDS. The Cu, either deposited or in solution, is responsible for the azide reduction, possibly involving nitrene intermediates. An application of the modified stirring bars as a heterogeneous catalyst for a click reaction is demonstrated.

A one-pot multistep sequence for preparation of the target amines was designed. The azide formation is mediated by Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; while elemental Cu is generated simultaneously, which is deposited onto the employed PTFE stirring bar used in the reaction. The Cu films were quantified and analysed by SEM/EDS. The Cu, either deposited or in solution, is responsible for the azide reduction, possibly involving nitrene intermediates. An application of the modified stirring bars as a heterogeneous catalyst for a click reaction is demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
This study reports the invention of di&#8208; or trifunctionalization of readily available pyridines (including all the pyridine substrates utilized in this paper, such as 3&#8208;cyanopyridine and 3&#8208;chloropyridine) through dearomative functionalization&#8208;oxidative rearomatization under transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and reductant&#8208;free conditions. Although a two&#8208;step operation is required, the crude product of the first step could be used in the next step directly. Typically, 3&#8208;&#960;&#8208;EWG pyridines undergo difunctionalization, whereas 3&#8208;&#963;&#8208;EWG pyridines participate in trifunctionalization, affording multisubstituted piperidines. Computational studies provide detailed insights for their distinct reactivity in the title reaction.

Abstract
We have developed Pd&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization reactions of a wide range of azulene&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acids with a large number of activated as well as unactivated 1,3&#8208;dienes, consequently allowing a streamlined synthetic method for the selective preparation of monosubstituted alkenyl dihydroazulenolactones and their derivatives.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Carboamination of Maleimides with Amines and &#945;&#8208;Bromo Carboxylates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative carboamination of maleimides with alkyl amines and &#945;&#8208;bromo carboxylates is described. These multicomponent reactions show good functional group compatibility and are suitable for the late&#8208;stage modification of a series of neuroprotective agents, providing a direct path for the library synthesis of 3&#8208;carbo&#8208;4&#8208;amino maleimides. The initial copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative amination of maleimides with amines to form enamines intermediate, followed by copper&#8208;catalyzed radical alkylation with &#945;&#8208;bromo carboxylate compounds, triggers a relayed catalytic reaction to achieve the carboamination process.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Iodohydrins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Iodohydrins and corresponding ethers were synthesized by an electrochemical process using inexpensive and non&#8208;toxic ammonium iodide. This transformation was applied to a panel of alkenes, giving products without the need of external hazardous oxidants, reductants or metal catalyst. This protocol showed a general efficiency to synthesize valuable iodinated molecules with yields from 19% to 90%.

Abstract
We have disclosed an alkenes dicarbofunctionalization method to introduce alkyl and electron&#8208;rich aryl across the C=C bond of styrenes under copper catalyst and oxidative conditions, leading to construct C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2)/C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds via dual C&#8722;H functionalization. This method realizes the synthesis of 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes, which are very important skeleton in natural products and drug molecules, through the grafting of electron&#8208;rich aromatics, including indoles, pyrroles, trisubstituted aromatic.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Condensation of Aryl Alkyl Ketones with o&#8208;Phenylenediamines: Access to Quinoxalines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
While elemental sulfur has been largely used as oxidant or sulfurating agent, its role as a catalyst has not been developed. We report here its catalytic activity in the oxidative condensation of o&#8208;phenylenediamines with acetophenones in DMSO to provide quinoxalines. The method was also extended to &#945;&#8208;tetralones, propiophenones (R=Me) as well as higher homologues (R=Et, n&#8208;Pr) in place of acetophenones, leading to a wide range of naphthoquinoxalines and 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;arylquinoxalines.

         <dc:description>The iridium/f&#8208;diaphos L2 or L9 catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of &#946;&#8208;aryl &#946;&#8208;keto amides (esters), and &#946;&#8208;amino ketones to afford two enantiomers of the desired chiral alcohols was realized with 90%&#8208;99% yield and 73%&#8208;99% ee. This protocol could be easily conducted on gram scale in the presence of low catalyst loading (up to 9900 TON). Moreover, the hydrogenated products are versatile building blocks for a variety of biologically active molecules and drugs, such as Fluoxetine, Dapoxetine and so on.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent renewed interest towards mono&#8208;fluoromethylation chemistry &#8211; somehow less developed than analogous well&#8208;established trifluoro&#8208; and difluoro&#8208;methylation tactics &#8211; identified the simple C1&#8208;building block fluoroiodomethane as an effective and versatile CH2F&#8208;delivering agent. The convenient physical state &#8211; liquid with a boiling point of 53 &#176;C &#8211; and the nowadays commercially availability, boosted in the last years the flourishing of protocols where it is used for generating the fluoromethyl group under conceptually distinct logics: electrophilic, nucleophilic and radical. Depending on the reaction conditions adopted, the reagent serves as a pluripotent precursor of variously functionalized CHF&#8208;fragments, thus considerably simplifying the installation of the motif into organic skeletons. A critical analysis of the applications found by the reagent in the literature (mainly) published in the last 5 years, is provided with vistas to its employment in the preparation of drug molecules (and thereof precursors).</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances for Alkylation of Ketones and Secondary Alcohols using Alcohols in Homogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The alkylation of ketones or secondary alcohols using alcohols as alkylating agents via hydrogen borrowing strategy presents a powerful method for the synthesis of &#593;&#8208;alkylated ketones. In this review, we summarize the progress catalyzed by Ir, Pd, Rh, Ru, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu catalysts for the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones with alcohols and cross&#8208;coupling of secondary alcohols with alcohols from 2017 to 2021. A wide range of ketones (aromatic and aliphatic ketones) and alcohols (benzylic and aliphatic primary alcohols, aromatic and aliphatic secondary alcohols, alkenyl alcohols, and diols) are well tolerated. Furthermore, we also discuss current challenges and propose perspectives on the coming development in this filed. The objective of the present review is to give an overview on recent advances for &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones with alcohols and &#946;&#8208;alkylation of secondary alcohols with alcohols. Finally, we hope that this review will give inspirations on alkylation of ketones or secondary alcohols with alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Asymmetric Allylic Amination with Pyridones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
We report herein a catalytic synthetic method for enantioenriched N&#8208;substituted pyridones. By employing chiral iridium catalyst generated from the Carreira [P/olefin] ligand, intermolecular asymmetric allylic amination of allyl alcohols with pyridones proceeded smoothly with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities (&gt;19:1 N/O, &gt;19:1 b/l and &#8805;89% ee). The reaction was a kinetic resolution process under mild conditions and displayed a broad substrate scope for both pyridones and allylic alcohols. The potential of this method was demonstrated by a gram&#8208;scale reaction with only 0.6&#8197;mol% catalyst loading and diverse transformations of the amination products to useful skeletons.

         <title>Insight into the Stereocontrol of DNA Polymerase&#8208;Catalysed Reaction by Chiral Cobalt Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Enantiomers of chiral substances typically have distinct biological activities, thus, the explorations of biochemical processes at the enantiomeric level has very high significance. This study investigated DNA polymerase&#8211;catalyzed reaction modulated by various types of chiral cobalt complexes. The experimental data showed that polymerase reactions were inhibited or accelerated in the presence of K[Co(edta)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O or [Co(en)3]I3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O. More importantly, the stereocontrol of bioreactivity was found to be different for the enantiomers, which was reflected in their ability to bind to the polymerase reaction system. The docking simulation illustrated that the acceleration or inhibition of polymerase reaction could be correlated with diverse electrostatic energy induced by the attached metal chelates, whereas the different stereocontrol of bioreactivity for the enantiomers was attributed to a discrepancy of Van der Waals interactions between the enantiomer and polymerase catalytic sites.

         <title>Synthesis of Saturated N&#8208;Heterocycles via a Catalytic Hydrogenation Cascade</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Saturated N&#8208;heterocycles are prominent motifs found in various natural products and pharmaceuticals. Despite the increasing interest in this class of compounds, the synthesis of saturated bicyclic azacycles requires tedious multi&#8208;step syntheses. Herein, we present a one&#8208;pot protocol for the synthesis of octahydroindoles, decahydroquinolines, and octahydroindolizines through a cascade reaction.

We have developed a method for constructing tricyclic [1,2&#8208;a]indoles via nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular imine&#8208;alkene coupling reactions. This method enables syntheses of 6&#8208;5&#8208;5 and 6&#8208;5&#8208;6 tricyclic [1,2&#8208;a]indoles. The use of NIXantphos or DPPPent as a ligand and 4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid as a co&#8208;catalyst is crucial for the reaction. The synthetic utility of the method was demonstrated by converting the product into useful indole amines.

         <title>Ylide&#8208;Functionalized Diisopropyl Phosphine (prYPhos): A Ligand for Selective Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Couplings of Aryl Chlorides</title>

Abstract
The ylide&#8208;functionalized diisopropyl phosphine (prYPhos) promotes Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings of aryl chlorides and bromides with arylboronic acids. Using Pd2(dba)3/prYPhos as the catalyst and K2CO3 as the base, various (hetero)biaryls were synthesized in 45&#8211;98% yields at mild reaction conditions, tolerating sensitive functional groups and steric hindrance. The electron rich, sterically demanding ligand induces a high selectivity for halides versus triflate. Chloroaryl triflates were selectively coupled at the chloride, leaving inherently more reactive triflate groups in place.

Abstract
A ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of allenoates with arylamines has been developed. This strategy provides an approach to synthesize E&#8208;allylic amines in good yields with high atom&#8208;economy and high levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and E&#8208;selectivities with a broad substrate scope.

         <title>Diarylprolinol with Trifluoromethyl Substituents and Diphenylprolinol&#8208;Derived Perfluoroalkanesulfonamide as Organocatalysts in the Cross&#8208;Aldol Reaction of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The asymmetric cross&#8208;aldol reaction of two different aldehydes is a synthetically relevant reaction. Diarylprolinol catalyst with trifluoromethyl substituents and sulfonamide catalyst derived from diphenylprolinol are organocatalysts for the cross&#8208;aldol reaction. The reactivity and stereoselectivity of these two catalysts were compared in the asymmetric cross&#8208;aldol reactions of propanal and acetaldehyde as nucleophilic aldehydes and several electrophilic aldehydes. Depending on the electrophilic aldehydes, the preferable catalyst differs. By the proper selection of these two catalysts, potentially synthetically useful chiral building blocks can be synthesized with diastereoselectivities of anti:syn=2.6:1&#8764;&gt;20:1 and enantioselectivities of 60&#8764;&gt;98% ee.

         <title>Diastereospecific Enantiodivergent Allylation of Pyrazolones as an Entry to &#946;&#8208;Aminoamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A diastereospecific enantiodivergent allylation of pyrazolones is reported which is catalyzed by a planar chiral pentaphenylferrocene based palladacycle. With the same catalyst batch both product enantiomers were selectively available. The method is applicable to structurally diverse substrates and gave products with enantiomeric excesses between 85 and 94%. In addition, we could show that pyrazolones are transformable into &#946;&#8208;aminoamides.
