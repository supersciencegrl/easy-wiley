         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we reported the straightforward synthesis of thiomethylnaphthalenes via the reaction of propargyl alcohols with DMSO/SOCl2, which also provided easy access to deuterated thiomethyl and other thioalkyl scaffolds when deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide and dialkyl sulfoxides were used, respectively. In addition, the thiomethyl group can be readily derivatized to the corresponding sulfoxide, sulfone, and sulfoximine of interesting photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Tropone hydrazides in [10+2]&#8208;hetero&#8208;higher&#8208;order cycloaddition for the synthesis of tetrahydropyridazine derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[10+2]&#8208;Hetero&#8208;higher&#8208;order cycloaddition between tropone hydrazides (acting as 10&#960;&#8208;components) and 3&#8208;alkylidene oxindoles (acting as 2&#960;&#8208;components) has been established. Under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis the reaction proceeded in a fully peri&#8208; and diastereoselective manner with the stereochemical outcome governed mainly by electronic interactions. Following such a strategy, a series of structurally diverse tetrahydropyridazines were prepared in 30&#8208;70% yields. Furthermore, the potential of the obtained cycloadducts has been confirmed in selected chemoselective transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemically Induced Approaches to the Syntheses of &#946;&#8208;Lactams</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactam scaffolds is of paramount importance due to their extensive applications in pharmaceuticals, particularly as antibiotics. Visible light photocatalysis has emerged as a revolutionary approach in this domain, providing a sustainable and efficient pathway for &#946;&#8208;lactam construction. In this review, we meticulously discuss the recent developments in the synthesis of photocatalysed &#946;&#8208;lactam frameworks.A key focus is the Staudinger reaction, traditionally a cornerstone in &#946;&#8208;lactam synthesis, and its adaptation to visible light photocatalysis. We explore the mechanistic intricacies of the Staudinger reaction under photochemical conditions, along with other pivotal cyclization strategies enabled by visible light. By illuminating the novel photocatalytic routes to &#946;&#8208;lactams, this review provides a thorough understanding of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques and sets the stage for future innovations in the green synthesis of these critical compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Mediated Cascade Reaction of CF3&#8208;Imidoyl Sulfoxonium Ylides and Diimides for the Synthesis of Functionalized Amidines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A base&#8208;mediated cascade reaction of CF3&#8208;imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides (TFISYs) and diimides has been developed for the preparation of functionalized amidines. In the transformation, a cascade nucleophilic addition and subsequent [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of sulfoxonium ylide occur to enable an intramolecular migration of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The unexpected result of the developed protocol demonstrates the chameleonic reactivity of TFISYs.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Functionalization of C60 with Vinylallenes Generated in situ by Rhodium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of fullerenes is important for several reasons, primarily related to enhancing their chemical reactivity, solubility, and potential of applications in optoelectronics and biomedicine. In this study, we present a novel approach to functionalize C60 through a cascade process encompassing an unprecedented Rh&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1,6&#8208;allenynes to in situ generate a vinylallene that is followed by a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with pristine fullerene, resulting in the formation of 6,6&#8208;fused bicyclic fullerene derivatives. The mechanism governing this process was elucidated by DFT calculations and confirmed by deuterium labelling and control experiments, demonstrating the critical role of traces of water in the reaction medium to mediate the observed reactivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With a number of biologically active members, 2&#8208;aroylchromones are valuable synthetic targets. A direct route towards 2&#8208;aroylchromones from 2&#8208;(methylsulfonyl)chromones and aldehydes via NHC&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;C bond formation was developed. Yields of the synthesized 2&#8208;aroylchromones were up to 85%. Chromones with angioprotective or antibacterial properties were easily synthesized using the method developed. Additionally, the synthetic utility of the afforded chromones was demonstrated by using them to synthesize the anticancer compound wrightiadione and analogues of it.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Bicyclo[3.3.0]octanes represent crucial structural motifs found in various bioactive natural compounds. In this study, we present the first metal&#8208;free formal [3 + 2] cycloadditions of alkyne&#8208;tethered cyclopropyl ketones via pyridine&#8208;boryl radical catalysis, affording bicyclo[3.3.0]octanes with high efficiency and broad substrate scope. This reaction features the generation of ketyl radical by pyridine&#8208;boryl radical and a consecutive 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig and 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cascade process.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted, nitrogen&#8208;centered radical&#8208;initiated trifunctionalization of 5&#8208;hexenenitriles via diamidation and 1,4&#8208;cyano migration, using 1 mol% fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)&#8323; as the photoredox catalyst, is reported. In this protocol, the O&#8208;acylhydroxylamine derivative acts as a bifunctional reagent, and the carbonitrile solvent also participates in the reaction. This transformation proceeds at room temperature without the need for an external oxidant or reductant, yielding a wide range of functionalized &#946;&#8208;amino nitriles, including the derivatives of natural products and pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergent C&#8211;H Alkynylation of 2&#8208;Pyridylthiophenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Di&#64256;erent catalysts are presented to overcome or augment a substrate&#8217;s innate regioselectivity. Rhodium was found to overcome the innate C3&#8208;selectivity &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; chelation&#8208;assisted rhodation. Conversely, palladium was found to enhance the innate C5&#8208;selectivity &lt;i&gt;via &lt;/i&gt;electrophilic palladation. These reactions allow for the formation of a diverse range of synthetically versatile C3&#8208; and C5&#8208;alkynylated products from 2&#8208;pyridylthiophenes. Notably, this strategy was successfully employed in the straightforward synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended functionalized 2&#8208;pyridylthiophenes, which could be converted into more valuable compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we reported the photocatalytic synthesis of 3&#8208;silyl coumarins using hydrosilanes as the silyl radical source with aryl alkynoates. Readily prepared N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts act as hydrogen atom transfer reagents for generating silyl radicals under photoredox catalysis. The reaction proceeds through silyl radical addition to alkyne followed by radical cascade cyclization/migration with subsequent oxidation and aromatization to give desired 3&#8208;silyl coumarins in 34% to 89% yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Vinylation of Phosphines with Sulfones and Alcohols
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a manganese&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component vinylation strategy for the synthesis of vinylphosphines from readily available alcohols, sulfones, and phosphines via acceptorless dehydrogenative strategy. This multi&#8208;component, four&#8208;stage, one&#8208;pot protocol offers a stereoselective approach, overcoming the challenges associated with achieving these products through the hydrophosphination of terminal alkynes. The reaction utilizes sulfones and common alcohols to access both (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;substituted vinylphosphines (using methanol) and &#945;&#8208;substituted vinylphosphines (using primary alcohols) in yields ranging from 52% to 99%, with E:Z stereoselectivity of 95:5 to 99:1. Importantly, the synthesized branched&#8208;substituted vinylphosphines exhibited superior ligand performance in the copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl bromides with pyrazole compared to the commercially available PPh3 and diphenyl(vinyl)phosphane.</dc:description>

Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of azafluoranthene derivatives under mild conditions via [2+2+2] cycloaddition of 1,6&#8208;diynes and nitriles catalyzed by CoBr2/dppp, exhibiting good atom economy. This procedure uses an inexpensive ligand and an earth&#8208;abundant metal as catalyst to lower the cost of synthesis. Several azafluoranthenes are produced in 28&#8211;95% yields using this approach, featuring mild conditions, wide substrate scope, and good functional group tolerance. The fluorescence spectra of some azafluoranthenes indicate that these scaffolds have good photophysical properties for material science.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of azafluoranthene derivatives under mild conditions &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; [2+2+2] cycloaddition of 1,6-diynes and nitriles catalyzed by CoBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/dppp, exhibiting good atom economy. This procedure uses an inexpensive ligand and an earth-abundant metal as catalyst to lower the cost of synthesis. Several azafluoranthenes are produced in 28&#8211;95% yields using this approach, featuring mild conditions, wide substrate scope, and good functional group tolerance. The fluorescence spectra of some azafluoranthenes indicate that these scaffolds have good photophysical properties for material science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A convenient cyano source for the nucleophilic 1,4&#8208;addition to enones and 1,2&#8208;addition to imines has been developed, by generating the cyano unit in&#8197;situ. via the TCT&#8208;assisted dehydration of formamide. This protocol distinguishes itself by transition&#8208;metal/ligand free conditions, compatibility with 1,4&#8208;/1,2&#8208;addition, readily available substrates and versatile synthetic utilities of the cyanated products.

Abstract
The oxaspiro&#8208;phthalides ([n,5]&#8208;oxaspirobenzalactones) bearing a phthalide spirofused to a cyclic&#8208;ether of various sizes are frameworks found in bioactive natural products. The discovery and development of an alkynyl&#8208;Prins cyclization based, strategy for the construction of structurally interesting, medicinally useful [5,5]&#8208;[6,5]&#8208;, and [7,5]&#8208;oxaspirophthalides is reported in this manuscript. Our strategy represents a report on the construction of oxaspiro&#8208;phthalides using the alkynyl&#8208;Prins cyclization. This approach exhibits broad substrate scope with respect to carbonyl compounds and 2&#8208;(alkynol)benzoates, with yields ranging between 43&#8211;98%. Isolation of intermediate, and further conversion of it to the end&#8208;product supported the proposed mechanistic pathway.

Abstract
An enantioselective tandem sequence that comprises a cycloaromatization process followed by an intramolecular desymmetrizing Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of functionalized cyclohexadienones has been accomplished. The process takes place in good yields (65&#8211;95%), with excellent diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1) and enantiomeric ratios up to 90.5:9.5 in the presence of (R)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived N&#8208;triflyl phosphoramides, and it gains access to a family of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives in a simple manner, with the simultaneous generation of two vicinal stereocenters, one of them a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter.

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot method has been developed for synthesizing diverse substituted 5&#8208;aminotetrazoles via the electrochemically induced desulfurizative addition&#8211;cyclization of thioureas with azidotrimethylsilane. This methodology enables the construction of C&#8722;N and N&#8722;N bonds under mild reaction conditions without transition metal catalysts or external oxidizing agents. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated by its broad substrate scope, compatibility with various functional groups, scalability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and practicality evidenced by the synthesis of an antibacterial agent.

Abstract
Another class of gold(I) redox&#8208;switchable catalysts, incorporating ferrocenyl phosphane&#8208;imines, enriches the existing library of gold(I) complexes. Our catalyst proves efficacy in gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations of furans and benzamides, exhibiting reversible &#8220;on&#8208;off&#8221; switching.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another class of gold(I) redox-switchable catalysts, incorporating ferrocenyl phosphane-imines, enriches the existing library of gold(I) complexes. Our catalyst proves efficacy in gold(I)-catalyzed cyclizations of furans and benzamides, exhibiting reversible &#8220;on-off&#8221; switching. Furthermore, we explored the unconventional role of &#8220;Magic Blue&#8221;, commonly used as an oxidizing agent in various organic transformations, as a potential activator of the Au&#8722;Cl bond, initiating conventional gold(I) catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted chemodivergent phosphorylation&#8208;peroxidation and oxyphosphorylation of alkenes with phosphine oxides and HOOtBu was realized under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. Using the commercially available Eosin Y as a SET&#8208;photocatalyst, the &#946;&#8208;peroxy&#8208;phosphine oxides were selectively obtained with a catalytic amount of base, while the addition of acid led to the exclusive formation of &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;phosphine oxides control experiments showed that Eosin Y could also act as a HAT&#8208;catalyst to induce the O&#8722;O bond cleavage of peroxides under acidic conditions.

         <title>Organocatalytic Regioselective Aldol Reaction of Hydroxyacetone with Aliphatic Aldehydes for the Synthesis of Linear Products</title>

Abstract
Herein, we present an organocatalyst that addresses the reactivity issue of aliphatic aldehydes with hydroxyacetone, leading to the formation of a linear product. Previous proline&#8208;based catalysts required a significant excess of hydroxyacetone and could only be applied to aromatic aldehydes. The proposed sulphonamide containing a proline moiety effectively controls the reaction, generating a new stereogenic center dependent on the catalyst&#8216;s configuration and does not require a large excess of the ketone. We demonstrated that this methodology can be effectively utilized in the synthesis of natural compounds, as confirmed by obtaining the 2&#8208;keto&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;gluconic acid (KDG) methyl ester from optically pure glyceraldehyde and protected hydroxyacetone.

Abstract
The development of novel strained spiro heterocycles (SSHs) as bioisosteres for aromatic or non&#8208;strained aliphatic rings is highly sought after for improving drug design. Their high molecular rigidity and predictable vectorization can enhance drug&#8208;likeness, target selectivity and clinical success. Towards this goal, 1&#8208;oxa&#8208;2,6&#8208;diazaspiro[3.3]heptane (ODASE) is reported as a novel potential SSH&#8208;bioisostere. We demonstrate through theoretical studies the potential of this strained spiro heterocycle to act as a bioisostere for piperazine. We have developed its synthesis from the highly strained azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl intermediate through a robust and mild flow technology&#8208;assisted two&#8208;step protocol. Its tolerance and stability towards medicinally relevant N&#8208;functionalisation protocols are studied, as well as its mild reduction to the C3&#8208;aminoalkylazetidinol motif found in the anti&#8208;cancer drug cobimetinib.

Abstract
A direct visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted radical&#8208;triggered tandem cyclization of 1,7&#8208;diene systems with cyclic sulfonium salts by using copper(I)&#8208;based complexes as photoredox catalyst is developed. With this approach, a variety of sulfur&#8208;containing polycyclic derivatives are prepared through alkylation/6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization/5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization of 1,7&#8208;diene systems under mild conditions. In addition, the photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening of cyclic sulfonium salts provides the alkyl radical intermediates, which prefers addition to the C&#8722;C double bond that connected to the aromatic ring rather than the electron&#8208;deficient vinyl in 1,7&#8208;dienes. Moreover, oxidation of the desired sulfur&#8208;containing polycyclic products provides a strategy for the preparation of remote nitrogen&#8208;fused polycyclic substituted sulfoxide or sulfone&#8208;containing derivatives.

Abstract
Organophosphorothioates are organic molecules containing sulfur and phosphorus, with significant biological activity and physicochemical properties, widely used in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, and the agrochemical industry. In particular, many phosphorothioates display a variety of biological activities, such as antifungal, antibacterial, anti&#8208;parasite, anticancer, and so on. Traditionally, the synthesis of phosphorothioates has mainly relied on indirect methods involving the construction of S&#8722;P bond. In recent years, direct phosphorothiolation has gained attention as a reliable and rapid method for introducing the &#8722;S&#8722;P(O)(OR)2 group into parent molecules. This article reviews the latest advances in direct phosphorothiolation reactions, categorized based on the different sources of the &#8722;S&#8722;P(O)(OR)2 group.

         <title>Recent Developments in Selenylation of Alkynes</title>

Abstract
Alkynes are simple yet important organic feedstocks. The selenylation of alkynes is able to produce complex selenium&#8208;containing compounds in a facile way. Although there are some reviews about the selenylation of alkynes, most of them focus on one specific reaction or what types of products that can be obtained. There is a lack of attention given to the various uses of different selenium reagents and their mechanisms. This review mainly focuses on recent advances (2013&#8211;2023) based on diverse selenium reagents. Mechanisms and how the added reagents work will be discussed. Different reaction types, including difunctionalization, Se&#8208;annulation, spiro&#8208;cyclization, C&#8722;Se coupling, click reaction will be recorded in this review. The regioselectivity can be achieved through various mechanisms, including radicals, seleniraniums or electrophilic cyclization. We hope it will do help for future research in this area.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Allylation of Cyclic Ketones with Allylic Alcohols</title>

Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric &#945;&#8208;allylation of ketones is a particularly useful tool for constructing stereocenters via C&#8722;C bond formation. However, this type of reaction often necessitated the use of activated ketones or pre&#8208;prepared enol intermediates as substrates. In this study, we developed a nickel&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;allylation of unactivated cycloketones with allylic alcohols to synthesize chiral cycloketones with an &#945;&#8208;quaternary carbon center. The reaction affords the products with 42&#8211;97% yields, 72&#8211;86% ee, and no additive is needed, and the only by&#8208;product is water.

Abstract
2&#8208;(chalcogen)benzothiazoles are frequently used as core structures for the development of pharmaceutical agents. A strategy for the synthesis of 2&#8208;(chalcogen)benzothiazoles under electrooxidative conditions using isocyanides, thiols or diselenides as substrates was developed. This protocol allows access to structurally diverse 2&#8208;(chalcogen)benzothiazoles in good yields and with good functional group tolerance, which does not require heavy metal catalysts and exogenous oxidants. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale synthesis was performed to demonstrate the scale&#8208;up applicability of this reaction.

Abstract
With triethylamine as a synthon, an alternative method for the synthesis of 3&#8208;formyl imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines has been accomplished from aldehydes, and 2&#8208;aminopyridines. The reaction proceeded via iodine&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N bond cleavage of triethylamine, generation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde in&#8197;situ, and oxidative cyclization with air as the oxygen source. This protocol may facilitate the synthesis of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives and provide a reference for the usage of triethylamine as a synthon.

Abstract
We developed a second generation of Lewis acid catalyst enabling selective and user&#8208;friendly phosphonylation of diverse alcohols. This one&#8208;pot method utilizes P(III) reagent bis(2,2,2&#8211;trifluoroethyl) phosphite under mild conditions. Exploring the influence of metal selection in Lewis acid catalysts revealed four highly active complexes for alcohol phosphonylation: Zn(II), Al(III), Zr(IV), and Hf(IV). Notably, Hf(IV) displayed superior selectivity compared to the previously developed Zn(II) catalyst.

Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive alkylative cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes with alkyl bromides has been developed. This transformation avoids the use of stoichiometric organometallic reagents and introduces alkyl groups regio&#8208; and stereoselectively into the products. This method provides a platform for the synthesis of carbo&#8208; and heterocycles that are widely found in many natural products and biologically active molecules.

Abstract
Whilst catalytic ketone allylation using palladium(0) is well&#8211;precedented, nickel(0)&#8208;catalysed equivalents of such reactions remain scarce. We report here the first nickel&#8208;catalysed allylation of ketones which uses an easily handled and inexpensive bench&#8208;stable Ni(II) pre&#8208;catalyst. This method avoids generation of stoichiometric by&#8208;products via the use of readily available allyl alcohols, rather than the esters or related derivatives which are often used in such transformations. Under the optimised conditions, 25 monoallylated ketones were obtained in 16% to 98% yield and with high selectivity for the linear (E)&#8208;isomers.

Abstract
Pyridine&#8208;directed regioselective C&#8722;H hydroxymethylation to pyridones and isoquinolones using para&#8208;formaldehyde has been developed under manganese catalysis, offering a wide variety of hydroxymethylated products in 40&#8211;85% yields. This operationally simple methodology proceeds in one step using an earth&#8208; abundant first&#8208;row transition metal&#8208;catalyst without the generation of unwanted salt wastes. A mechanistic study revealed that the C&#8722;H metalation step is reversible but not the rate&#8208;determining step. The introduction of hydroxymethyl group in the biologically relevant scaffolds could be used as an intermediate for valuable synthetic transformations.

Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive amidation of aryl sulfonium salts with isocyanates for amide synthesis via C&#8722;S bond cleavage was developed. The reactions proceeded smoothly at ambient temperature in the presence of nickel catalyst and manganese metal in DMF to give a variety of amides in moderate to good yields with wide functional group tolerance.

Abstract
A de novo synthesis of cyclobutene&#8208;fused indoline derivatives via thermally induced intramolecular cyclization was reported. This approach efficiently yields valuable high&#8208;strained cyclobute[b]indolines in moderate to high yields and enables further transformation into other valuable heterocycles, demonstrating its potential in organic synthesis.

     alt="Thermal-Induced Synthesis of Cyclobute[b]indolines via Intramolecular Formal [2+2] Cycloaddition of Enamines and Triazole-Derived Ketenimines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A de novo synthesis of cyclobutene-fused indoline derivatives via thermally induced intramolecular cyclization was reported. This approach efficiently yields valuable high-strained cyclobute[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]indolines in moderate to high yields and enables further transformation into other valuable heterocycles, demonstrating its potential in organic synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we present a strategy for the visible&#8208;light&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams based on the Norrish type II reaction. This protocol uses acetonitrile as solvent and commercially available photocatalyst to drive the reaction. Notably, various challenging substrate types reported in previous studies undergo conversion. DFT calculations further elucidate the reaction mechanism, while discussing the competitiveness between [2+2] cycloaddition and the Norrish II reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of &lt;i&gt;Ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Halogen&#8208;Substituted Aryl(alkynyl)phosphinates via Aryne&#8208;Phosphite&#8208;Haloalkyne Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The one&#8208;pot formation of two C&#8211;P bonds and one C&#8211;halogen bond was achieved through a mild three&#8208;component coupling reaction utilizing arynes, phosphites, and haloalkynes.  In this reaction, the aryl anion, generated from the nucleophilic addition of phosphite to aryne, directly attacked the halogen of the haloalkyne.  The reaction proceeded smoothly with a wide substrate scope and good functional group tolerance.  This operationally simple method enables direct access to ortho&#8208;halogen&#8208;substituted aryl(alkynyl)phosphinates.  The synthetic utility of ortho&#8208;halogen&#8208;substituted aryl(alkynyl)phosphinates with prospective applications in natural product synthesis, medicinal chemistry, and materials chemistry has also been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Pharmaceutically prospective 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethyloxazoles are synthesized in up to 58% yield via unprecedented cascade assembly of one molecule of primary amide with two molecules of acetylene gas in the KOH/MeOH/DMSO (90 oC, 2 h) catalytic triad.

         <title>Asymmetric [3+3] Cycloaddition of N&#8208;Vinyl Oxindole Nitrones with 2&#8208;Indolylmethanols to Prepare Spirooxindole[1,2]oxazines</title>

Abstract
We describe a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed asymmetric [3+3] cycloaddition of N&#8208;viny oxindole nitrones with 2&#8208;indolylmethanols to prepare various spirooxindole[1,2]oxazines in 43&#8211;93% yields and 88:12&#8211;97:3 enantiomeric ratios. Experimental results revealed that the addition of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) played important roles to help CPA control the reaction reactivity and enantioselectivity. The present method features the construction of a tetrasubstituted chiral carbon stereocenter and the example of N&#8208;vinyl nitrones in asymmetric [3+3] cycloaddition.

         <dc:description>A visible light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed bifunctionalization of styrenes with malonic esters and CO2 to form two C(sp3)&#8211;C bonds has been developed.

         <title>Synthesis of rutaecarpine analogues by borrowing hydrogen strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of rutaecarpine analogues were synthesized in 11&#8211;90% yields via an iron (II) phthalocyanine&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;alkylation reaction of 3&#8208;hydroxyethyl quinazolinone&#8208;linked indole. Mechanistic investigation revealed that the formation of C&#8208;N bonds in the cyclization reaction occurs through intramolecular borrowing hydrogen annulation. The crucial intermediates in this process were verified by LC&#8208;MS analysis and DFT calculations, further supporting the proposed mechanism. Furthermore, biological evaluation demonstrated that some of the synthesized rutaecarpine analogues exhibited good anti&#8208;inflammatory activity.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral C&#8208;Glycosyl amino acids are prevalent structural motifs found in pharmaceuticals and natural products, making them a significant dimension for exploration in modern pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. However, the current synthesis methods for these compounds face numerous environmental and practical challenges, highlighting the critical need to establish more sustainable approaches. Herein, we report a simple and powerful strategy for the stereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;glycoamino acids. This method features the design and use of (&#8208;)/(+)&#8208;camphorsultam as an ideal chiral auxiliary, shielding one prochiral face of the glycine &#945;&#8208;carbon efficiently and imposing a high kinetic barrier for the epimerization of thus&#8208;generated chiral &#945;&#8208;carbon that two configuration products of R and S could be achieved independently. It proceeds under mild conditions, shows broad scope, and allows for the direct stereoselective glycosylation without metal and chiral ligand.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We, herein, report a base free, photocatalytic decyanation of &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles. A range of amides and lactams were obtained in 52&#8208;95% yields. Control experiments indicate O2 as an amide/lactam oxygen source and the reaction (lactam formation) follows radical pathway via dioxetanimine species. This methodology also applied for &#945;&#8208;ester/aldehyde substituted pyrrolidines in the presence of a base, probably via decarboxylation pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiocarbonyl&#8208;Directed Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;H Silylation of Indoles and Pyrroles with Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, hydrogen&#8208;acceptor&#8208;free C2&#8208;selective iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H silylation of indoles and pyrroles with hydrosilanes via C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H bond activation to generate the desired silylated products is presented. The developed protocol allows for the C&#8211;H silylation of a wide range of functionalized indoles with monohydrosilanes under iridium catalysis. Significantly, this process represents a rare silylation of C&#8211;H bonds using &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;directing groups.

         <title>Recyclable All&#8208;in&#8208;one Organo&#8208;Photo&#8208;Auxiliaries Enabling (sp3)C&#8211;(sp3)C Coupling Reactions with Diverse Functionalities
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical C&#8211;C coupling reactions can be tailored to environmentally benign industrial chemical processes and preparations of valuable pharmaceuticals. Yet, recent approaches in this area are limited to using precious transition metal coordination complexes that facilitate light absorption and redox processes with benchtop chemicals. Herein, we propose a new paradigm that involves all&#8208;in&#8208;one organo&#8208;photo&#8208;auxiliaries, thio&#8208;heteroarenes, which exhibit unique photophysical properties. These thio&#8208;heteroarenes were employed to prepare several all&#8208;in&#8208;one ionic photo&#8208;salts from commercially available alkyl/benzyl and heterocyclic halides via aromaticity&#8208;mediated nucleophilic substitution reactions. From the library of &gt; 30 salts, we performed on&#8208;demand photochemical C&#8211;C coupling reactions to isolate numerous symmetrical and unsymmetrical diary/alkyl&#8208;ethanes with yields up to 84% and mass balance as high as 96%. We also investigated the influence of structural features/properties on the outcomes of the photochemical C&#8211;C coupling reactions. The current photochemical C&#8211;C method was successful in the isolation of &gt;30 photoproducts, including the natural product Brittonin A, a precursor of Imipramine, and derivatives of the bioactive Honokiol Analogues. Furthermore, transient absorption spectroscopy and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations were used to decipher the nature of light&#8208;promoted electronic transitions. The present research opens new avenues in sustainable photochemical C&#8211;C coupling reactions to afford valuable compounds and bioactive systems while avoiding the use of precious metals&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Cyclization of 2&#8208;(Alkynylaryl)acetonitriles and Amines: Access to 3&#8208;Hydroxyisoindolinones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe an approach to the synthesis of 3&#8208;hydroxyisoindolinone derivatives via copper&#8208;catalyzed tandem cyclization of 2&#8208;(alkynylaryl)acetonitriles and amines. This reaction is compatible with 2&#8208;(alkynylaryl)acetonitriles and primary alkyl amines  containing various functional groups, providing the corresponding 3&#8208;hydroxyindolinone derivatives with yields ranging from 44% to 82% (medium to good yields). Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction involves oxidation of the benzylic carbon, amide formation, hydration of the alkyne and intramolecular cyclization to produce various 3&#8208;hydroxyisoindolinones. The practicality of the strategy was further demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis, late&#8208;stage functionalizations, and the post modification of natural products.</dc:description>

Abstract
The synthesis of substituted 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones has attracted considerable attention due to the frequent presence of the indole nucleus in numerous natural products and biologically active molecules. Herein, a direct access to 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones through copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative intramolecular cyclization of N&#8208;(2&#8208;acetylphenyl)picolinamide has been developed. This method exhibits good functional group tolerance, atom&#8208;economy and avoids the pre&#8208;functionalization of substrates.

         <title>Solvent&#8208; and Temperature&#8208;Switched Chemoselectivity: Controlled Synthesis of Diverse Pyrazolo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Divergent synthesis of two types of functionalized pyrazolo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines was established via a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol involving a tunable dehydrogenation process and deacylative oxidation accompanied by elimination of the HNO2 pathway. Key attributes of the procedure included the initial formation of C,N&#8208;cyclic&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;acyl azomethine imines and subsequent switchable chemoseletivity that either led to aroyl&#8208; and nitro&#8208;substituted pyrazolo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines or proceeded via deacylative oxidation and elimination of HNO2 pathway to afford solvent and temperature used. The present approach features the use of readily available amines and aldehydes as raw materials, switchable chemoselectivity, wide functional group tolerance such as nitro, halide, aryl, aroyl and sulfonyl group, and easy separation and purification. A combination of control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided important insights into the possible mechanism.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Aerobic oxidative tandem C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H imination and amination between pyridylmethane and aminomethane derivatives was demonstrated using a flavin&#8211;iodine&#8208;coupled catalyst. This method provides a simple and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of various 1,3&#8208;substituted imidazo[1,5&#8208;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyridines with fluorescent properties. The flavin&#8211;iodine catalyst efficiently promoted multiple reactions, including the oxygenation of pyridylmethane and subsequent oxidative C&#8211;N bond formation, utilizing only molecular oxygen, which is a sustainable ideal oxidant. The resulting 1&#8208;ester&#8208;substituted imidazo[1,5&#8208;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyridine derivatives exhibited dual&#8208;state emission in both solution and solid states. In particular, imidazo[1,5&#8208;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyridine with a bulky 2,6&#8208;dichlorophenyl substituent showed an apparent blue emission with good photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields (0.49 in CH2Cl2 solution and 0.39 in the solid state), making it promising candidate for use in optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

Abstract
Complexes cis&#8208;[Pd(ArF)2(NCMe)2] (A) and cis&#8208;[Pd(ArF)2(THF)2] (B) (ArF=C6F3H2) are fast general precursors easy to prepare, store and handle, which allow in&#8197;situ synthesis of tailor&#8208;made [Pd(Ar)(X)(L)] catalysts for chosen Ar&#8208;Nu couplings, provided that the L ligand (in this case PR2(2&#8208;biaryl)) induces (ArF)2 coupling. This fluorinated byproduct is inert in the reaction conditions, and no other byproduct is expected because the Ar and X groups are the same in the catalyst, the intermediates and the products. The application of A or B in catalysis (e.&#8201;g. with 1% catalyst) consists of a first step (formation of 1% tailor&#8208;made catalyst) where 100 ArX+1&#8197;A (or B)+1&#8197;L in THF gives a solution with 99 ArX+1 [Pd(Ar)(X)(L)]+(ArF)2. The only other byproduct is THF or NCMe. In the second step, addition of the nucleophile, 100 Q(Nu), triggers and completes the catalytic cycle yielding 100 Ar&#8208;Nu+100 Q(X)+1 [Pd0(L)]. The 100% yield is theoretical, but the tested catalysis (Ar&#8208;Me Negishi coupling, C6F5&#8208;alkynyl Stille coupling and Ar&#8208;naphthyl Suzuki coupling) using A as precursor, SPhos as ligand, and 1000:1 reagents:catalyst ratio, afford 95&#8211;99% yield. In contrast, aryl&#8208;amination requires 1000:5 ratio to give 96% yield (or 1000:50 for 99% yield) because PhNH2 eventually displaces the SPhos from Pd and blocks the catalyst. As a bonus, the presence of F in the precursors facilitates stepwise 19F NMR monitoring of the formation of [Pd(Ar)(X)(L)] with different phosphines, facilitating analysis of weaknesses or strengths of each of them to produce the catalyst, and helps in the choice of the most convenient one for the case. The in&#8197;situ catalyst formation is ideal for serial two&#8208;step catalysis with different phosphines or different nucleophiles.

         <title>Enzymatic Dimerization of Fungal Natural Products Through Intermolecular Disulfide Bridges</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The biosynthetic pathway for the production of natural products from various species often include a dimerization step which increases the structural variability and range of biological activities. These dimerization reactions are highly interesting for biocatalytic applications. Epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) are an important class of natural products whose potent bioactivities rely on disulfide bridges. ETPs often carry a transannular disulfide bridge and can be linked through C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds to form dimers. In this study, we shed light on the mechanism of disulfide formation in the case of the dimeric vertihemiptellides (vhe) produced by the fungus Verticillium hemipterigenum BCC1449. These compounds feature a unique intermolecular disulfide bridge which links two monomers together. Using comparative genomics, we identified the 12&#8208;membered vhe gene cluster. In vitro assays, kinetic analysis, and protein mutagenesis, enabled us to characterize VheT, the oxidase catalyzing an intermolecular disulfide bond formation resulting in ETP dimers. We showed that the CxxC motif of VheT plays a crucial role in catalyzing this reaction. VheT is an oxidase linking natural product monomers through intermolecular S&#8722;S bridges and could be developed into a biocatalyst for thiol specific dimerization reactions.

Abstract
A Palladium catalyzed C4&#8208; alkylation of indoles using epoxide as an alkylating agent and pivaloyl as a weak chelating group has been demonstrated. A variety of substituted epoxides and indoles furnished the desired &#946;&#8208;indolylethyl alcohols in 38%&#8211;87% yields. Control experiments indicate that the C&#8722;H cleavage step is irreversible. The resultant hydroxyl group has been converted to various functional groups to demonstrate the synthetic utility of this protocol.

         <dc:description>








Abstract
Light mediated iodine&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of enaminones through C&#8722;N bond cleavage has been described. In addition to substituted ynones, diverse substituted acyclic tertiary amines, and cyclic tertiary amines were also reactive under standard conditions. Selected transformations of the coupling adduct demonstrated the latent utility of this protocol. Preliminary mechanistic studies were also conducted.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Engineering of a Short&#8208;Chain Dehydrogenase LfSDR1 for Efficient Biosynthesis of (R)&#8208;9&#8208;(2&#8208;Hydroxypropyl)adenine, the Key Intermediate of Tenofovir</title>

Abstract
(R)&#8208;9&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl) adenine ((R)&#8208;HPA) is an important intermediate for the synthesis of tenofovir and its prodrugs. Herein, structure&#8208;guided rational design of short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase LfSDR1 was adopted to improve the catalytic performance for enantioselective synthesis of (R)&#8208;HPA at high substrate loading. The crystal structures of LfSDR1 in its apo form as well as in complex with NADPH were solved, which were used for mutagenesis studies and illustration mechanism. Three residues (G92, E141 and V186) were identified as hotspots by structural analysis, and variants V186A/G92V and V186A/G92V/E141L with remarkably improved activity were obtained. By molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of WT and variants, G92V plays a key role in enzyme&#8208;substrate interaction in the binding pocket. Whole cells expressing the mutant LfSDR1&#8208;V186A/G92V and glucose dehydrogenase BsGDH from Bacillus subtilis were used as the catalyst, and up to 200&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 substrate without cosolvent was completely converted to (R)&#8208;HPA with 99.9% ee and a high space&#8208;time yield (STY) of 800&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8197;day&#8722;1. This study improves the understanding of the catalytic mechanism of LfSDR and provides a potential biocatalytic strategy for industrial synthesis of (R)&#8208;HPA.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam Reaction and Sequential [2,3]&#8208;Rearrangement to Prepare &#945;&#8208;Benzotriazinium Ketones</title>

Abstract
A variety of &#945;&#8208;benzotriazinium ketones were prepared in 38%&#8211;89% yields through a copper(II)&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam reaction and [2,3]&#8208;rearrangement in a one pot reaction open to air from N&#8208;hydroxybenzotriazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones and alkenyl boronic acids at room temperature. Experimental results showed that the copper catalyst not only played as cross&#8208;coupling catalyst but also served as Lewis acid catalyst to control the chemoselectivity of [2,3]&#8208;rearrangement. The reaction tolerated various linear and cyclic disubstituted alkenyl boronic acids. Moreover, &#945;&#8208;benzotriazinium ketone could be easily prepared in gram scales. The present method highlights dual roles of copper catalyst and [2,3]&#8208;rearrangement of N,O&#8208;vinyl moiety.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Alkyl Selenides with Aryl Bromides: Cross&#8208;Coupling Between Two Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction has been developed using two distinct electrophiles: an aryl alkyl selenide and an aryl bromide. The organoselenium compound, due to the lower bond dissociation energy of the C&#8722;Se bond, acts as a pseudohalide. This one&#8208;pot reaction proceeds by cleaving the C&#8722;Se bond, producing the desired biaryls in moderate to good yields. The use of commercially available aryl bromides eliminates the handling of pre&#8208;formed organomagnesium reagents, enhancing the practicality and applicability of this approach.

         <title>Enantioselective Addition of Thiols to Acyclic Ketiminoesters Using Cinchona Alkaloid Amide/Zinc(II) Catalysts</title>

Abstract
The first enantioselective reaction of acyclic &#945;&#8208;ketiminoesters with thiols has been developed. Good yields and enantioselectivities were obtained using our original cinchona alkaloid amide/zinc(II) catalysts. The obtained products were converted into useful chiral thiazolidines. Based on experimental results and DFT calculation, transition states were proposed to explain the stereoselectivity of the reaction.

         <title>Decarboxylative Aminomethylation of Ferulic Acids via Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Flavin Photocatalysis and its Application in the Synthesis of Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Lead Compounds</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a protocol for the direct visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted decarboxylative aminomethylation of ferulic acid with N&#8208;aryl tetrahydroisoquinolines under air atmosphere. The current protocol uses naturally available ferulic acid as coupling partner, the inexpensive organic photocatalyst riboflavin tetraacetate (RFTA) as photocatalyst and molecular oxygen as oxidant, which is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. This methodology further demonstrated its utility by the protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free semi&#8208;synthesis of natural alkaloids maclekarpine E and by assessing the anti&#8208;inflammatory activity of its analogues.

         <title>Dearomative Functionalization of Activated Quinolines: Transfer Hydrogenation/Cycloaddition Cascade to Construct &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Cascade dearomative functionalization is a robust protocol to convert flat arenes into medicinally relevant three&#8208;dimensional architectures with added new functionality. Herein, a dearomative cycloaddition protocol for synthesizing tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;embedded &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine scaffolds has been developed employing quinolinium salts and sulfonyl azides under metal&#8208;free conditions. An underexplored and mechanistically distinct pathway is unveiled, creating quaternary&#8208;center&#8208;bearing amine skeletons by an amine group migration during the transfer hydrogenation and cycloaddition cascade reaction. This approach provided a broad substrate scope of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine scaffolds from a plethora of C3&#8208;substituted quinolinium and sulfonyl azides. The post&#8208;synthetic modifications have further diversified the &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine core into interesting scaffolds. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested the involvement of aziridine ring formation for the amine migration to the C&#8208;3 position of quinoline to generate the &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine core.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Substitution Using Nucleophilic Amines: Access to Functionalized Mono&#8208; and Bis&#8208;N&#8208;Allyl Synthons</title>

Abstract
We here report a catalytic strategy to enable the decarboxylative allylic amination of vinyl cyclic carbonates using various aliphatic and nucleophilic amines. The use of a protic medium and chelating diphosphine ligands are the main drivers towards chemoselective allylic amine formation, thereby minimizing undesired ligand&#8208;driven complex speciation and aminolysis of the involved substrate. This improved approach amplifies the repertoire of allylic amine synthons that can be prepared from a variety of substrate combinations.

Abstract
Catalyst&#8208;controlled switchable (4+3) and (4+2) annulation reactions of Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates with benzofuran&#8208;derived azadienes have been established. Employing PCy3 as the catalyst, the reaction could provide a variety of synthetically useful benzofuro[3,2&#8208;b]azepines in good yields (80&#8211;92%) with excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities via (4+3) cycloaddition reactions. Whereas changing the catalyst from PCy3 to DMAP, the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities were switched to construct highly substituted spirotetrahydroquinoline scaffolds with three sequential stereocenters containing all&#8208;carbon spiro&#8208;quaternary stereocenters in excellent efficiency and diastereoselectivities (92&#8211;96% yields with all cases&gt;25:1 dr) via (4+2) annulations. In addition, the synthetic utility of this method was further showcased by gram&#8208;scale reactions and synthetic transformations of the product.

Abstract
We present a diastereoselective Au/Pd relay catalytic tandem cyclization reaction to produce dearomatic 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;7&#8208;azaspiro[4.5]decane derivatives under mild conditions. This process involves generating furan&#8208;derived azadiene from readily available enynamide, followed by a [2+4] cycloaddition with Pd&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl dipole decarboxylated from vinyl benzoxazinanone. Our method efficiently constructs the spiro[4.5]decane skeleton, achieving yields ranging from 31&#8211;97% and diastereoselectivities from 6:1 dr to &gt;20:1 dr across 34 examples. This research introduces new cycloaddition sites for azadienes as 1,2&#8208;dipoles and offers a reliable approach for constructing oxa&#8208;azaspiro[4.5]decane frameworks.

         <title>Synthesis of Aza&#8208;S(VI) Fluorides and Primary Sulfonimidamides from Sulfinylamines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aza&#8208;S(VI) fluorides are crucial compounds in the synthesis of various S(VI) derivatives, which find broad applications in drug discovery. However, the synthesis of sulfonimidoyl and sulfondiimidoyl fluorides have been relatively underexplored, often requiring lengthy reaction sequences and/or the use of hazardous gaseous reagents. In this study, we present a rapid one&#8208;pot method for producing sulfonimidoyl fluorides from sulfinylamines via a nucleophilic addition/electrophilic fluorination sequence. Similarly, sulfondiimidoyl fluorides can be synthesized using the same sequence, preceded by the formation of unsymmetrical sulfurdiimides readily generated in situ from sulfinylamines. Whereas isolation of sulfondiimidoyl fluorides was not feasible, they could be efficiently converted into primary sulfonimidamides by base hydrolysis in a one&#8208;pot process. Furthermore, we explored the reactivity of aza&#8208;S(VI) fluorides with various nucleophiles, demonstrating a versatile synthetic platform for the synthesis of aza&#8208;S(VI) compounds..</dc:description>

This approach exhibits a certain functional&#8208;group compatibility with 31 examples and affords desired products in yields of 16% to 88%.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organophosphorus compounds, especially phosphorylated heterocycles, are gaining increasing attention in the fields of materials science, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemistry due to their excellent biological activities. Consequently, the exploration of green and efficient methods for the synthesis of phosphorylated heterocycles has garnered significant interest from organic chemists. In recent years, visible light&#8208;induced photoredox&#8208;catalyzed organic synthesis has made substantial progress in the field of phosphorylation reaction since its eco&#8208;friendly and mild conditions. This review summarizes the advance of the past five years in the visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthesis of phosphorylated heterocycles using phosphine oxides as precursors through P&#8208;centered radical addition, cross&#8208;couping, and cyclization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective N&#8208;Heterocyclic&#8208;Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Spiroannulation as an Access Towards Spirobenzofuranone&#8208;Fused Cyclohexenones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we present an organocatalytic spiroannulation method that provides access to spirocyclic benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;ones. The reaction proceeds via the generation of an azolium dienolate from an &#945;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde using a chiral N heterocyclic carbene, followed by annulation with benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;one&#8208;derived alkenes. The resulting chiral spirobenzofuranone&#8208;fused cyclohexenones were obtained with enantioselectivity ranging from 77% to 99% ee and diastereomeric ratios (dr) from 1.2/1 to 20/1. The utility of the protocol was underscored by gram&#8208;scale reaction and follow&#8208;up transformations.</dc:description>

In this pathway, the Pd catalyst plays a dual role by harvesting light as a photocatalyst and catalyzing the chemical transformation via C&#8208;H bond activation. This process is general to synthesize a range of aryl quinolinyl ketones and tolerates many common functional groups. Our methodology was successfully applied to synthesize highly potent tubulin polymerization inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[3+(2+1)] Annulation represents the most straightforward and atom&#8208;economical strategies in organic synthesis for the efficient construction of diverse cyclic structural units and complex molecules. Herein, we present a Lewis acid Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed controlled synthesis of two different regioselective oxa/thio&#8208;spirohydroquinolines (C=C at the &#945;/&#946;&#8208;site of O/S&#8208;atom) from aromatic amines and bimolecular O/S&#8208;heterocyclic ketones via intermolecular [3+(2+1)] annulation. This method features mild reaction conditions, high step economy and atom utilization, and the O/S&#8208;heterocyclic ketone can act as both two&#8208; and one&#8208;carbon synthons. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the intrinsic cause of this unique regioselectivity is caused by the proton abstraction step.</dc:description>

The formation of products involves Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H bond metalation, carbene formation, migratory insertion, proto&#8208;demetalation and intramolecular condensation. In general, this newly developed protocol features simple substrates, structurally diverse products, step&#8208;economy and scalability. In addition, evaluation of the photophysical properties and anti&#8208;proliferative activity against three human cancer cell lines of the products thus obtained showed that some of them possess potent anticancer activity with potential self&#8208;tracking capability through fluorescence detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in Exploring Mechanisms of Oxidative Phenolic Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biphenolic compounds serve as important scaffolds for the development of biologically active molecules. Among the methods for the synthesis of biarenols, oxidative coupling, which directly forms a C&#8211;C bond, has been extensively explored in various metal&#8208;catalyzed (V, Cr, Co, Fe, Cu, etc.) reactions, electrochemical reactions, and photochemical reactions over the decades. While the exact mechanisms remain elusive in many cases, numerous mechanistic studies have provided valuable insights. This review focuses on the mechanistic details of the oxidative coupling of phenols or naphthols, involving at least one radical at	least one radical intermediate. Additionally, the factors governing chemoselectivity (homo&#8208; and cross&#8208;coupling), regioselectivity (ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; and para&#8208;), and enantioselectivity (R and S configuration) are discussed, with a particular emphasis on intermediates and transition states, encompassing various oxidation sites for phenols and potential coupling sites.

         <title>Intermolecular Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Nitrene Transfer Employing Aryl Azides: An Access to 7&#8208;Functionalized 2&#8209;Aminoindoles
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on intermolecular gold&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer, utilizing o&#8208;functionalized aryl azides as nitrene transfer reagents. This catalytic reaction provides a modular route to 7&#8208;functionalized 2&#8208;aminoindoles. Due to the optimized reaction conditions (toluene, 80&#8211;100 &#176;&#1057;), a variety of functional substituents proved compatible (36 examples; yields up to 98%). The reaction can be performed using both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic variants with a low catalyst loading (1 mol %). The synthetic potential of the obtained products was illustrated by post&#8208;modifications of the indole backbone and peripheral substituents. A plausible reaction mechanism includes the generation of intermediate &#945;&#8208;imino carbenes directly from the o&#8208;functionalized aryl azides or other nitrene sources, such as anthranils or benzofuroxans, which form during the reaction in the cases of the specific aryls.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper and Photocatalytic Synergistic Strategies for Radical Cyclization Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The rapid development of photo&#8208;synergistic transition metal catalytic systems has provided a green paradigm to complement thermal transition metal catalytic methods. However, the most commonly used iridium or ruthenium complexes involve expensive in nature, in contrast to the abundant copper elements in the earth's crust, which are highly valued for their unique electronic structure and light&#8208;absorbing properties. Recently, the application of copper and photocatalytic synergistic strategies in radical cyclization reactions has progressed considerably, leading to a renaissance in the synthesis of functional natural products, drugs and their analogues, but summary work addressing this aspect has not been reported. In this review, we briefly analyze the effect of ligand choice on copper complexes and some inorganic copper salts and even on light sources. We then summarize the copper and photocatalytic synergistic strategies in radical cyclization reactions and classify them into three categories, C, N and O radicals, according to the class of the central atom of the radical in each work, and in each category will be elaborated in turn from coordination cyclization via Cu catalysts, direct radical cyclization and other cyclization mode. For individual more complex reactions, the mechanisms are explored and briefly discussed.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Cycloadditions of Cyclic Sulfamidate Imines: Straightforward Access to Chiral N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>

Abstract
Chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds are key structures in natural compounds and pharmaceuticals, and they serve as essential building blocks of functional materials. Catalytic asymmetric cycloaddition reactions represent one of the most efficient synthetic strategies for constructing optically active heterocycles. Cyclic sulfamidate imines have recently come to be extensively studied and widely utilized in both organocatalytic and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions, where they have been shown to provide various N&#8208;fused&#8208;heterocycles and spiro&#8208;cycles exhibiting high efficiencies with excellent stereoselectivities. This review highlights recent advancements in catalytic asymmetric cycloadditions of cyclic sulfamidate imines for the stereoselective synthesis of biologically active sulfamidate&#8208;containing heterocycles since 2012 while focusing on the diverse reactivities of cyclic sulfamidate imines and the mechanisms of chiral induction in catalysis.

         <title>A High&#8208;Throughput in Vitro Assay System for the Detection of the Enzymatic Dihydroxylation of Aliphatic Olefins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Rieske dioxygenase enzymes can perform the cis&#8208;dihydroxylation of aliphatic olefins, representing a potential green alternative to established methods of performing this important transformation. However, the activity of the natural enzymes in this context is low relative to their more well&#8208;known activity in the cis&#8208;dihydroxylation of aromatics. To enable the engineering of dioxygenase enzymes for improved activity in the dihydroxylation of aliphatic olefins, we have developed an assay system to detect the relevant diol metabolites produced from whole&#8208;cell fermentation cultures. Optimization studies were carried out to maximize the sensitivity of the assay system, and its utility in the in&#8197;vitro screening of enzyme variant libraries was demonstrated. The assay system was utilized in screening studies that identified Rieske dioxygenase variants with significantly improved activity in the dihydroxylation of aliphatic olefins relative to the wild&#8208;type enzyme.

Abstract
In synthetic carbohydrate chemistry, the modification of glycosyl radicals pathway stands as a central area of focus. The radical&#8208;based reactions often demonstrate remarkable compatibility with various functional groups owing to the mild initiation conditions. In particular, the identification of novel glycosyl radical precursors, combined with advanced reaction techniques, has substantially broadened the scope of glycosyl compound synthesis. Despite the presence of versatile donors, the synthesis of noble donors is still addressed as a synthetic need and challenges associated with sugar chemistry. Currently, a new class of glycosyl radical precursors has been developed which enables the production of C&#8208;, S&#8208;, O&#8208;, and N&#8208;glycosides efficiently. In this light, we highlight strategies towards bench&#8208;stable glycosyl sulfoxides, sulphone, and sulfite donors that can enable the site&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective transformation of protected or naked sugar synthons in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry. Here, this review article covers the recent developments in the selective glycosyl radical diversification such as glycosyl alkylation, arylation, alkenylation, sulfuration, C&#8722;H activation, and DNA conjugation via the bench&#8208;stable donors along with mechanistic aspects, challenges, and future directions.

Abstract
A route for the construction of benzofulvenes derivatives through 4&#8208;Aminobenzotriazole (ABTA) directed Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions of amides with inner alkynes was developed. This method afforded a diverse array of benzofulvene derivatives in yields ranging from 34% to 91%. The control experiments indicated that the substrate reacts with alkynes in tandem to synthesize 1,3&#8208;diene intermediates, and ultimately 1,3&#8208;diene underwent intramolecular cyclization to produce benzofulvene derivatives. Furthermore, the directing group can be removed.

         <title>Stereoselective Construction of Trisubstituted 1,3&#8208;Enynes via Aryl to Vinyl 1,4&#8208;Palladium Migration</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective olefinic C&#8722;H alkynylation of gem&#8208;diarylsubstituted ethylenes with propargylic alcohols was achieved to access diverse unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;enynes. The regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities were established through a 1,4&#8208;palladium migration from aryl to vinyl in the presence of 2&#8208;FC6H4OH as additive. Mechanistic investigations suggest that cleavage of the olefinic C&#8722;H bond might not be involved in the rate&#8208;determining step of the catalytic process.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palladium-catalyzed stereoselective olefinic C&#8722;H alkynylation of &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-diarylsubstituted ethylenes with propargylic alcohols was achieved to access diverse unsymmetrical 1,3-enynes. The regio- and stereoselectivities were established through a 1,4-palladium migration from aryl to vinyl in the presence of 2-FC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OH as additive. Mechanistic investigations suggest that cleavage of the olefinic C&#8722;H bond might not be involved in the rate-determining step of the catalytic process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
C&#8722;H activation represents an interesting alternative to conventional cross&#8208;coupling methods, avoiding the requirement of additional steps to introduce activating groups. Generally, Pd&#8208;catalyzed reactions have been extensively employed for C&#8722;H activation. The high cost and limited availability of resources of Pd have prompted us to explore alternative transition metals. In this context, researchers are turning to Earth Abundant Metals (EAMs) like manganese and iron for their potential in C&#8722;H activation. Significant progress has been made in manganese&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H activation in recent years, showcasing excellent specificity, environmental compatibility, and versatility across different substrates. This review summarises approximately 50 recent publications highlighting significant advancements in this field from 2020 to 2023.

         <title>Rapid (Deuterio)difluoromethylation of Heteroatoms Using R&#8208;22 Gas: A Demonstration of Flow Chemistry in Suppressing Intrinsic Reaction Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
R&#8208;22 gas (ClCF2H) is utilized in continuous flow for the installation of CF2H and CF2D groups on heteroatoms. A judiciously designed flow system suppresses the intrinsic SN2 reaction between heteroatom anions and ClCF2H, allowing for selective carbene&#8208;based fragment coupling to yield X&#8208;CF2D products with deuterium incorporation levels up to 96%. A broad scope of X&#8211;CF2H and X&#8211;CF2D products (X=S, O, N) is obtained with a short residence time of 5 minutes and scalability is demonstrated.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Substitutions Achieved by C&#8722;N Axially Chiral N&#8208;Arylpyrrole Derived Monophosphine Ligands</title>

Abstract
Monophosphine ligands based on C&#8722;N axially chiral N&#8208;Arylpyrrole backbones are prepared starting from amino acids and evaluated in Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitutions. 20.7&#8211;99.9% ees are achieved in the reactions of rac&#8208;1,3&#8208;diphenylallyl acetates with O&#8722;, N&#8722; and C&#8208;nucleophiles. Ligand screening revealed that the steric hindrance from 3&#8208; or 4&#8208; position of the pyrrole is crucial for the enantioselectivity of the reaction. The synthetic utilization of the products was demonstrated by the transformation of one product by a gold&#8208;catalyzed oxidative rearrangement reaction.

         <title>Molecular Electro(Photo)Catalysis: Triarylamine and Triarylimidazole Derivatives Mediated Oxidation Systems in Organic Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Organic electrosynthesis has become a green, efficient and sustainable alternative to traditional organic transformation for the redox reactions. In this connection, indirect electrolysis employing redox mediators is attaining increasing significance as it offers a chance to improve reaction selectivity and avoids the over&#8208;oxidation/reduction issues encountered in direct electrolysis. Triarylamines and triarylimidazoles, as representative organic molecular mediators, have attracted widespread attention in recent years due to the advantages of well&#8208;defined easy structural modification and tunable redox ability. Hence, in this minireview, the recent growth of triarylamine and triarylimidazole derivatives mediated electrochemical oxidation reactions were presented, highlighting the structural optimization, electrochemical performance and reaction mechanism of these organic mediators. Moreover, the photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic cases with these molecular mediators were also highlighted. To conclude, the current challenges and future prospects of this field are also discussed.

Abstract
We disclose herein a triflic acid and silane&#8208;promoted reductive deoxygenative transformation of ketoacid/esters for the divergent synthesis of different&#8208;sized lactones, which hold substantial significance in pharmaceutical and natural product chemistry. Owing to the simple reaction conditions and setup, this protocol features broad substrate generality, scalability, and good functional group tolerance, including late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical compounds and natural products. The control experiments and detailed NMR study provide insight into the reaction mechanism.

Abstract
This study presents a strategy for the electrochemical deuteroalkylthiolation of heteroarenes, using Bunte salt as a deuterium&#8208;alkylthio source. This reaction occurs in an undivided cell without the need for catalysts, oxidants, or electrolytes, yielding a variety of deuteroalkylthiolated heteroarenes.

         <title>Aldehyde&#8208;Mediated Open&#8208;Air Stereoselective &#946;&#8208;Glycosylation of Glycals: An Expeditious Route towards Glycosyl&#8208;Ester Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The study introduces a method for achieving a selective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;glycosyl esters through the reaction of glycals with carboxylic acids. This process is characterized by stereoselectivity, operating under mild reaction conditions and in an open&#8208;air environment mediated by an aldehyde. Detailed investigations and control experiments indicate the significance of benzaldehyde in conjunction with atmospheric air in facilitating this transformation. The method's versatility is evident in its broad substrate scope, accommodating various carboxylic acid derivatives with electron&#8208;releasing and electron&#8208;neutral functional groups. The practical applicability of the protocol is demonstrated by successfully esterifying different drugs, including indomethacin, tolmetin, and stearic acid, resulting in the production of novel compounds with excellent yields. Mechanistic studies, supported by controlled experiments, highlight the formation of glycal epoxide as an intermediate in the reactions.

Abstract
A catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free one&#8208;step protocol for synthesizing thiazolines and thiazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, utilizing the annulative coupling between &#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxonium ylides and &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides has been described. The dual functionalization of &#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxonium ylides through S&#8208;alkylation and intramolecular N&#8208;cyclization leads to the generation of both C&#8722;S and C&#8722;N bonds. The developed synthetic methods facilitate the synthesis of diverse functionalized thiazolines and thiazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives, validated through large&#8208;scale reactions.

Abstract
The development of synthetic methods for the synthesis of organic azides is highly important, given their critical role in advancing click chemistry over the last twenty years. We report a reagent&#8208;economical, reliable, and scalable synthesis of alkyl azides from primary and secondary alcohols. This robust click method capitalizes on the synergistic interaction between Sulfur Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) reagents &#8211; specifically, benzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;disulfonyl fluoride (BDSF) or benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trisulfonyl fluoride (BTSF) &#8211; and trimethylsilyl azide (TMSN3). The method offers procedural ease, accommodates a wide array of substrates, and enables late&#8208;stage functionalization. Additionally, we demonstrate the protocol&#8216;s adaptability by validating a straightforward one&#8208;pot deoxyazidation&#8208;CuAAC sequence for drug discovery applications.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Tailored Divergence of Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidation of Cyclopropanols. Application to the Practical Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Aminoketones and &#946;&#8208;Enaminones</title>

Abstract
The aerobic ring&#8208;opening oxidation of cyclopropanols catalyzed by copper complexes was systematically investigated, with a focus on the effect of nitrogen ligands on the distribution of oxidation products. This study led to the development of a new synthesis of &#946;&#8208;aminoketones and &#946;&#8208;enaminones from cyclopropanols, where product specificity is tuned through ligand and solvent selection. &#946;&#8208;Aminoketones were prepared in 34&#8211;99% yields by copper(II) acetate&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation of cyclopropanols in the presence of nucleophilic secondary aliphatic amines. In contrast, bipyridine&#8208;ligated copper catalysts resulted in the generation of &#946;&#8208;enaminones in 36&#8211;86% yields, presumably via the Kornblum&#8208;DeLaMare rearrangement of intermediate 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes.

         <title>Oxidative Photochemical Cyclisations to Access Spiroketals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The spiroketal moiety is an important substructure within many biological natural products. One method to access them is via the oxidative cyclisation of a pendant hydroxyl group on to a pre&#8208;formed pyran. However applications of this methodology have been severely limited by requiring the use of toxic oxidants, such as lead (IV) tetraacetate or mercuric oxide. Herein we report a high yielding photochemical route to prepare complex spiroketals using an oxidative photochemical approach employing iodine monochloride and sodium acetate and demonstrate the methodology to the synthesis of a number of insect pheromones.

Reported herein is a method for the construction of azepino[1,2&#8208;a]indoles via an intramolecular aldehyde&#8211;alkyne metathesis of 1&#8208;(5&#8208;aryl&#8208;4&#8208;pentynyl)indole&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehydes. This Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed reaction has several remarkable features, such as ready accessibility of the starting materials, broad substrate scope, operational simplicity, and high yields. The practicality of the process and the synthetic potential of the products were demonstrated with an upscaling experiment and downstream synthetic derivatizations of the obtained products. We have also extended this methodology to synthesize a 6,7&#8208;dihydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indole derivative.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclohexenone(aryl)iodonium Salts and Their Application in Construction of Fused aza&#8208;Heterocyclic Skeletons</title>

Abstract
A class of cyclohexenone(aryl)iodonium salts was readily prepared from 2&#8208;iodocyclohexenones and arenes under mild conditions. This novel series of hypervalent iodonium building blocks exhibits dual characteristics of hyperiodonium salts and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated cyclic ketones, enabling access to intricate aza&#8208;heterocycles. The reaction of these cyclohexenone(aryl)iodonium salts with arylamines or aryl sulfonamides affords 2&#8208;acylaziridines, while with 2&#8208;aminobenzimidazoles or 2&#8208;aminoimidazoles leads to the formation of the 1H&#8208;imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]imidazole&#8208;fused compounds. The transformation is postulated to proceed through an exclusive hyperiodonium&#8208;mediated N&#8208;Michael addition followed by N&#8208;annulation cascade.

         <title>Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Annulation of Enaminones with Maleimides Using a Traceless Directing Group Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed annulation of enaminones with maleimides was developed to synthesize various pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;e]isoindoles. In this strategy, 2&#8208;aminopyridine served as a traceless directing group, and target products were obtained in 54&#8211;72% yields. Moreover, a plausible mechanism for this reaction was proposed based on several control experiments, deuterium exchange experiments, and previous reports.

Abstract
A domino sequence consisting of a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed Doyle&#8208;Kirmse rearrangement followed by a Claisen&#8208;thioimidate rearrangement has been developed. This type of thio&#8208;Claisen rearrangement represents the first example reported in the homoallenylsulfenyl series. The sequence involves 2&#8208;propargylsulfenyl benzazoles and diazoesters, affording N&#8208;butadienyl substituted benzazole&#8208;2&#8208;thiones as a mixture of Z and E isomers, in yields ranging from 12% to quantitative (32 examples). The method provides a rapid access to a new family of highly substituted polyfunctionalized 2&#8208;aminobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes with potential synthetic applications.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced C&#8722;H Silylation of Azauracils with Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A C&#8211;H silylation of azauracils was developed via the combination of organic photoredox and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysis. Using 1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) as the photocatalyst, quinuclidine as the HAT catalyst, and silanes as the silyl radical sources, a variety of silylated azauracils were synthesized in 43&#8208;87% yields. Moreover, pyrazinone, cinnolinone, and chromone were also compatible with this catalytic system. The reaction is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization of drugs and complex molecules, and the transformation can be easily scaled up to the gram level. Mechanistic studies suggest that the silylation reaction is likely to proceed through a radical mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Radical Borylation of Robust Carbon&#8722;Heteroatom Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinduced borylation has emerged as a valuable strategy for synthesizing arylboronic esters. However, photochemical transformations involving inert bonds such as C(sp2)&#8722;F bonds are still challenging. Herein, we report a straightforward and operationally simple method for the activation of various inert carbon&#8722;heteroatom bonds, enabling the synthesis of diverse arylboronic esters without the need for transition metals or catalysts. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the deprotonation of DMSO plays a pivotal role in the reaction, and the excited DMSO anion can undergo electron transfer to the aryl substrates activated by anionic sp2&#8722;sp3 diboron compounds, i.e., [FB2pin2]&#8722;, thereby facilitating the cleavage of carbon&#8722;heteroatom bonds. The reaction allows the conversion of diverse Caryl&#8722;hetero bonds in batch and flow reactors into the corresponding arylboronic esters. The products can be used in a subsequent Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling without isolation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 3,5&#8208;Dialkoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxolanes by Alkoxyperoxidation of 1,3&#8208;Diketones with Hydrogen Peroxide and Alcohols</title>

         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component reaction of 1,3&#8208;diketones with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and alcohols was discovered. 3,5&#8208;Dialkoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxolanes are formed in yield ranging from 13% to 83% using an excess of acids such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, MeHSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;TsOH&#183;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. This reaction proceeds with the formation of 3,5&#8208;dialkoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxolanes despite the diversity of possible reaction pathways leading to different types of peroxides, oligomers, polymers or hydrolysis. 3,5&#8208;Dimethoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxolanes exhibit high activity against phytopathogenic fungi.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(III) Catalysis in Ionic Liquids: The Case Study of Coumarin Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Well&#8208;defined (P,C)&#8208;cyclometalated Au(III) complexes proved to be able to catalyze the synthesis of coumarins by intramolecular hydroarylation of a broad range of aryl propiolates under mild and practical conditions (0.1&#8208;2 mol% catalyst, 25&#8208;40&#176;C, 1&#8208;24 hours). Use of an ionic liquid as reaction solvent allowed to drastically decrease the amount of Br&#246;nsted acid used to unlock the catalyst regeneration step. The effect of the nature of the acid additive and of the ionic liquid anion have been assessed. Preliminary results on the extension of this methodology to the cyclization of aryl propargyl ethers are also presented.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: A Rh (III)&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral C&#8208;H activation/ [3+3] cyclization of 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2H&#8208;indazole&#8208;6&#8208;carboxylic acids with iodonium ylides under microwave irradiation for the synthesis of indazole&#8208;fused chromenes has been reported. The critical feature of this method is that the C&#8208;H activation of the C7&#8208;H bond of 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2H&#8208;indazole&#8208;6&#8208;carboxylic acid proceeds with regioselectivity in the presence of the proximate C5&#8208;H bond without the need for external oxidant. Microwave irradiation reduced the reaction time as compared to conventional heating. The detailed mechanistic study disclosed the mechanistic pathway of the reaction.

         <title>Hypervalent iodine&#8208;mediated regioselective dearomatization of non&#8208;activated arenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dearomatizations of non&#8208;activated arenes, particularly those under mild reaction conditions, are highly desired transformations in organic synthesis due to their power in converting flat aromatic rings into three&#8208;dimensional frameworks. Although hypervalent iodine (HVI)&#8208;mediated dearomatization of phenol derivatives has developed rapidly, HVI&#8208;mediated dearomatization of non&#8208;activated arenes remains an urgent and challenging task. To fulfil this task, in this work, we established an HVI&#8208;mediated oxidative dearomatization of non&#8208;activated arenes by using biphenylureas and N&#8208; or O&#8208;nucleophiles as reactants. This electrophilic dearomatization (DEAr) process is highly regioselective, which enabled different N&#8208; and O&#8208;nucleophiles to react at the distal C4&#8208;position of the phenyl ring, thus generating dearomative spiro&#8208;products in a single step under mild conditions with wide substrate scope (43 examples, 22%&#8722;76% yield). This approach not only provides a successful example for dearomatization of non&#8208;activated arenes under mild reaction conditions, but also has overcome the challenges in HVI&#8208;mediated dearomatization of non&#8208;activated arenes, which will enrich the chemistry of dearomatization.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Functionalization of Pyrazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ones: Access to 4&#8208;Quinoxalinone&#8208;Substituted Pyrazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy for the preparation of 4&#8208;quinoxalinone&#8208;substituted pyrazole derivatives by electrochemical functionalization of pyrazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ones is reported. Quinoxalinones, possessing significant biological activities, serve as aryl sources and participate in the transformation under electrochemical conditions without the necessity of adding extra oxidants and catalysts. This method features one&#8208;pot synthesis, scale&#8208;up and late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecule derivatives. Notably, activity testing reveals that some compounds exhibit superior inhibitory effects on the proliferation of A549 cells compared to 5&#8208;fluorouracil.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ruthenium (II)&#8208;catalysed regioselective C6 alkylation of indole&#8208;7&#8208;carboxamides with maleimide has been described. Electronically diverse maleimides reacted with various indoles to furnish corresponding C6 substituted succinimide derivatives of indoles with 46&#8208;89% yields. The reaction shows broad functional group tolerance. The synthetic utility of the reaction has been demonstrated through the conversion of the obtained product to the corresponding hexahydropyridazinyl derivative. We also studied the kinetics of the reaction through intermolecular competitive experiments with electronically distinct indole&#8208;7&#8208;carboxamides.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnesium and Calcium Bisguanidinates: Catalytic Activity in the Hydroboration of Unsaturated Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role of ligands in catalytically active metal complexes can be crucial. Herein, we present a study on the synthesis and catalytic behavior of alkaline earth bisguanidinato complexes. The reactivity of trisubstituted guanidines, specifically (iPrHN)2CNR (R= Ph, 2&#8208;Ph2PC6H4, 2&#8208;MeSC6H4), towards magnesium and calcium alkyls or amides was explored. All the compounds were found to be very active in the hydroboration of acetophenone with pinacolborane. Notably, a calcium&#8208;based complex was especially effective in the hydroboration of carbonyl compounds, demonstrating significant chemoselectivity against other reactive functional groups.	This complex was also particularly effective in the double hydroboration of nitriles and moderately active in the hydroborative dearomatization of pyridine. Our experimental and DFT studies allow us to propose a mechanism in which the participation of the guanidinato ligands, along with the metal, is key to the activation of both the unsaturated species and borane.

         <title>Biocatalytic Recycling Cascades Combining Aldolases and Transaminases for the Stereo&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>

Abstract
Recycling cascades combining aldolases and transaminases from biodiversity were designed for the stereoselective synthesis of various isomers of &#947;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids. Aldolases with opposite enantioselectivities were combined with a d&#8208;&#945;&#8208;transaminase to prepare in a single step, d&#8208;syn or d&#8208;anti&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyglutamic acid with high yield and stereoselectivity. Bioactive (2S,3R,4S)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;isoleucine was also efficiently prepared via an aldolase&#8208;transaminase recycling cascade. In that case, the unexpected high stereoselectivity was shown to result from the thermodynamically&#8208;driven formation of a stable derivative of the product. This novel approach was applied to the synthesis of l&#8208;syn and d&#8208;syn&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxynorvaline as well as for 3 new &#946;&#8208;branched&#8208;&#947;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids, analogues of 4&#8208;hydroxyisoleucine.

Abstract
Daphenylline, a structurally unique triterpenoid Daphniphyllum alkaloid, has attracted considerable attention from the synthetic community since its isolation. Herein, we delineate an enantioselective total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;daphenylline, which is based on a gold&#8208;catalyzed dearomatization reaction of &#946;&#8208;methoxynaphthalene. Other features include installation of the initial chiral stereocenter via an enantioselective rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of an alkylidene&#8208;indane derivative; construction of the other vital stereocenter by organocatalytic asymmetric Mukaiyama&#8211;Michael reaction of a structurally complex benzofused cyclohexanone; and a tandem reductive amination/amidation double cyclization reaction to assemble the distinctive azapolycyclic cage&#8208;like architecture.

         <title>K3PO4&#8211;Mediated Synthesis of Chromeno&#8211;[3,4&#8208;c]isoxazole from 3&#8211;Nitro&#8211;2H&#8211;chromene and &#945;&#8211;Chloro Aldehyde via Michael Addition/C&#8722;Cl Bond Cleavage/Deformylation as Key Fragmentation Sequences</title>

Abstract
Here we report a transition metal&#8211; and oxidant&#8211;free annulation cascade method for the synthesis of chromeno&#8211;isoxazoles. The annulation reaction involves easily accessible starting materials, 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2H&#8208;chromene and &#945;&#8208;chloro aldehyde, yielding the structurally intriguing framework, chromeno[3,4&#8208;c]isoxazoles employed by tripotassium phosphate as a base. The isoxazole ring construction over the 2H&#8211;chromene unit is believed to occur via a series of multiple reaction sequences. Here, the enolate generation/Michael addition/C&#8722;Cl bond cleavage/oxy&#8211;anionic addition to reactive tethered&#8208;aldehyde/deformylation via retro&#8211;C&#8722;C and N&#8722;O bond cleavages are the most possible sequences which furnish the desired end&#8211;product in good chemical yields. The multiple reaction sequences occur in one&#8208;pot at mild conditions, supported by experimental results and a few control experiments including DFT studies. This process exhibits a broad substrates scope illustrating good functional group compatibility towards both the nitrochromenes and aldehydes, and thus prove to be a general and efficient protocol for the synthesis of chromeno[3,4&#8211;c]isoxazoles. Overall, the use of nitrochromene as the limiting reagent, noteworthy functional group tolerance, scalability including great applications like chiral pool strategy towards the synthesis of enantioenriched chromeno&#8208;isoxazole are the additional features.

     alt="K3PO4&#8211;Mediated Synthesis of Chromeno&#8211;[3,4-c]isoxazole from 3&#8211;Nitro&#8211;2H&#8211;chromene and &#945;&#8211;Chloro Aldehyde via Michael Addition/C&#8722;Cl Bond Cleavage/Deformylation as Key Fragmentation Sequences"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we report a transition metal&#8211; and oxidant&#8211;free annulation cascade method for the synthesis of chromeno&#8211;isoxazoles. The annulation reaction involves easily accessible starting materials, 3-nitro-2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-chromene and &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-chloro aldehyde, yielding the structurally intriguing framework, chromeno[3,4-&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]isoxazoles employed by tripotassium phosphate as a base. The isoxazole ring construction over the 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;chromene unit is believed to occur via a series of multiple reaction sequences. Here, the enolate generation/Michael addition/C&#8722;Cl bond cleavage/oxy&#8211;anionic addition to reactive tethered-aldehyde/deformylation via retro&#8211;C&#8722;C and N&#8722;O bond cleavages are the most possible sequences which furnish the desired end&#8211;product in good chemical yields. The multiple reaction sequences occur in one-pot at mild conditions, supported by experimental results and a few control experiments including DFT studies. This process exhibits a broad substrates scope illustrating good functional group compatibility towards both the nitrochromenes and aldehydes, and thus prove to be a general and efficient protocol for the synthesis of chromeno[3,4&#8211;&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]isoxazoles. Overall, the use of nitrochromene as the limiting reagent, noteworthy functional group tolerance, scalability including great applications like chiral pool strategy towards the synthesis of enantioenriched chromeno-isoxazole are the additional features.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A synthesis of acyl halides from the corresponding carboxylic acid thioesters was achieved using commercially available Selectfluor or NCS, and the acyl fluoride or chloride intermediates were transformed to the corresponding esters, amides, and several carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation products. This approach can be applied to the peptide synthesis from functionalized amino acid thioesters.

         <title>Organophotocatalyzed C&#8722;Si Bond Fragmentation Using Silyl Ethers as Radical Precursors</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
In this work, silyl ethers of phenols and alcohols have been successfully prepared and tested as neutral carbon (silicon) centered radical precursors. The organophotocatalyzed oxidation (by the Fukuzumi catalyst) of these ethers caused the cleavage of a C&#8722;Si (or a Si&#8722;Si) bond for the release of the desired radical to be used for the forging of C(sp3) &#8722;C(sp3) (or C(sp3) &#8722;Si) bonds via a Giese reaction.

         <title>Dearomative 1,2&#8208;(Deutero)Hydrotrifluoromethylation of Chromium&#8208;Bound Arenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Dearomative trifluoromethylation of arenes provides an ideal method for constructing CF3&#8208;containing three&#8208;dimensional architectures which are of increasing interest in drug discovery. However, such transformation is rare and challenging because of the inherently low reactivity of arene &#960;&#8208;systems and selectivity issues. Herein, we disclose a general dearomative 1,2&#8208;hydrotrifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes utilizing activation by temporary &#960;&#8208;complexation to chromium, thus affording convenient access to 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes bearing the privileged CF3 group. The versatility of this strategy further enables a dearomative 1,2&#8208;deuterotrifluoromethylation with high deuterated ratios. The related dearomative 1,2&#8208;(deutero)hydroperfluoroethylation reactions were conducted well for a range of chromium&#8208;bound (hetero)arenes. Finally, a reasonable mechanism was proposed based on the intermediate capture and control experiments.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Photocyclization/Oxidation Cascade Constructing Quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones and Tetrahydrocarbazolones</title>

Abstract
We reported a one&#8208;pot photocyclization/ oxidation cascade of N&#8208;aryl acrylamides to afford quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones. Thioxanthone was used as a bifunctional energy transfer agent to mediate both photocyclization and generation of singlet oxygen, the latter facilitates the dehydrogenation of dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;one intermediate. This cascade strategy also supports the 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization to synthesize tetrahydrocarbazolones from phenylamino cyclohexenones.

Abstract
Our study introduces a streamlined oxidative method for synthesizing 1,3&#8208;diarylphenanthro[9,10&#8208;c]thiophenes, and their subsequent oxidative cleavage to yield 9,10&#8208;diaroylphenanthrenes. Harnessing an optimized aerobic photochemical transformation, we showcase broad substrate scope and tolerance to various photosensitive functional groups. Our mechanistic investigations unveil the pivotal role of singlet oxygen, providing intriguing insights into the reaction pathway. The synthesized 9,10&#8208;diaroylphenanthrenes serve as versatile building blocks for nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, dibenzoannulated phthalazines, that are promising compounds with diverse functionalities. Offering mild conditions, and broad applicability, our synthetic strategy is useful for organic synthesis and chemical biology exploration.

Abstract
The biocatalytic oxidative deamination&#8208; reductive amination process for the production of L&#8208;phosphinothricin (L&#8208;PPT) from D,L&#8208;phosphinothricin (D,L&#8208;PPT) is a green and environmentally friendly approach with significant development potential. In this study, the adopted technological route involves the oxidative deamination of the D&#8208;PPT component in D,L&#8208;PPT to 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)butanoic acid (PPO) by utilizing D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAAO), followed by the catalytic reductive amination of PPO to L&#8208;PPT using phosphinothricin dehydrogenase (PpDH). In order to enhance the catalytic rate and reduce the inhibitory effect of the intermediate product PPO on the catalytic process, optimization of both oxidative deamination and reductive amination phases was conducted through separate strategies of constant&#8208;pressure oxygen supply and substrate feeding, respectively. A &#8220;two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot&#8221; method was employed to link the optimized reactions, significantly shortening the production time. Furthermore, the &#8220;two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot&#8221; catalytic strategy was optimized, ultimately achieving a high 97.7% yield of L&#8208;PPT with ee of L&#8208;PPT&gt;99.9% after 5.5&#8197;h of reaction under 800&#8197;mM D,L&#8208;PPT catalytic conditions, D&#8208;PPT and PPO could not bedetected in the reaction system, further enchanced the catalytic efficiency, production efficiency and product quality. The aforementioned results demonstrate that this proposed approach has great potential for industrial&#8208;scale production of L&#8208;PPT as well as significant competitive advantages in terms of economic feasibility.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A multi&#8208;gram scale synthesis of ferrocenetriflone was optimised from ferrocenesulfonyl fluoride and Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Ruppert reagent). Enantioselective deprotolithiations were then carried out using alkyllithiums in the presence of catalytic (+)&#8208;sparteine to afford 2&#8208;substituted ferrocene triflones with ee up to 84%. The use of chiral lithium amides in the presence of in situ traps was also optimised and was found to outperform alkyllithium&#8729;chiral diamine chelates for the first time in the ferrocene series, with ee up to 93%. Crystallisation of derivatives afforded enantiopure compounds that were engaged in deprotolithiation&#8208;electrophilic trapping sequences, a halogen &#8216;dance' reaction and transition metal promoted coupling to afford a wide range of variously polysubstituted ferrocene triflones.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a cost&#8208;effective synthesis of various multi&#8208;substituted pyridine derivatives, especially 2&#8208;aryl pyridines, using secondary alcohols and 1,3&#8208;diol as the primary feedstock with ammonium acetate serving as nitrogen donor, catalyzed by a new well&#8208;defined singlet mono&#8208;radical Ru(III)&#8208;catalyst featuring a cyclopentadienyl group, one PPh3, and a redox&#8208;active scaffold &#8210;N1&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine having a pendant &#8208;NH2 arm. The &#8208;NH2 arm of the catalyst facilitates the generation of the critical reactive intermediates by enhancing the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon center of the diols or diketones by forming hydrogen bonds, making it more catalytically effective over the similar other Ru&#8208;catalysts having no pendant &#8208;NH2 arm. The Ru&#8208;catalyst also functionalizes 2&#8208;aryl pyridine moieties with different coupling partners, such as aryl iodides, terminal alkynes, and styrene derivatives at the o&#8208;position of the phenyl ring.</dc:description>

Abstract
The synthesis of substituted 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;b]indazoles from 3&#8208;aminoindazoles and ketones has been established. It involves one molecule of 3&#8208;aminoindazoles and two molecules of ketones via a [3+2+1] three&#8208;component annulation process. 3&#8208;Oxo&#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;b]indazoles exhibit strong yellow fluorescence in various solvents. A wide range of products have anti&#8208;oxidant activities. Cytotoxicity studies indicate that compounds 3&#8201;a, 3&#8201;aa and 3&#8201;ab have obvious effects on both HCT116 and A549 cancer cell lines.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Formal Addition of Aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds to Alkenes via Phenyl Radical Involved Intermolecular HAT</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A copper catalyzed aerobic formal addition of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds to alkenes via a phenyl radical mediated intermolecular HAT process is reported herein, in which the phenylhydrazine not only acts as a HAT reagent precursor, but also as a hydrogen atom donor. This reaction affords an alternative method for the direct formal addition of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds to alkenes utilizing air as the radical initiator without additional reductants at ambient temperature. A variety of alkanes and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes are successfully incorporated, furnishing a series of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H formal addition products in 20&#8211;93% yield. Preliminary mechanistic studies show that the 2&#8208;tetrahydrofuranyl and phenyl radical are formed in this reaction.

A variety of alkanes and electron-deficient alkenes are successfully incorporated, furnishing a series of aliphatic C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;3)&#8722;H formal addition products in 20&#8211;93% yield. Preliminary mechanistic studies show that the 2-tetrahydrofuranyl and phenyl radical are formed in this reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed [4+4] cycloaddition of aryl&#8208;substituted &#947;&#8208;methylidene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactones (GMDVs) with divinylketones (DVKs) was developed, providing an approach to access various mono&#8208;cyclic tetrahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;oxocines with diverse substituents in 41% to 95% yield with 81:19 to &gt;20:1 dr. This reaction was facilitated by anchoring olefin (C=C), carbonyl (C=O), and arene (Ar) at the &#945;&#8208;position of carbonyls.

Abstract
It remains a challenge to achieve regioselectivity and stereoselectivity in the synthesis of dihydropyranone derivatives. Herein, an Ir/Pd&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative allylic (amino)ketalization was disclosed to prepare dihydropyranone derivatives in regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities under mild conditions, resulting in O&#8208; and N&#8208;allylative products. It provided a strategy for the post&#8208;modifications of dihydropyranone derivatives.

The front cover picture, provided by Singh, Park, Kim, and co&#8208;workers, illustrates the synthetic method for the vicarious&#8208;type nucleophilic amination of azine N&#8208;oxides and cyclic iminoamides using iminyl anions, readily generated from organic azides under basic conditions. The formation of iminyl anions and site&#8208;selective nucleophilic aromatic substitution in this process were supported by a series of mechanistic investigations including DFT calculations. The utility of C2&#8208;aminated products was highlighted by the photocatalytic reduction of a N&#8208;oxide group and the formation of a five&#8208;membered iridacycle. More details can be found in Update by Singh, Park, Kim, and co&#8208;workers (J. Min, S. Min, E. Chung, K. Moon, H. S. Kim, T. Jeong, A. Rakshit, P. Singh, J. S. Park, I. S. Kim, Adv. Synth.

         <title>Intramolecular Buchner Reaction: Experimental and Theoretical Comparison of the Effect of the Carbene Substituent on the Chemoselectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The intramolecular Buchner reaction is a powerful transformation able to dearomatize benzenic rings. However, the competitive C&#8722;H insertion of the carbene moiety into benzylic positions still remains a limitation, and the reasons governing this uncomplete chemoselectivity are poorly understood. The carbene substitution, in particular, has been observed to influence the selectivity strongly, though the currently proposed explanation relying on the electrophilicity of the metallocarbene hardly describes some experimental results reported in the literature. In this article, we present our experimental observations of intramolecular rhodium&#8208;catalyzed Buchner reactions, combined with DFT calculations on selected carbene substituents, to propose a complementary explanation for the observed chemoselectivity modification.

Abstract
Site&#8208;selective amination of N&#8208;heterocycles is an interesting topic in organic synthesis and drug discovery. We herein present a method for the vicarious&#8208;type nucleophilic amination of azine N&#8208;oxides and cyclic iminoamides using iminyl anions, readily generated from organic azides under basic conditions. The plausible reaction mechanism involving nucleophilic aromatic substitution by iminyl anions is elucidated by a series of mechanistic investigations.

         <title>Selective Access to Sultams and Spirocyclic Sultams by the Divergent Annulations of (N&#8208;Aryl)&#8208;Alkynyl Sulphonamides</title>

Abstract
Herein, we present the first annulation reaction of (N&#8208;aryl)&#8208;alkynyl sulphonamides leading to sultams or spirocyclic sultams. The selective formation of aforesaid products is based on the variable reactivity, intramolecular ortho&#8208;cyclization or dearomative ipso&#8208;annulation, guided by the substituent on N&#8208;aryl group of the substrate. The ortho&#8208;annulation is mediated by electrophile, while the ipso&#8208;annulation is promoted by the radical, enabling the functionalization (selenyl or iodo) on sultams. The synthetic potential of this method is illustrated by modifications of the functional groups present in the products obtained.

         <title>Synthesis of Fluorinated Spiroindolenines by Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Indole Dearomatizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A strategy to access fluorinated spiroindolenines has been developed, involving a selective functionalization of indoles with fluorinated moieties and subsequent catalytic dearomatization. Trifluomethylthio (SCF3), diethyl phosphono(difluoromethyl)thio (SCF2P(O)(OEt)2) and (phenylsulfonyl)difluoromethyl (CF2SO2Ph) groups were embedded at the C2 position of indole derivatives substituted with alkynes, allenes, and allyl carbonate moieties at the C3 position. A gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization gave access to five spiroindolenines, and an enantioselective palladium catalyzed cyclization provided 10 fluorinated spirocyclic products with up to 77% ee.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Aerobic Dearomatization of Naphthylamines under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The dearomatization of aromatic substrates via photocatalytic methodologies has gained escalating prominence to access molecular complexity. Although much focus has been put on non&#8208;active arenes, naphthols and N&#8208;based heteroaromatics, arylamines have so far remained in the background. Herein, we report a photocatalytic strategy for the aerobic, dearomative hydroxylation of naphthylamines under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Our investigation highlights singlet oxygen generation as a viable mechanism for aromaticity disruption, mitigating selectivity issues deriving from the direct oxidation of targeted arylamines. Finally, we showcased the synthetic value of the obtained dearomatized products in a late&#8208;stage diversification campaign.

Abstract
We report herein a palladium&#8208;catalyzed, site&#8208;selective cyclative annulation of o&#8208;alkynyl arylamides with maleimide for the stereoselective construction of succinimide&#8208;fused benzoxazine derivatives. This operationally simple and modular protocol provides access to polycyclic frameworks. The other associated features are high functional group compatibility, gram&#8208;scale synthetic potential, and downstream transformations. Control and labeling experiments were conducted to get insights into the mechanism.
