         <title>Dissymmetrically Substituted Diphosphines with Two Atropisomeric Axes and Their Application in Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Imines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the great potential and widespread applications, the majority of diphosphine ligands used in asymmetric catalysis are C2&#8208;symmetric and their structural modifications are often limited. Herein, we reported the design of original enantiopure dissymmetrical diphosphines, BiaxPhos, bearing two atropisomeric axes. Their original chiral architecture combined with important modularity, renders BiaxPhos ligands appealing candidates for asymmetric catalysis, as illustrated by the Ir&#8208;BiaxPhos catalyzed asymmetric imines hydrogenation, furnishing chiral amines with excellent enantioselectivities under mild conditions. Remarkably, combined experimental mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations delineate yet unexplored mechanistic scenario implying the hydrogenation of the enamine tautomeric form instead of the classic reduction of the imine.</dc:description>

         <title>NHPI/O2&#8208;Mediated Electrochemical Intermolecular Cyclization/Dehydrogenation for the Construction of Polycyclic Quinazolinones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, an eco&#8208;friendly and atom&#8208;economical electrochemical methodology with isatins and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinolines through NHPI/O2&#8208;mediated intermolecular oxidation/annulation is disclosed, leading to a variety of polycyclic quinazolinones in 46&#8208;82% yields. This oxidative cyclization proceeded in transition metal&#8208; and strong oxidant&#8208;free conditions and generated H2 and CO2 as byproducts. Additionally, late&#8208;stage functionalization and broad substrate scope demonstrated the synthetic usefulness of this protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Anilides by Aminolysis of Unactivated Esters using MnCl2 in Combination with strong Bases as Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Anilides are often found in pharmaceuticals and active ingredients in crop protection. Although of great interest, the atom&#8208; and step economic formation of the amide bond between a less nucleophilic aniline with an acid or ester remains still a major challenge. Herein, we report an aminolysis of aromatic and alkyl esters with anilines catalyzed by a readily available catalytic system comprising of an earth&#8208;abundant Mn&#8208;salt in combination with an inexpensive base.

         <title>Weak Nucleophiles in the Aza&#8208;Michael Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The 1,4&#8208;conjugated addition of nitrogen centered nucleophiles to electron&#8208;deficient alkenes is one of the most significant and widely used reactions in modern synthetic organic chemistry. To date, various protocols for the aza&#8208;Michael reaction have been developed. However, these reports mainly focus on the use of strong Michael donors. In recent years, the conjugate addition of weak nitrogen nucleophiles to various Michael acceptors gained increasing popularity. Impressive progress in this area has been achieved by the use of more efficient catalyst systems. This review aims to provide a critical analysis of the results obtained in reactions of weak nucleophiles (azoles, pyrroles, indoles, carbamates, purines, amides, hydrazides, uraciles etc) with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes which were reported over the past twelve years.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Fused Thienoindoles via Base Promoted Double C&#8722;H Sulfuration with Elemental Sulfur</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A direct strategy for the preparation of fused thienoindoles from substituted indoles and elemental sulfur has been reported. The present approach produces a range of structurally valuable fused thienoindoles in 51&#8211;78% yield under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, which may have potential applications in pharmaceutical industry and organic functional materials. In this work, the double C&#8722;S bonds formation is achieved via base promoted direct sulfuration of C&#8722;H bonds with elemental sulfur.

         <title>Photoinduced Arene C&#8208;H Amination with Ammonia: A Practical and Regioselective Strategy for Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introducing the primary amino group into aromatic ring is one of the most important study issues in organic chemistry, particularly for the pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals chemistry. Herein, we describe a photoinduced direct C&#8208;H amination of arenes with ammonia via the site&#8208;selective C&#8208;H thianthrenation that forms a new C&#8208;N bond with excellent regioselectivity. The reaction is carried out under mild conditions, and with a wide range of functional group tolerance, such as sensitive &#8208;Cl, &#8208;Br, and &#8208;OH groups which are poorly tolerated in conventional approaches. Moreover, the synthetic utility of our amination protocol has been confirmed through late&#8208;stage modification and gram&#8208;scale synthesis of complex drug&#8208;like molecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade double cyclization reaction has been designed to synthesize heterobiaryl compounds such as furanyl and pyrrolyl 2H&#8208;chromenes from bis(alkynyl)&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols and 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols. The starting materials are readily available from biomass platform molecules such as &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids and &#945;&#8208;amino acids. The process involves an initial heterocyclodehydration step enabling the formation of the furan or pyrrole ring, followed by an alkyne hydroarylation to form the chromene core.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Thiocyanated/Iodinated/Brominated Pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;amines and Thiocyanated Enamines via C(sp2)&#8722;H Functionalization</title>

Abstract
An electrochemical method for the C(sp2)&#8722;H thiocyanation of pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;amines and enamines were developed in an undivided cell. A variety of thiocyanated pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;amine and enamine derivatives were accessed in 36&#8211;91% yields, employing thiocyanate salts as electrolyte and thiocyanating reagent. Moreover, this electrochemical protocol can be extended to the synthesis of various iodinated and brominated pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;amine derivatives in 51&#8211;95% yields. This electrochemical protocol does not require a metal or external chemical oxidants and tolerates unprotected amino groups.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Cyclization of Nitrogen or Oxygen Containing Nucleophile Tethered&#8208;Vinylidenecyclopropanes to Pyrrole, Furan, Pyrrolidine and Piperidine Skeletons</title>

Abstract
In this paper, we report a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of N&#8208; or O&#8208;nucleophile tethered&#8208;vinylidenecyclopropanes (VDCPs), resulting in the synthesis of pyrrole, furan, pyrrolidine, and piperidine skeletons in 30%&#8208;98% yields. Depending on the carbon chain length connecting the nucleophile and VDCPs, two reaction pathways are available, leading to different products. Both &#945;&#8208;amino VDCPs and &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl VDCPs, where nucleophiles and VDCPs are connected by a methylene group, undergo intramolecular nucleophilic addition and aromatization, followed by ring&#8208;opening of the cyclopropane unit to produce substituted pyrroles and furans. By extending the chain length to three or four carbons, it becomes possible to form pyrrolidines and piperidines with a cyclobutene moiety via ring expansion of the cyclopropane unit, accompanied by gold carbene induced vinylogous nucleophilic addition.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrochemical Hydroboration of Olefins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we reported the electrochemical hydroboration of olefins to access the organoboron derivatives in a one&#8208;pot reaction under air and at room temperature. This reaction manifold was applied to a broad range of alkenes with 40&#8211;90% yields and good functional group tolerance without using a metal catalyst or an additional hydride source. Mechanistic studies suggested that this anodic oxidation conducted in an undivided cell allowing the production of a boron radical species, which initiates the hydroboration of olefins event by a radical addition process.

         <title>A Base&#8208;Free, Low Temperature Click and Release Reaction for the In Situ Generation of Diazomethane</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Diazomethane is a powerful reagent for numerous chemical reactions such as esterifications and the homologation of carboxylic acids. Unfortunately, the synthetic utility of diazomethane is severely limited by its toxicity and highly explosive nature. Diazald&#174; is typically used for ex situ synthesis, however it requires cumbersome and hazardous transfer of diazomethane from a caustic aqueous phase to the reaction medium. Herein, we present a low temperature and base&#8208;free in&#8197;situ synthesis of diazomethane via a &#8220;click and release&#8221; reaction between an enamine and sulfonyl azide. Its utility is exemplified by the synthesis of diverse methyl esters in yields of up to 93%. Moreover, diazoketone synthesis from in&#8197;situ generated diazomethane and acid chlorides was demonstrated for the first time. Finally, trideuteromethylation was achieved using acetone&#8208;d6 as the deuterium source. We anticipate that this method will enable the safer use of diazomethane in organic synthesis and drug discovery programs.

         <title>Advancements in the Synthesis of Diaryliodonium Salts: Updated Protocols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Our group has reported several one&#8208;pot protocols for the synthesis of diaryliodonium salts, which have been recognized as attractive multi&#8208;purpose reagents in areas ranging from organic synthesis to materials chemistry. Over the years, we have identified limitations in the published protocols concerning synthesis of mixed electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor, as well as highly electron&#8208;poor diaryliodonium salts, as the corresponding starting materials are either too reactive or too unreactive. In this update, we discuss the underlying limitations concerning the stability and reactivity of the involved reagents and provide strategies to overcome these challenges through updated synthetic protocols.

Abstract
Propargyl ureas can lead to a range of possible heterocyclic compounds, mainly depending on the employed catalyst. Silver salts are known to promote the N&#8208;5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization mode to imidazolidinone derivatives. Conversely, a versatile and stereoselective O&#8208;5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization of propargyl ureas to 2&#8208;aminooxazolines by Ag(I) catalysis is here disclosed. Good to excellent yields and complete stereoselectivity of the external double bond have been achieved under milder reaction conditions (50&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C). A one&#8208;pot protocol starting from the corresponding propargylic amines and isocyanates has been developed as well. N,N&#8217;&#8208;Dipropargyl ureas underwent a uncommon O&#8208;5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig/N&#8208;5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig double cyclization sequence. Finally, insights into the tautomeric equilibrium of 2&#8208;aminooxazoles and on their relative reactivity are provided.

         <title>A Scalable Synthesis of Chiral Himbert Diene Ligands for Asymmetric Catalysis</title>

Abstract
Chiral dienes are important ligands in asymmetric catalysis but they are less accessible than other commonly used ligands such as chiral bisphosphines. Here, we show that intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition of a simply attained chiral allenecarboxanilide readily affords pseudoenantiomeric bicyclo[2.2.2]octa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dienes containing an alkenyl bromide, which can be readily functionalized to give diverse chiral diene ligands. The synthesis is straightforward and easily conducted on multigram scales. These ligands exhibit high performance in nine types of enantioselective Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;addition or 1,2&#8208;addition reactions.

Abstract
A feasible and umpolung strategy for the synthesis of structurally diverse &#946;&#8208;amino ketones has been achieved through TEMPO mediated C&#8722;N coupling of cyclopropanols with nitrogen nucleophiles. Mechanism studies indicated that in&#8197;situ generated enones derived from cyclopropanols are the key intermediates and TEMPO play multiple roles, including radical initiator, trapping reagent, a porter of &#946;&#8208;hydrogen and an in&#8197;situ base. This protocol features broad substrate scope, good scalability and good to excellent yields and provides an alternative and complementary approach to the synthesis of structurally important &#946;&#8208;amino ketone scaffolds under metal and additive&#8208;free conditions.

Abstract
S&#8208;Glycosides are considerably more stable toward chemical degradation and enzymatic hydrolysis than O&#8208;glycosides, and thioglyco&#8208;peptides/proteins also demonstrate critical bioactivities in the living system. However, the general and stereoselective synthetic strategies are still challenging. Herein, a versatile S&#8208;glycosylation approach was developed by palladium&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution to form &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;thioglycosides respectively under mild conditions. A wide range of substrates were tolerated to afford thioglycosides in a stereospecific manner with 70%&#8211;86% yields. This protocol also created the quick access to various S&#8208;linked disaccharides and glycopeptides.

Abstract
Installation of an alkyl chain at a specified position in the aromatic ring via metal&#8208;free catalysis is very important. In this regard, we have developed a facile metal&#8208;free, extremely selective, user&#8208;friendly, environmentally benign and cost&#8208;effective Friedel&#8208;Crafts (FC) alkylation protocol for 2&#8208;oxindoles and anilines with donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes. Real&#8208;time NMR studies reveal that the transformation is governed by the cooperative catalysis of Br&#248;nsted acid (TfOH) and HFIP, which facilitates the nucleophilic attack on donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes from 2&#8208;oxindoles and anilines.

Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced mild, transition metal, base, and photocatalyst&#8208;free green protocol has been developed for the synthesis of tryptanthrin and its derivatives. The present reaction is compatible with a wide range of substrates with good to high yields. Further, a novel synthetic transformation of tryptanthrin derivatives has been achieved by the decarboxylative addition of cyanoacetic acid for the first time. This reaction proceeds by visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced single electron transfer between the substrate and oxygen, followed by intramolecular cyclization without the use of an external photocatalyst.

&lt;p&gt;Visible-light-induced mild, transition metal, base, and photocatalyst-free green protocol has been developed for the synthesis of tryptanthrin and its derivatives. The present reaction is compatible with a wide range of substrates with good to high yields. Further, a novel synthetic transformation of tryptanthrin derivatives has been achieved by the decarboxylative addition of cyanoacetic acid for the first time. This reaction proceeds by visible-light-induced single electron transfer between the substrate and oxygen, followed by intramolecular cyclization without the use of an external photocatalyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
A method for preparing sulfonamides using visible light is described. In this approach, an aryl diazo tetrafluoroborate salt, 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane bis(sulfur dioxide) (DABSO), and amino benzoate as substrates, CuBr2 as a catalyst, and 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;pentanol as an additive were employed for a one&#8208;pot multicomponent reaction to provide sulfonamides under mild reaction conditions. A variety of aryl diazo tetrafluoroborate salts and O&#8208;benzoyl hydroxylamines were tolerated in this process to provide products with yields up to 96%.

Abstract
Cyanoimines (C=N&#8722;CN) are eliciting increased attention because of their extensive presence in medicine and biologically active molecules. This study demonstrated the use of the electrochemical oxidative carbon&#8208;atom multifunctionalization and N&#8208;cyanation of imine to synthesize (Z)&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;cyano&#8208;N&#8208;carbamimidothioate. This multicomponent reaction showed good step economy, thereby providing a tool to construct various cyanoimines. Moreover, good functional&#8208;group tolerance and large&#8208;scale synthesis were achieved under metal&#8208;free and external&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free conditions, indicating the potential applicability of this methodology.

Abstract
N&#8208;thiophthalimido&#8208; arylphenothiazines 2 and triarylamines 3 can be converted to dithiabridged triarylamine hetero[4]helicenes 1 using catalytic amounts of chalcogen substituted Lewis Bases and hexafluoro isopropanol as hydrogen bond donor. The procedure occurs under mild reaction conditions and gives good yields avoiding the use of excesses of Lewis Acids as previously reported. A preliminary study about the possibility to control the M and P absolute stereochemistry of helicenes 1 using enantiopure sulfur containing LBs from the natural chiral pool is also reported.

Abstract
A metal&#8208;free radical multicomponent bicyclization of heteroatom&#8208;linked 1,7&#8208;diynes with aryl diazonium tetrafluoroborates and DABCO&#8208;bis(sulfurdioxide) (DABSO) is reported, enabling annulative SO2 insertion access to produce two types of skeletally diverse tricyclic sulfones, namely, thieno[3,4&#8208;c]quinoline 2,2&#8208;dioxides and thieno[3,4&#8208;c]chromene 2,2&#8208;dioxides, with moderate to good yields by simply tuning the linkers of the 1,7&#8208;diynes. This protocol demonstrates remarkable compatibility regarding N&#8208; and O&#8208;linked 1,7&#8208;diynes with different substitution patterns and aryl diazonium tetrafluoroborates.

Abstract
The electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex&#8208;enabled asymmetric photochemical alkylation strategy holds potential to attain elusive chiral &#945;&#8208;alkylated aldehydes without an external photoredox catalyst. The photosensitizer&#8208;free conditions are beneficial concerning process costs and sustainability. However, lengthy organocatalyst preparation steps as well as limited productivity and difficult scalability render the current approaches unsuitable for synthesis on enlarged scales. Inspired by these limitations, a protocol was developed for the enantioselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes based on the synergistic combination of visible light&#8208;driven asymmetric organocatalysis and a controlled continuous flow reaction environment. With the aim to reduce process costs, a commercially available chiral catalyst has been exploited to achieve photosensitizer&#8208;free enantioselective &#945;&#8208;alkylations using phenacyl bromide derivates as alkylating agents. As a result of elaborate optimization and process development, the present flow strategy furnishes an accelerated and inherently scalable entry into enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;alkylated aldehydes including a chiral key intermediate of the antirheumatic esonarimod.

The front cover picture illustrates that intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition of a simply attained chiral allenecarboxanilide affords the pseudoenantiomeric alkenyl bromides shown, which can be readily functionalized to give diverse chiral &#8220;Himbert diene&#8221; ligands. The synthesis can be readily scaled to produce decagram quantities of ligands. These ligands match, or exceed, the performance of existing &#8220;best&#8208;in&#8208;class&#8221; chiral dienes over nine types of enantioselective Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;addition or 1,2&#8208;addition reactions.

Abstract
Quaternary pyridinium compounds are valuable intermediates in organic synthesis, which have gained immense popularity in the synthetic community. The application of transition metal or photoredox catalysis in transforming quaternary pyridinium compounds into various C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X bonds is well established. A majority of these methods require high temperatures, expansive catalysts, and delicate conditions for successful execution. On the other hand, the use of transition metal&#8208;free and photocatalysis&#8208;free strategies in constructing C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X bonds using quaternary pyridinium derivatives has been sought&#8208;after. In this context, the electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA)&#8208;complex reactions have emerged as a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic synthetic methodology, which do not require any photocatalyst for their successful execution. EDA&#8208;complex photochemistry takes advantage of the electron&#8208;acceptor ability of quaternary pyridinium derivatives, which can quickly generate a radical precursor via the deaminative process. These newly generated radical intermediates are useful in several valuable transformations. We hereby, in this review, discuss an area of major progress in EDA&#8208;complex mediated reactions involving quaternary pyridinium compounds with mechanism, substrate scope, and limitations.

Abstract
Azo compounds have attracted much attention in the past decades, due to their unique properties. Recently, the free radical strategy has been widely applied to the chemical transformations of azobenzenes, dialkyl azodicarboxylates, mainly including hydrogenation and functionalization of N=N double bond, and N&#8208;functionalization reactions via the cleavage of the N=N double bonds. In this review, we systematically summarized these reactions as well as their mechanisms are discussed.

Abstract
A synthetic protocol for construction of 3&#8208;benzoxepin skeleton through a silver&#8208;catalyzed annulation/nucleophilic/ring&#8208;expansion reaction of 2&#8208;alkynylacetophenones with diazomethylphosphonates is described. This protocol provided a series of 1&#8208;phosphonate&#8208;3&#8208;benzoxepin analogs in yields of 39%&#8211;95%. The resulting benzoxepins featuring halogen and phosphonate could be further transformed into other derivatives.

Abstract
The direct C&#8722;H acyloxylation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with carboxylic acids as the acyloxylating agents was achieved via the electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes between PAHs and N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS). This visible light&#8208;assisted metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H acyloxylation reaction provides an easy access to the desired aryl carboxylates from readily available PAHs and aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids under mild reaction conditions.

Abstract
A diastereoselective (3+3) cycloaddition of azomethine imines and in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated azaoxyallyl cations from &#945;&#8208;halohydroxamate promoted by a Br&#248;nsted base has been developed. A series of pyrazolo [1,2&#8208;a][1,2,4]triazin&#8208;6&#8208;ones were accessed with up to 95% yields and diastereoselectivities greater than 20:1. The asymmetric version of this reaction was explored and moderate enantioselectivity was achieved after screening a series of cinchonine&#8208;derived chiral catalysts.

A series of pyrazolo [1,2-a][1,2,4]triazin-6-ones were accessed with up to 95% yields and diastereoselectivities greater than 20:1. The asymmetric version of this reaction was explored and moderate enantioselectivity was achieved after screening a series of cinchonine-derived chiral catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis of Secondary Trifluoromethyl Boronic Esters through Visible Light Induced Decarboxylative Alkylation Reactions</title>

Abstract
We demonstrated a practical and general methodology for the synthesis of secondary trifluoromethyl boronic esters through visible light induced decarboxylative alkylation reaction. This reaction was driven by the photochemical activity of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex. Except for wide group tolerance, moderate to high yields and simple reaction conditions, the practicality of this protocol was further demonstrated by direct modification of bioactive molecules and further derivations.

Abstract
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cascade 1,3&#8208;sulfinate migration, intermolecular [3+2] annulation of 1&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles and indoles was achieved. The one&#8208;pot protocol provided a method to construct cyclopenta[b]indoles bearing four stereocenters in 45% to 99% yields with 1.6:1 to &gt;20:1 diastereoselectivities. In addition, cyclopenta[b]indoles could be transformed into a variety of functionalized compounds, demonstrating the synthetic value of this migration&#8208;annulation strategy in ring system synthesis.

         <title>A Continuous&#8208;Flow Method for the Transformation from Amides to Nitriles Catalyzed by CeO2 in Acetonitrile</title>

Abstract
A CeO2&#8208;catalyzed method for the transformation from amides to nitriles was developed using acetonitrile as the solvent and dehydrating reagent. The transformation proceeded via a formal &#8220;water transfer&#8221; reaction between the amides and acetonitrile. We propose that the presence of oxygen defect sites in CeO2 is important in the mechanism of this transformation. Various nitriles could be continuously synthesized from amides in 75&#8211;96% yields via flow operation using a catalyst column packed with CeO2.

Abstract
In the presence of the Suginome reagent (PhMe2Si&#8722;Bpin), a large panel of electron&#8208;withdrawing alkenes was successfully converted into the hydrosilylated product in good to excellent yields. This direct electrochemical hydrosilylation does not require exogenous oxidants and catalysts. Preliminary mechanistic study supported the involvement of a silyl radical, which reacted on the alkene.

Abstract
We present the first study on the application of platinum complexes in the hydrostannylation of terminal alkynes. A range of platinum complexes were screened, with PtCl2/XPhos proving to provide the best selectivity for the &#946;&#8208;(E)&#8208;vinyl stannane. The catalyst system is able to provide the corresponding vinyl stannane in selectivities which surpasses that which is typically afforded under palladium catalysis. Additionally, a telescoped hydrometallation/cross&#8208;coupling sequence has been developed, allowing for application of the vinyl stannanes without excessive manipulation or purification of the intermediate stannane.

         <title>Synergistic Photoredox and Iron(II) Catalyzed Carbophosphorothiolation of Vinyl Arenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component vicinal carbophosphorothiolation of vinyl arenes by the cooperation of visible light and iron(II) catalysis has been established for the synthesis of S&#8208;alkyl phosphorothioates. Noteworthy, the late&#8208;stage functionalization of biologically active compounds has been performed using this procedure. The preliminary mechanistic study reveals that the catalytic cycle is accomplished by single&#8208;electron transfer (SET).

         <dc:description>Iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C2&#8208;alkylation of indole derivatives with terminal alkenes proceeded to give branched alkylation products with high enantioselectivity (39&#8211;99% yields, 20&#8211;91% ee). The reaction of indole derivatives having an &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;substituted benzimidazolyl as a directing group gave the branch&#8208;selective alkylated products. Styrene derivatives and allylsilanes were good substrates displaying high enantioselectivity. The directing group was readily removed in several ways.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Aminopiperidines via I(III)&#8208;Mediated Olefin Diamination with (Hetero)aryl Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3&#8208;Aminopiperidines are a valuable motif present in small molecule pharmaceuticals and bioactive natural products. Synthesis of these moieties via olefin diamination would be an attractive approach, however significant challenges remain with regards to both regioselectivity and exogenous nucleophile scope. Herein, we report a metal&#8208;free olefin diamination via a &#8220;heterocyclic group transfer&#8220; (HGT) reaction of I(III) N&#8208;HVI reagents, giving rise to 3&#8208;aminopiperidines with high selectivity. The HGT strategy leverages heteroarenes as oxidatively masked amine nucleophiles, giving rise to (hetero)arylonium salt products which are isolated via simple trituration and provide a versatile handle for downstream diversification. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and broad scope with regards to both the heteroarene nucleophile and olefin. This represents only the second 6&#8208;endo selective I(III)&#8208;mediated diamination reaction and the use of (hetero)arene nucleophiles provides practical and synthetic advantages over prior approaches. Mechanistic studies indicate ring opening of an intermediate aziridinium ion is responsible for the 6&#8208;endo selectivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>2&#8208;Pyrazolines are important five&#8208;membered heterocycles, containing two adjacent nitrogen atoms. They can incorporate various functional groups and possess unique biological properties. Moreover, they have been used as useful building blocks. In recent years, the field of 2&#8208;pyrazoline synthesis has experienced enormous progress. Novel strategies have been developed, and many studies reporting improvements or adaptations of existing protocols have been published, giving access to new functionalizations, unexplored structures, and/or enantioselective synthesis. This review summarizes the progress made in synthetic methodologies during the period from 2012 to 2022.

         <title>Mechanochemical defluorinative acylation of ortho&#8208;hydroxyarylenaminones by CF3&#8210;compounds: Synthesis of 3&#8208;acylchromones.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An alternative strategy for the mechanochemical defluorinative acylation of ortho&#8208;hydroxyarylenaminones has been developed  to synthesise 3&#8208;acylchromones utilizing CF3&#8210;compounds via activation of the C&#8210;F bound of the trifluoromethyl group in the presence of ytterbia (Yb2O3). The current protocol tolerated a wide range of coupling substrates to access a library of diversely substituted 3&#8208;acylchromones under the mechanochemically induced domino cyclisation mode. This is the first report for the deflourinative transformation of the inert CF3 group to the corresponding carbonyl functionality under the mechanochemical conditions.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An alternative strategy for the mechanochemical defluorinative acylation of ortho-hydroxyarylenaminones has been developed  to synthesise 3-acylchromones utilizing CF3&#8210;compounds via activation of the C&#8210;F bound of the trifluoromethyl group in the presence of ytterbia (Yb2O3). The current protocol tolerated a wide range of coupling substrates to access a library of diversely substituted 3-acylchromones under the mechanochemically induced domino cyclisation mode. This is the first report for the deflourinative transformation of the inert CF3 group to the corresponding carbonyl functionality under the mechanochemical conditions.

Abstract
A chemoselecive cyclodehydration of &#945;&#8208;acyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;arylaminoacrylamides via an electrophilic activation strategy has been described. A series of substituted 4&#8208;aminopyridines are chemoselectively prepared in 73&#8211;92% yields from &#945;&#8208;acyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;arylaminoacrylamides activated by hexaphenyloxodiphosphonium triflate (Hendrickson reagent), whereas substituted diaza[n]phenacenes (n=4&#8211;6) are obtained in 72&#8211;93% yields directly from &#945;&#8208;acyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;arylaminoacrylamides using Hendrickson reagent in combination with triflic anhydride (Tf2O). The synthetic protocols feature with readily available starting materials, mild reaction conditions, simple execution, and wide range of synthetic potential of products.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Enabled Photo&#8208;Sulfonylation of Aryl Halides Using Alkylsulfinates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photochemical synthetic method to access sulfones from aryl halides and sodium alkyl sufinates in the presence of CuCl is reported. Regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity for the sulfonylation is observed for polyhalogenated arenes.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A photochemical synthetic method to access sulfones from aryl halides and sodium alkyl sufinates in the presence of CuCl is reported. Regio- and chemoselectivity for the sulfonylation is observed for polyhalogenated arenes. Mechanistic studies indicate that a copper sulfinate reagent is formed in situ from CuCl and sodium sulfinate based on NMR experiments. Potential reaction intermediates, including excited state aryl halides are studied using density functional theory calculations and reveal energetically accessible non-planar triplet geometries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Diazonium Salts to Optically Active 1&#8208;Arylpropan&#8208;2&#8208;ols through a Sequential Photobiocatalytic Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic Meerwein arylation between aromatic diazonium salts and isopropenyl acetate under blue LED light irradiation in aqueous medium has been deeply investigated. Optimization of the reaction conditions in terms of substrate concentration, ester equivalents, cosolvent type and amount, reaction time and photocatalyst source, has allowed the access to a variety of 1&#8208;arylpropan&#8208;2&#8208;ones with yields up to 95% using 9&#8208;mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methylacridinium perchlorate ([Acr&#8208;Mes]ClO4). Next, the design of a one&#8208;pot sequential photobiocatalytic linear approach was accomplished, by the combination of the Meerwein arylation with the bioreduction of the corresponding ketone intermediates. Thus, a total of 19 pairs of 1&#8208;arylpropan&#8208;2&#8208;ol enantiomers were obtained depending on the alcohol dehydrogenase stereopreference. Global yields up to 76% were attained with high to excellent stereoselectivity (90 to &gt;99% ee). Also, it was possible to get access to both 1&#8208;phenylpropan&#8208;2&#8208;ol antipodes (51&#8208;53% yield) starting from aniline through a one&#8208;pot three&#8208;step sequential photobiocatalytic protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Difluoromethylation of Alkenes with Difluoroacetic Anhydride: Reactivity of Fluorinated Diacyl Peroxides and Radicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the importance of difluoromethylated molecules for drug and agrochemical development, much attention has been drawn to the establishment of related synthetic protocols, as exemplified by the CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H radical&#8208;mediated catalytic difluoromethylation of alkenes. However, most of these difluoromethylations proceed under photocatalytic conditions, whereas those requiring thermal conditions are few. Herein, we developed a general and practical method of Cu&#8208;catalyzed alkene difluoromethylation with difluoroacetic anhydride (DFAA) as a CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H source, showing that the thus realized amino&#8208;, allylic&#8208;, and oxy&#8208;difluoromethylations involve bis(difluoroacetyl) peroxide (BDFAP) in situ generated from DFAA and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and further demonstrating the occurrence of carbo&#8208;difluoromethylation under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The obtained results pave the way to the simple and efficient synthesis of a broad range of difluoromethylated species and thus facilitate their practical applications, including those in medicinal and agricultural chemistry. Moreover, we probed the mechanisms of the observed transformations, rationalized the extraordinary fast decomposition of BDFAP compared to that of diacyl peroxides containing CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl groups, and performed DFT calculations to shed light on the low stability and decomposition mode of BDFAP. Finally, we examined the influence of fluorinated radical philicity on the reaction outcome.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Decyanations of Unactivated Carbon&#8211;CN Bonds: Recent Achievements and Mechanistic Studies</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decyanation is an important process in the synthesis of aromatic molecules in the studies of pharmaceutical research, medical and materials sciences. In late&#8208;stage modifications of privileged carbo/heterocyclic scaffolds, radical&#8208;type decyanation techniques have been devised to date. As a result, the chemistry of cyano&#8208;involved conversions, a hotly debated subject over the past few decades, has advanced significantly. The cyano group (CN), on the other hand, has rarely been acknowledged as a good reaction site due to its thermodynamic robustness. The most recent advancements in catalytic radical decyanation protocols that CN behaved as a leaving group has made are surveyed in this article. Following the introduction of a number of different reaction modes, the catalytic reactions that are used to activate the C&#8208;CN bonds are primarily categorized, and the text herein are divided into three groups: (1) photo&#8208;catalyzed decyanation transformations, (2) electro&#8208;catalyzed decyanation transformations, and (3) transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed or metal&#8208;free decyanation transformations. With an emphasis on the catalytic systems and synthetic applications in C&#8211;CN bond activation, this review will provide the readers with an overview of decyanation chemistry in radical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Remote Stereocontrolled Additions of In Situ Formed Electron&#8208;Deficient Conjugate Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugate addition is one of the most powerful and practical methods for the formation of carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds in organic synthesis. Owing to the rapid development of asymmetric catalysis, significant progress has been made in the field of asymmetric conjugate addition, such as 1,4&#8208;addition and 1,6&#8208;addition. However, formidable challenge of controlling chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity arises with the extended conjugated systems. Recently, with the aid of Br&#248;nsted acids catalysis, functionalized benzyl alcohols and indolylmethanols has been successfully developed as suitable precursors of electron&#8208;deficient conjugate systems for organocatalytic remote stereocontrolled conjugate additions. This review investigates the advances in the field of organocatalytic enantioselective 1,8&#8208;conjugate addition and 1,10&#8208;conjugate addition of in situ formed electron&#8208;deficient conjugate	systems from functionalized alcohols, which is organized according to the substrates.

         <title>Divergent Hydroxysulfenylation and Chlorosulfonylation of Styrenes with Sulfinyl Chlorides Steered by Controlled Disproportionation of Sulfoxide&#8208;Onium Ions</title>

Abstract
Herein, sulfinyl chlorides and styrenes have been exploited to afford either &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;phenylethyl sulfides catalyzed by homogenous ZnCl2, or &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208;phenylethyl sulfones mediated by heterogeneous CuO nanoparticles (NPs). The key to achieve such a divergent synthetic strategy is the controlled disproportionation process of sulfoxide&#8208;onium ions, induced by different metal complexes. Owing to the mild conditions, a wide range of functional groups and heterocycles could be tolerated by both of the protocols. The mechanistic studies reveal the key role of sulfoxide&#8208;onium ions in both of the reaction pathways, and suggest that metal&#8208;steered disproportionation defines the oxidation state of sulfur in products.

         <title>Merging Continuous Flow Technology, Photochemistry and Biocatalysis to Streamline Steroid Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since their structural elucidation in 1935, the introduction and substitution of functional groups and the modification of the steroidal scaffolds have been a fertile ground of research for synthetic and medicinal chemists. The discovery of steroids with hormonal and pharmacological activity has stimulated tremendous efforts to the development of highly selective and efficient synthetic procedures. Despite the progress made, steroid chemistry remains challenging and the preparation of steroidal compounds of pharmaceutical interests and in clinical practice, often requires long and elaborated synthesis. In recent years, a new impetus in the field came with the advent of enabling chemical technologies, such as continuous flow chemistry, which are exploited to overcome problems that arise from batch synthesis. Although it is still a niche sector, the use of flow technology in steroid synthesis and functionalization holds the premise to empower methodology development and to provide innovative tactics also for many hitherto uncharted chemistries. In this review, scientific contributions are reported and discussed in terms of flow set&#8208;up and advantages offered concerning process efficiency, optimization, waste minimization, safety improvement, easy scale&#8208;up and costs. We also highlight the main challenges, key improvements and the future trajectory in the application of continuous flow chemistry and its implementation to different disciplines such as photochemistry and biocatalysis with the ultimate goal of streamlining steroid synthesis.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reductive functionalization between two electrophiles represents a straightforward protocol to access carbon&#8208;carbon bonds without generating organometallic reagents beforehand. Here, we developed a manganese&#8208;mediated reductive alkylation of heterocyclic thiazolyl&#8208;phosphonium salts with benzyl bromides to form C2&#8208;alkylated benzothiazoles. The method features a broad substrate scope, high&#8208;functional&#8208;group tolerance, and can be utilized in late&#8208;stage modification of complex natural products and bioactive molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluoroalkyl Iodides in Fluoroalkylative Difunctionalization of C&#8208;C Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated alkyl iodides serve as a convenient and inexpensive source of fluoroalkyl radicals that can readily undergo addition to the C&#8208;C unsaturated bonds of alkynes and alkenes which is the foundation for a variety of useful synthetic protocols. Since 2010 this field has witnessed huge progress in several respects. First the portfolio of fluorinated alkyl iodides was extended beyond only simple perfluoroalkyl iodides (CnF2n+1I). In particular, employment of iododifluoro&#8208;methyl&#8208; carbonyls and phosphonates has enabled facile installation of the medicinally relevant difluoromethylene motif. Secondly, from a conceptual point of view, novel strategies for activation of fluoroalkyl iodides towards radical formation have been introduced, relying on the formation of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes, photoredox catalysis, frustrated Lewis pairs and transition metal catalysis, complementing prior approaches based on heat and UV induced C&#8208;I homolysis, radical initiators, and simple electron transfer processes. Based on these strategies a range of novel fluoroalkylative transformations of unsaturated systems have been added to classical iodoperfluoroalkylation. Broadly applicable protocols for simple fluoroalkylation and hydrofluoroalkylation, as well as for more sophisticated, complexity&#8208;building methods of fluoroalkylation&#8208;annulation and tandem multicomponent fluoroalkylations with concomitant installation of another functionality have been recently disclosed. 
This review summarizes the progress achieved since 2010 in the reactivity of fluoroalkyl iodides towards alkenes and alkynes with emphasis placed on the above&#8208;mentioned advances.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Quinolones through Radical C&#8211;H Functionalization/Cyclization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Divergent synthesis is an effective, yet challenging method to selectively access different molecules from a single starting material. Herein, we demonstrate a divergent and controllable synthesis of quinolones by sulfonyl chloride&#8208;controlled, copper&#8208;catalyzed, site&#8208;selective radical C&#8211;H functionalization/cyclization of quinoline scaffolds. Our catalytic system can tolerate a wide range of functional groups and provide both 2&#8208;thioquinolone and 4&#8208;quinolone derivatives in moderate to good yields. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations indicate a single&#8208;electron transfer mechanism, and the steric hindrance of sulfonyl chlorides and their electronic effect are decisive for reaction selectivity. This transformation provides not only a novel example of divergent radical C&#8211;H functionalization controlled by small organic molecules, but also an efficient way to rapidly derivatize medicinally important scaffolds and ultimately facilitate late&#8208;stage drug modification.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A cobaltaelectro catalyzed oxidatively dehydrogenative [4+2] annulation of arylphosphinamides with alkynes to selectively construct a series of cyclic phosphinamide derivatives is described. Picolinic acid behaved as a powerful and efficient ligand to promote this transformation. 38 examples demonstrated the broad substrate scope, good functional tolerance and excellent regioselectivity of this reaction. Moreover, avoidance of the usage of oxidants and electrolytes showed its environmental&#8208;friendly nature. In addition, gram scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage diversification as well as removal of the directing group could be easily realized. Cyclic voltammetry  and kinetic isotope experiments gave a better understanding on reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Activation of 3&#8208;Membered Rings: Cyclopropanes, Epoxides, Azirines and Aziridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The activations of carbonyl compounds bearing cyclopropyl, epoxyl, azirine and aziridinyl groups by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organic catalysts are reviewed. The reactions are introduced and discussed from 3 aspects according to the activation modes involved in these transformations. A brief summary on the achievements and the remaining challenges in NHC&#8208;catalyzed activation of cyclopropanes and their analogues is given at the end of this minireview. Our own perspectives on the future development within this highly active research field are also provided.

&lt;p&gt;The activations of carbonyl compounds bearing cyclopropyl, epoxyl, azirine and aziridinyl groups by N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organic catalysts are reviewed. The reactions are introduced and discussed from 3 aspects according to the activation modes involved in these transformations. A brief summary on the achievements and the remaining challenges in NHC-catalyzed activation of cyclopropanes and their analogues is given at the end of this minireview. Our own perspectives on the future development within this highly active research field are also provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Enantioselective Intramolecular Hydroacylation of Alkynes by Rhodium Catalysis through Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>

Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroacylation of racemic alkynals having a substituent at the &#945;&#8208;position of the carbonyl group is described. This reaction can be applied for the wide range of substrates (22 examples), and mechanistic studies revealed that a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process occurs during the hydroacylation, giving various cyclic ketones in 47&#8211;93% yields with 59:41 to 97:3 er from racemic starting materials.

         <title>In situ generated, tetracoordinated Copper(II)&#8208;Quinoline Complexes as Photocatalysts for the Chlorosulfonylation of Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of copper complexes were synthesized and studied as photocatalysts for the chlorosulfonylation of olefins. Featuring a tetradentate ligand consisting of one amino quinoline and two methyl pyridine moieties, the resulting Cu(II)&#8208;complex is effective under visible light irradiation to add sulfonyl chlorides to alkenes and alkynes, including unactivated aliphatic olefins. A weak base additive such as Na2CO3 prevents catalyst poisoning, resulting in an improvement of reaction yields and catalyst lifetime. A broad scope of sulfonyl chlorides and alkenes/alkynes as coupling partners are amenable for the title process, including examples previously reported unsuccessful with established copper&#8208;based photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress in Synthetic Applications of Cyclic Hypervalent Iodine(III) Reagents</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Hypervalent iodine compounds have found broad application in modern organic chemistry as reagents and catalysts. Cyclic hypervalent iodine reagents based on the benziodoxole heterocyclic system have higher stability compared to their acyclic analogues, which makes possible the preparation and safe handling of the reagents with special ligands such as azido, cyano, and trifluoromethyl groups. Numerous iodine&#8208;substituted benziodoxole derivatives have been prepared and utilized as reagents for transfer of the substituent on hypervalent iodine to organic substrate. Reactions of these reagents with organic substrates can be performed under metal&#8208;free conditions, in the presence of transition metal catalysts, or using photocatalysts under photoirradiation conditions. In this review, we focus on the most recent synthetic applications of cyclic hypervalent iodine(III) reagents with the following ligands: N3, NHR, CN, CF3, SCF3, OR, OAc, ONO2, and C(=N2)CO2R. The review covers literature published mainly in the last 5&#8197;years.

Abstract
In the last decade, free radicals have found a wide application in functionalization of unsaturated compounds, such as alkenes, alkynes, and arenes, via the free&#8208;radical addition to carbon&#8208;carbon &#960;&#8208;bonds. In these processes, intermolecular free&#8208;radical attack on the aromatic substrates represents a challenge due to relatively high resistance of aromatic &#960;&#8208;system to addition reactions in comparison to alkene C=C bonds. The free&#8208;radical functionalization of heterocycles is especially interesting due to the diversity of their structures and chemical properties as well as their importance for medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and materials science. Addition of C&#8208;centered radicals to heterocycles is widely known as the Minisci&#8208;type reactions and well&#8208;reviewed. In this paper, we have summarized the main achievements in less explored group of processes: functionalization of heterocycles by intermolecular addition of heteroatom&#8208;centered radicals (O&#8208;, N&#8208;, S&#8208;/Se&#8208;, and P&#8208;radicals) with the emphasis on the papers published after 2010. Literature analysis revealed the strong trend towards the usage of electrochemistry and photoredox&#8208;catalysis for the generation of free radicals in recent years. The remaining fundamental problem in this field is the lack of strong experimental support for the proposed mechanisms and frequent existence of several plausible reaction pathways. The progress in mechanistic studies can significantly improve the prediction of optimal reaction conditions depending on the substrates structure.

The free-radical functionalization of heterocycles is especially interesting due to the diversity of their structures and chemical properties as well as their importance for medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and materials science. Addition of C-centered radicals to heterocycles is widely known as the Minisci-type reactions and well-reviewed. In this paper, we have summarized the main achievements in less explored group of processes: functionalization of heterocycles by intermolecular addition of heteroatom-centered radicals (O-, N-, S-/Se-, and P-radicals) with the emphasis on the papers published after 2010. Literature analysis revealed the strong trend towards the usage of electrochemistry and photoredox-catalysis for the generation of free radicals in recent years.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An aerobic coupling of benzhydryl phosphonium salts with simple alkenes for accessing trisubstituted olefins is developed under metal&#8208;free, catalyst&#8208;free, and additive&#8208;free conditions. New C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) bond is constructed via the C&#8208;P and C&#8208;H bond functionalization by synergistically using O2 as a &#8220;green&#8221; oxidant and DMSO as a promoter. The method also distinguishes itself by its broad substrate scope and synthetic potential. Particularly, the use of 1,3,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzene fragment in the resulting products as a carbon&#8208;based leaving group for further transformations is proved to be feasible.</dc:description>

Abstract
A series of 2,4&#8208;dithiohydantoins were synthesized regiospecificlly from various phenacyl sulfoxides bearing 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazole and N&#8208;substituted thioureas in moderate to excellent yields. The proposed mechanism involved the generation of &#945;&#8208;sulfines from sulfoxides through thermolytic elimination, carbonphilic attack of sulfines by substituted thioureas, and dehydration condensation. The current method provides a safe strategy for the preparation of 2,4&#8208;dithiohydantoins.

Abstract
A new N&#8722;F reagent, N,N&#8242;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium bis(tetrafluoroborate), for iodoarene&#8208;catalyzed fluorination reactions as a terminal oxidant is reported. This reaction is effective for the fluorination of simple alkenes, aromatic alkenes and 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds, giving 1,2&#8208;difluorinated alkanes, geminal difluorinated compounds, 2&#8208;fluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds in good to high yields, respectively. This is a useful fluorination reaction that not only improves the issues of the fluorination reaction using conventional mCPBA as a terminal oxidant but also constructs a simpler catalytic cycle. The present N&#8722;F reagent can be recovered as 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Dual C&#8722;H Activation for Regioselective Triple Annulation of Enaminones: Access to Polycyclic Naphthopyran Derivatives</title>

Abstract
Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation of arenes for oxidative annulations with alkynes stands out as a protocol for polycyclic scaffolds. This perspective drives us to disclose herein a rhodium catalyzed regioselective triple annulation of enaminones with hydroxyl&#8208;alkynoates via double C&#8722;H functionalization for polycyclic naphtho&#8208;pyran scaffolds. Secondary coordination of OH in alkynoate dictated the regioselectivity. Initial lactonization occurred chemoselectively on to enamine part via carbo rhodation followed by reductive elimination. This protocol was scalable and has shown high functionality tolerance. KIE studies were done to get insight in to the mechanism, and some downstream transformations were achieved to show the synthetic potential of the method.

         <title>Synthesis of Fluoroalkylated Pyrrolidines through Neat Reaction of Fluoroalkyl Iodides with N, N&#8208;Diallylamines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We presented a cascade transformation of N, N&#8208;diallylamines and fluoroalkyl iodides into various functionalized fluoroalkylated pyrrolidines through a visible light&#8208;induced synthetic process in the solvent&#8208;free conditions. In this reaction system, the substrate N, N&#8208;diallylamine acted both as the base and the electron donor. We further demonstrated the practicality of this protocol by the direct modification of amino acids and pharmaceutical molecules.

         <title>Multifaceted Domino Knoevenagel&#8208;Cyclization Reactions; Four Movements for 2H&#8208;Chromenes and Chromans</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Domino Knoevenagel&#8208;cyclization reactions of 2H&#8208;chromene and chroman derivatives containing o&#8208;formylaryl amine or ether side&#8208;chain was carried out to produce four series of chiral condensed heterocycles representing four novel skeletons and exhibiting antiproliferative activity. The cyclization step occurred with four different mechanisms: a concerted intramolecular hetero Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (IMHDA), a stepwise polar [2+2] cycloaddition, a [1,5]&#8208;hydride shift&#8208;6&#8208;endo cyclization or a multi&#8208;step nitro hetero Diels&#8208;Alder&#8208;ring&#8208;opening&#8208;Cadogan&#8208;type cyclization sequence. The latter reaction provided a new route to hydroxyindoles by an inverse Cadogan&#8208;type cyclization, in which the nitro group is deoxygenated by a nitro IMHDA&#8208;ring&#8208;opening sequence. The cyclization mechanisms and their stereoselectivity were studied by DFT calculations, based on which we proposed a mechanism for the multi&#8208;step cyclization to hydroxyindoles and explained the observed diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Construction of Functionalized Isocoumarin, Flavone, and Isoquinolinedione via a One&#8208;pot Reaction of o&#8208;Quinol Acetate and Soft Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot strategy for the synthesis of substituted isocoumarin, flavone, and isoquinolinedione derivatives through a switchable C&#8208;arylation/lactonization or SNAr reaction from a wide range of soft nucleophiles and o&#8208;quinol acetates has been developed. This base&#8208;mediated protocol proceeds under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions and selectively affords various heteroarenes in 13&#8211;98% yields from readily prepared or commercially available 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl and &#945;&#8208;EWG&#8208;substituted carbonyl compounds. The synthetic utility is further demonstrated in the synthesis of potential anti&#8208;HIV and anti&#8208;coronavirus derivatives and COX&#8208;2 inhibitors. In addition, detailed experimental and computational studies are performed to provide an intensive understanding and strong support of the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Short and Scalable Synthesis of Plant&#8208;Based Cholesterol in GMP Grade</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A plant&#8208;based straightforward and short four&#8208;step synthesis of cholesterol starting from commercially available diosgenin is reported. This offers a large&#8208;scale production of highly needed GMP&#8208;grade cholesterol, which is part of the lipid cocktail for the assembly of effective mRNA&#8208;based vaccines against the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. These lipids are formulated into the delivery system of the mRNA fragments by forming Lipid Nano Particles (LNP) that introduce the mRNA into the cells. Cholesterol plays a crucial role because it stabilizes LNP and facilitates endosome escape of the mRNA into the cytosol.

Abstract
In this study, regio&#8208; and diastereoselective ring&#8208;opening cyclization of spirocyclopropanes with phosphorus ylides stabilized by electron&#8208;withdrawing groups were developed. The reaction of various cyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione&#8208;2&#8208;spirocyclopropanes with phosphorus ylides bearing alkoxycarbonyl groups proceeded smoothly without any additives to provide the corresponding 6,7&#8208;dihydroindan&#8208;4&#8208;ones in 32&#8211;87% yields. Cycloheptane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione&#8208;2&#8208;spirocyclopropanes were also used in this reaction, producing the corresponding products 1,2,3,6,7,8&#8208;hexahydroazulen&#8208;4&#8208;ones in 52&#8211;67% yields. The resulting [5.6]&#8208; and [5.7]&#8208;fused carbocyclic products were readily converted into highly substituted indanes and azulenes, respectively, by oxidation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, regio- and diastereoselective ring-opening cyclization of spirocyclopropanes with phosphorus ylides stabilized by electron-withdrawing groups were developed. The reaction of various cyclohexane-1,3-dione-2-spirocyclopropanes with phosphorus ylides bearing alkoxycarbonyl groups proceeded smoothly without any additives to provide the corresponding 6,7-dihydroindan-4-ones in 32&#8211;87% yields. Cycloheptane-1,3-dione-2-spirocyclopropanes were also used in this reaction, producing the corresponding products 1,2,3,6,7,8-hexahydroazulen-4-ones in 52&#8211;67% yields. The resulting [5.6]- and [5.7]-fused carbocyclic products were readily converted into highly substituted indanes and azulenes, respectively, by oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
We described an Rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed divergent C&#8722;H bond functionalization of N&#8208;aryl amidines with iodonium ylides. Carbazolones and zwitterionic salts were diversely constructed through intermolecular annulation and intramolecular proton transfer under the different reaction conditions. This protocol is operationally simple and tolerates a variety of functional groups. The efficient post&#8208;modification of pharmaceutical molecules demonstrates its practicability.

Abstract
Merging the latest advances in the field of gold catalysis and the efficiency of hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP), a gold&#8208;catalyzed orthogonal tandem reaction has been developed to access carbocyclic ketone on naphthalene substrates. The methodology involved a cycloisomerization/nucleophilic addition and a C&#8594;O rearrangement. The HFIP solvent most probably acted as a Lewis&#8208;acid on isochromene derivatives, through hydrogen donor bond activity. A large range of acenaphthylene carbaldehyde has been engaged in this process coupling gold catalysis and Lewis&#8208;acid behavior of HFIP leading to cyclic ketones with a yield ranging from 15 to 91% (27 compounds). The mechanism was investigated, and the reaction most presumably occurred via a classical cyclization process followed by a [Au]&#8208;HFIP interaction for the final rearrangement. The interest of such transformation was demonstrated by performing it on a gram&#8208;scale. Moreover, a post&#8208;functionalization bromination was performed, as well as the isomerization of some functionalized ketones leading to full trans derivatives with a yield ranging from 78 to 90% yields.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Trisubstituted Piperidines via Biocatalytic Transamination and Diastereoselective Enamine or Imine Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Substituted piperidine rings are a common motif in natural products and pharmaceutical drugs. The asymmetric synthesis of piperidines bearing multiple stereocentres remains a challenge, and current approaches often rely on lengthy reaction sequences and &#8216;chiral pool&#8217; strategies. Herein, we report multi&#8208;enzymatic and chemo&#8208;enzymatic methods that allow the preparation of piperidines with three chirality centres in only two steps from achiral diketoester precursors. Stereocontrol is achieved by a highly enantioselective transamination leading to optically pure (ee &gt;99%) enamine or imine intermediates, followed by diastereoselective reduction of these unsaturated N&#8208;heterocycles using either platinum(0)&#8208;catalysed flow hydrogenation or enzymatic imine reduction. In the latter case, coupling of the two biocatalytic reactions in a concurrent one&#8208;pot process is possible, thus reducing the synthetic sequence to a single biotransformation. In total, nine trisubstituted piperidines were prepared in high stereoisomeric purities (dr &#8805;98:2) and isolated yields of up to 73%. Lead&#8208;likeness analysis of five representative products using an open&#8208;source webtool suggests that these compounds possess considerable application potential as building blocks in drug discovery.

Stereocontrol is achieved by a highly enantioselective transamination leading to optically pure (&lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt;99%) enamine or imine intermediates, followed by diastereoselective reduction of these unsaturated N-heterocycles using either platinum(0)-catalysed flow hydrogenation or enzymatic imine reduction. In the latter case, coupling of the two biocatalytic reactions in a concurrent one-pot process is possible, thus reducing the synthetic sequence to a single biotransformation. In total, nine trisubstituted piperidines were prepared in high stereoisomeric purities (&lt;i&gt;dr&lt;/i&gt; &#8805;98:2) and isolated yields of up to 73%. Lead-likeness analysis of five representative products using an open-source webtool suggests that these compounds possess considerable application potential as building blocks in drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Construction of Fluorinated Chiral Alcohols via Sequential Substitution/Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Bromoarylketones and Fluoroalcohols</title>

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot synthesis of fluorinated chiral alcohols from &#945;&#8208;bromoarylketones and fluoroalcohols is described. The fluorinated ketone intermediates were formed from &#945;&#8208;bromoarylketones with fluoroalcohols as nucleophiles and solvents, which were reduced subsequentially by adding a chiral Ru catalyst and a mixture of formic acid and triethyl amines (FA: TEA=1.1:1) as hydrogen donor to give 27 examples of fluorinated chiral alcohols in 60&#8211;93% yields and 85&#8211;98% ee values. Notably, K3PO4 acts as a base in nucleophilic substitution and an additive in reductive step to enhance the reactivity and enantioselectivity, which is crucial for constructing compatible conditions for one&#8208;pot process. This one&#8208;pot process is also applicable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis.
