         <title>Recent Development of Recoverable MacMillan Catalysts for Asymmetric Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral imidazolidinone as an organocatalyst was developed by MacMillan and co&#8208;workers in 2000 and they evaluated this organocatalyst originally in the enantioselective Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. Later, this catalyst was used in a number of other asymmetric organic transformations. Chiral organocatalysts are expensive, therefore their recoverability and reusability are highly desirable to make the organic transformation economically viable for industrial application. Hence, the chiral imidazolidinone was modified and attached to different supports for its recoverability and reusability. A number of recoverable imidazolidinones have been reported in asymmetric Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. In this review, we have summarized the reports on reusable and recoverable imidazolidinones (MacMillan catalysts) as organocatalysts in asymmetric organic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Room Temperature Benzofused Lactam Synthesis Enabled by Cobalt(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H Amidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzofused lactams, especially indolin&#8208;2&#8208;one and dihydroquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;one are popular structural motives in durgs and natural products. Herein, we developed a room temperature and robust synthesis of benzofused lactams through cobalt(III)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H amidation. In this protocol, in&#8208;situ formation of Cp*Co(III)(ligand) catalyst from Cp*Co(CO)I2 and ligand simplify the synthetic effort of cobalt complexes. Simple and readily synthesized 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones underwent room temperature intramolecular C&#8722;H amidation and afforded a wide variety of functionalized benzofused lactams in up to 80% yield. The scalability of the reaction is demonstrated and the competition and deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments were also probed.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Conjugate Addition of Stabilized Arylzinc Iodide to Enones: an Improved Protocol of the Hayashi Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Stabilised arylzinc iodide, prepared by direct insertion of zinc into aryl iodides, were used as nucleophiles in the Hayashi Rh&#8208;catalysed enantioselective conjugate addition to enones. The reaction conditions were optimized in the addition of phenylzinc iodide to 2&#8208;cyclohexen&#8208;1&#8208;one, obtaining good yields and 99% ee of the addition product. The general applicability of the protocol was checked using different arylzinc iodides and enones. Organometallic reagents endowed with both halogen and electrophilic groups were also successfully used.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Substituted Isothiazoles via Three&#8208;Component Annulation of Alkynones, Xanthate and NH4I</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A protocol was described to access diverse isothiazoles with functionalization potential via transition metal&#8208;free three&#8208;component annulation of alkynones, potassium ethylxanthate (EtOCS2K) and ammonium iodide (NH4I). A sequential regioselective hydroamination/thiocarbonylation/intramolecular cyclization cascade achieved the efficient formation of consecutive C&#8722;N, C&#8722;S and N&#8722;S bonds in a one&#8208;pot process.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Calothrixin B via an Intramolecular Baylis&#8208;Hillman Cyclization/6&#960; Electrocyclization/Dehydro&#8208;aromatization Sequence and a Specific Oxidative Quinone Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A short total synthesis of bioactive alkaloid calothrixin B have been accomplished with atom and step economy from commercially available starting materials. The key cyclization involved a Baylis&#8722;Hillman/6&#960; electrocyclization/dehydroaromatiz&#8208;ation sequence to construct the pentacyclic skeleton. Reduction of the resulting lactam followed by oxidation led to the characteristic quino[4,3&#8208;b]carbazole framework. This intermediate underwent a direct oxidation with high regioselectivity to yield the final product.

         <title>Reactions of Organophosphorus Compounds with Arynes: Reactivity and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Aryl phosphorus compounds have found versatile applications in materials, medicinal and synthetic chemistry. As a powerful tool, aryne chemistry has been widely utilized in constructing aryl C&#8722;P bonds under mild conditions; this has enabled facile access to a variety of structurally diverse aryl&#8211;phosphorus compounds with good efficiency. The present review aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the chemistry between arynes and organophosphorus compounds, with emphasis placed on reactivity modes and mechanistic aspects. According to the valency of phosphorus atoms, this paper is divided into two main sections, reactions of arynes with organophosphorus(III) compounds and those with organophosphorus(V) compounds.

Abstract
Organic azides are highly reactive, which have long established as versatile building blocks in the assembly of structurally diverse N&#8208;containing heterocycles. The conversion of organic azides into high&#8208;value compounds is of great importance and a subject of enormous current interest. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H amination/annulation of organic azides provides a powerful tool for the transformation of organic azides into a wide range of biologically important heterocyclic frameworks. In this review, we aim to summarize the recent progress on organic azides&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8722;H amination/annulation for N&#8208;heterocycle synthesis enabled by transition metal catalysts. Representative strategies are discussed in detail, including catalytic systems, reaction scopes, limitations and mechanisms.

Abstract
The site&#8208;selective functionalization of biologically important nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles and related derivatives remains a challenging and important task. We report herein on the direct regiodivergent N1/C2 phosphorylation of free indole derivatives. Cyclic voltammograms and EPR data indicate that by utilizing different electrolyte&#8208;mediated anodic oxidation to generate different active indole species, a diverse collection of N1 and C2 phosphorylation products could be obtained in moderate to high yields under exogenous&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free and metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free electrochemical conditions. In addition, N&#8722;P coupling was also found to be compatible with various alkylamines.

         <title>Hydroxyl Assisted, Photoredox/Cobalt Co&#8208;catalyzed Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation and Tandem Cyclization of o&#8208;Alkynylphenols for Access to 2,3&#8208;Dihydrobenzofurans</title>

Abstract
Herein, a hydroxyl assisted, photoredox/cobalt co&#8208;catalyzed semi&#8208;hydrogenation and tandem cyclization of o&#8208;alkynylphenols is developed towards direct assembly of 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans. Moderate to good yields were obtained for a range of sterically and electronically diverse 2&#8208;propynolphenols under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies demonstrated the inevitable role of the alcoholic hydroxyl group with (Z)&#8208;alkene as the real intermediate. Finally, a key low&#8208;valent cobalt catalyzed intramolecular hydroetherification of alkene is proposed.

         <title>Engineering an Alcohol Dehydrogenase from Kluyveromyces polyspora for Efficient Synthesis of Ibrutinib Intermediate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>(S)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypiperidine [(S)&#8208;NBHP] is a key intermediate for the synthesis of mantle cell lymphoma drug, ibrutinib. Here, KpADH, an alcohol dehydrogenase from Kluyveromyces polyspora, exhibits evolutionary potential in the asymmetric reduction of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;3&#8208;piperidone (NBPO) to (S)&#8208;NBHP. By screening key resi&#8208;dues in substrate binding pocket of KpADH, an excellent variant Y127W was obtained with 6&#8208;fold improved activity of 119.3 U&#183;mg&#8208;1, 1.8&#8208;fold enhanced half&#8208;life of 147 h and strict S&#8208;stereoselectivity (&gt;99% ee). When catalyzed by Y127W, a complete conversion of 600 g&#183;L&#8208;1 NBPO was achieved at a substrate to catalyst ratio (S/C) of 30 in 10 h. Based on crystal&#8208;structure of Y127W, molecular docking and dynamic simulations reveal hydrogen bonds formed between W127 and Boc group of NBPO, as well as improved structural stability mainly contribute to the increased catalytic activity and stereoselectivity of Y127W. This study offers guidance for engineering ADHs for biosynthesis of chiral hetero&#8208;cyclic alcohols, and provides insights into mechanisms in catalytic activity and stereoselectivity toward car&#8208;bonyl&#8208;containing heterocyclic substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>The synthesis of pyridyl[2.2]paracyclophanes by palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of pyridine sulfinates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Substituted planar chiral pyridyl[2.2]paracyclophanes were prepared by the palladium&#8208;catalyzed desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling of bromo[2.2]paracyclophanes and pyridine sulfinate salts. Pyridine&#8208;substituted [2.2]paracyclophanes are useful building blocks in the preparation of catalysts, functionalized materials, and luminescent molecules. Yet the synthesis of many pyridine&#8208;substituted [2.2]paracyclophanes is more challenging than expected due to the instability of traditional coupling partners. Pyridine sulfinates offer a solution to this 	shortcoming, permitting pyridyl[2.2]paracyclophanes to be prepared from readily available bromo[2.2]paracyclophanes. Our preliminary results indicate the potential of this chemistry. Amine, bromine and ester substituted planar chiral pyridines that are hard to synthesize by other methods were formed but formation of (bis)pyridines is still problematic.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Synthesis of Benzothiophene&#8208;Fused Polycyclic, Eight&#8208;Membered N&#8208;Heterocycles via Amine&#8208;Mediated Three&#8208;Component Domino Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A product&#8208;selective strategy was used to synthesize benzothiophene&#8208;fused polycyclic, eight&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles via a three&#8208;component domino reaction of thioisatins under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The reaction between tryptamine, thioisatin, and bromoacetophenone produced benzothiophene&#8208;fused polycyclic compounds. In contrast, using D&#8208;tryptophan methyl ester hydrochloride instead of tryptamine afforded benzothiophene&#8208;fused eight&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles. DFT calculations showed that the benzothiophene&#8208;fused polycyclic compounds formed via the Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. However, the ester group in D&#8208;tryptophan methyl ester hydrochloride changed the reaction pathway and produced benzothiophene&#8208;fused eight&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioproduction of Enantiopure (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208; and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;2&#8208;Phenylglycinols from Styrenes and Renewable Feedstocks</title>

         <dc:description>Enantiopure (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylglycinols are important chiral building blocks for pharmaceutical manufacturing. Several chemical and enzymatic methods for their synthesis were reported, either involving multi&#8208;step synthesis or starting from a relatively complex chemical. Here, we developed one&#8208;pot simple syntheses of enantiopure (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylglycinols from cheap starting materials and renewable feedstocks. Enzyme cascades consisting of epoxidation&#8208;hydrolysis&#8208;oxidation&#8208;transamination were developed to convert styrene 2a to (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylglycinol 1a, with butanediol dehydrogenase for alcohol oxidation as well as BmTA and NfTA for (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;enantioselective transamination, respectively. The engineered E. coli strains expressing the cascades produced 1015 mg/L (R)&#8208;1a in &gt;99% ee and 315 mg/L (S)&#8208;1a in 91% ee, respectively, from styrene 2a. The same cascade also converted substituted styrenes 2b&#8208;k and indene 2l into substituted (R)&#8208;phenylglycinols 1b&#8208;k and (1R, 2R)&#8208;1&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;indanol 1l in 95&#8208;&gt;99% ee. To transform bio&#8208;based L&#8208;phenylalanine 6 to (R)&#8208;1a and (S)&#8208;1a, (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;enantioselective enzyme cascades for decarboxylation&#8208;deamination&#8208;epoxidation&#8208;hydrolysis&#8208;oxidation&#8208;transamination were developed. The engineered E. coli strains produced (R)&#8208;1a and (S)&#8208;1a in high ee at 576 mg/L and 356 mg/L, respectively, from L&#8208;phenylalanine 6, as the first synthesis of these compounds from a bio&#8208;based chemical. Finally, L&#8208;phenylalanine biosynthesis pathway was combined with (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;enantioselective cascade in one strain or coupled strains, to achieve the first synthesis of (R)&#8208;1a and (S)&#8208;1a from a renewable feedstock. The coupled strain approach enhanced the production, affording 274 and 384 mg/L (R)&#8208;1a and 274 and 301 mg/L (S)&#8208;1a, from glucose and glycerol, respectively. The developed methods could be potentially useful to produce these high&#8208;value chemicals from cheap starting materials and renewable feedstocks in a green and sustainable manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Photoredox Allylation of Aldehydes Promoted by a Cobalt Complex</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. The preparation of homoallylic alcohols by addition organometallic allyl compounds to carbonyls is an important strategy in organic chemistry. Allylating organometallic cobalt species can be generated employing stoichiometric quantities of Zn acting as reductant. To avoid the employment of stoichiometric amount of Zn, we have developed an allylation reaction of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes promoted by photoredox catalysis in the presence of a cobalt complex, and we present herein a full account of our research. In the presence of the abundant CoBr2 (10 mol%), 4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl (dtbbpy, 10 mol%), allyl acetate (3 equiv),	[Ir(dtbbpy)(ppy)2]PF6 (ppy = 2&#8208;phenylpyridine, 2 mol%), and N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (4 equiv), an allylation of aldehydes is taking place, in moderate to good yields. Substrates scope, limitations, and photophysical investigations of this new process are reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Hydrophilic Phosphorus Ligands and Their Application in Aqueous&#8208;Phase Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions in aqueous media are experiencing a constant increase in interest. In homogenous catalysis the use of water as a solvent offers advantages in cost, safety, the possibility of two&#8208;phase catalysis and simplified separation strategies. In the life sciences, transition metal catalysis in aqueous systems enables the ligation or modification of biopolymers in buffer systems or even in their cellular environment. In biocatalysis, aqueous systems allow the simultaneous use of enzymes and transition metal catalysts in cascade reactions. The use of water&#8208;soluble phosphine ligands still represents the most reliable and popular strategy for transferring metal catalysts into the aqueous phase. This review summarizes the recent advancements in this field since 2009 and describes current synthetic strategies for the preparation of hydrophilic phosphines and phosphites. In addition, recent applications of transition metal catalysis in aqueous solvents using these hydrophilic ligands are presented.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed tandem trifluoromethylation/cyclization/remote oxidation of 1,6&#8208;dienes has been achieved. A broad range of trifluoromethyl group&#8208;containing tetrahydrofurans or tetrahydropyrroles could be generated in good yields and with excellent diastereoselectivity by using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as oxidant. The mild and facile protocol affords direct access to trifluoromethyl group&#8208;bearing tetrahydrofurans and tetrahydropyrroles via difunctionalization of olefins.</dc:description>

Abstract
K2CO3&#8208;mediated [4+1] annulation reactions of N&#8208;acetyl hydrazones with bifunctional amino reagents are described, which provide an environmental&#8208;friendly strategy to construct 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles that does not employ metals, azides, organocatalysis, or oxidants. A series of substituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazole derivatives was prepared with good yields.

         <dc:description>Saturated heterocycles are found widely in biologically active compounds such as medicinal drugs and agrochemicals. However, boronic acid&#8208;derived building blocks for these structures have limited availability, particularly in comparison to heteroaromatic boronic acids. We report the preparation of boronic ester &#947;&#8208;lactams through a Cu&#8208;catalysed conjugate borylation&#8208;cyclisation protocol. Using a chiral catalyst, this can be performed in high enantioselectivity. Exploration of the further transformations of these reagents suggest that the boronic esters have much potential as chemical building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective and Diastereoselective C&#8208;Glycosylation by Allyl&#8208;Allyl Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;glycosylation reaction was developed by allyl&#8208;allyl coupling process using Achmatowicz rearrangement products as donors and methylcoumarins as acceptors under mild conditions. This method featured regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities, stereodivergent synthesis of C&#8208;glycosides. The glycosyl donors with controlled stereodiversity and glycosyl acceptors with fluorescent performace further highlighted this methodology.

Abstract
Herein, we disclose a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed regioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization on the piperazine core using aldehydes as alkylating agents. The present transformation appears to go through the dehydrogenation of the piperazine to propagate to enamine in&#8197;situ, followed by nucleophilic addition to the aldehyde and hydrogenation to result in the regioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation. A variety of aromatic, heteroaromatic, aliphatic aldehydes were employed for the C&#8208;3 alkylation of N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;p&#8208;nitrophenyl substituted piperazines.

Abstract
A formation of fused tricyclic [1,3]oxazino[3,4&#8208;a]indol&#8208;1&#8208;ones and dihydropyrimido[1,6&#8208;a]indol&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones via Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed [3+3] or [4+2] annulation of N&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1H&#8208;indole&#8208;1&#8208;carboxamides with sulfoxonium ylides has been developed. These selective annulation reactions were carried out by switching the additives and notable features of this protocol were low catalyst loading and a broad substrate scope providing the corresponding products in up to 99% yields.

Abstract
A direct synthesis of spiro[5.5]and [5.4]&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines has been developed through C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization triggered by sequential [1,5]&#8208; hydride shift /cyclization sequence using ortho amino benzaldehydes and active methylene compounds such as 2&#8208;coumaranone, 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin, 3&#8208;coumaranone, and 3&#8208;isochromanone. This protocol provides a Lewis acid catalyst&#8208;free straight forward one&#8208;pot reaction in cases of 2&#8208;coumaranone and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin, Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed stepwise reaction for 3&#8208;coumaranone and 3&#8208;isochromanone to access a wide range of spiro&#8208;heterocycles in excellent to good yields and diastereoselectivity.

Abstract
A general and efficient photocatalytic annulation&#8208;carbohalogenation of 1,7&#8208;enynes with a wide variety of alkyl halides was reported, which led to the atom&#8208;economic synthesis of functionalized 3,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalen&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones with good yields and high stereoselectivity under the mild and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. The reaction demonstrated remarkable compatibility regarding alkyl halides as bifunctional reagents, such as ethyl 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoroacetate, ethyl 2,2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;iodoacetate, perfluorobutyl iodide, bromotrichloromethane, and diethyl 2&#8208;bromomalonate, and enabled wide substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and 100% atom utilization.

Abstract
We report a polystyrene&#8208;incorporated chiral nickel(II)&#8208;bisdiamine complex, which is accessible on gram&#8208;scale. This metal complex functions as a heterogeneous catalyst for the enantioselective Michael addition between malonates and aliphatic nitroalkenes, and it provides yields and enantioselectivities on par with homogeneous catalysts. Good functional group tolerance is reported for this reaction. Upon recycling, the catalyst achieves significantly higher TONs than previously reported. We demonstrate scalability to multigram&#8208;scale, compatibility with continuous flow production (4.43&#8197;gram), and application to the synthesis of the blockbuster drug Pregabalin. Finally, a new tandem reaction is disclosed.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalysed Reductive Deoxygenation of Ketones with Formic Acid as Traceless Hydride Donor</title>

Abstract
An iridium&#8208;catalysed deoxygenation of ketones and aldehydes is achieved, with formic acid as hydride donor and water as co&#8208;solvent. At low catalyst loading, a number of 4&#8208;(N,N&#8208;disubstituted amino) aryl ketones are readily deoxygenated in excellent yields and chemoselectivity. Numerous functional groups, especially phenolic and alcoholic hydroxyls, secondary amine, carboxylic acid, and alkyl chloride, are well tolerable. Geminally dideuterated alkanes are obtained with up to 90% D incorporation, when DCO2D and D2O are used in place of their hydrogenative counterparts. The activating 4&#8208;(N,N&#8208;disubstituted amino)aryl groups have been demonstrated to undergo a variety of useful transformations. The deoxygenative deuterations have been used to prepare a deuterated drug molecule Chlorambucil&#8208;4,4&#8208;d2.

Thus, hydrogenation of 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxychalcones using EtOH as solvent provided the corresponding 1,3&#8208;diarylpropanes in excellent yields. On the contrary, when the hydrogenation was performed in DCM, the corresponding dihydrochalcones were isolated. Switching the reaction solvent to n&#8208;BuOH/H2O (1:1), afforded 1,3&#8208;diarylpropanols from moderate to good yields. The methodology here reported offers a straightforward, simple and cost&#8208;effective method for the preparation of a wide variety of 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;diarylpropanes derivatives, and was also applied to the preparation of natural Bussealins C and D.

         <title>Consecutive C1&#8208;Homologation / Displacement Strategy for Converting Thiosulfonates into O,S&#8208;Oxothioacetals</title>

Abstract
A conceptually intuitive synthesis of oxothioacetals is reported starting from thiosulfonates as electrophilic sulfur donors. The installation of a reactive CH2Cl motif with a homologating carbenoid reagent, followed by the immediate nucleophilic displacement with alcoholic groups [(hetero)&#8208;aromatic, aliphatic] offer a convenient access to the title compounds. Genuine chemoselectivity is uniformly observed in the case of multi&#8208;functionalized systems.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Stereoselective Synthesis of Fluorinated Amino Alcohols through One&#8208;pot Reactions using Alcohol Dehydrogenases and Amine Transaminases</title>

Abstract
A series of amino alcohols have been prepared in a chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective fashion starting from the corresponding (het)aryl diketones, avoiding tedious chemical protection and deprotection steps. Different alcohol dehydrogenases have been able to selectively reduce the more reactive trifluoroacetyl groups under optimized conditions, while amine transaminases catalyzed the biotransamination of the less hindered acetyl groups. Based on the different reactivity of the acetyl and trifluoroacetyl groups, the design of sequential and concurrent cascades was investigated. The proper selection of the enzymes permits the synthesis of amino alcohol stereoisomers in high to excellent yields (86&#8211;&gt;99% conversion) and remarkable stereocontrol (up to &gt;99% de and &gt;99% ee) using an aqueous medium and mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Optimization of Catalyst Structure for Asymmetric Propargylation of Aldehydes with Allenyltrichlorosilane</title>

Abstract
The design of catalysts for asymmetric propargylations remains a challenging task, with only a handful of methods providing access to enantioenriched homopropargylic alcohols. In this work, guided by previously reported computational predictions, a set of atropisomeric bipyridine N,N&#8217;&#8208;dioxides was tested as Lewis base catalysts for the asymmetric propargylation of aldehydes with trichloroallenylsilane. The catalysts are easily prepared in four simple steps starting from readily available methyl ketones. Aryl&#8208;substituted derivatives proved to be highly active and showed a high level of enantiocontrol even at 1&#8197;mol% loading. The reaction scope includes a wide range of aromatic, heteroaromatic, and unsaturated aldehydes. New computations confirm that the key stereodetermining transition state structures for the synthesized catalysts are similar to those previously reported for the model structure.

Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric C3&#8208;indolylation of N&#8208;protected spiro&#8208;epoxyoxindoles has been developed for the access of 3&#8208;(3&#8208;indolyl)&#8208;oxindole methanols with excellent enantioselectivity (ee up to &gt;99%). The widespread substrate scope and easily accessible Co(III)&#8208;salen over 1,1&#8242;&#8208;Spirobiindane&#8208;7,7&#8242;&#8208;diol phosphoric acid prove our condition to be more beneficial than the chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction. Further, kinetic resolution of spiro&#8208;epoxides is achieved in high enantiomeric excess under certain conditions. The detailed mechanistic study endorses that the feedback inhibition played a key role which restricts the dynamic kinetic resolution process. Besides it also revealed the SN2&#8242; mechanism for the Co(III)&#8208;salen catalysed C3&#8208;indolylation of spiro&#8208;epoxyoxindoles.

Abstract
An enantioselective approach to lactone&#8208;fused chromanone derivatives from 1&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyaryl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;diketones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes under mild conditions has been developed, which included organocatalytic stepwise Michael addition/ cycloketalization/hemiacetalization and followed by oxidation reaction. In the presence of chiral amine organocatalyst and an additional salicylic acid, a wide range of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyaryl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;diketones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes were tolerated, furnishing a spectrum of lactone&#8208;fused tricyclic chromanones bearing three contiguous stereocenters in high yields with good to excellent selectivities (90&#8208;&gt;99% ee, &gt;19:1&#8197;d.r.).

         <title>Formal Ring Contraction of Cyclic N&#8208;Sulfonamides via C&#8722;N Bond Cleavage and &#945;&#8208;Amination by Oxidation of Halides</title>

Abstract
An oxidative C&#8722;N bond cleavage reaction of substituted cyclic sulfonamides that proceeds via oxidation of bromide ion in hydrogen bromide solution was developed to furnish N&#8208;sulfonamide&#8208;protected acyclic amino ketones in high yields. The subsequent &#945;&#8208;amination of the amino ketones via the oxidation of iodide in tetrabutylammonium iodide provided 2&#8208;acyl cyclic sulfonamides in good yields. The combination of these transformations involving the oxidation of halides resulted in a formal ring contraction of substituted cyclic amides.

         <title>Tris(benzhydryl) and Cationic Bis(benzhydryl) Ln(III) Complexes: Exceptional Thermostability and Catalytic Activity in Olefin Hydroarylation and Hydrobenzylation with Substituted Pyridines</title>

Abstract
A series of Ln(III) tris(benzhydryl) complexes [(p&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4)2CH]3Ln (Ln=La (1), Nd (2), Y (3)) were synthesized by the salt metathesis reactions of LnHal3(THF)3.5 (Ln=La, Nd, Hal=Cl; Ln=Y, Hal=I) and [(p&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4)2CH]Na. In 1&#8211;3 the benzhydryl ligands are linked with the metal centres in &#951;4&#8208;coordination mode. For diamagnetic complexes 1 and 3 a fluxional behaviour was detected in solution. Complexes 1&#8211;3 proved to be thermally stable: no decomposition was observed even after heating their solutions in toluene&#8208;d8 at 140&#8201;&#176;C during 72&#8197;h. The reactions of 1 and 2 with B(C6F5)3 allowed for the synthesis of base&#8208;free cationic complexes [(p&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4)2CH]2Ln[(p&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4)2CHB(C6F5)3] (Ln=La (4), Nd (5)) which adopt the structure of a contact ion pair. Combinations of 1&#8211;3 and borane ((B(C6F5)3, [Me2NHPh][B(C6F5)4], [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4]) as well as 4 and 5 were found to be highly efficient, regio&#8208; and chemoselective catalysts for hydroarylation and hydrobenzylation of C=C bonds of a variety of substrates with substituted pyridines. These catalysts enable highly challenging transformations such as hydrobenzylation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted and internal C=C bonds.

Abstract
Herein we report a mild and diastereoselective access to ketonitrones by reacting easily available aryl acetic acid esters and other active methylene compounds, with nitrosoarenes under catalytic loading of 2&#8208;tert&#8208;butylimino&#8208;2&#8208;diethylamino&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethylperhydro&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;diazaphosphorine (BEMP) at room temperature. Depending on the substitution pattern and nature of the aryl moiety, a switch toward the formation of imines can be observed. The mechanistic framework is put to scrutiny by experimental and theoretical studies, pointing to the formation of a nitroso aldol intermediate, whose fate toward one of the competing pathways, namely hydride transfer or elimination, would depend upon the NOH/CH&#945; relative acidities.

Abstract
Nitrones are key intermediates in organic synthesis. Herein, we report the first photo&#8208;redox synthesis of methylene nitrone intermediates from nitroarenes and arylamines. The highly reactive methylene nitrones are in&#8197;situ trapped by alkenes to afford various isoxazolidines. This three&#8208;component reaction features the use of N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines or N&#8208;aryl glycines as C1 building blocks, which allow for the one&#8208;pot formal [1+2+2] cycloaddition from simple starting materials. A wide range of useful isoxazolidines can be obtained under mild conditions with moderate to good yields. Mechanistic investigations support the formation of methylene nitrone via selective N&#8722;CH3 bond cleavage and methylene transfer.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Synthetic Sialic Acid Probes for Challenging the Substrate Promiscuity of Enzymes in the Sialoconjugation Pathway</title>

Abstract
A series of unusual sialic acid analogs were prepared using a semi&#8208;synthetic strategy. Truncation of natural N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid was followed by diastereoselective carbon backbone reconstruction using Barbier&#8208;type carboligations as well as different functional group interconversions, which provided access to a variety of functional motifs in the terminal carbon backbone, including examples of saturated and unsaturated, linear and branched alkyl chains, partially deoxygenated sialic acids, sialic diacids and a first truncated legionaminic acid analog. The synthetic sialic acid probes were studied for nucleotide activation by the CMP&#8208;sialic acid synthetase from Neisseria meningitidis using a universal pH&#8208;shift assay for kinetic analysis. One&#8208;pot enzymatic nucleotide activation and sialyltransfer to lactose was performed using a selection of five probes together with an engineered &#945;2,3&#8208;sialyltransferase from Photobacterium phosphoreum to furnish five new&#8208;to&#8208;nature analogs of the GM3 trisaccharide, which were finally utilized to test the substrate tolerance of two bacterial sialidases. The obtained set of sialic acid analogs and neo&#8208;sialocojugates provides interesting opportunities for further glycobiology studies.

&lt;p&gt;A series of unusual sialic acid analogs were prepared using a semi&#8208;synthetic strategy. Truncation of natural &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid was followed by diastereoselective carbon backbone reconstruction using Barbier&#8208;type carboligations as well as different functional group interconversions, which provided access to a variety of functional motifs in the terminal carbon backbone, including examples of saturated and unsaturated, linear and branched alkyl chains, partially deoxygenated sialic acids, sialic diacids and a first truncated legionaminic acid analog. The synthetic sialic acid probes were studied for nucleotide activation by the CMP&#8208;sialic acid synthetase from &lt;i&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/i&gt; using a universal pH&#8208;shift assay for kinetic analysis. One&#8208;pot enzymatic nucleotide activation and sialyltransfer to lactose was performed using a selection of five probes together with an engineered &#945;2,3&#8208;sialyltransferase from &lt;i&gt;Photobacterium phosphoreum&lt;/i&gt; to furnish five new&#8208;to&#8208;nature analogs of the GM3 trisaccharide, which were finally utilized to test the substrate tolerance of two bacterial sialidases. The obtained set of sialic acid analogs and neo&#8208;sialocojugates provides interesting opportunities for further glycobiology studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
One&#8208;pot synthesis of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted 4&#8208;aminoquinolines is developed through a three&#8208;component reaction of 2&#8208;azidobenzaldehydes, &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters and amines involving cascade Mannich, aza&#8208;Wittig and dehydrofluorinative aromatization. The method is applicable to other functionalized quinolines. It is a pot, atom and step economy (PASE) synthesis of biologically interesting 4&#8208;aminoquinolines relevant to hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine.

Abstract
The importance of fluorinated organic molecules in drugs and pharmaceuticals led to the development of several synthetic methods for introducing fluorine into bioactive molecules and trifluoromethylation is one of the key approaches for the same. Electrochemical organic synthesis has emerged as one of the most sustainable, green synthetic strategies in recent years and new developments in electroorganic synthesis also focus on electrochemical trifluoromethylation of organic compounds. A considerable number of reports have appeared in recent literature and this review surveys all the recent developments in electrochemical trifluoromethylation reactions. This highly sustainable trifluoromethylating protocol will emerge further soon and pave the way for more energy&#8208;efficient and green protocols.

Abstract
The synthetic application of nickel catalysts in Heck&#8208;coupling reactions is quite prominent and noticeable of late in organic synthesis. It shows great interest over the other transition metal catalysts due to its unique characteristic that prepares them more significantly applicable in different fields of synthetic application. The usefulness of nickel&#8208;catalysts relies in the fact that they are abundant in nature, relatively less precious and environment friendly. Nickel plays pivotal role in different kind of Heck reactions known such as intramolecular&#8208;, intermolecular&#8208;, reductive&#8208;Heck type reaction producing mainly carbocycles and hetero cycles of biological significance. Carbocyclization or hetero&#8208;cyclization reaction occurred under optimized reaction conditions developed and come up with the formation of various structural building blocks of naturally occurring compounds. Via reductive Heck cyclization large membered	ring of carbo&#8208; or hetero&#8208;cyclic system was formed which performed key role as building blocks in pharmaceutical synthesis and bioactive molecule formation. Intermolecular Heck type reactions were comparatively more explored. Silyl&#8208;Heck, carbonyl&#8208;Heck, and other miscellaneous type reactions were covered up through nickel&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular Heck reaction. Asymmetric versions of Heck&#8208; coupling reactions are also reported to proceed even with unactivated alkenes, offering molecules having quaternary stereogenic center in a regio&#8208; and enantioselective manner. This manuscript intends to cover these entire concepts.

Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed site selective arene C&#8722;H bond activation concomitant functionalization with various coupling partners gain magnificent attraction in synthetic organic chemistry as complementary to traditional transformations. Mechanistically, these C&#8722;H functionalization approaches involve directing group assisted concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation (CMD), migratory insertion, and reductive elimination sequences. In this realm, diverse categories of coupling partners were employed as C&#8722;H functionalization buddies. Particularly alkynes gain enormous attention as annulating agents. These units coordinates with metalcycle through &#960;&#8208;interaction produce annulation outcomes in a straightforward manner. Very recently, propargylic alcohols were appointed as valuable archetypes in arene C&#8722;H activation armoury, as they have shown regio&#8208; and chemoselective migratory insertion into primary metalcycle species via hydroxy chelation. The influential regioselectivity was drawn by dual coordination of metal complexes with the pendent directing group and a propargylic hydroxyl group. In this review, we focused on annulations and functionalization of arenes and propargylic alcohols, which afford intricate cycles as well as complex acyclic motifs in a trouble&#8208;free manner. We categorized these transformations based on number of atoms of propargylic alcohols involved in annulation along with some addition reactions. We anticipate to pave a way towards enhanced endeavours for discovering novel reaction avenues.

Abstract
Fluorinated compounds can exhibit interesting biological properties. The importance of these species has made that the chemistry of fluorine has experienced a great development. On this review, the recent advances on asymmetric fluorination reactions promoted by chiral hydrogen bonding&#8208;based organocatalysts are discussed. Hence, examples using phosphoric acid, carboxylic acid, (thio)urea and squaramide derivatives are illustrated. The growth of this field is amazing. We have only considered pivotal works in which direct fluorination takes place using a fluorinating agent, leaving aside the reactions where a fluorine atom is incorporated from the beginning as part of other reactants. Herein, the scarce existing examples on this field of research have been compiled.

         <title>Tandem Annulations of Propargylic Alcohols to Indole Derivatives</title>

Abstract
Indole derivatives are important heterocycles in organic synthesis for serving as privileged building blocks for functional material and as key components in a lot of bioactive compounds. Propargylic alcohols, bearing alkynyl and hydroxyl functional groups, have emerged as promising feedstock materials for the construction of carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. Especially, in the last decade, the Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acid catalysed tandem annulations of propargylic alcohols to build structurally diverse indole derivatives have been well&#8208;investigated. In this review, we summarize two main synthetic strategies toward indole derivatives via the cascade reactions of propargylic alcohols: indole&#8208;ring formation involved tandem reactions and the direct function&#8208;alization of indole skeletons. We hope this review would help to develop new and more efficient protocols for the synthesis of indole&#8208;included N&#8208;heterocycles.

         <title>Photocatalytical and Photochemical Generation of Imidoyl Radicals: Synthetic Applications</title>

Abstract
In the last few decades, the development in the field of radical chemistry has gained great attention. The majority of these radical strategies mainly depend on the in&#8197;situ generation of reactive radical species by employing radical initiators such as oxidants and metal salts or methods such as photocatalysis and electrochemistry etc. This review covers the literature on the generation of imidoyl radicals using photoredox catalysis. In the majority of the reactions, the spontaneity of the underlying SET transitions is correlated by the compiled redox potential data of the reacting species for a better understanding of the readers. Besides, the applications of these reactive imidoyl radicals to access a variety of heterocycles such as benzothiazoles, indoles, quinoxalines, phenanthridines, isoquinolines, pyridines, and amides are also addressed.

Abstract
The phenols are key intermediates as well as desired products in many target oriented syntheses. The conversion of C&#8722;H bond to C&#8722;O bond is one of the most challenging tasks in organic synthesis. In last few decades, the hydroxylation of aromatic compounds has drawn a considerable attention because of their importance in Pharmaceutical industry, material chemistry, polymers and in agrochemicals. Indeed, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed, coordination&#8208;assisted regio&#8208; and chemoselective ortho&#8208;hydroxylation of arenes has become very efficient and popular strategy to obtain good yields of phenols with tolerance of a wide range of functional groups. This review is the comprehensive summary of recent advancement on Pd&#8208;, Ru&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, Cu&#8208; and Ir&#8208;catalyzed, chelation&#8208;controlled regioselective ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H bond hydroxylation of aromatic compounds in the presence of diverse hydroxylating agents. The review has been classified on the sources of hydroxylating agents used in reaction.

Abstract
The valorization of lignin and its model compounds represents a key technology applied for the production of lignin&#8208;monomers, which constitute as renewable feedstocks and intermediates for the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels as well as molecules related to life science applications. Hence, in addition to lignin&#8208;depolymerization, the effective utilization of lignin&#8208;derived feedstocks such as phenols, ethers, alcohols, ketones and aldehydes is also gaining significant importance. In this regard, number of methodologies has been developed on the utility of these feedstocks for the production of various functional chemicals. In this review, we summarize the valorization of lignin&#8208;derived feedstocks by amination, hydrogenation, dehydrogenation oxidation, carbonylation, and trifluoromethylation, hydrolysis reactions for the synthesis of amines, cyclohexanes, cyclohexanols, cyclohexanones, esters, ketones, cyclic ethers, trifluoromethylated compounds and heterocycles as well as pharmaceuticals and biomolecules.

Abstract
The enantioselective synthesis of chiral N,N&#8208;acetals derived from &#945;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds has been achieved. Good yields and enantioselectivities were observed for the reaction with various &#945;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds with 2&#8208;aminobenzamides using chiral bis(imidazoline)&#8208;phosphoric acid catalysts. Based on these experimental investigations, a possible transition state is proposed to explain the origin of the asymmetric induction.

Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free photo&#8208;induced cascade sulfonylation/addition/cyclization of 3&#8208;arylethynyl&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;carbonitriles with Na2S2O5 and aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates for the construction of 4&#8208;sulfonated cyclopenta[gh]phenanthridines is developed. This reaction involves a radical pathway and goes through a sequence of phenyl radical formation, sulfur dioxide insertion, sulfonyl radical addition, iminyl radical formation, and cyclization. The methodology displays mild conditions, a broad substrate scope and does not require any external oxidants.

Abstract
Inspired by the chemistry and biology of chromone, a method for the construction of spirooxindole&#8208;based tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]chromanones is reported with good regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (all cases &gt;20:1&#8197;dr) and moderate yields (up to 67%). This method leads to the construction of four contiguous stereogenic tertiary centers and one spiro quaternary center via a one&#8208;step &#947;&#8208;regioselective cascade [3+2] cycloaddition of an oxindole&#8208;chromone synthon with 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;nitro&#8208;5&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;isoxazole.

         <title>Organocatalytic Hantzsch Type Reaction Using Aryl Hydrazines, Propiolic Acid Esters and Enals: Enantioselective Synthesis of Paroxetine</title>

Abstract
Aryl hydrazines, propiolic acid esters and enals serve as a viable substrate combination for an organocatalytic enantioselective Hantzsch type reaction. The method converts readily available starting materials into important chiral heterocycles with good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities, and has addressed the longstanding scope limitation of the classic Hantzsch reaction in the asymmetric synthesis of 2,6&#8208;unsubstituted hydropyridines. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated by the concise enantioselective synthesis of paroxetine.

Abstract
Strong Br&#248;nsted acids were found to catalyze the oxidative condensation of 2&#8208;aminothiophenols with aryl alkyl ketones in DMSO to provide a wide range of complex 2&#8208;arylbenzothiazines. With acetophenones, dimeric 2&#8208;arylbenzothiazines were formed. On the other hand, the reaction with propiophenones resulted in 2:1 adducts whereas 1:1 adducts were produced with isobutyrophenones, benzoylacetonitrile and ethyl benzoylacetate.

Abstract
We apply a chiral anionic phase&#8208;transfer system for the catalytic asymmetric bromoaminocyclization and bromocycloetherification of momo&#8208;functional benzo&#8208;cyclic alkenes. Various brominated tricyclic benzo&#8208;heterocycles were produced with up to 99% yields and 99% enantiomeric excess. The resulting enantioenriched hexahydro&#8208;benzoindoles are key building blocks of bioactive molecules.

Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed direct trifluoroethylation of aryl iodides with an industrial raw material CF3CH2I has been developed, demonstrating high efficiency, excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility, especially with large sterically hindered groups. The key to success is the combination of nickel with readily available nitrogen and phosphine ligands. The powerful potential of this strategy is further demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage modification of several derived bioactive molecules.

Abstract
Divergent halogenation pathways of 2,2&#8208;dichlorobut&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ols have been developed to give 3,4&#8208;dihalofurans and 1,3&#8208;dihaloallenyl ketones in good to excellent yields. Thus, the readily accessible 2,2&#8208;dichlorobut&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ols were treated with the electrophilic halogen source to provide the 1,3&#8208;dihalogen&#8208;substituted allenyl ketones, whereas the use of Pd(II) catalyst promoted the oxypalladation followed by the electrophilic halogenation to give 3,4&#8208;dihalogen&#8208;substituted furan derivatives. The synthetic utility of 3,4&#8208;dihalofurans and 1,3&#8208;dihaloallenyl ketones is demonstrated in the sequential Suzuki cross coupling strategies.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free, Multicomponent Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydroarylsulfonylation and Alkoxyarylsulfonylation of Vinyl Arenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A unified strategy for the hydro&#8208;arylsulfonylation of vinyl arenes has been developed under catalyst, additive&#8208;free conditions at room temperature from the corresponding aryldiazonium salts, DABSO (DABCO&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2SO2), and thiophenol as hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reagent. Mechanistically, an incipient arylsulfonyl radical is generated from the corresponding aryl diazonium salts and DABSO which undergoes anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition to styrenes followed by hydrogen atom transfer from thiophenol. Interestingly, this multi&#8208;component reaction is highly chemoselective suppressing deleterious thiosulfonylation and thiol&#8208;ene reactions. Tuning the reaction conditions, a four&#8208;component difunctionalization with alkoxy group has been achieved using 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene as an oxidant. Furthermore, base&#8208;promoted elimination to form vinyl sulfone has been also examined. The practicability of this present reaction has been demonstrated by the ex situ generation of sulfur dioxide in an H&#8208;type reaction vessel and subsequent hydro&#8208; and alkoxyarylsulfonylation in good to moderate yields. The hydroarylsulfonylation reaction is scalable and applied to a metal&#8208;free synthesis of the key intermediate for an anti&#8208;migraine drug Eletriptan.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrosilylation of Cyclic Imines: Synthesis of Chiral 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Substituted Pyrrolidines as Pharmaceutical Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The first successful enantioselective hydrosilylation of cyclic imines promoted by a chiral zinc complex is reported. In situ generated zinc&#8208;ProPhenol complex with silane afforded pharmaceutically relevant enantioenriched 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted pyrrolidines in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). The synthetic utility of presented methodology is demonstrated in an efficient synthesis of the corresponding chiral cyclic amines, being pharmaceutical drug precursors to the Aticaprant and Larotrectinib.

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first successful enantioselective hydrosilylation of cyclic imines promoted by a chiral zinc complex is reported. &lt;i&gt;In situ&lt;/i&gt; generated zinc&#8208;ProPhenol complex with silane afforded pharmaceutically relevant enantioenriched 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted pyrrolidines in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;). The synthetic utility of presented methodology is demonstrated in an efficient synthesis of the corresponding chiral cyclic amines, being pharmaceutical drug precursors to the Aticaprant and Larotrectinib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>A Concise Route to 2&#8208;Sulfonylacetonitriles from Sodium Metabisulfite</title>

Abstract
A three&#8208;component reaction of aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates, sodium metabisulfite, and 3&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;methylbut&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;ol under mild conditions is described. By using abundant and cheap sodium metabisulfite as the sulfur dioxide surrogate, this protocol features good functional group compatibility, affording 2&#8208;arylsulfonylacetonitriles in moderate to good yields. The reaction proceeds smoothly at room temperature without the need of any catalysts or additives. Moreover, the synthetic utility of this method is demonstrated by the transformation of 2&#8208;arylsulfonylacetonitrile into 2&#8208;arylsulfonyl acetamide and 2&#8208;arylsulfonylethylamine.

         <title>Synthesis of Metallocene Analogues of the Phenethylamine and Tetrahydroisoquinoline Scaffolds via Regioselective Ring Opening of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;N&#8208;sulfonyl Aziridines</title>

Abstract
The Lewis (or Br&#248;nsted) acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridines with ferrocene and ruthenocene provided new amino&#8208;functionalized metallocene derivatives arising from a regioselective ring opening of the aziridine. The functionalized metallocene derivatives available by this methodology are suitable precursors for the stereoselective synthesis of metallocene analogues of the relevant tetrahydroisoquinoline motif by a Pictet&#8208;Spengler type reaction. These isoquinoline analogues are also accessible by a TfOH&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridines, ferrocene (or ruthenocene) and formaldehyde.

         <title>NaHSO3&#8208;Mediated Direct Synthesis of Sulfinic Esters from Sulfonyl Hydrazides under Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
We have developed a protocol for the NaHSO3&#8208;promoted esterification of sulfonyl hydrazides with alcohols for the synthesis of sulfinic esters. Various sulfonyl hydrazides could be converted to the corresponding sulfinic esters in good to high yields. The merits of this protocol include mild transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free reaction conditions, an inexpensive and available reagent, and operational simplicity. Controlled experiments reveal that this transformation probably undergoes via a radical pathway.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks in Catalytic Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which are built upon dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) with various organic building blocks, possess predesignable, highly ordered and crystalline porous structures. These features endow COFs with great potential in the development of function&#8208;tailored materials, particularly in catalytic organic synthesis. Start from selective oxidation reactions early introduced by Ferdi, Thomas and their co&#8208;workers, and then Wang and co&#8208;workers performed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction through integrating palladium into COFs, increasing numbers of works were established to explore their potentials in the 4.5catalysis of organic reactions. As heterogeneous organic catalysts, COFs bring benefits and solve problems, but also create new obstacles. Hence, we would like to establish a comprehensive system to review some pioneering works in this area. This will help us get a better view so that we can discuss the key and challenging issues we are currently confronted with.

Abstract
A P(III)&#8208;mediated entry towards construction of C&#8722;N/C&#8722;S bond has been devised. The developed heterocyclization method was exercised for the synthesis of a diverse range of N,S&#8208;heterocycles and related spiro molecules. P(NMe2)3 revealed the maximum efficacies under the aerobic reaction conditions and a spectrum of bis&#8208;nucleophiles, and isothiocyanates were tolerated well to serve the access of manifold immense molecules.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organoboron compounds are well known building blocks for many organic reactions. However, under basic conditions, polyfluorinated aryl boronic acid derivatives suffer from instability issues that are accelerated in compounds containing an ortho&#8208;fluorine group, which result in the formation of the corresponding protodeboronation products. Therefore, a considerable amount of research has focused on novel methodologies to synthesize these valuable compounds while avoiding the protodeboronation issue. This review summarizes the latest developments in the synthesis of fluorinated aryl boronic acid derivatives and their applications in cross&#8208;coupling reactions and other transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Construction of C&#8211;C and C=C Bonds by Manganese Catalyzed Coupling of Alcohols with Phosphorus Ylides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the manganese catalyzed coupling of alcohols with phosphorus ylides. The selectivity in the coupling of primary alcohols with phosphorus ylides to form carbon&#8211;carbon single (C&#8211;C) and carbon&#8211;carbon double (C=C) bonds can be controlled by the ligands. In the conversion of more challenging secondary alcohols with phosphorus ylides the selectivity towards the formation of C&#8211;C vs. C=C bonds can be controlled by the reaction conditions, namely the amount of base. The scope and limitations of the coupling reactions were thoroughly evaluated by the conversion of 21 alcohols and 15 ylides. Notably, compared to existing methods, which are based on precious metal complexes as catalysts, the present catalytic system is based on earth abundant manganese catalysts.The reaction can also be performed in a sequential one&#8208;pot reaction generating the phosphorus ylide in situ followed manganese catalyzed C&#8211;C and C=C bond formation. Mechanistic studies suggest that the C&#8211;C bond was generated via a borrowing hydrogen pathway and the C=C bond formation followed an acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium Catalyzed Ring Expansion Reaction of Isoxazolones with Isocyanides: Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Oxazin&#8208;6&#8208;One Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A palladium catalyzed ring expansion reaction of isoxazolones with isocyanides was disclosed. In the reaction, a cascade process involving ring&#8208;opening/cyclization was suggested. The reaction features high atomic economy due to no elimination of CO2 occurred. Moreover, products obtained demonstrate aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties with relatively high solid&#8208;state emission efficiencies.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for Beckmann rearrangement (BKR) using ethyl 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfonyloxyimino) acetate (o&#8208;NosylOXY) under microwave irradiation is reported. Ketoximes (19 examples) are converted to the corresponding amides/lactams with 69&#8208;97% yields in ~10 minutes without any Lewis acid or co&#8208;catalyst. This is an example of halogen&#8208;free organocatalytic BKR. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)&#8208; and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)&#8208;based detailed mechanistic investigation suggest that o&#8208;NosylOXY acts as an initiator. Such initiators are reported before based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, we report here the HRMS signatures of two transient intermediates, the nitrilium ion and the nitrilium ion's dimeric species. Rigorous NMR&#8208;based investigation of the reaction mechanism is performed. Our results indicate that the reported BKR proceeds via two consecutive rearrangements.</dc:description>

         <title>Threat to the Throne: Can Two Cooperating Boron Atoms Rival Transition Metals in Chemical Bond Activation and Catalysis?</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Certain electron&#8208;rich 1,4&#8208;diborabenzene derivatives efficiently activate single, double, and triple bonds and thereby increasingly compete with transition metals in homogeneous catalysis. This review compares the activation of three model substrates (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by (i) 9,10&#8208;dihydro&#8208;9,10&#8208;diboraanthracene anions, (ii) their neutral carbene&#8208;stabilized congeners, (iii) 1,3,2,5&#8208;diazadiborinines, and (iv) 1,4,2,5&#8208;diazadiborinines. Distinct structure&#8208;properties relationships become apparent, the most influential factors being (i) the steric demands of the B&#8208;bonded substituents, (ii) the charges of the B&#8208;doped (hetero)arenes, (iii) charge polarization as a result of additional N&#8208;doping, and (iv) the energies and nodal structures of the frontier orbitals. The observed reactions are explained by a transition metal&#8208;like activation mechanism. If the two boron atoms are chemically inequivalent, contributions of a B(+I)/B(+III) mixed&#8208;valence state determine the observed regioselectivities when polar substrates are added. The lessons learned from the conversions of the model substrates are subsequently used to rationalize the behavior of the B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterocycles also toward more sophisticated substrate molecules. Finally, catalytic cycles based on H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208; and H&#8722;&#8208;transfers, hydroboration reactions, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reductions will be covered</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Bulky 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Bipyridine and (S)&#8208;Pyridine&#8208;Oxazoline Ligands</title>

Abstract
Bulky N,N&#8217;&#8208;bidentate ligands can furnish catalysts with enhanced catalytic activity compared to commercially available ligands. Straightforward methods to effectively synthesize a broad range of these ligands, however, are uncommon. In this work, a simple and efficient method is developed for the synthesis of bulky N,N&#8217;&#8208;bidentate ligands, including 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridines and enantioenriched pyridine&#8208;oxazolines. The Pd/NIXANTPHOS catalyst system enabled synthesis of a series of bulky 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;based ligands and (S)&#8208;pyridine oxazoline&#8208;based enantioenriched ligands with good to excellent yields. The ligands have been benchmarked in the aminofluorination of styrene.

         <dc:description>








Abstract
Asymmetric multi&#8208;catalysis, designed to mimic catalytic processes in nature, is a powerful instrument to fulfil fascinating transformations. As a result, this area of research has attracted considerable interests within chemistry communities. Although there are numerous reviews involving multi&#8208;catalysis, reviews describing asymmetric organomulticatalysis remain rare. Taking into consideration that organocatalysts possess the superiorities of effortless availability, inexpensiveness, hypotoxicity, facile handling and hyposensitivity to moisture and oxygen, they have definite advantage in their own distinct modes of activation when utilized in multi&#8208;catalytic reactions. Organomulticatalysis refers to the synthetic strategies of modular combination of organo&#8208;catalyzed reactions into one synthetic operation with minimum workup or change in conditions. It is apparent that a variety reports utilizing the concept of enantioselective organomulticatalysis have substantially surfaced in the past few years. Hence, it is indispensable to succinctly present all such reports by means of disclosing the mechanistic analysis, as well as the challenges and issues associated in the development of the asymmetric catalytic system. Additionally, this review will introduce some of the unsettled conundrums and possible innovations in this field.

         <title>Halohydrin Dehalogenases and Their Potential in Industrial Application &#8211; A Viewpoint of Enzyme Reaction Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
At the moment, there are approx. 100 published papers investigating halohydrin dehalogenases from different aspects; enzymology, molecular biology and reactions they can catalyse. Unquestionably, these enzymes are of great importance and hold an immense potential due to the wide spectrum of different compounds that can be synthesized by their action. These compounds, such as chiral epoxides, &#946;&#8208;substituted alcohols, oxazolidinones etc., significantly enrich the chemist's toolbox and, moreover, open the possibility for the synthesis of even more complex compounds. Still, there are many unknowns, and it is the purpose of this work to demonstrate the possibilities and bottlenecks, in scientific sense, that could further help in broadening the applicative potential of these fascinating enzymes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, there are approx. 100 published papers investigating halohydrin dehalogenases from different aspects; enzymology, molecular biology and reactions they can catalyse. Unquestionably, these enzymes are of great importance and hold an immense potential due to the wide spectrum of different compounds that can be synthesized by their action. These compounds, such as chiral epoxides, &#946;&#8208;substituted alcohols, oxazolidinones etc., significantly enrich the chemist's toolbox and, moreover, open the possibility for the synthesis of even more complex compounds. Still, there are many unknowns, and it is the purpose of this work to demonstrate the possibilities and bottlenecks, in scientific sense, that could further help in broadening the applicative potential of these fascinating enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Pd&#8208;Catalysed Fujiwara&#8208;Moritani type Reaction of N,S&#8208;Heterocyclic Systems with Olefins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;thiazine skeletons bearing olefin fragment at their &#945;&#8208;position were prepared through a robust Pd(OAc)2&#8211;catalysed Fujiwara&#8208;Moritani type reaction via C&#8211;H alkenylation with olefins. This approach is selective, generalizable to a wide range of olefins and requires only 1 eq. of Ag2CO3 without the need of co&#8208;oxidant. The C&#8211;H bond activation proved to be strongly dependent on the olefin&#8217;s substitution while unfused dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;thiazines seemed to be affected by the oxidation state of the sulfur atom. The utility of olefins obtained was demonstrated by their implication in the dipolar cycloaddition reaction with a non&#8208;stabilized azomethine ylide.</dc:description>

         <title>C2&#8208;Functionalization of Pyridines/Quinolines by N&#8208;Oxide Chemistry</title>

There is a famous sentence in Tao Te Ching: &#8220;The Tao produced one. One produced two. Two produced three. Three produced all things.&#8221; In this front cover picture, Tai Chi stands for Tao, and &#8220;N&#8221; and &#8220;O&#8221; in the two circles represent N&#8208;oxides of this paper. Thunder and lightning stimulate Tai Chi to produce everything, which is represented by the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Therefore, this picture indicates that pyridine N&#8208;oxides can produce numerous nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds under the action of activating reagent. Details can be found in the Review by Dong Wang and co&#8208;workers (L. D&#233;saubry, G. Li, M. Huang, S. Zheng), Adv. Synth. Catal. 2021, 363, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202000910).

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Pentacyclic Proaporphine Alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;Misramine</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An enantioselective total synthesis of pentacyclic proaporphine alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;misramine has been achieved. The synthetic route features a Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization to construct the fused B and C rings and a sequence of Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation, Pinnick oxidation, and pinacol&#8208;type cyclization to install the &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketal moiety. The absolute configuration of the pentacyclic framework was elucidated by X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal analyses of (&#8722;)&#8208;11&#8208;demethoxymisramine.

         <title>Direct C&#8722;H Arylation of Indole&#8208;3&#8208;Acetic Acid Derivatives Enabled by an Autonomous Self&#8208;Optimizing Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Described herein is a continuous&#8208;flow strategy for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8722;H arylation of indole&#8208;3&#8208;acetic acid derivatives with arenediazonium salts. A fully autonomous self&#8208;optimizing flow platform was used to efficiently optimize the coupling reaction in a three&#8208;dimensional space. The flow methodology developed is experimentally simple, mild, broad in scope, and safer than traditional batch approaches. Our continuous&#8208;flow approach is particularly convenient to prepare precursors of pharmaceutically relevant compounds.

         <title>Recent Developments in Radical Cross&#8208;Coupling of Redox&#8208;Active Cycloketone Oximes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Recent years have witnessed a renaissance of radical cross&#8208;coupling of cycloketone oximes which served as active cyanoalkyl radical via ring fragmentation in various transformations. It provided an efficient and practical strategy to introduce cyanoalkyl groups into organic compounds without using toxic cyanide sources. In this review, a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the field of redox&#8208;active cycloketone oximes&#8208;based cross&#8208;couplings were covered. This review was categorized into two broad parts: non&#8208;photocatalyzed and photocatalyzed cross&#8208;couplings according to the reaction conditions. Moreover, the two broad parts were further divided into several sub&#8208;sections depending on the nature of the bond formation. Some representative examples along with reaction mechanisms were also discussed.

         <title>Utilizing Alcohols for Cross&#8208;Coupling with Alkenyl Bromides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inside cover picture, designed by Takuya Suga, illustrates the merger of titanium&#8208;mediated homolytic C&#8211;OH bond cleavage and nickel catalysis that realizes a cross&#8208;coupling reaction between benzyl alcohols and alkenyl bromides. The direct application of alcohols to cross&#8208;coupling may set us free from tedious preparations of halides and homolysis&#8208;active esters. Manganese powder was used to reduce titanium(IV) and nickel(II) to their active low&#8208;valent forms that can cleave C&#8211;OH and C&#8211;Br bonds, respectively. More information can be found in the Communication by Suga, Takahashi, and Ukaii. (T. Suga, Y. Takahashi, Y. Ukaji, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2020, 362, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202000945).

Abstract
Direct hydrogen atom transfer from a photoredox&#8208;generated Hantzsch ester radical cation to electron&#8208;deficient alkenes has enabled the development of an efficient formal hydrogenation under mild, operationally simple conditions. The HAT&#8208;driven mechanism is supported by experimental and computational studies. The reaction is applied to a variety of cinnamate derivatives and related structures, irrespective of the presence of electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents in the aromatic ring and with good functional group compatibility.

         <title>Gold Catalysis Meets Materials Science &#8211; A New Approach to &#960;&#8208;Extended Indolocarbazoles</title>

Abstract
Herein we describe a modular, convergent synthesis of substituted benzo[a]benzo[6,7]&#8208;indolo[2,3&#8208;h]carbazoles (BBICZs) using a bidirectional gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction as a key step. A building block strategy enabled the easy variation of substituents at different positions of the core structure and a general analysis of substitution effects on the materials properties of the target compounds. All BBICZs were fully characterized and their optical and electronic properties were studied experimentally as well as by computational methods. Organic thin&#8208;film transistors based on eight selected derivatives were fabricated by vacuum deposition and charge&#8208;carrier mobilities up to 1&#8197;cm2/Vs were measured.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Heterocyclics via Cascade Cyclization of Propargylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Heterocyclic compounds are important organic compounds and have emerged as key scaffolds in numerous drugs, natural products, vitamins, biologically and pharmaceutically active compounds. Over the past few decades, the development of versatile methodologies employing propargylic alcohols as synthons for the construction of heterocyclic skeletons has attracted great attention from synthetic chemists. In this review, recent developments in the cascade cyclization of propargylic alcohols with diverse nucleophiles to construct heterocyclic compounds are summarized. According to the types of nucleophiles, these reactions can be divided into four categories: 1) Reactions involving C&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation; 2) Reactions involving O, S&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation; 3) Reactions involving N, P&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation; 4) Reactions involving halo&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation.

Abstract
A direct carbocyclization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophthalazine&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones is achieved using isocyanates as carbonyl source via Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed sequential ortho&#8208;amidation followed by intramolecular nucleophilic substitution, delivering substituted indazolo[1,2&#8208;b]phthalazine&#8208;triones in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. For ortho&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophthalazine&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones, the corresponding amidated products were also isolated in excellent yields by modifying the reaction parameters. Application of isocyanates as carbonyl source, high functional group tolerance on the two coupling partners and diverse chemical transformation of the synthesized fused and functionalized phthalazinones are the key highlights of the work.

Abstract
An efficient approach to regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of (Z)&#8208;vinylsulfonylated quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;ones has been developed. This oxidative reaction involves copper&#8208;catalyzed vinylsulfonylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with alkynes and sulfonyl hydrazides. Various functionalized vinylsulfonylated quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives have been synthesized in excellent yields. The reaction proceeds via sulfonyl radicals generated from sulfonyl hydrazides.

         <title>Development of an Enzymatic Process for the Synthesis of the Key Intermediate of Telotristat Ethyl</title>

Abstract
(R)&#8208;1&#8208;(4&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;(3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethan&#8208;1&#8208;ol [(R)&#8208;2] is a key chiral intermediate in the synthesis of telotristat ethyl, an anti&#8208;carcinoid syndrome drug. However, the synthetic methods for (R)&#8208;2 mainly include chemical reductions, rarely involving biocatalysis or bioreduction until now. Here, we report a method for obtaining (R)&#8208;2 by biocatalytic reduction of corresponding prochiral acetophenone (1) with bulky o&#8208;substitution using recombinant Lactobacillus fermentum short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase 1 (LfSDR1) as a biocatalyst. Further engineering of LfSDR1 variants could access asymmetric reduction of 1 and yield (R)&#8208;2 with a &gt;99% ee and a &gt;99% conversion. In addition, through the test of different co&#8208;solvents and a series of initial substrate concentrations, substrate 1 with the concentration of 60&#8197;g/L can be completely converted into (R)&#8208;2 on a preparative scale (1.13&#8197;g, 3.93&#8197;mmol, 75.6% isolated yield) in 24&#8197;hours. This study presents an efficient enzymatic process for the biocatalytic synthesis of key chiral intermediate (R)&#8208;2 in the synthesis of telotristat ethyl.

In addition, through the test of different co&#8208;solvents and a series of initial substrate concentrations, substrate &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with the concentration of 60&#8197;g/L can be completely converted into (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; on a preparative scale (1.13&#8197;g, 3.93&#8197;mmol, 75.6% isolated yield) in 24&#8197;hours. This study presents an efficient enzymatic process for the biocatalytic synthesis of key chiral intermediate (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; in the synthesis of telotristat ethyl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Bicyclic and [3+2]&#8208;Annulations of Internal Propargyl Alcohols with Nitrones and Imines To Yield to Two Distinct Heterocycles</title>

Abstract
A gold&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of 1,3&#8208;dihydrooxazolo[3,4&#8208;a]indoles from 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;4&#8208;ols and nitrones is described; this new bicyclic annulation presents the first examples that internal alkynes can react with nitrones to undergo an oxoarylation route. DFT calculations indicate a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic shift of initial alkenylgold intermediates to elude the intermediacy of gold carbenes. We also developed new [3+2]&#8208;annulations of the same 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;4&#8208;ols with imines, yielding oxazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;ylidene derivatives efficiently. The tethered alcohols of these 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;ynes allow trapping of their metastable 2&#8208;azadienium intermediates to enable a novel annulation. Our mechanistic analysis indicates that the two products, despite their structural relevance, are produced from two independent systems.

         <title>Lewis Acid Catalyzed Reductive Cyclization of 2&#8208;Aryloxybenzaldehydes and 2&#8208;(Arylthio)benzaldehydes to Unsubstituted 9H&#8208;Xanthenes and Thioxanthenes in Diisopropyl Ether</title>

Abstract
Readily accessible 2&#8208;aryloxybenzaldehydes and 2&#8208;(arylthio)benzaldehydes undergo a sequence of reactions leading to a wide variety of unsubstituted 9H&#8208;xanthenes and thioxanthenes in high yields when heated with a Lewis acid in diisopropyl ether. This reductive cyclization method is compatible with several important functional groups. The method is also applicable for the selective reductive cyclization of the more electron&#8208;rich aryl ring of a 2,6&#8208;bis(aryloxy)benzaldehyde. The key feature of this transformation is the chemoselective reduction of a transient xanthylium ion in the presence of aldehydic group via intermolecular hydride transfer from diisopropyl ether (solvent).

Abstract
The synthesis of hydrobenzoimidazoles from para&#8208;quinamines and 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes was achieved via a formal [3+2] annulation reaction in the presence of In(OTf)3 as the catalyst. Further studies demonstrated that the synthesis of hydrobenzooxazoles could also be accomplished via the same strategy from para&#8208;quinols and 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Biaryls using Biaryl 2,5&#8208;Diphenylphospholanes as Ligands for Palladium&#8208;Catalysed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reactions</title>

Abstract
Here we describe the development of biaryl 2,5&#8208;diphenylphospholanes as a new class of C2&#8208;symmetric, monodentate ligands for asymmetric Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura (ASM) reactions. Screening of a series of exemplary phospholanes led to the identification of two ligands that were used to prepare a range of atropisomeric biaryl and heterobiaryl products with good to excellent levels of enantioselectivity (up to 97:3 e.r.) under mild conditions. DFT studies suggest that the formation of a constraining ligand pocket and coordination of one of the biaryl methoxy groups in the optimised ligands to the metal centre is crucial for restricting conformational freedom in the bond&#8208;forming step.

         <title>Recent Achievements in the Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Concise Construction of Medium N&#8208;Heterocycles, Azepines and Azocines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Medium N&#8208;heterocycles, azepines and azocines, serve as important skeletons that occurred widely in natural products, however, due to the lack of efficient synthetic methodologies, their application potential in biologically active molecules, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals remained to be explored. In this context, rhodium catalysis in this field featured good reactivity and functional group tolerance, with readily available starting materials, and enabled rapid access to the azepines and azocines. Delightfully, great achievements in the concise construction of these 7 and 8&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles under rhodium catalysis have been made, which mainly included cycloisomerization of unsaturated C&#8722;X bonds (which might also combine the ring&#8208;opening strategy on strained rings), metal carbenoid or nitrene insertion involved transformations and direct C&#8722;H activation reactions. Considering the great performance of rhodium catalyst in the synthesis of azepines and azocines, herein, we summarized the recent results in this field, and wish to give further insight and inspired more encouraging methodologies and new drug discovery based on these 7 and 8&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles.

         <title>Modular Tandem Mizoroki&#8208;Heck/Reductive Heck Reactions to Construct Fluorenes from Cyclic Diaryliodoniums</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Starting from cyclic diaryliodoniums and terminal alkenes, a diverse set of fluorenes is conveniently constructed. The reactions catalyzed by palladium undergo one conventional Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reaction and one reductive Heck reaction. The scope of alkenes is general, leading to 29 fluorenes which would expand the structural diversity of fluorene reservoir.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting from cyclic diaryliodoniums and terminal alkenes, a diverse set of fluorenes is conveniently constructed. The reactions catalyzed by palladium undergo one conventional Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reaction and one reductive Heck reaction. The scope of alkenes is general, leading to 29 fluorenes which would expand the structural diversity of fluorene reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Nickel/Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Hydrocyanation of Alkynes with Formamide as the Cyano Source, Dehydrant, Reductant, and Solvent</title>

Abstract
A Ni/Co co&#8208;catalyzed reductive hydrocyanation of various alkynes was developed for the production of saturated nitriles. Hydrocyanic acid is generated in&#8197;situ from safe and readily available formamide. Formamide played multiple roles as a cyano source, dehydrant, and reductant for the NiII pre&#8208;catalyst and vinyl nitriles, along with acting as the co&#8208;solvent in this reaction. Detailed mechanistic investigation supported a pathway via hydrocyanation of C&#8801;C bond and the subsequent reduction of C=C bond. Wide substrate scope, the employment of a cheap and stable nickel salt as pre&#8208;catalyst, a safe cyano source and convenient experimental operation render this hydrocyanation practical for the laboratory synthesis of saturated nitriles.

         <title>Synthesis of Seleno Oxindoles via Electrochemical Cyclization of N&#8208;arylacrylamides with Diorganyl Diselenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The tandem cyclization of acrylamide with diselenides facilitated by electrochemical oxidation was successfully developed. This strategy provided an environmentally friendly method for the construction of C&#8722;Se bond. A series of seleno oxindoles with pharmacological activity were obtained by using this well&#8208;designed tandem cyclization strategy. The in&#8197;vitro antitumor activity of the compounds was also screened through MTT assay. Results showed that the seleno oxindoles exhibited better antitumor activity than other oxindole derivatives.

         <title>Recent Developments in Photo&#8208;Catalyzed/Promoted Synthesis of Indoles and Their Functionalization: Reactions and Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The use of clean and renewable light sources is increasingly common in organic synthesis due to its safety, practicality and economy. Recently, photoredox catalysis has shown great application values in organic transformations because of its advantages of environmentally friendly and abundant resources. Indoles and their derivatives (indolines, oxindoles and isatins) are the core skeletons of some important organic compounds and widely&#8208;present in various natural products and pharmaceuticals with different biological activities. Therefore, the research on the synthesis and modification of indoles is particularly important for chemists and pharmacologists. This review summarizes the effects of photocatalysis on indole synthesis and modification in recent decades. These transformations are accomplished by using metal photocatalysts (i.&#8201;e., Ir, Ru, Ni, Cu, Fe, Au, Rh, TiO2, etc.) or non&#8208;metallic photocatalysts (i.&#8201;e., Rose Bengal, Eosin Y, quinones, naphthols, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, carbazoles, pyrylium salts, etc.), or without the need of photocatalysts. The detailed mechanisms of these photo&#8208;catalyzed/promoted organic reactions are also highlighted deeply. And we hope this review will be helpful to researchers interested in this promising field of photocatalyzed transformations.

Abstract
An iodine&#8208;promoted one&#8208;pot cascade oxidative annulation reaction has been developed for the synthesis of [1,2,3]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines from methyl azaarenes and N&#8208;tosylhydrazines. The reaction has a broad substrate scope and can be easily scaled up to gram&#8208;scale. 1,2,3&#8208;Triazoles are an important skeletal structure for the construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;P bonds, 2&#8208;cyclopropylquinolines and imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines, for which different synthetic applications were explored.

         <title>Regioselective and Chemodivergent Synthesis of Azulenolactones and Azulenolactams from Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions of Azulenecarboxamides with Sulfoxonium Ylides</title>

Abstract
A regioselective and chemodivergent synthetic approach for azulenolactones and azulenolactams as a new scaffold was demonstrated through Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed reaction of N&#8208;methoxyazulene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxamides with sulfoxonium ylides. Sulfoxonium ylides that act as a precursor of secondary carbene was described, leading to the selective formation of azulenolactones and azulenolactams bearing two substituents on a newly introduced double bond. This method demonstrated functionalization of less reactive 2&#8208;position of azulene to overcome the natural reactivity.

Abstract
A base&#8208;mediated, green, microwave&#8208;assisted efficient preparation of a diverse benzoxanthone library from variety of readily accessible &#947;&#8208;alkynyl 1,3&#8208;diketones is reported. The synthesis is based on tandem reactions involving intramolecular cyclization, propargyl&#8208;allenyl isomerization, and electrocyclization in one pot. Some of the benzoxanthones are also synthesized by the one&#8208;pot reaction of 1,3&#8208;diketone and alkynyl bromide under basic heating conditions. This transformation also results in the construction of one new C&#8722;C bond and one new C&#8722;O bond.

Abstract
A practical method for the synthesis of selenylsubstituted indolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolin&#8208;6(5H)&#8208;ones through Fe(OTf)3&#8208;promoted tandem selenylation/cyclization of 2&#8208;arylindoles was developed. In this transformation, new C&#8722;Se bond and C&#8722;C bond were constructed simultaneously under mild conditions.

Abstract
A halogen bond donor based on a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine framework has been synthesized, and used to catalyze Friedel&#8722;Crafts reactions of furans. Electrophiles used successfully in these reactions included various enones, an aldehyde, and a carboxylic acid anhydride. The yields of the reactions were generally good using a moderate catalyst loading (0.025 or 0.1&#8197;equiv.) at a relatively low temperature (room temp. or 50&#8201;&#176;C) in acetonitrile. The catalyst used was designed with a biaryl scaffold so that if it indeed proved to be an efficient halogen bond donor organocatalyst, an enantioenriched version of it could potentially serve as a stereoselective catalyst.

         <title>Methyl Radical Initiated Kharasch and Related Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
An improved procedure to run halogen atom and related chalcogen group transfer radical additions is reported. The procedure relies on the thermal decomposition of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylhyponitrite (DTBHN), a safer alternative to the explosive diacetyl peroxide, to produce highly reactive methyl radicals that can initiate the chain process. This mode of initiation generates byproducts that are either gaseous (N2) or volatile (acetone and methyl halide) thereby facilitating greatly product purification by either flash column chromatography or distillation. In addition, remarkably simple and mild reaction conditions (refluxing EtOAc during 30 minutes under normal atmosphere) and a low excess of the radical precursor reagent (2 equivalents) make this protocol particularly attractive for preparative synthetic applications. This initiation procedure has been demonstrated with a broad scope since it works efficiently to add a range of electrophilic radicals generated from iodides, bromides, selenides and xanthates over a range of unactivated terminal alkenes. A diverse set of radical trap substrates exemplifies a broad functional group tolerance. Finally, di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxyoxalate (DTBPO) is also demonstrated as alternative source of tert&#8208;butoxyl radicals to initiate these reactions under identical conditions which gives gaseous by&#8208;products (CO2).

         <title>Stepwise Suzuki&#8722;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling of Triborylalkenes Derived from Alkynyl&#8722;B(dan)s: Regioselective and Flexible Synthesis of Tetrasubstituted Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Alkenes with three boryl groups of differing reactivities were synthesized and subsequently cross&#8208;coupled regioselectively with aryl halides in a stepwise manner to afford tetrasubstituted alkenes. The key triborylalkene is derived from the platinum&#8208;catalyzed diboration of alkynyl&#8722;B(dan)s with B2(pin)2. Due to excellent regioselectivity and reaction efficiency of each step starting with alkynyl&#8722;B(dan)s, tetrasubstituted alkenes with desired carbon frameworks at desired positions can be prepared in high yields. For example, an alkene with four distinct aryl groups, p&#8208;MeOC6H4, p&#8208;CF3C6H4, p&#8208;MeC6H4, and p&#8208;NCC6H4, was obtained in 71% overall yield via six steps, starting with the dehydrogenative borylation of p&#8208;MeC6H4C&#8801;CH with HB(dan). Moreover, a variety of tetrasubstituted alkenes, including regio&#8208; and stereoisomers of the above tetraarylalkene, AIE&#8208;active TPTPE and derivatives thereof, and (Z)&#8208;tamoxifen, a well&#8208;known breast cancer drug, were accessed via the developed strategy.

         <title>Stereospecific Synthesis of Glycoside Mimics Through Migita&#8208;Kosugi&#8208;Stille Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of Chemically and Configurationally Stable 1&#8208;C&#8208;Tributylstannyl Iminosugars</title>

Abstract
A process for the de novo synthesis of imino&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides is described. The methodology is based on the reaction of 1&#8208;C&#8208;stannylated iminosugars with various electrophiles under the conditions of Migita&#8208;Kosugi&#8208;Stille cross&#8208;couplings, which gives 1&#8208;C&#8208;substituted iminosugar derivatives in a stereoretentive process. The required iminoglycosyl stannanes are obtained by way of the highly stereoselective addition of tributylstannyllithium to (SR)&#8208; or (SS)&#8208;N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl glycosylamines, followed by an activation cyclization sequence. Most interestingly, the methodology is tunable: the configuration of the tin adduct is controlled exclusively by the tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl auxiliary, thus giving access after ring formation to &#8216;&#945;&#8217;&#8208;configured or &#8216;&#946;&#8217;&#8208;configured iminoglycosyl stannanes. With the subsequent stereoretentive C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming process, the methodology allows the synthesis of pseudo anomers of imino&#8208;C&#8208;glycosyl compounds in a controlled fashion.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction of 2&#8208;(3&#8208;arylpropioloyl)benzaldehydes was developed, leading to benzylated 1,4&#8208;naphthoquinones via radical&#8208;triggered cascade cyclization. This example of an acylbenzylation involving internal alkynes could be carried out with a broad substrate scope and wide functional group tolerance.

         <title>A3 Coupling Reaction in the Synthesis of Heterocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
In recent years, the transition&#8208;metal catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of an aldehyde, an alkyne and an amine, commonly called A3 coupling has become a powerful tool in organic synthesis. The aim of this review is to give a general overview of A3 coupling utility in the synthesis of heterocycles, highlighting the variety of compounds that can be directly accessed from single reactions. The diverse A3 coupling based methodologies that have been developed for the synthesis of N,O,S&#8208;heterocycles are presented, emphasizing the influence of the reaction conditions and the use of additional reagents in the outcome of the transformations.

         <title>Cyclization of Polarized Divinyl Ketones under Aqueous and Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An &#8216;on&#8208;water&#8217; protocol has been developed for the synthesis of combretastatin A&#8208;4 (CA&#8208;4) analogues by cyclization of polarized triaryldivinyl ketones using hydrochloric acid as a promoter in 45&#8211;95% yields. The reaction time was reduced by about 30 times due to ultrasonic irradiation at ambient temperature. The other advantages of this new method are operational simplicity, easy workup, no column purification, and applicability on a gram&#8208;scale. It was shown that the amphiphilicity of the substrate and a low energy barrier of the reaction are a prerequisite for electrophilic and concerted reactions under aqueous and ambient conditions.

         <title>Gold&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H Functionalization of Phenothiazines with Aryldiazoacetates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Phenothiazine is an important structural motif in pharmaceuticals and advanced functional organic materials. However, the C&#8722;H functionalization reaction of N&#8208;protected phenothiazine is rather unexplored and often shadowed by its chemical reactivity on the heteroatomic centers, which limits the diversity of its potential applications. This report demonstrates a straightforward approach towards the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H functionalization of phenothiazine at the para&#8208;position of N atom via gold&#8208;catalyzed carbene transfer reactions (37&#8197;examples, up to 83% yield). The mechanism behind the regionselectivity of the C&#8722;H functionalization reaction was also elucidated by a combination of computational and experimental studies.

Abstract
Rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative annulation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines with maleimides is described. The reaction afforded 1H&#8208;benzo[e]pyrido[1&#8242;,2&#8242;:1,2]imidazo[4,5&#8208;g]isoindole&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;diones in high yields with wide range of functional group tolerance. The reaction proceeds through Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation, followed by maleimide insertion and intramolecular cyclization. Photophysical properties of 1H&#8208;benzo[e]pyrido[1&#8242;,2&#8242;:1,2]imidazo[4,5&#8208;g]isoindole&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;diones were studied with UV&#8208;visible and fluorescence spectroscopy and validated by quantum chemical calculations. All the annulated products showed large Stokes shift values with emission in the range of 530&#8211;618&#8201;nm, and moderate to high quantum yields.

         <title>Copper(II)&#8208;Catalysed Aerobic Oxidative Coupling of Arylamines with Hexafluoroisopropanol: An Alternative Methodology for Constructing Fluorinated Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The selective functionalisation of arylamine derivatives with hexafluoroisopropanol through copper(II)&#8208;catalysed aerobic oxidative coupling was developed to generate various fluoroalkylated arylamines under mild conditions. This method has a wide substrate scope with excellent functional group tolerance and provides the fluorinated products in good to excellent yields. Furthermore, preliminary studies indicate that this reaction occur via a radical mechanism. This protocol, which uses atmospheric O2 as an oxidant, provides an alternative green route for constructing fluorinated compounds.

         <title>Enantioselective Michael Addition Reactions to Construct SCF3&#8208;containing Stereocenter Catalyzed by Chiral Quaternary Phosphonium Salts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The trifluoromethylthio group is significant in drug design for its high stability, electronegativity, and lipophilicity. Herein, a series of indenone structures containing the SCF3 group and an adjacent chiral quaternary stereocenter were synthesized by an asymmetric Michael addition reaction using an ion pair catalyst derived from amino acids. The desired products were obtained in excellent yields (up to 98%) and good to high stereoselectivities (up to 97%&#8197;ee and &gt;20:1&#8197;dr).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trifluoromethylthio group is significant in drug design for its high stability, electronegativity, and lipophilicity. Herein, a series of indenone structures containing the SCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group and an adjacent chiral quaternary stereocenter were synthesized by an asymmetric Michael addition reaction using an ion pair catalyst derived from amino acids. The desired products were obtained in excellent yields (up to 98%) and good to high stereoselectivities (up to 97%&#8197;ee and &amp;gt;20:1&#8197;dr).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
