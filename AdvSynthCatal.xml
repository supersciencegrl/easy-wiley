         <title>Photoinduced Methylthio Radical Generation from Methylthiophosphonium Salt</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of methylthio radical typically relies on gaseous methanethiol or dimethyl disulfide. Herein, we present a new and straightforward method for the photogeneration of methylthio radical from methylthiophosphonium salt, enabling the synthesis of methylthiophenanthridines via charge transfer complex strategy. In this approach, the methylthiophosphonium salt acts as the electron acceptor, while 2&#8208;isocyanobiaryls serve as the electron donors. This strategy is distinguished by its simplicity in both conditions and operation, and can be extended for the generation of various alkyl(aryl)thio radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Minisci&#8208;Type Acylation of Heterocyclic C&#8211;H Bonds with Amino Acid&#8208;Tethered Dihydropyridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugation of amino acids to bioactive molecules has emerged as a promising strategy for optimizing pharmacological profiles of lead candidates in drug discovery. This study describes a photocatalytic Minisci&#8208;type transfer reaction of N&#8208;acyl amino acids into various N&#8208;heterocycles. Notably, this protocol enables direct conjugation of amino acids into heterocyclic C&#8211;H bonds, eliminating the need for prefunctionalized substrates. A diverse array of N&#8208;heterocycles, amino acids, oligopeptides, and drugs were used to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach. In addition, the importance of this approach is demonstrated through its application in the DNA&#8208;encoded library chemistry. Various synthetic transformations and preliminary mechanistic investigations were also explored.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrative C2&#8208;Arylation of Oxazoles, Benzoxazoles, and Benzimidazoles with Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A step&#8208;economic method for C2&#8208;arylated azoles via Pd&#8208;catalyzed denitrative arylation of nitroarenes and azoles is reported. This protocol employs synthetically upstream nitroarenes as arylating reagents and proceeds through the selective cleavage of the C&#8211;NO&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;and C&#8211;H bonds. Various nitroarenes and nitroheteroarenes were coupled with oxazoles, benzoxazoles, and methylbenzimidazoles, achieving yields of up to 95%. The method's utility is exemplified by its application in the synthesis of Flunoxaprofen. This strategy reduces synthetic steps and minimizes pollution, offering substantial cost&#8208;effectiveness and environmental benefits. Furthermore, the relatively inert C&#8211;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bond in nitroarenes enables late&#8208;stage functionalization or stepwise coupling reactions, providing a complementary method for C2&#8208;arylation of azoles.</dc:description>

Abstract
We describe a selective preparation of a variety of functionalized pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;c]tetrahydroquinolines and indolo[3,2&#8208;c]tetrahydroquinolines in 40&#8211;82% and 40&#8211;80% yields from alkynyl&#8208;tethered oximes with diaryliodonium triflates, respectively. The one&#8208;pot reaction underwent N&#8208;arylation, intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition, selective [1.3] or [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement of N&#8722;O bond in total three steps. Experimental studies revealed that EtOAc solvent and copper(II)&#8208;catalyst played crucial roles on the formation of these two tetrahydroquinoline scaffolds. Moreover, these two tetrahydroquinoline scaffolds could be converted into various tetrahydroquinoline building blocks by further transformations.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Tandem Cycloisomerization/Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction of 1,7&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed methodology for regioselective cycloisomerization and tandem Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of 1,7&#8208;enynes has been described, enabling the synthesis of diverse polycyclic heterocycles with four stereocenters. This stereoselective protocol demonstrates compatibility with various substituted enynes and alkenes, yielding products in 46&#8211;90% yield while tolerating a wide range of functional groups, including esters, ketones, and halides. Notably, the reaction with naphthoquinones retains the moiety in the final product, which acts as essential core structures in various natural products and bioactive compounds.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ruthenium-catalyzed methodology for regioselective cycloisomerization and tandem Diels-Alder reactions of 1,7-enynes has been described, enabling the synthesis of diverse polycyclic heterocycles with four stereocenters. This stereoselective protocol demonstrates compatibility with various substituted enynes and alkenes, yielding products in 46&#8211;90% yield while tolerating a wide range of functional groups, including esters, ketones, and halides. Notably, the reaction with naphthoquinones retains the moiety in the final product, which acts as essential core structures in various natural products and bioactive compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Quinoxaline is a chemical moiety known for its diverse physicochemical and biological properties, making it the focus of extensive research. Over the past few decades, quinoxaline scaffolds have been utilized in the design and development of various bioactive molecules, dyes, fluorescent materials, electroluminescent materials, organic sensitizers for solar cells, and polymeric optoelectronic materials. Herein, we present a metal&#8208;free and rapid protocol for the phosphorylation of quinoxalines and quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one. This method employs oxygen as an oxidant under ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, with experimental evidence indicating the absence of radical involvement. Our methodology provides range of phosphorylated quinoxalines and quinoxaline&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one in yields ranging from 47% to 99%.

         <title>Selective Enzymatic C&#8208;H&#8208;Oxyfunctionalization for the Efficient Synthesis of Grevillic Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, a selective C&#8208;H oxyfunctionalization using an unspecific peroxygenase (UPO) enabled an efficient biosynthetic route for the synthesis of grevillic acid (GA), a natural antioxidant. The route commenced with the release of o&#8208;coumaric acid (oCA) from trans&#8208;2&#8208;coumaric acid glucoside (trans&#8208;CAG) using commercially available &#42933;&#8208;glucosidase from almonds. In addition, a cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans photoisomerization of cis&#8208;CAG was implemented to increase the synthetic access of oCA. The key step, the para&#8208;hydroxylation relative to the existing hydroxyl group of oCA, was accomplished by an UPO with full conversion and 93% isolated yield. Despite its name, the UPO turned out to exhibit excellent regioselectivity in this C&#8208;H functionalization, requiring only H2O2 as a cosubstrate.</dc:description>

Abstract
We present a novel and highly efficient method for synthesizing polyfunctionalized 1,2,4&#8208;triazoles. This approach leverages visible light and arylazo sulfones in combination with N&#8208;vinyl amides, in the environmentally friendly solvent ethyl acetate. Remarkably, the reaction proceeds without the need for (photo)catalysts, ensuring near&#8208;perfect atom economy and producing only water as a by&#8208;product. This method exhibits excellent functional group tolerance and can be scaled for both batch and continuous&#8208;flow processes.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Cascade Trifluoromethylation of Dienes and Enynes Using a Perylene Diimide (PDI) Organophotocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The perylene diimide (PDI) is an underexplored synthetic organic dye with significant potential in photoredox catalysis. We have developed a good chemo&#8208; and regioselective, atom&#8208;economical methodology for synthesizing trifluoroethylated saturated heterocyclic derivatives and trifluoroethyl&#8208;containing cyclobutane derivatives. This process involves the generation of trifluoromethyl radical from the Langlois (CF3SO2Na) reagent under photoredox conditions, which selectively reacts with the electron&#8208;rich terminal double/triple bonds in the diene/enyne framework. The resulting intermediate undergoes a cascade cyclization, yielding the desired compounds in a redox&#8208;neutral manner. Our methodology operates under very mild conditions, eliminating the need for transition metals and external oxidizing agents. It is broadly applicable across various substrates and is supported by comprehensive mechanistic insights from regular photophysical experiments.

Abstract
A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective cycloisomerization of bis(indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;ynamides for the rapid construction of five&#8208;membered ring linked bisindole derivatives has been reported, affording the desired products in the range of 72%&#8211;94% yields under mild conditions along with broad substrate scope. Moreover, DFT calculation of the NBO (natural bond orbital) charge supports the origin of its regioselectivity.

Abstract
An environmentally benign route for the synthesis of sulfonamides via Sulfur (VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) chemistry utilizing N&#8208;methylimidazole, that simultaneously act as a base, precatalyst, HF by&#8208;product scavenger, as well as solvent, is described. This one&#8208;step sulfonamide synthesis exhibits excellent reactivity toward highly electron&#8208;deficient and less nucleophilic anilines as well as aminopyridines while tolerating a wide range of functional groups. In addition to the desired sulfonamide target, we also isolated an ionic salt as the sole side product from the reaction mixture that has been identified as bis[1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;3&#8208;ium] hexafluorosilicate (IV). The glass surface of reaction vessel is acting as the source of silicon present in the isolated side product. Formation of hexafluorosilicate salt is also facilitating the consumption of sulfonyl fluoride for sulfonamide synthesis. Optimization of the reaction under various conditions, as well as the isolation of the bis[1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;3&#8208;ium] hexafluorosilicate (IV) salt, highlight the crucial role of N&#8208;methylimidazole and support the glass&#8208;assisted approach. Besides the first example of glass&#8211;assisted SuFEx catalyzed by benign organic bases, this reaction also offers an alternative route for accessing protic hexafluorosilicate&#8208;based molten salts without employing external HF. The synthetic utility of this SuFEx route for late&#8208;stage functionalization is also demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;An environmentally benign route for the synthesis of sulfonamides via Sulfur (VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) chemistry utilizing &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylimidazole, that simultaneously act as a base, precatalyst, HF by-product scavenger, as well as solvent, is described. This one-step sulfonamide synthesis exhibits excellent reactivity toward highly electron-deficient and less nucleophilic anilines as well as aminopyridines while tolerating a wide range of functional groups. In addition to the desired sulfonamide target, we also isolated an ionic salt as the sole side product from the reaction mixture that has been identified as bis[1-methyl-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-imidazole-3-ium] hexafluorosilicate (IV). The glass surface of reaction vessel is acting as the source of silicon present in the isolated side product. Formation of hexafluorosilicate salt is also facilitating the consumption of sulfonyl fluoride for sulfonamide synthesis. Optimization of the reaction under various conditions, as well as the isolation of the bis[1-methyl-1H-imidazole-3-ium] hexafluorosilicate (IV) salt, highlight the crucial role of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylimidazole and support the glass-assisted approach.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed carbo&#8208;/protoboration of boryl enynes is disclosed, providing access to an array of penta&#8208; and hexasubstituted diboryl dienes in a chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner. All six positions of the dienes can be manipulated using this methodology. The hexasubstituted diene boronates adopt a skew conformation. An iterative Suzuki coupling of the products provided highly conjugated trienes and tetraenes.

Abstract
We have developed a synthesis for tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines involving cascade sigmatropic rearrangements. The substrates were conveniently prepared from parent anilines via a [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement and cyanomethylation. Silver&#8208;mediated decyanation afforded the corresponding iminium cation, which underwent a cascade consisting of an aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement, an aza&#8208;oxa&#8208;Cope rearrangement, an aromatization, and a Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction, and tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines were obtained as the single product. The reaction involved seven bond scissions and four bond formations and was triggered by a single reagent.

Abstract
Herein, an electroreductive aryl radical enabled 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization of N&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;halobenzamides is presented, providing a convenient route for the synthesis of a variety of 3&#8208;iminoisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones in 30&#8211;75% yields. Simply by employing zinc plate instead of graphite rod anode, the products of the electrosynthesis are switched to diverse 3&#8208;aminoisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones through aryl&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization and subsequent reductive hydrogenation. Furthermore, this anode material determined divergent 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization features mild electrochemical conditions, excellent substrate scopes, and good functional group tolerance.

Abstract
Herein, we report the development of photoredox&#8208;catalyzed N&#8722;H insertion of sulfoxonium ylides with amines via oxidative single&#8208;electron transfer (SET). These reactions exhibit broad substrate scope (32 examples) and offer operationally simple, scalable procedures for accessing &#945;&#8208;ketoamides in a single step. Mechanistic studies and control experiments confirm the participation of a photogenerated carbon radical in facilitating the oxidative single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) from the sulfoxonium ylides to initiate the reaction.

         <title>Selective 1,2&#8208;Carboimination of Isothiocyanates to Access S&#8208;Substituted Isothioureas via Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we introduce a novel method for the synthesis of S&#8208;substituted isothiourea compounds via the selective 1,2&#8208;carboimination between oxime esters as bifunctional reagents and the C=S bond of isothiocyanates under visible&#8208;light catalysis. This approach deviates from conventional methods by precisely modulating the substrate electronics to selectively functionalize the C=S bond of isothiocyanates over the C=N bond, eliminating the need for strong bases and high temperatures and bypassing the formation of thiourea intermediates. Consequently, this protocol enables the efficient one&#8208;step synthesis of S&#8208;alkyl isothioureas, with featuring mild reaction conditions, operational simplicity and broad substrate scope.

Abstract
Benzylidene imidazolones with an ortho&#8208;sec&#8208;amino group undergo chemodivergent photochemical transformations, based on the wavelength of irradiation. Irradiation at 525&#8197;nm causes dimerization and the formation of cyclobutanes with two spiroatoms, related to dictazoles in 87&#8211;98% yield. In turn, irradiation at 365&#8197;nm provides access to spirocyclic indolines in 67&#8211;92% yield. Each of the processes proceeds with exclusive atom economy and chemoselectivity.

Abstract
A concise and practical sustainable strategy for modular access to isoquinoline&#8208;fused benzo[f][1,3]oxazepine derivatives through a formal [4+3] annulation of commercially available salicyaldehydes with isoquinolinium salts has been developed. The reactions proceeded through the formation of two new bonds (C=C and C&#8722;O) and a seven&#8208;membered heterocyclic ring in one pot. Remarkably, use of simple NaHCO3 as a mild base, open atmosphere, nonhazardous reagents, nice functional group tolerance, and easily scale up are added characteristics to this approach. A wide range of substrates are compatible with this mild reaction system, thereby proving a facile and reliable protocol for constructing a benzo[f][1,3]oxazepine skeletons.

         <dc:description>An electrochemical cascade radical cyclization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl indoles with sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate as a coupling partner has been explored, which afforded the unexpected bis&#8208;trifluoromethylated indole[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines as products. Experimental results and DFT calculations disclose that this reaction involves trifluoromethylation&#8208;triggered cyclization and the second trifluoromethylation as the key steps. This strategy does not need any transition&#8208;metal catalysts or oxidants with a readily available trifluoromethylating reagent enabling facile synthesis of bis&#8208;trifluoromethylated indole&#8208;fused tricycles.</dc:description>

         <title>From gem&#8208;Dichlorocyclobutenones to Cyclobutenols: Unveiling a Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Reduction&#8208;Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation Cascade</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclobutenones constitute an appealing class of substrates in catalytic asymmetric transformations leading to diversely substituted enantioenriched four&#8208;membered carbocycles, which are eliciting a growing interest in medicinal chemistry. Whilst several synthetically useful enantioselective conjugate addition reactions have been reported, the catalytic enantioselective reduction of the carbonyl group of simple cyclobutenones remains an elusive transformation. Herein, we disclose the discovery of a novel allylic reduction&#8208;asymmetric transfer hydrogenation cascade, catalyzed by a Noyori&#8208;Ikariya ruthenium complex, from readily available gem&#8208;dichlorocyclobutenones, leading to 2&#8208;chlorocyclobutenols with high optical purities, which can be engaged in postfunctionalization reactions enabling access to substituted four&#8208;membered rings.</dc:description>

Abstract
Herein, we report a protocol for the direct visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted decarboxylative aminomethylation of ferulic acid with N&#8208;aryl tetrahydroisoquinolines under air atmosphere. The current protocol uses naturally available ferulic acid as coupling partner, the inexpensive organic photocatalyst riboflavin tetraacetate (RFTA) as photocatalyst and molecular oxygen as oxidant, which is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. This methodology further demonstrated its utility by the protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free semi&#8208;synthesis of natural alkaloids maclekarpine E and by assessing the anti&#8208;inflammatory activity of its analogues.

Abstract
The combination of a gold(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complex and an ene&#8208;reductase (ERED) has made possible the synthesis of enantiopure &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones in a one&#8208;pot concurrent approach. The protocol consists of the Meyer&#8208;Schuster rearrangement of racemic propargylic tertiary alcohols using [1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene]&#8208;[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)&#8208;imide]gold(I) (IPrAuNTf2), followed by an asymmetric alkene reduction of the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone intermediate using the Zymomonas mobilis ERED (NCR&#8208;ERED). The chemoenzymatic cascade was optimised with a model substrate, where E/Z&#8208;isomers both generated the (R)&#8208;ketone, which was rationalised using in silico molecular docking experiments. The cascade was then applied towards the production of a series of (R)&#8208;4&#8208;substituted&#8208;alkan&#8208;2&#8208;ones in enantiopure form in a straightforward manner.

&lt;p&gt;The combination of a gold(I) N-heterocyclic carbene complex and an ene-reductase (ERED) has made possible the synthesis of enantiopure &#946;,&#946;-disubstituted ketones in a one-pot concurrent approach. The protocol consists of the Meyer-Schuster rearrangement of racemic propargylic tertiary alcohols using [1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]-[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-imide]gold(I) (IPrAuNTf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), followed by an asymmetric alkene reduction of the &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated ketone intermediate using the &lt;i&gt;Zymomonas mobilis&lt;/i&gt; ERED (NCR-ERED). The chemoenzymatic cascade was optimised with a model substrate, where &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-isomers both generated the (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-ketone, which was rationalised using &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; molecular docking experiments. The cascade was then applied towards the production of a series of (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-4-substituted-alkan-2-ones in enantiopure form in a straightforward manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
We have developed a Ni&#8208;catalyzed cyclodimerization of 1,6&#8208;allenyenes which affords pentacyclic derivatives containing a [3]&#8208;ladderane. Six new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds are formed in a single operation which is fully atom&#8208;economical. The reaction proceeds with an inexpensive catalyst and shows a broad scope in the alkyne, the allene and the tethering group. A computational and experimental study on the reaction mechanism suggests that this process proceeds by oxidative cyclometallation of the allenyne coordinated to Ni(0) followed by reductive elimination leading to cyclobutenes. Then, two of these molecules are coupled following a related cyclometallation&#8208;reductive elimination sequence, the latter being the rate&#8208;limiting step.

Abstract
We here report a catalytic strategy to enable the decarboxylative allylic amination of vinyl cyclic carbonates using various aliphatic and nucleophilic amines. The use of a protic medium and chelating diphosphine ligands are the main drivers towards chemoselective allylic amine formation, thereby minimizing undesired ligand&#8208;driven complex speciation and aminolysis of the involved substrate. This improved approach amplifies the repertoire of allylic amine synthons that can be prepared from a variety of substrate combinations.

         <title>Rhodium Catalysts Based on Phenyl Substituted Cp Ligands for Indole Synthesis via Oxidative Coupling of Acetanilides and Alkynes</title>

Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling of acetanilides and alkynes via C&#8722;H activation is the most powerful synthetic tool for producing the indole motif from commercially available precursors. However, this reaction usually requires large catalyst loadings (5&#8197;mol% of rhodium). In this study, a 1,2&#8208;diphenylcyclopentadienyl ligand&#8208;based catalyst was developed that works well at 1&#8197;mol% loading of rhodium. DFT calculations of the C&#8722;H activation step provided insight into its high catalytic activity. The catalyst efficiency was also demonstrated in the synthesis of naturally occurring isocoumarins, such as polygonolide, tubakialactone B and penicimarine F. The developed catalytic protocols tolerate a wide range of functional groups, for example, halide, nitro, hydroxy, and alkoxy.

Abstract
(R)&#8208;9&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl) adenine ((R)&#8208;HPA) is an important intermediate for the synthesis of tenofovir and its prodrugs. Herein, structure&#8208;guided rational design of short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase LfSDR1 was adopted to improve the catalytic performance for enantioselective synthesis of (R)&#8208;HPA at high substrate loading. The crystal structures of LfSDR1 in its apo form as well as in complex with NADPH were solved, which were used for mutagenesis studies and illustration mechanism. Three residues (G92, E141 and V186) were identified as hotspots by structural analysis, and variants V186A/G92V and V186A/G92V/E141L with remarkably improved activity were obtained. By molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of WT and variants, G92V plays a key role in enzyme&#8208;substrate interaction in the binding pocket. Whole cells expressing the mutant LfSDR1&#8208;V186A/G92V and glucose dehydrogenase BsGDH from Bacillus subtilis were used as the catalyst, and up to 200&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 substrate without cosolvent was completely converted to (R)&#8208;HPA with 99.9% ee and a high space&#8208;time yield (STY) of 800&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8197;day&#8722;1. This study improves the understanding of the catalytic mechanism of LfSDR and provides a potential biocatalytic strategy for industrial synthesis of (R)&#8208;HPA.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted site&#8208;selective difluoroalkoxylation of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines has been achieved using N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) as a fluorinating agent. This practical reaction has a wide range of substrate scope for both imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines and alcohols to give 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;arylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines in 65&#8211;93% yields. The reaction proceeded at room temperature, showed high functional group tolerance, and was amenable to scale&#8208;up. Based on mechanistic investigation, a radical pathway is proposed.

&lt;p&gt;A visible-light-promoted site-selective difluoroalkoxylation of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines has been achieved using N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) as a fluorinating agent. This practical reaction has a wide range of substrate scope for both imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines and alcohols to give 3,3-difluoro-2-alkoxy-2-arylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridines in 65&#8211;93% yields. The reaction proceeded at room temperature, showed high functional group tolerance, and was amenable to scale-up. Based on mechanistic investigation, a radical pathway is proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
We present a diastereoselective Au/Pd relay catalytic tandem cyclization reaction to produce dearomatic 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;7&#8208;azaspiro[4.5]decane derivatives under mild conditions. This process involves generating furan&#8208;derived azadiene from readily available enynamide, followed by a [2+4] cycloaddition with Pd&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl dipole decarboxylated from vinyl benzoxazinanone. Our method efficiently constructs the spiro[4.5]decane skeleton, achieving yields ranging from 31&#8211;97% and diastereoselectivities from 6:1 dr to &gt;20:1 dr across 34 examples. This research introduces new cycloaddition sites for azadienes as 1,2&#8208;dipoles and offers a reliable approach for constructing oxa&#8208;azaspiro[4.5]decane frameworks.

Abstract
We have developed a method for the synthesis of thieno[3,2&#8208;b]furans on the basis of a strategy consisting of a formal [3+2] cycloaddition utilizing the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement and a subsequent Br&#248;nsted base&#8208;mediated cyclization. The method streamlines access to a wide range of well&#8208;organized 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted thieno[3,2&#8208;b]furans that are otherwise difficult to synthesize and is also applicable to the syntheses of 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted seleno[3,2&#8208;b]furans.

Abstract
A squaramide moiety was introduced at the C&#8208;4 position of proline to afford an organocatalyst that served as a stereocontrol element to promote the asymmetric Michael addition of cyclic ketones to maleimides. A variety of chiral succinimides were obtained by the conjugate addition in 84&#8211;98% yield accompanied by 58&#8211;96% enantioselectivity. The results also include an interesting contrast in the facial selectivity observed with cyclohexanones and cycloheptanones, whereas an asymmetric desymmetrization of 4&#8208;alkyl cyclohexanones was also achieved using the transformation.

Abstract
A method for the synthesis of unsymmetrical bis(indolyl)methanes (BIMs) using simple indoles and readily available alcohols as the coupling partners under both heat and 390&#8211;400&#8197;nm light conditions was developed. Detailed research of the mechanism demonstrated that the diaryliodonium salt&#8208;mediated transformation undergoes a nucleophilic hydroxymethyl radical formation process. Moreover, the diaryliodonium salt&#8208;mediated method is also applicable for synthesizing symmetrical BIMs.

Abstract
Herein, we present the first annulation reaction of (N&#8208;aryl)&#8208;alkynyl sulphonamides leading to sultams or spirocyclic sultams. The selective formation of aforesaid products is based on the variable reactivity, intramolecular ortho&#8208;cyclization or dearomative ipso&#8208;annulation, guided by the substituent on N&#8208;aryl group of the substrate. The ortho&#8208;annulation is mediated by electrophile, while the ipso&#8208;annulation is promoted by the radical, enabling the functionalization (selenyl or iodo) on sultams. The synthetic potential of this method is illustrated by modifications of the functional groups present in the products obtained.

Abstract
The spiroketal moiety is an important substructure within many biological natural products. One method to access them is via the oxidative cyclisation of a pendant hydroxyl group on to a pre&#8208;formed pyran. However applications of this methodology have been severely limited by requiring the use of toxic oxidants, such as lead (IV) tetraacetate or mercuric oxide. Herein we report a high yielding photochemical route to prepare complex spiroketals using an oxidative photochemical approach employing iodine monochloride and sodium acetate and demonstrate the methodology to the synthesis of a number of insect pheromones.

Abstract
The replacement of benzene rings with saturated bioisosteric counterparts is a key priority in drug discovery programs, and disubstituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes have been recognized as flexible molecular scaffolds that could act as ortho&#8208;substituted benzene bioisosteres. In this study, we outline the synthesis of a wide range of 2&#8208;substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexan&#8208;1&#8208;ols, which have the potential to emulate ortho&#8208;phenolic derivatives, via SmI2&#8208;mediated reductive cyclization reactions. The synthetic utility of this methodology was exemplified by the preparation of several saturated analogs of pharmaceutically relevant compounds.

Abstract
The synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactam scaffolds is of paramount importance due to their extensive applications in pharmaceuticals, particularly as antibiotics. Visible light photocatalysis has emerged as a revolutionary approach in this domain, providing a sustainable and efficient pathway for &#946;&#8208;lactam construction. In this review, we meticulously discuss the recent developments in the synthesis of photocatalysed &#946;&#8208;lactam frameworks. A key focus is the Staudinger reaction, traditionally a cornerstone in &#946;&#8208;lactam synthesis, and its adaptation to visible light photocatalysis. We explore the mechanistic intricacies of the Staudinger reaction under photochemical conditions, along with other pivotal cyclization strategies enabled by visible light. By illuminating the novel photocatalytic routes to &#946;&#8208;lactams, this review provides a thorough understanding of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques and sets the stage for future innovations in the green synthesis of these critical compounds.

Abstract
Organophosphorus compounds, especially phosphorylated heterocycles, are gaining increasing attention in the fields of materials science, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemistry due to their excellent biological activities. Consequently, the exploration of green and efficient methods for the synthesis of phosphorylated heterocycles has garnered significant interest from organic chemists. In recent years, visible light&#8208;induced photoredox&#8208;catalyzed organic synthesis has made substantial progress in the field of phosphorylation reaction since its eco&#8208;friendly and mild conditions. This review summarizes the advances of the past five years in the visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthesis of phosphorylated heterocycles using phosphine oxides as precursors through P&#8208;centered radical addition, cross&#8208;coupling, and cyclization reactions.

Abstract
Benzofluorenes are an important class of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are widely used in materials science for light&#8208;sensitive electronic components. In addition, the benzofluorene skeleton also serves as a key structural unit in various natural products. Therefore, the development of synthetic strategies for the construction of benzofluorenes has been a prominent research topic in synthetic chemistry. Over the past few decades, numerous efforts have been made for the construction of benzofluorenes via cascade cyclization of alkyne units. This review aims to summarize recent advances in the cascade cyclization of alkyne units for the construction of Based on the different reaction mechanisms underlying these transformations, this review can be divided into four categories: (1) thermal&#8208;induced cascade cyclization of alkyne units for the construction of benzofluorenes, (2) metal&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of alkyne units for the construction of benzofluorenes, (3) acid&#8208;promoted/catalyzed cyclization of alkyne units for the construction of benzofluorenes, and (4) base&#8208;promoted cascade cyclization of alkyne units for the construction of benzofluorenes.

Abstract
Germanium (Ge), a congener of carbon, possesses unique properties that hold extensive potential for applications across multiple domains. Recent years have seen significant progress in the development of carbon&#8208;germanium bond formation strategies, particularly those for more challenging C(sp3)&#8722;Ge bonds. This review systematically summarizes the recent advances in C(sp3)&#8722;Ge bond forming methodologies, with particular emphasis on (1) the versatility of transition&#8208;metals, including iron, nickel, copper, rhodium and palladium, as catalysts in broadening reaction scope and controlling selectivity; (2) the powerfulness of organic photocatalysis in achieving mild and selective bond formation, and (3) the sustainability of catalytic electrosynthesis in facilitating chemical oxidant&#8208;/reductant&#8208; free conversions. Additionally, examples of (4) non&#8208;catalytic strategies are also discussed. The representative scopes, as well as mechanistic proposals, of these protocols are highlighted. Through an overview on the current state of research, this review aims to offer insights into the catalytic construction of C(sp3)&#8722;Ge bonds, and provide perspectives on future research directions to address the current challenges.

         <title>Catalytic Strategies for the Selective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Functionalized Amines via Hydrofunctionalization of Enamides</title>

Abstract
&#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Functionalized amines are two classes of important compounds, whose structural units are widely present in approved drugs. The hydrofunctionalization of enamides is the most direct and efficient method for constructing these two types of compounds. Regioselectivity is the focus of this conversion, and is largely influenced by the catalytic mode. Therefore, to selectively synthesize &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;functionalized amines, the progress in the catalytic hydrofunctionalization of enamides over the past decade is reviewed, and the catalytic pathways for this process discussed in detail. This account aims to objectively evaluate the effects of various catalytic pathways on the regioselectivity of hydrofunctionalization, to provide a new perspective on the selection of catalytic methods and the design of catalytic pathways for the selective synthesis of &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;functionalized amines.

Abstract
Flavin&#8208;dependent nitroreductases are gaining attention as biocatalysts for the synthesis of pharmaceutically active compounds and their precursors. Here, we examined a panel of nitroreductase&#8208;like flavoenzymes for their reductase activity towards a wide variety of aromatic and aliphatic nitro compounds, nitroolefins, and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Several of these flavoenzymes displayed high reductase activity and achieved excellent conversion of diverse nitroarenes, nitroolefins and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds, accomplishing good product yields in semi&#8208;preparative scale reactions (up to 97%). In addition to the catalytic promiscuity of several of these flavoenzymes, being able to perform the reduction of nitro groups (nitroreductase activity) as well as C=C groups (ene&#8208;reductase activity), this study also revealed that some flavoenzymes exhibit high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and/or enantioselectivity, making them attractive enzymes for use in organic synthesis.

Abstract
The synthesis of substituted 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones has attracted considerable attention due to the frequent presence of the indole nucleus in numerous natural products and biologically active molecules. Herein, a direct access to 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones through copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative intramolecular cyclization of N&#8208;(2&#8208;acetylphenyl)picolinamide has been developed. This method exhibits good functional group tolerance, atom&#8208;economy and avoids the pre&#8208;functionalization of substrates.

Abstract
Metal hydride catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) reaction of 1,6&#8208;enyne and electron&#8208;poor alkene progresses through a radical cascade, involving ene&#8208;yne cyclization and exocyclic C&#8722;C bond formation superseding the direct reductive olefin cross&#8208;coupling; which is realized in the current study. The generality of this reaction manifold is demonstrated with a range of functionalized 1,6&#8208;enyne and dienes and involving structurally distinct electron&#8208;poor olefins and alkynes as partners. Current work unveils a merger of MHAT&#8208;based olefin&#8208;hydro functionalization with radical ene&#8208;one cyclization.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal hydride catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) reaction of 1,6-enyne and electron-poor alkene progresses through a radical cascade, involving ene-yne cyclization and exocyclic C&#8722;C bond formation superseding the direct reductive olefin cross-coupling; which is realized in the current study. The generality of this reaction manifold is demonstrated with a range of functionalized 1,6-enyne and dienes and involving structurally distinct electron-poor olefins and alkynes as partners. Current work unveils a merger of MHAT-based olefin-hydro functionalization with radical ene-one cyclization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Light mediated iodine&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of enaminones through C&#8722;N bond cleavage has been described. In addition to substituted ynones, diverse substituted acyclic tertiary amines, and cyclic tertiary amines were also reactive under standard conditions. Selected transformations of the coupling adduct demonstrated the latent utility of this protocol. Preliminary mechanistic studies were also conducted.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Multisubstituted Hydroindole Derivatives via [3+2] Annulations of p&#8208;Quinamines with Nitroalkenes</title>

Abstract
The synthesis of two stereoisomers of hydroindole derivatives was achieved through [3+2] annulations of p&#8208;quinamines with nitroalkenes. Catalyst&#8208;free or in the presence of DMAP, the annulation reactions were employed to produce the target products containing four contiguous stereogenic centers. This method enables the efficient construction of multisubstituted and functionalized hydroindole derivatives from readily accessible building blocks and reagents. Furthermore, the anti&#8208;inflammatory activity of some resulting hydroindoles was evaluated, with three derivative products showing effective inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

Abstract
A molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of N2,C3&#8208;disubstituted 2H&#8208;indazoles from readily available 2&#8208;acylazobenzenes via deoxygenation of C=O and annulation has been described. The non&#8208;noble metal catalytic system has good tolerance of functional groups, and various N2,C3&#8208;disubstituted 2H&#8208;indazoles have been constructed in 24% to 99% yield. This reaction is easy to scale&#8208;up and has shown its applications in deriving valuable fluorescent and bioactive compounds. The plausible mechanism shows the plausible processes of molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenative annulation.

Abstract
Tandem reactions via electrocatalytic annulations have emerged as a strategy for the construction of heterocycles. Herein, a two&#8208;component electrochemical annulation via sequential reduction, oxidation, and condensation steps to synthesize valuable benzimidazoles motifs is reported. This reaction, which utilizes electricity as both the oxidants and reductants, tolerates a broad range of functional groups. Detailed mechanistic studies including control experiments, cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis, and key reaction intermediate characterization, reveals an intermolecular electrochemical redox/cyclization pathway.

Abstract
The transition metal catalyzed cyclization of alkene&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chloride has emerged as a tool to construct oxindoles bearing quaternary centers. Most of these reactions proceed via carbometalation&#8208;initiated 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization followed by nucleophilic trapping of the resulting &#963; alkyl&#8208;metal species to achieve diverse functionalized oxindoles. The 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig type cyclization of alkene&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chloride has been rarely reported. Herein, a zinc&#8208;mediated carbamoyl amination of alkylidenecyclopropane&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides with anilines for the synthesis of functionalized 2&#8208;quinolones was developed. A range of different substituted 2&#8208;quinolones were prepared in 65&#8211;89% yield from alkylidenecyclopropane&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides and aniline derivatives using a Zn/TMSCl system.

Abstract
A direct electrochemical redox reaction involving radical cross&#8208;coupling cyclization for the synthesis of pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxaline derivatives from 1&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrroles and CH3CN has been developed, which includes the functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds as well as the construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds. Notably, the control and deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments suggest that CH3CN in this reaction acts as both a carbon source via C&#8722;C cleavage and solvent.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A direct electrochemical redox reaction involving radical cross-coupling cyclization for the synthesis of pyrrolo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]quinoxaline derivatives from 1-(2-aminophenyl)pyrroles and CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN has been developed, which includes the functionalization of C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds as well as the construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds. Notably, the control and deuterium-labelling experiments suggest that CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN in this reaction acts as both a carbon source &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; C&#8722;C cleavage and solvent. The reaction features metal- and oxidant-free conditions, and various substituted pyrrolo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]quinoxaline derivatives were obtained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A three&#8208;component one&#8208;pot synthesis of substituted azepines was realized by gold/magnesium orthogonal relay catalysis. The one&#8208;pot synthesis involves simply mixing and heating propiolates, imines, and activated cyclopropanes to initiate a gold&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;enyne metathesis between propiolates and imines, followed by a magnesium&#8208;catalyzed [4+3] cycloaddition reaction of the resultant 1&#8208;azabutadienes and the cyclopropanes, yielding substituted azepines. The substituted azepines including 22 derivatives could be successfully prepared in good to excellent yield (61&#8211;95%). The reaction was also conducted on one&#8208;gram scale.

The glycosylation reaction conditions show tolerance towards acid/base sensitive protecting groups and have a different substrate scope with 68&#8208;89% yields. The electron&#8208;deficient fluoroarene&#8208;containing glycosyl donor enables the construction of O&#8208; and C&#8208;glycosides using both free alcohols and silylated alcohols, as well as C&#8208; nucleophiles as acceptors.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chloroarenes constitute fundamental building blocks in organic synthesis and are widely applied in the synthesis of bioactive compounds, fine chemicals, materials, natural products and pharmaceuticals. Electrochemical chlorination has been recognized as a promising synthetic method for accessing chloroarenes, but it has proved challenging to achieve in practice as shown by the limited number of existing protocols. Herein, we report on a highly general electrocatalytic strategy for the regioselective chlorination of various substituted heteroaryl scaffolds in an undivided cell setup, using ethyl chloroformate as the chlorine source. This strategy offers several practical advantages over existing methodologies, including an operationally simple experimental setup, exceptional functional group tolerance, and the possibility to form either the mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;chlorinated products in high selectivity depending on the choice of catalyst loading, electric current and ethyl chloroformate equivalents. The practicality and selectivity of the protocol were demonstrated by the successful chlorination of an array of densely&#8208;substituted arene frameworks as well as by the synthesis of chlorinated bioactive molecules.</dc:description>

Abstract
Photochemical C&#8722;C coupling reactions can be tailored to industrial chemical processes and preparations of pharmaceuticals. Recent approaches in this area are limited to using precious transition metal coordination complexes that facilitate light absorption and redox processes with benchtop chemicals. Herein, we propose a paradigm that involves all&#8208;in&#8208;one organo&#8208;photo&#8208;auxiliaries, thio&#8208;heteroarenes, which exhibit unique photophysical properties. These thio&#8208;heteroarenes were employed to prepare several all&#8208;in&#8208;one ionic photo&#8208;salts from commercially available alkyl/benzyl and heterocyclic halides via aromaticity&#8208;mediated nucleophilic substitution reactions. From the library of &gt;30 salts, we performed on&#8208;demand photochemical C&#8722;C coupling reactions to isolate numerous symmetrical and unsymmetrical diary/alkyl&#8208;ethanes with yields up to 84% and mass balance as high as 96%. We also investigated the influence of structural features/properties on the outcomes of the photochemical C&#8722;C coupling reactions. The current photochemical C&#8722;C method was successful in the isolation of &gt;30 photoproducts, including the natural product Brittonin A, a precursor of Imipramine, and derivatives of the bioactive Honokiol Analogues. Furthermore, transient absorption spectroscopy and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations were used to decipher the nature of light&#8208;promoted electronic transitions.

Abstract
This study investigates the visible&#8208;light&#8208;initiated uranyl(VI)&#8208;catalyzed activation of Si&#8722;H bonds through direct hydrogen atom transfer, which facilitates the formation of silyl radicals from silanes. The silyl radical can abstract a chlorine atom from the sulfonyl chloride, leading to the generation of sulfonyl radicals. These silyl radicals and sulfonyl radicals could react with alkenes and alkynes, achieving the first example of uranyl&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation and hydrosulfonylation of unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds. This method features mild reaction conditions and a broad substrate scope, and exhibits exceptional functional&#8208;group tolerance. Consequently, it is suitable for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug derivatives.

         <title>Dual NHC/HAT&#8208;Promoted Esterification to Access &#945;&#8208;Aryl Glycines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Aryl glycines are among the most important carbonyl compounds, particularly as nonproteinogenic &#945;&#8208;amino acids present in many pharmacophores. As such, many strategies have been developed to access this motif, but direct carboxylation methods remain underdeveloped. Herein, we employ a dual NHC/HAT catalysis strategy to access 2&#8208;azaallyl radicals, which subsequently couple with in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated ester azolium radical intermediates. Base&#8208;mediated collapse of the ensuing tetrahedral intermediate liberates the NHC catalyst and benzophenone&#8208;protected aryl glycine. This methodology was employed to esterify a variety of aryl&#8208;substituted glycine derivatives, as well as allylic and benzylic sites. Mechanistic studies reveal that this radical process operates under both oxidative and reductive quenching cycles, while preliminary experiments employing a chiral NHC and Lewis acid additive demonstrate modest enantioselectivity.

         <title>Modular Chiral Bithiophene&#8208;2NO Ligands: Synthesis and Application in Asymmetric Palladium(II)&#8208;catalysed Friedel&#8208;Crafts Alkylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of privileged thiophene&#8208;type ligand remains highly desirable, owing to the high coordination ability of sulfur atom to most of the soft metals. Herein, a new class of C2&#8208;symmetric rigid chiral tertiary amine&#8208;derived dioxide ligands with a coordinating bithiophene bridge was developed in a convenient synthetic route with 25&#8208;62% overall yields. The bithiophene&#8208;2NO&#8208;palladium(II) catalyst system was generated in situ and found to be highly capable catalyst in the asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of indoles. Excellent yields (up to 92%) and high enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99% ee) are obtained for a wide range of substrates under mild conditions. Control experiments and DFT calculations revealed the origins of the enantioselectivity. This represented the first example of chiral thiophene ligands coordinating with soft metal Pd(II) in the asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation. Experiments revealed that the counteranion is involved in the stereoselectivity&#8208;determining step in this soft palladium(II) catalysis, and the additional NO and thiophene in ligands can act as the second chelation site and thus reduce the amount of free metal ions for suppressing background reaction in the catalytic system.</dc:description>

Abstract
An efficient Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation/cyclization of 2&#8208;arylbenzimidazoles with CF3&#8208;imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides has been achieved, yielding diverse CF3&#8722; and amino&#8208;disubstituted 5,6&#8208;dihydrobenzoimidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines, which could undergo a deaminative hydroxylation to access CF3&#8722; and hydroxy&#8208;disubstituted 5,6&#8208;dihydrobenzoimidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines catalyzed by Sc(OTf)3. This developed strategy features easily available starting materials, broad substrate scope, good scalability and high efficiency. Moreover, the antitumor activities of selected products against some human cancer cell lines were also investigated, and the results indicated that several products show antiproliferative activities.

Abstract
The asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of 3&#8208;substituted 2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazines with an azeotropic mixture of HCO2H/NEt3 (5/2) using tethered Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;diamine catalysis has been realized. This process allows access to a broad range of chiral 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazines in high yields with up to 99% ee, and tolerates a variety of functional groups. The enantiocontrol is achieved by the judicious choice of catalyst and hydrogen source. This reaction proceeds with unexpected reversal of enantioselectivity, which is attributed to the acidic reaction conditions and the hydrogen bond between the N&#8722;H of the rhodium species and the O atom in the substrate.

Abstract
Biomass has been identified as the ultimate sustainable resource for all carbon&#8208;based consumer products of the chemical industries in the future. Its catalytic conversion leads to the formation of various platform chemicals that could partially or even fully replace the fossil&#8208;based building blocks that have been currently used in synthetic chemical processes. Among these compounds, levulinic acid (LA) has been recognized as a member of the &#8220;Top Value Added Chemicals from Biomass&#8221; and has attracted significant attention since the seminal paper reported by Werpy and Petersen in 2004. This review summarizes the properties, recent advances, and developments in the chemistry of levulinic acid. The production of LA from both plant and animal&#8208;based carbohydrate feedstocks via 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural or furfuryl alcohol is discussed from a mechanistic perspective, highlighting intrinsic molecular&#8208;level limitations to LA formation. The efficiencies of recently developed catalytic systems are also summarized and compared. Furthermore, the conversion of LA into high&#8208;value&#8208;added downstream chemicals, including its role in the synthesis of complex molecular structures, is overviewed. This section discussed the reactions of LA in the points of view of its various transformations on carbonyl&#8208;, carboxy&#8208;, methyl&#8208;, and methylene functional groups. The reactions of these functionalities with C&#8722;, N&#8722;, O&#8722;, and S&#8208;nucleophiles, alcohols, amines, organometallic reagents, oxygen etc. were thematically summarized. Our review also outlooks to highlight the challenges and opportunities associated with the extensive research area of organic chemistry of levulinic acid.

         <title>Diastereoselective Intramolecular Spirocyclization via C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Functionalization Towards the Synthesis of 2,7&#8208;Diazaspiro[4.5]decane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones</title>

Abstract
The C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization via intramolecular hydride transfer initiated cascade annulation for the synthesis of spiro&#8208;fused succinimide&#8208;containing tetrahydroquinolines induced by iminium intermediates is described. A series of diastereoselective 2,7&#8208;diazaspiro[4.5]decanes&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones were achieved using ortho&#8208;amino&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;succinimide using Lewis acid catalysis. This scandium triflate Sc(OTf)3 catalysed, oxidant&#8208;free protocol leads to the diastereoselective synthesis of a class of 2,7&#8208;diazaspiro[4.5]decanes&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones derivatives with 48&#8211;98% yield in a single step.

         <title>Generation of Sulfamoyl Radicals via Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Fixation of Sulfur Dioxide for the Synthesis of Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Herein, we report a new approach for the light&#8208;mediated generation of sulfamoyl radicals using sulfur dioxide as key building block and the direct application of these radicals in the synthesis of sulfonamides. In the presence of different photoredox catalysts, sulfamoyl radicals can be generated directly from SO2 or the SO2 surrogate DABSO (1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane&#8901;bis (sulfur dioxide) adduct) and N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts as nitrogen radical precursors. Trapping of the in&#8197;situ generated sulfamoyl radicals with selected electron&#8208;rich olefins affords different sulfonamides in up to 86% yield in a three&#8208;component procedure. This transformation provides a complementary approach for the in&#8197;situ generation of sulfamoyl radicals as synthetic intermediates for the assembly of the sulfonamide functionality, a privileged motif in active pharmaceutical ingredients.

         <title>Methodology to Control the Regioselective Installation of a Carboxylic Acid for the Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Diarylpropionic Acids</title>

Abstract
A stepwise copper&#8208;catalyzed boracarboxylation then palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling methodology was developed to access 2,3&#8208;diarylpropionic acid derivatives regioselectively by pre&#8208;setting the position of the carboxylic acid in the boracarboxylation reaction. This method provides access to a wide range of aryl and heteroaryl products in up to 80% isolated yield. Pharmaceutical potential was demonstrated by synthesizing a glucagon receptor antagonist drug in three steps (31% overall yield) from commercially available 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylstyrene.

         <title>Unsupported Nanoporous Copper Catalyzed Insertion of Carbenes from &#945;&#8208;Diazo Compounds into Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The insertion of diazo carbene into Si&#8722;H bonds with unsupported nanoporous copper (CuNPore) catalyst has been developed. &#945;&#8208;Aryl diazoesters, diazophosphonates, and unstable aryl diazoalkyls can be used as carbene precursors to exquisitely insert into the Si&#8722;H bond of silanes. A variety of &#945;&#8208;silylesters, silylphosphonate, and functionalized arylsilane were obtained in 35&#8211;82% yields. The reusability feature of the CuNPore catalyst for this insertion reaction demonstrated its high heterogeneous catalytic activity and practicality. Further, mechanistic studies revealed that the insertion of carbene from diazo compounds into the Si&#8722;H bond may include a three&#8208;center concerted transition state on CuNPore.

         <title>Trifluoroacetic Acid Promotes Umpolung of 2&#8208;Methylindole to Achieve C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An umpolung strategy for the C(sp3)&#8722;H aminomethylation of 2&#8208;methylindole has been developed using trifluoroacetic acid to induce the transformation, with aminals serving as precursors of iminium ion. Mechanistic studies have clearly shown that trifluoroacetic acid may play a pivotal role in this strategy. The utilization of readily available starting materials, mild reaction conditions, tolerance to complex functional groups, combine with yields of up to 98% and potential biological applications render this protocol applicable and useful for organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry.

Abstract
An iodine&#8208;mediated C=C double bond&#8208;forming reaction has been established to access various fused quinolinone derivatives under transition metal&#8208;free conditions. The present reaction is also applicable to the synthesis of fused quinolinium frameworks from the corresponding precursors and can be conducted on a gram scale.

         <title>Calcium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Sulfoximinocyclopentenones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A series of 4&#8208;sulfoximinocyclopent&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones was prepared in 35 to 99% yield through a calcium(II)&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;Piancatelli reaction, including in enantioenriched form. Depending on their substitution pattern, diverse diastereoselective chemical transformations can be applied to these scaffolds, allowing access to cyclopentane derivatives. This study opens synthetic routes to cyclopentane&#8208;based scaffolds and also paves the way for the exploration of the associated chemical space in drug discovery.

         <title>Dual Lewis Acid Promoted/Visible Light Driven Preparation of Aryl Diazenyl Oxazoles from Isocyanoacetamides and Arylazo Sulfones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
While arylazo sulfones have been widely applied as arylating agents, their exploitation for diazenylation reactions has been previously limited to electron&#8208;rich alkenes such as styrenes and silyl enol ethers. Herein we optimized a synthetic one&#8208;pot protocol to access oxazolyl azo compounds via a selective domino ring&#8208;closing/aryldiazenylation sequence by starting from arylazo sulfones and isocyanoacetamides in the presence of Sm(OTf)3 as the Lewis acid. The substrate scope, along with scale&#8208;up reaction both in batch and under continuous flow conditions provide a valuable approach to such a class of heteroaryl azo compounds.

         <title>Direct Access to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated &#947;&#8208;Lactams via Palladium&#8208;Catalysed Carbonylation of Propargylic Ureas.</title>

Abstract
Additive carbonylations typically necessitate strong nucleophiles, such as alcohols or amines. In this study, we carbonylated a poorly nucleophilic urea, under oxidant&#8208;free conditions. Our straightforward carbonylative strategy enables access to versatile &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams featuring an aminocarbonyl fragment, utilizing readily available propargylic ureas as starting materials. The employment of the PdI2/KI catalytic system allowed complete regioselectivity (5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig), high functional group tolerance, broad substrate scope as well as operational simplicity (oxidant&#8208;free, organic ligand&#8208;free and base&#8208;free protocol). The synthetic utility of these &#947;&#8208;lactams is showcased through late&#8208;stage functionalizations, such as Giese reactions and peptide couplings.

Abstract
Deuterated hydroxyl acids and amino acids have been widely utilized in life science, biochemistry and drug development. Site&#8208;selective and stereoselective synthesis of deuterated hydroxyl acids and amino acids remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the development of a robust whole&#8208;cell&#8208;based chemoenzymatic platform for the synthesis of deuterated hydroxyl acids and amino acids from off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf aldehydes in high yields with excellent selectivities and levels of deuteration. The platform delivers products with diverse scaffolds and deuteration patterns, as well as broad scopes with both aromatic and aliphatic side chains. The application of the platform was demonstrated by the concise synthesis of a deuterium&#8208;containing antiparkinson's disease candidate. This platform provides a concrete foundation for accessing amino acid isotopologs for potential applications in research and drug discovery and development.

Abstract
The selective N&#8722;C bond cleavage of amides to create value&#8208;added products through a transition metal&#8208;free approach has become a significant challenge. Here, we present a method to convert amides into N&#8208;(3&#8208;acylamidopropyl)lactams through sequential amide chemoselective N&#8722;C bond cleavage and amidine ring opening under mild conditions, applicable in batch and continuous flow processes. These methods utilize bench&#8208;stable reagents and are operationally straightforward and mild, enabling synthesis on a gram scale with excellent functional group tolerance. Additionally, the synthetic feasibility of these reactions under flow conditions has proven to be highly efficient, providing N&#8208;(3&#8208;acylamidopropyl)lactam derivatives with improved yields and shorter reaction time.

The approach leverages on the regiodivergent reactivity of mono&#8208; and bimetallic gold complexes that results from &#960;&#8208; vs &#963;,&#960;&#8208;activations of alkynyl&#8208;substituted urea substrates, for the selective formation of either dihydroquinazolinone or indole&#8208;carboxamide products, via intramolecular hydroamidation.

         <title>Carboxylate&#8208;Directed Oxidative Annulation via C(Alkenyl)&#8722;H Activation/Double Alkyne Insertion/1,4&#8208;Pd Migration: Synthesis of Functionalized Naphthalenes</title>

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed double consecutive C(alkenyl)&#8722;H activation/alkyne insertion method utilizing a free carboxylic acid as a directing group in the preparation of functionalized naphthalenes is reported. The reaction mechanism involves a sequence of the C (alkenyl)&#8722;H activation/alkyne insertion/1,4&#8208;palladium migration/reductive elimination steps. The second alkyne insertion occurred at the phenyl ring of the intermediate generated from the first alkyne insertion via 1,4&#8208;palladium migration, which is an uncommon case in typical C&#8722;H activation/alkyne insertion chemistry, providing functionalized naphthalene products. Additionally, the kinetic studies and control experiments as well as density functional theory (DFT) studies are also investigated to elucidate the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Improving the Photochemical Skeletal Enlargement of Pyridines to 1,2&#8208;Diazepines with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
In this work, we extend the one&#8208;pot protocol to synthesize 1,2&#8208;diazepines from commercially available and cheap starting materials. Capitalizing on isocyanate derivatives as activating agents, the photochemical skeletal enlargement occurs, while preserving key functional groups embedded in more than 30 substrates. We also demonstrated that isocyanates can be generated in&#8197;situ exploiting the wealth of methods starting from bench stable resources. Compare to previous strategies, the use of these precursors prevents the presence of deleterious HCl traces in the system, thus enabling the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;diazepines in high yields over up to 5 sequential steps.

Abstract
A six&#8208;membered ring bromo&#8208;etherification of &#1013;&#8208;alkenyl alcohols using an N&#8208;oxide catalyst was developed to furnish 2&#8208;bromomethyl&#8208;6&#8208;substituted tetrahydropyrans with cis&#8208;selectivity and 3&#8208;bromomethyl isochromans in high yields. DFT calculations indicate that the NMO catalyst enhances the electrophilicity of the bromine atom on NBS via two hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions after the formation of the NMO&#8208;NBS complex.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation for Facile Access to Optically Active Dihydrodibenzo&#8208;Fused Azepines</title>

Abstract
The asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of various dibenzo&#8208;fused azepines including 5H&#8208;dibenzo[b,e][1,4]diazepines, dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepines and 11H&#8208;dibenzo[b,e]azepines using chiral iridium diamine catalysts and HCO2H/NEt3 as the hydrogen source has been accomplished. A range of chiral 10,11&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5H&#8208;dibenzo[b,e][1,4]diazepines, 10,11&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine and 6,11&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5H&#8208;dibenzo[b,e]azepines have been prepared in 82&#8211;94% yields with 82&#8211;99% ee. Diversely substituted substrates are suitable for this transformation, and a number of functional groups are tolerated. Enantiocontrol is achieved via judicious choice of catalyst, additive and hydrogen source. The synthetic potential of this reaction is explored through gram&#8208;scale reactions without loss of reactivity and optical purity and further transformations on products.

Abstract
A photocatalytic methodology has been devised for the stereoselective construction of trisubstituted alkenes incorporating 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams in 17&#8211;93% yields via a radical cascade process utilizing MBH acetates and N&#8208;allylbromodifluoroacetamides as starting materials. The reaction mechanism involves single&#8208;electron transfer, 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization, radical addition, and elimination in a cascade fashion.

Abstract
Amines are widely found in natural products, drugs and pesticides. We have proposed a base&#8208;promoted method for synthesizing polysubstituted aromatic amines. The reaction does not necessitate the involvement of transition metals, provided that an equivalent base is employed. In this process, aryl thianthrenium salt serves as the precursor to arynes, which are subsequently distorted by the induction effect of different substituents. The attack of amine nucleophiles results in the formation of a series of multi&#8208;substituted aromatic amine products.

         <title>Discovery of EDA&#8208;Complex Photochemical Reactions Using Computational Vision</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a multidimensional screening strategy to discover Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor (EDA) complex photochemical reactions using only simple photographic devices, such as webcams or cellphones, combined with TLC analysis. An algorithm was designed to automatically identify EDA&#8208;complex reactive mixtures in solution by processing digital images from a 96&#8208;well microplate, alongside TLC results. The code detects the absorption region of the mixture in the visible spectrum and quantifies color changes through grayscale values. Integrated automatic TLC analysis further classifies mixtures as colorimetric reactions, non&#8208;reactive, or potentially reactive EDA complexes. Leveraging this screening platform, we have developed a new EDA&#8208;mediated approach to synthesize iminophosphoranes in yields up to 90%.

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Benzo[f]chromanes and Hydroxyalkyl Naphthols: Catalytic Coupling of Naphthols and Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic dearomatization of arenols is an uphill task that can serve as a powerful method to construct C&#8208;C bonds with unsaturated coupling partners. Herein, a simple and efficient strategy for coupling naphthols with allylic alcohols is reported. A single Ru(II) pincer catalyzed coupling of naphthols with primary allylic alcohols led to the formation of benzo(f)chromanes, whereas the use of secondary alcohols delivered the hydroxyalkyl naphthols. Broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance are demonstrated. Notably, a high diastereoselectivity is attained on chromanes. Hydroxyalkyl naphthols are synthetically transformed into spiroethers, and dearomative bromination is achieved on chromanes. Mechanistic studies revealed the involvement of tandem reactions, a formal O&#8208;H bond activation of allylic alcohols by an active catalyst via amine&#8208;amide metal&#8208;ligand cooperation provided &#945;&#8208;&#946;, unsaturated carbonyl intermediates, which further underwent 1,4 conjugate addition with dearomatized naphthols. One of the crucial intermediates, naphthyl radical, is elucidated by EPR studies and trapped using a radical scavenger. Liberated hydrogen and water molecules are the only byproducts in these transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrofluoroether Synthesis through One&#8208;Pot Anodic Iodoalkoxylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The incorporation of carbon&#8208;fluorine bonds can profoundly influence the chemical and physical properties of drugs, agrochemicals, and materials. Different methods allow the installation of CF3, CF2H units and C&#8722;F bonds including trifluoro&#8208; and difluoromethoxylations, reflecting the limited diversity of reactions available to synthetic chemists. We introduce the 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethoxy group through an electro&#8208;oxidative iodination of alkenes as a versatile substituent for fluorine chemists. An iodoarene serves as an unusual iodine source facilitating the 1,2&#8208;iodoalkoxylation of a broad range of industrially relevant aliphatic alkenes in high yields (31&#8211;98%) showing high Markovnikov regioselectivity.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative Cyclization of Indolyl Ynamides for Synthesis of Pentacyclic Spiroindolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The dearomatization of indoles with ynamides is a convenient access towards polycyclic spiroindolines, which can be initiated by &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;additions of ynamides. Currently, the related &#946;&#8208;addition initiated dearomative cyclization requires noble&#8208;metal catalyst or stoichiometric oxidant. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed dearomative cyclization of aryl&#8208;substituted indolyl ynamides through regioselective &#946;&#8208;addition onto ynamides, providing pentacyclic spiroindolines in 81&#8211;97% yields with &gt;25:1 diastereoselectivities. Moreover, preliminary success has been obtained for the catalytic enantioselective dearomative cyclization.

Abstract
A ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H acylmethylation of Trp&#8208;containing peptides with &#945;&#8208;chloro ketones is reported here. This reaction features good C&#8208;2 selectivity and chemoselectivity, making it suitable for late&#8208;stage modification of Trp&#8208;containing peptides. Low&#8208;cost metal ruthenium as a catalyst enables the reaction to be conducted on a gram scale. This report also discusses the synthetic applications and presents a method to remove the pyridine directing group. In addition, a plausible mechanism of the C(2)&#8722;H acylmethylation reaction is proposed in this article.

         <title>Arylation of Secondary Phosphines with Diaryliodonium Salts under Metal&#8208;Free and Non&#8208;Photochemical Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A metal&#8208; and irradiation&#8208;free approach for the direct arylation of secondary phosphines has been developed. The reaction employs diaryliodonium salts as electrophilic aryl&#8208;transfer reagents, effecting the P&#8722;Ar bond&#8208;formation in a single step, under mild conditions, using t&#8208;BuOK as a base and DMSO as a solvent. The protocol furnishes expedient access to diverse unsymmetrical triarylphosphines and, upon a one&#8208;pot oxidation, the corresponding triarylphosphine oxides. Experimental and computational studies support the inner sphere aryl&#8208;transfer mechanism through a reductive coupling at the hypervalent iodine center. The calculations also point to a key role played by potassium ions, providing extra stabilization to the P&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming transition state by binding the reactants via cation&#8208;&#960; interactions.

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Synthesis of Pyrroles from Nitroarenes with Glycols as Reductants</title>

Abstract
A molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of N&#8208;(hetero)aryl pyrroles directly from inexpensive and commonly available (hetero)nitroarenes via reduction with pinacol and annulation with 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyls or cyclobutane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols has been described. The process does not require an inert atmosphere and tolerates the presence of air and water. This non&#8208;noble catalytic system shows high chemoselectivity, allowing a diverse range of potentially reducible functional groups such as alkynes, alkenes, halogens, cyano, and carbonyls. Moreover, this strategy enables the reuse of a waste byproduct as reactant, facilitating the formation of challenging 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyls from accessible cyclobutane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols used as reducing agents.

Abstract
Molybdenum catalysts bearing ONO, ON(N)O, ON(O)N and ON(S)O ligands were studied for catalytic deoxydehydration of vicinal diols. The complex bearing N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethylbenzyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylethylenediamine ligand afforded full conversion and up to 97% selectivities towards alkenes, when aliphatic vicinal diols were subjected to the reaction at 5&#8197;mol% catalyst loading.

Abstract
This opinionated review underlines the increasing production of 1,3&#8208;propanediol (1,3&#8208;PDO) by whole cell biocatalytic fermentation of biomass and highlights how production has transitioned from petrochemicals to bio&#8208;renewables. Current uses of 1,3&#8208;PDO are listed. Some future prospects for evolving the current technology and expanding the chemical uses of 1,3&#8208;PDO are discussed, with emphasis on catalytic and atom efficient chemistries. Lessons from the success of biomass derived 1,3&#8208;PDO are noted that may be applied to other bio&#8208;based organic platform chemicals.

         <title>Combined Gold and Photoredox Catalysis: Synthesis of 3&#8208;Alkenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;Indazoles from 2&#8208;Alkynylazobenzenes</title>

Abstract
We disclose the intramolecular synthesis of 3&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;indazoles from 2&#8208;alkynylazobenzenes, promoted by a dual catalysis using AuCl3 and a ruthenium photocatalyst under visible light irradiation. This reaction proceeds through hydroamination of the alkynyl fragment. The yields are influenced by electronic factors. Control experiments suggest that both radical and polar mechanisms operate in parallel. This transformation involves C&#8722;N bond formation and a 1,2&#8208;hydride shift. Additionally, derivatization was performed to demonstrate the versatility of this methodology.

Abstract
Herein, we present a protocol starting from styrene oxide reacting with o&#8208;acylaniline and o&#8208;alkenylaniline derivatives to obtain 3,4&#8208;disubstituted quinoline and 2&#8208;acylquinoline derivatives, respectively, in 32&#8211;92% yields under specific conditions. Preliminary research outcomes underscore the versatility of our approach, as exemplified by its scalability for large&#8208;scale synthesis, downstream derivatization, and the characteristic properties manifested by the modified molecules.

         <title>Synergistic Palladium/Silver/Ligand Catalysis for C&#8722;H Alkenylation of 2,1,3&#8208;Benzofused Heterodiazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The combination of palladium and silver complexes has emerged as a bimetallic catalytic system in C&#8722;H activation, frequently outperforming palladium&#8208;only systems. Beyond the conventional roles of silver (I) salts serving as oxidants, halide scavengers, and Lewis acids, Pd&#8722;Ag bimetallic synergism has been shown to facilitate C&#8722;H cleavage. In this study, we explore the incorporation of a pyrazolopyridone (PzPyOH) ligand into a Pd&#8722;Ag bimetallic catalytic system, which together promote both C&#8722;H cleavage and migratory insertion processes. This synergistic approach enables dehydrogenative C&#8722;H alkenylations at the C4 position of 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole, 2,1,3&#8208;benzoxadiazole, and 2,1,3&#8208;benzotriazole with alkenes. These results demonstrate the potential of combining novel ligands with heterobimetallic systems to facilitate other elementary steps beyond C&#8722;H cleavage, suggesting their broader applicability in C&#8722;H functionalization.

Difuropyridines have been prepared from aldehydes and chitin&#8208;derived 3&#8208;acetamidofuran (3AF) under acid&#8208;catalyzed conditions. Difuropyridines were comprehensively synthesized for the first time. The synthesized difuropyridines can be applied to prepare fluorescent probe analogs or catalyze decarboxylative reactions as photocatalysts.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Nitro Compounds with Grignard and Organozinc Reagents for Synthesis of Functionalized Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The treatment of nitro compounds with Grignard reagents in the presence of a catalytic amount of FeCl2/t&#8208;BuMgCl produced various types of secondary amines in good yields. This reductive coupling most likely involves the compatibility of functional groups such as chlorine, benzyl ether, olefin, and acetylene. Moreover, the corresponding poly&#8208;substituted amines were not observed under these conditions. When the Grignard reagents were replaced with organozinc reagents, functionalized secondary amines containing ester and nitrile groups were obtained in good yields.

         <title>Recent Advances in Organocatalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring represents an attractive yet challenging synthetic targets in the field of organic synthesis, especially in a stereocontrolled fashion. Over the past two decades, organocatalysis has emerged as an enabling technology for the facile construction of enantioenriched molecules with remarkably increasing complexity and diversity, and a myriad of chiral architectures containing bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane units were elegantly assembled through organocatalytic asymmetric transformations. This review summarizes recent advancements on this topic (mainly from 2010 to 2023),    emphasizing the reaction types such as desymmetrization  and cascade reactions of different prochiral starting materials toward various chiral bicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes as well as their aza, oxa and thio derivatives. Meanwhile, the synthetic strategy, reaction mechanism, substrate scope and synthetic applications of these catalytic reactions are also discussed. We hope that this review will motivate further development and application of organocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of AMA Synthase from Pyrenophora teres f. teres 0&#8211;1&#8201;for the Synthesis of Aspergillomarasmine A Analogues and Non&#8208;Canonical Amino Acids</title>

Abstract
The fungal natural product aspergillomarasmine A (AMA) is an inhibitor of metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamases and a promising co&#8208;drug candidate for reversing bacterial &#946;&#8208;lactam resistance. The biosynthesis of AMA from L&#8208;Asp and O&#8208;phospho&#8208;L&#8208;serine is catalyzed by AMA synthase, which possesses high synthetic potential for the biocatalytic preparation of AMA and related aminopolycarboxylic acids. Here, we identified and structurally characterized an AMA synthase from Pyrenophora teres f. teres 0&#8211;1 (PteAMAS). Crystallographic analysis revealed a unique homotetrameric fold and a highly hydrophilic active site, which supports the PLP&#8208;dependent &#946;&#8208;replacement catalytic mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of PteAMAS for the biocatalytic synthesis of AMA and its analogues, achieving structural diversification of the APA1 moiety through a modular two&#8208;enzyme system involving PteAMAS and a selective C&#8722;N lyase, namely EDDS lyase or 3&#8208;methylaspartate ammonia lyase variant MAL&#8722;Q73&#8197;A. In addition, we exhibited the usefulness of PteAMAS for convenient synthesis of various S&#8208;alkyl, &#8208;aryl, and &#8208;arylalkyl substituted L&#8208;cysteines, which are valuable non&#8208;canonical amino acids with broad pharmaceutical applications. The present study has not only provided the structural basis for catalysis and substrate recognition by PteAMAS, but also paved the way for biocatalytic preparation of structurally complex AMA analogues and various non&#8208;canonical amino acids.

         <title>Borane&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Transformation of Levulinic Acid and Hydrazines into Hexahydropyridazines and Tetrahydropyridazin&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones Using Hydrosilane</title>

Abstract
Borane&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation of levulinic acid and other &#947;&#8208;keto acids with hydrazines for selective access to hexahydropyridazines and tetrahydropyridazin&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones has been developed. The combination of B(C6F5)3 and Et3SiH allows for synthesis of various hexahydropyridazines and tetrahydropyridazin&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones in 67&#8211;97% yields with tolerance towards various functional groups and easy scale&#8208;up. This reaction can be rendered enantioselective by using a chiral borane catalyst generated in&#8197;situ from HB(C6F5)2 and a binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral diene and PhMe2SiH, affording the target products in 70&#8211;92% yields with up to &gt;99% ee. The judicious choice of borane catalyst and hydrosilane reductant proves to be critical for catalysis. Mechanistic investigations elucidate the catalytic pathway.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Benzylation and Allylation of Six&#8208;Membered Endocyclic Enecarbamates</title>

Abstract
Six&#8208;membered endocyclic benzyl/allyl enecarbamates undergo a Pd&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylation process to generate endocyclic 1&#8208;azaallyl anions and Pd&#8211;benzyl/allyl cations. The ion pair then react with each other followed by reduction to ultimately give unprotected 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl&#8208;3&#8208;benzylpiperidines and 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl&#8208;3&#8208;allylpiperidines in 31&#8211;91% yields as single cis&#8208;diastereomers. These reactions represent a strategy to form unprotected &#946;&#8208;substituted piperidines, which generates elusive endocyclic 1&#8208;azaallyl anion intermediates by introducing the negative charge from the N&#8208;terminal.

Abstract
Imidazoheterocycles have extensive applications in the pharmaceutical industry and agrochemicals. A comprehensive overview has been provided on the current advancements in the electrochemical functionalization of imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycles, which have been classified into ten different types of reactions. Electrochemical synthesis has emerged as a highly effective method for producing organic molecules, especially in the context of sustainable development. Employing electrons as the traceless oxidant, several C&#8722;H functionalization reactions of imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycles have been achieved at either the C3 or C5 positions. Electrons may serve as the reducing agent to synthesize pyridine rings that are either partially or fully saturated in imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines. The purpose of the review is to attract the interest of the scientific community and promote additional research on the functionalization of imidazoheterocycles using electrochemical methods.

A comprehensive overview has been provided on the current advancements in the electrochemical functionalization of imidazo-fused heterocycles, which have been classified into ten different types of reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of CF3CH2&#8208;Amides/Propiolamides/Acrylamides: The TfOH Catalyzed Reactions of Nitrile Compounds with CF3CHN2</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An efficient and operationally simple protocol to access N&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)amides/propiolamides and acrylamides via direct conversion of easily accessible nitriles (aryl/alkyl/alkynyl/vinyl) and in&#8197;situ generated CF3CHN2 as trifluoroethylating reagent has been developed. The protocol offers broad functional group tolerance under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, the conversion of trifluoroethylated propiolamide into its triazole analog via Ru&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloadditions using BnN3 clearly indicates its versatility in the synthetic applications.

         <title>Revisiting the Synthetic Utility of 4,5&#8208;Dehydro[2.2]paracyclophane</title>

Abstract
4,5&#8208;Dehydro[2.2]paracyclophane, an aryne species of [2.2]paracyclophane ([2.2]PCP) was reported more than half a century ago. However, despite its potential usefulness for preparing [2.2]PCP derivatives, this species is rarely considered in synthetic applications, probably because the efficiency of aryne generation and reaction with arynophiles are low under harsh reaction conditions of classical methods involving precursors. We have prepared o&#8208;iodoaryl triflate&#8208; and o&#8208;silylaryl triflate&#8208;type precursors and achieved generation of 4,5&#8208;dehydro[2.2]PCP, which reacted with a diverse range of arynophiles to afford functionalized [2.2]PCP derivatives, including [2.2]PCP&#8208;fused &#960;&#8208;extended polyaromatics. Our results highlight the synthetic utility of the historically overlooked 4,5&#8208;dehydro[2.2]PCP intermediate.

         <title>Introduction of Phosphinine Ring into Aromatic Systems via Alkyne Cyclization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Recently developed synthetic protocols for the preparation of &#955;3&#8208;phosphanaphthalenes have broadened the general scope of organophosphorus chemistry, but a versatile protocol is still missing. Here, we describe a scalable synthetic approach for the construction of various substituted phosphanaphthalenes. We have obtained 11 derivatives through rigorous study and have demonstrated the robustness of this method. The optical properties of these phosphorus compounds and their aza and carbo analogues have been experimentally compared. Here, we show the power of the method in extending the synthesis to even larger polycyclic aromatic systems with embedded phosphine rings toward its potential applicability to materials science.

         <title>Dual C2 Synthon Strategy for the Synthesis of Pyrimidines: Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Difunctionalization of Tertiary Alkylamines</title>

Abstract
Herein, we describe a two&#8208;component methodology developed for the synthesis of pyrimidine derivatives using tertiary alkylamines and amidines. Tertiary alkylamines serve as dual C2 synthons through copper&#8208;catalyzed aerobic difunctionalization of the &#945;,&#946;&#8722;C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. The process operates under mild conditions and uses atmospheric oxygen as the oxidant. Notably, by this methodology yields up to 85% yields are obtained and a broad substrate scope is shown. Mechanistic studies indicate that the annulation proceeds via a radical&#8208;mediated oxidation and C&#8722;N bond coupling process. This approach provides a pathway for synthesizing various heterocycles by employing tertiary alkylamines as dual C2 synthons.

         <title>Stereoconvergent Access to Z&#8208;Allylborons from E/Z&#8208;Mixed 1,3&#8208;Dienes via Cu&#8208;Guanidine Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Merging the stereoisomeric mixture of substrate into a single product through stereospecific transformation is a challenging but higher&#8208;order synthetic strategy, which perfectly meets the demand of cost control in the precise chemical production. In this work, the stereoconvergent synthesis of Z&#8208;allylic boronates was realized with protoborylation of E/Z&#8208;mixed 1,3&#8208;dienes catalyzed by a novel copper&#8208;guanidine complex. The reaction could proceed smoothly under very mild conditions with good functional group tolerance, and convert diverse aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes into the desired Z&#8208;1,4&#8208;addition products with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivities in minutes. Detailed mechanistic studies also helped to disclose the origin of stereoconvergency. Both E&#8208; and Z&#8208;diene were found directly undergoing a rapid borylation without E/Z isomerization of C=C bond, followed by a convergent formation of the same thermodynamically stable allylcopper intermediate before the slow protonation step occurred.</dc:description>

         <title>Bidentate NHC&#8208;Containing Ligands for Copper Catalysed Synthesis of Functionalised Diaryl Ethers</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diaryl and heteroaryl ethers are important and common motifs in drug discovery and agrochemicals. Here we present a catalytic system for the copper catalysed arylation of phenols with aryl halides. Bidentate N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands provide a well&#8208;defined catalytic system that enable low loading of copper in effective coupling reactions (0.5 mol% Cu or lower). The reaction scope of aryl iodides and aryl bromides is developed, that is tolerant of functional groups and a library of biaryl ethers with lead&#8208;like properties is prepared. The presence of excess ligand (in a 1:3 ratio) is shown to be optimal to prevent catalyst degradation, presumably by avoiding decomplexation of the ligand. This is also supported by the catalytic results obtained with pre&#8208;formed copper complexes. The kinetics of the reaction are examined and shown to be first order in copper, supportive of a well&#8208;defined catalyst species, first order in phenol and aryl iodide, and zero order in base under the developed conditions.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diaryl and heteroaryl ethers are important and common motifs in drug discovery and agrochemicals. Here we present a catalytic system for the copper catalysed arylation of phenols with aryl halides. Bidentate N-heterocyclic carbene ligands provide a well-defined catalytic system that enable low loading of copper in effective coupling reactions (0.5 mol% Cu or lower). The reaction scope of aryl iodides and aryl bromides is developed, that is tolerant of functional groups and a library of biaryl ethers with lead-like properties is prepared. The presence of excess ligand (in a 1:3 ratio) is shown to be optimal to prevent catalyst degradation, presumably by avoiding decomplexation of the ligand. This is also supported by the catalytic results obtained with pre-formed copper complexes. The kinetics of the reaction are examined and shown to be first order in copper, supportive of a well-defined catalyst species, first order in phenol and aryl iodide, and zero order in base under the developed conditions. Computational studies performed using Minnesota MN15-L parametrisation method support an oxidative addition&#8211;reductive elimination pathway. Reductive elimination would be turnover limiting and occurr through an intimate ion pair intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective One&#8208;pot Double Cascade Hybrid Formation/[3+3] Spirocyclization for the Synthesis of 3&#8208;Spiropiperidines Under Phase Transfer Conditions.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report an efficient approach to synthesizing hybrid 3&#8208;spiropiperidines heterocycles that incorporate both 3&#8208;isochromanone and 3&#8208;isoindolinone units through a one&#8208;pot, double cascade reaction facilitated by an economical K&#8322;CO&#8323;/TBAB catalytic system. By examining the nucleophilicity of the lactone 3&#8208;isochromanone, we developed a cascade reaction pathway that first generates a bi&#8208;nucleophilic hybrid intermediate, which then undergoes [3+3] spirocyclization with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The regioselectivity of the spirocyclization strongly depends on the substitution pattern of lactam ring. The process exhibits high diastereoselectivity, even with the formation of three or four stereocenters, including two contiguous quaternary carbons. These sequential cascade reactions were successfully scaled up, and the subsequent reactivity was readily analyzed, enabling the transformation of existing functional groups into valuable new functionalities.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Described herein is the discovery of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed chlorocylization strategy for the synthesis of 3&#8209;chloroindoles tolerated with a wide range of functional groups in moderate to excellent yields. In this transformation, the solvent effect is so important that only THF presents the positive effect. Furthermore, the present method provides an essay access to the N&#8208;unprotected 3&#8208;chloroindoles. A mechanism study showed that 2&#8208;alkynlanilines were catalyzed by palladium to from corresponding indoles, followed by copper&#8208;mediated oxidation chlorination to deliver the 3&#8208;chloroindoles products.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstructive synthesis of fluorinated dihydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indolones by a cyclohexadione cut&#8208;to&#8208;fuse strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a fluorinative ring&#8208;cleavage reaction that breaks C&#8211;C bonds in cyclic &#946;&#8208;diketones bearing aryl moiety using N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) in the presence of inorganic carbonates (Cs2CO3 or K2CO3) in methanol at room temperature within one hour. Generated fluorinated keto acid esters bearing ortho&#8208;nitro aryl groups were transformed into fluorinated dihydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indolones (DHPIs) via reductive cyclization using B2(OH)4 followed by amidation in the presence of  K2CO3.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ever&#8208;increasing prevalence of diseases and inadequate resources on Earth are threats to society. Biomass is an abundant resource, and bioactive compounds produced from biomass are environmentally benign in contrast to conventional chemical synthesis methods, which frequently depend on non&#8208;renewable resources. In addition, the functionalized monomers from biomass allow the atom economical synthesis of bioactive molecules. This review aims to provide insight into the synthesis of bioactive molecules from the lignocellulose&#8208;derived platform chemicals. Existing methodology and catalytic systems are summarized for the synthesis of targeted bioactive molecules from cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin&#8208;derived platform chemicals. The biological activities of bioactive molecules obtained from biomass, such as antioxidant, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and anticancer properties, are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>PTC in the polyenolate&#8208;mediated [10+2]&#8208;cycloaddition for the synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acid precursors</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. The manuscript describes a formal [10+2] higher&#8208;order cycloaddition between 2&#8208;benzylideneindan&#8208;1&#8208;ones and &#945;&#8208;alkilidene azlactones as higherene precursors and  higherenofiles respectively. The reaction is realized under Br&#248;nsted&#8208;base catalysis utilizing the phase transfer catalysis approach. The key intermediate is an isobenzofulvene&#8208;derived polyenolate which acts as a 10&#8208;electron component in the higher&#8208;order cycloaddition. By using this strategy, a series of structurally diverse compounds containing a polycyclic hydrocarbon scaffold was prepared in 79&#8208;99% yields. In addition, the potential of the obtained [10+2]&#8208;cycloadducts has been confirmed by transformations, including the synthesis of a highly&#8208;valuable alpha,alpha&#8208;disubstituted N&#8208;protected alpha&#8208;aminoester.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Abstract. The manuscript describes a formal [10+2] higher-order cycloaddition between 2-benzylideneindan-1-ones and &#945;-alkilidene azlactones as higherene precursors and  higherenofiles respectively. The reaction is realized under Br&#248;nsted-base catalysis utilizing the phase transfer catalysis approach. The key intermediate is an isobenzofulvene-derived polyenolate which acts as a 10-electron component in the higher-order cycloaddition. By using this strategy, a series of structurally diverse compounds containing a polycyclic hydrocarbon scaffold was prepared in 79-99% yields. In addition, the potential of the obtained [10+2]-cycloadducts has been confirmed by transformations, including the synthesis of a highly-valuable alpha,alpha-disubstituted N-protected alpha-aminoester.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Raney Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Deuterium Labeling of Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Heterocycles and Pharmaceuticals under Continuous Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deuterium&#8208;labeled compounds play a pivotal role in physical organic chemistry, life sciences, and materials science. This has resulted in a surge of interest in deuterium&#8208;labeled active pharmaceutical ingredients in recent years. In this study, we present a continuous flow Raney nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange process that boasts compatibility with a wide spectrum of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles and pharmaceutical compounds. The broad applicability of the developed method was demonstrated through successful labeling of various purine bases, imidazoles, pyridines, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including complex structures like abacavir and remdesivir. Control experiments revealed Raney nickel's crucial role in the exchange process, showcasing the superiority of the continuous flow approach over batch reactions. Furthermore, a scaled&#8208;up experiment demonstrated the robustness of the catalyst.</dc:description>
