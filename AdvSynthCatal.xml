         <title>Synthesis of 1,4&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds via Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Decarboxylative Radical Cascade Reactions</title>

Abstract
We herein report a method for the synthesis of 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds using light&#8208;activated electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes. This multi&#8208;component reaction involves the photoactivation of EDA complexes formed by carboxylic acid derivatives, triphenylphosphine, and sodium iodide, resulting in single&#8208;electron reduction. The subsequent decarboxylation fragmentation leads to the formation of nucleophilic alkyl free radicals, which can undergo sequential radical coupling reactions with electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208;rich olefins. This method has been successfully applied to various aliphatic carboxylic acid derivatives, including tertiary, secondary, and primary ones, as well as multiple types of electron&#8208;deficient olefins and enol silyl ethers. The entire process is conducted under mild conditions, indicating its potential for the synthesis of valuable synthetic compounds.

         <title>Recent Progress in Application of Propargylic Alcohols in Organic Syntheses</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Propargylic alcohols are readily available bifunctional (alkyne and hydroxyl groups) synthons, which recognize as one of the attractive synthetic feedstock in organic transformations. Especially, in recent years the employment of these valuable molecules has frequently been observed in the literature. Hence, the present review highlights recent advancements in the application of propargylic alcohols in the cyclization, substitution, and addition reactions.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Phthalimidine&#8208;d2 with Heavy Water as Deuterium Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Phthalimidine finds wide pharmaceutical applications and its deuterated derivative is supposed to exhibit enhanced stability towards metabolism. In this work, an electrochemically reductive deuteration strategy from phthalimide to phthalimidine&#8208;d2 was achieved with D2O as a deuterium source at the reagent level in common solvents. This approach showed broad compatibility with a variety of functional groups. Mechanistic investigations assisted by electrochemical analysis revealed a 4&#8208;electron reduction pathway, and the coupled anodic oxygen evolution collectively maintains a neutral to mild basic conditions for the ongoing electrochemical reaction.

         <title>Substituent&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergent Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Annulative Dearomatization of Phenols toward Skeletally Diverse Spirocyclohexadienones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular dearomative formal [4+2] annulation of phenols with propargyl electrophiles is reported, enabling substituent&#8208;controlled regiodivergent synthesis of a wide range of skeletally diverse spirocyclohexadienones with good yields. The regiodivergence could be precisely controlled by adjusting the steric hindrance of O&#8208; and N&#8208;substituents from binucleophilic substrates, where substrates with an O&#8208;nucleophilic site were converted into spiro[chromane&#8208;4,1&#8242;&#8208;cyclohexane]&#8208;2&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;dien&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;ones with complete regioselectivity and (Z)&#8208;selectivity, whereas N&#8208;nucleophiles enabled a different regiodivergent process to access spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;1,4&#8242;&#8208;quinoline]&#8208;2,5&#8208;dien&#8208;4&#8208;ones.

         <title>A Combined Halogen&#8208; and Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Applications of both halogen and chalcogen bonding in organocatalysis are by now well established with various examples. However, the combination of both interactions within one catalyst is currently unknown. Herein, we describe the synthesis of such a mixed chalcogen&#8208; and halogen&#8208;bond donor and present a first indication of its catalytic activity in a benchmark reaction.

         <title>Ga&#8208;Catalyzed Temperature&#8208;Dependent Oxazolidinone/Piperazine Synthesis from Phenyl Aziridines Involving a Divergent Ligand&#8208;Assisted Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Application of a binary Ga&#8208;based catalyst system for the coupling of CO2 and aziridines to form oxazolidinones is presented. It has been possible to optimize the catalyst system for the selective formation of a single regioisomer, in excellent yield, under relatively mild reaction conditions. The optimized catalyst system has been successfully applied to a range of substituted aziridines derived from styrene oxide. It has been observed that aziridines bearing two aromatic substituents result in piperazine formation through an unexpected dimerization reaction. These piperazine products can be selectively formed in the absence of CO2 or are favored at lower reaction temperatures. A detailed DFT study into the reaction mechanism for the formation of both products has been carried out and an unusual ligand assistance in the case of oxazolidinone synthesis has been identified. More specifically, this ligand interaction promotes the initial ring&#8208;opening of the aziridine and this work presents the first fully elucidated mechanism involving this intermediate.

Abstract
In 1962, Paul&#8197;J. de&#8197;Mayo initially described the photochemical reaction involving 1,3&#8208;diketones and double bonds, resulting in the formation of 1,5&#8208;diketones. Since then, this reaction has been extensively utilized for the synthesis of a wide range of fascinating natural products. Over time, this synthetic methodology has been applied to various carbonyl systems, including locked enol&#8208;tautomers of diketones, &#946;&#8208;keto esters, and &#946;&#8208;enaminones. Additionally, it has found application in other unsaturated systems such as allenes and alkynes. In this review article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the classical de Mayo reaction, highlighting its scope and potential. Furthermore, we focus on recent advances achieved through photocatalytic conditions. Special emphasis is placed on the regioselectivity of the process and the underlying reaction mechanism, particularly within the context of photocatalysis.

Abstract
In this study, we present a methodology for synthesizing aza&#8208;heterocyclic compounds using N&#8208;tosylhydrazones as key reagents. Our primary objective was to obtain six or seven&#8208;membered ring heterocycles; however, we unexpectedly observed the formation of bi&#8208;indole compounds in high yields. Furthermore, our synthetic pathway enables modifications at the C3 or C2 position of the indole, leading to the formation of the respective 3&#8242;&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;biindole or carbazole derivatives.

         <title>Michael Addition and Oxidative Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Oxo Ketene Dithioacetals and Maleimides: Switchable Synthesis of 3&#8208;Alkenyl Succinimides and Maleimides</title>

Abstract
Switchable synthesis of 3&#8208;alkenyl succinimides and maleimides has been achieved via Michael addition and oxidative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of &#945;&#8208;oxo ketene dithioacetals and maleimides by switching different reaction conditions. In the presence of 30&#8197;mol% of CH3SO3H in DCE at 120&#8201;&#176;C, Michael addition reaction of &#945;&#8208;oxo ketene dithioacetals and maleimides occurred to afford 3&#8208;alkenyl succinimides in 40&#8211;90% yields, whereas in the presence of 30&#8197;mol% of Pd(OAc)2 in DMF at 20&#8201;&#176;C, 3&#8208;alkenyl maleimides were obtained in 40&#8211;80% yields from the oxidative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of &#945;&#8208;oxo ketene dithioacetals with maleimides. The presupposition of directing groups onto the substrates is not required in the Michael addition reaction. The method can be extended to gram scale.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydrogenation of Azides and One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
In this work, a single&#8208;atom cobalt&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation (TH) of azides is reported under mild conditions (at 30&#8201;&#176;C in 30&#8197;min) using NH2NH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O as the hydrogen source. Employing this protocol, a wide range of azides were transformed to their corresponding amines. This methodology was extended towards the synthesis of several important N&#8208;substituted pyrroles from azides in one&#8208;pot manner. The control experiments suggested, the transfer hydrogenation favoured by electron withdrawing substituents and one&#8208;pot pyrrole synthesis favoured by electron&#8208;donating substituents. The recyclability test revealed the catalysts could be recycled up to 7th times without significant loss in the catalytic activity.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Aryliminophosphoranes in Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A practical electrochemical method for synthesizing aryliminophosphoranes from widely available nitro(hetero)arenes in a continuous&#8208;flow system is presented. The utilization of flow technology offers several advantages to our approach, including the elimination of the need for a supporting electrolyte and enhanced scalability. Our method demonstrates good tolerance towards various functional groups, with electron&#8208;deficient nitroarenes being particularly suitable for this strategy. In addition, we have demonstrated the versatility of aryliminophosphoranes as intermediates in synthesizing anilines, amines, and amides. To further enhance the utility of our approach, we have developed a telescoped method that utilizes a tube&#8208;in&#8208;tube setup for the in&#8208;situ production of isocyanates.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven, Persulfate&#8208;Mediated Hydrocarboxylation of Vinylsulfones</title>

Abstract
We report a visible light&#8208;mediated approach for the radical hydrocarboxylation of vinylsulfone derivatives. Using cheap and easily accessible sodium formate as C1&#8208;source and K2S2O8 as reagent, a set of vinylsulfone substrates could be efficiently hydrocarboxylated in aqueous medium without any additional catalyst or reagent; and the concept could be also applied for direct hydroacylations, hydroalkylations and hydrophosphorylations. The control experiments clearly indicated that the reaction proceeds via radical mechanism without the generation of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes; supporting the working model of K2S2O8&#8208;initiated in&#8197;situ formation of CO2 radical anion.

Abstract
Herein, a method about hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mediated electrochemical cross dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reaction of heterocycles with ethers has been established. Saturated linear, branched or cyclic ethers were all suitable for this cross&#8208;coupling reaction to form the corresponding products in 70&#8211;98% yields. The advantages of this reaction are transition metal&#8208; and chemical oxidant&#8208;free conditions, high yields, and broad functional group tolerance, etc.

         <dc:description>This report has realized the catalytic asymmetric [3+2] annulation of benzylideneindolinones with CF3&#8208;containing isatin&#8208;derived azomethine ylides for the first time, in which the organocatalysis has failed. In the presence of dinuclear zinc catalysts, a series of functionalized 2,3&#8208;pyrrolidinyl dispirooxindoles have been synthesized in good yields with excellent stereoselectivity under mild reaction conditions. This protocol can be run on a gram scale and a possible catalytic mechanism is proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote Asymmetric Bisvinylogous [4+2] Cycloaddition Reaction to Synthesize Spirocyclic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The highly enantioselective organocatalytic synthesis of spyrociclic compounds by Diels&#8208;Alder reactions via trienamine using cyclic 2,5&#8208;dienones as bisvinylogous precursors and different nitroalkenes as dienophiles is described. The use of cinchonidine&#8208;based primary amine as catalyst and benzoic acid as co&#8208;catalyst has allowed the construction of a wide variety of spiro compounds containing three stereogenic centres in good yields and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Additionally, other dienophiles have been evaluated exhibiting different behaviour depending on the electron withdrawing group nature. Subsequent transformations have yielded complex structures with up to five stereocentres. The plausible reaction mechanism has been investigated by computational methods.

This transformation features a broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance.

         <title>Direct Introduction of &#8722;OCD3 into the Hantzsch Pyrrole Synthesis via Multicomponent Cascade Cyclization: Synthesis of Fully Substituted Pyrrole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A I2&#8208;DMSO mediated approach to introduce &#8722;OCD3 into pyrroles in&#8197;situ via multicomponent cascade cyclization reaction using methyl ketones, aniline, ethyl benzoylacetate and CD3OD as readily available substrates is reported. This process realizes introduction of &#8722;OCD3 into the Hantzsch pyrrole synthesis and synthesis of deuterated alkoxy&#8208;substituted pyrroles with formation of one C&#8722;C bond, one C&#8722;O bond and two C&#8722;N bonds in one pot. Notably, this conversion has good substrate compatibility (62 examples) and eliminates of the need for anhydrous and anaerobic operation.

         <title>Transfer Hydrogenation of Azoarenes to Hydrazoarenes by Ammonia Borane Complex Catalyzed by Au Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Minute amounts of supported Au nanoparticles on TiO2 (0.1&#8197;mol%) catalyze quantitatively at room temperature the transfer hydrogenation of azoarenes to hydrazoarenes by ammonia borane complex, in ethanol as solvent. At 1&#8197;mol% catalyst loading level and 2.5 molar equivalents of ammonia borane the process occurs instantaneously. The catalyst is recyclable and reusable. In the absence of reducing agent, hydrazoarenes undergo smooth Au/TiO2&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation back to azoarenes.

         <title>L&#8208;Proline Derived Thioamide Small Organic Molecule for the &#945;&#8208;Stereoselective Synthesis of 2&#8208;Deoxyglycosides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
L&#8208;Prolinethioamide catalyzes direct stereoselective glycosylation of glycal donors to access 2&#8208;deoxyglycosides under moderate reaction conditions. This proposed glycosylation protocol produced the desired products in up to 88% yield and shows greater tolerance of glycosyl acceptors and a broad substrate scope with better stereoselectivity. This method is also applicable for less nucleophilic acceptors such as phenol. In addition, 1,1&#8242;&#8208;linked trehalose&#8208;type analogues can also be accessed through this methodology. Further, mechanistic studies suggest that, in this glycosylation, L&#8208;prolinethioamide operates via Br&#248;nsted acid/base catalysis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L-Prolinethioamide catalyzes direct stereoselective glycosylation of glycal donors to access 2-deoxyglycosides under moderate reaction conditions. This proposed glycosylation protocol produced the desired products in up to 88% yield and shows greater tolerance of glycosyl acceptors and a broad substrate scope with better stereoselectivity. This method is also applicable for less nucleophilic acceptors such as phenol. In addition, 1,1&#8242;-linked trehalose-type analogues can also be accessed through this methodology. Further, mechanistic studies suggest that, in this glycosylation, L-prolinethioamide operates via Br&#248;nsted acid/base catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The front cover illustrates the diastereoselective formation of condensed heterocyclic ring systems by domino reaction sequences. The dominoes toppling each other represent the steps of the reaction sequences, each transformation initiating the next one. The mechanism of the cyclization is tunable by the choice of reagent, affording four different condensed heterocyclic ring systems. A novel mild transformation of nitroarenes to N&#8208;hydroxyindoles, in which deoxygenation is carried out by an intramolecular nitro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder cyclization&#8208;ring opening, is presented. Details can be found in the Research Article by Attila M&#225;ndi, Tibor Kurt&#225;n, and co&#8208;workers (S. B. Kir&#225;ly, L. T&#243;th, T. Kov&#225;cs, A. B&#233;nyei, E. Lisztes, B. I.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclizations and [3+2]&#8208;Annulation Cascades between 1,5&#8208;Diyn&#8208;3&#8208;ols and Nitrones to Construct Carbazole Frameworks</title>

Abstract
Gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions between 1,5&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;ols and nitrones to deliver carbazole derivatives are described. Such cascade reactions are applicable to facile synthesis of polyaromatic compounds containing carbazole subunits. Notably, the reaction mechanism involves unexpected oxoarylations, rather than oxidative Mannich reactions as known for but&#8208;1&#8208;yn&#8208;4&#8208;ols. Our control experiments indicate that the presence of a second alkyne as in 1,5&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;ols enables such oxoarylations due to a weak bonding between gold and this alkyne, rending the tethered alcohol less conformationally flexible.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold-catalyzed cascade reactions between 1,5-diyn-3-ols and nitrones to deliver carbazole derivatives are described. Such cascade reactions are applicable to facile synthesis of polyaromatic compounds containing carbazole subunits. Notably, the reaction mechanism involves unexpected oxoarylations, rather than oxidative Mannich reactions as known for but-1-yn-4-ols. Our control experiments indicate that the presence of a second alkyne as in 1,5-diyn-3-ols enables such oxoarylations due to a weak bonding between gold and this alkyne, rending the tethered alcohol less conformationally flexible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized 2&#8208;Pyrrolidinones Bearing N&#8208;Trifluoromethylphenyl through A Formal [4+1] Cycloaddition of Cinnamaldehyde Nitrones and 1&#8208;Ethynylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ols</title>

Abstract
A variety of functionalized 2&#8208;pyrrolidinones bearing N&#8208;trifluoromethylphenyl moieties were prepared in moderate to good yields with high diastereoselectivity through copper(II)&#8208;catalyst and base co&#8208;catalyzed formal [4+1] cycloaddition of cinnamaldehyde nitrones with 1&#8208;ethynylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ols in the presence of m&#8208;CPBA as the oxidant. The triple bond of 1&#8208;ethynylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol served as one&#8208;carbon synthon for the pyrrolidinone ring formation. Mechanistic studies revealed that m&#8208;CPBA played an important role to interrupt the intramolecular O&#8208;cyclization to afford the 2&#8208;pyrrolidinones. Moreover, the reaction could be easily performed at gram scales and the obtained products were selectively converted into diverse pyrroline scaffolds.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Access to Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;Aminothiophenes via Regio&#8208; and Chemoselective Domino Reactions of Dithioesters with Fumaronitrile at Room Temperature</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot viable protocol to synthesize tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;aminothiophenes engaging readily accessible &#945;&#8208;enolic dithioesters and abundant fumaronitrile under transition metal&#8208;free conditions at room temperature in open air. The reaction proceeds via successive Michael&#8208;type addition/intramolecular cyclization/isomerization cascades. The added features are benign conditions, exclusive regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity, excellent atom&#8208;/step&#8208;economy, easy purification, and tolerance of wide range of functional groups of a diverse electronic and steric nature. This protocol not only provided a robust and modular approach to various 2&#8208;aminothiophenes in moderate to excellent yields, but also demonstrated the potential of dithioesters and fumaronitrile in the challenging intermolecular cross&#8208;coupling reactions widening the arsenal of synthetic methods.

         <title>Multicomponent Reaction of Aliphatic Organozinc Reagents, Acrylates and Acyl chlorides: Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Substituted &#946;&#8208;Ketoesters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An uncatalyzed three&#8208;component reaction employing aliphatic organozinc reagents for the preparation of &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;ketoesters is described. This modular procedure, which relies on a formal conjugate addition/crossed&#8208;Claisen domino reaction between an organozinc, an acrylate and an acyl chloride, allows the straightforward synthesis of the reaction products under mild conditions. The three&#8208;component coupling can also be conducted from alkyl iodides, in an even more simple procedure. Experimental findings account for a probable polar concerted mechanism involving at least two organozinc compounds at the stage of the transition state.

Abstract
(&#946;&#8208;Diazo&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroethyl)phosphonates have been emerging as useful building blocks in organic synthetic chemistry in recent years, which can be used as diazo analog or masked carbene for the rapid assembly of difluoromethylene phosphonate&#8208;containing compounds. Herein, we elaborate a method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates from hydration/C&#8722;F bond cleavage of in&#8197;situ generated (&#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroethyl)phosphonates via a Rh&#8208;carbene intermediate. Divers (&#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroethyl)phosphonates are tolerated in this reaction affording &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates in good yields. This reaction used the in&#8197;situ generated water as the coupling partner, which represents a reaction of (&#946;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroethyl)phosphonates and also a method for generating bioactive &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Amide Synthesis in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
In the present study, for the first time environmentally friendly deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are used as reaction media to perform an efficient, simple and straightforward photocatalytic amide synthesis at room temperature using thioacids and amines. This method features mild conditions, a broad substrate scope, high yields (&#8804;99%) under ambient conditions with air and moisture tolerance. Moreover, the applied operationally mild reaction conditions tolerate the presence of several different functional group substituents on the amine counterpart. Finally, the developed approach allows the recycling of the reaction medium and catalyst for at least three consecutive cycles without a significant decrease in the reaction yield.

         <title>Transient Directing Group Enabled C3&#8208;(sp2)&#8722;H Alkenylation of Five Membered Heterocyclic Aldehydes: An Access to Mechanochromic Luminogen</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The palladium (II) catalyzed direct C3&#8208;(sp2)&#8722;H alkenylation of five membered heterocyclic aldehydes has been developed using 3&#8208;aminobutanoic acid as a catalytic transient directing group. A wide range of heterocyclic aldehydes reacted with various acrylates to afford highly site&#8208;selective C3&#8208;alkenylated products. This method features an exclusive E&#8208;selective alkenylation at the C3&#8208;position of heterocyclic aldehydes with a broad substrate scope. The protocol also proved to be useful to construct the mechanochromic luminogen.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The palladium (II) catalyzed direct C3-(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H alkenylation of five membered heterocyclic aldehydes has been developed using 3-aminobutanoic acid as a catalytic transient directing group. A wide range of heterocyclic aldehydes reacted with various acrylates to afford highly site-selective C3-alkenylated products. This method features an exclusive &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-selective alkenylation at the C3-position of heterocyclic aldehydes with a broad substrate scope. The protocol also proved to be useful to construct the mechanochromic luminogen.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Regulated Electrochemical Selenylation and Deuteration of Alkynyl Aryl Ketones: Chemoselective Synthesis of 3&#8208;Selenylated Chromones and Deutero&#8208;Selenylated Chalcones</title>

Abstract
We have developed an electrochemical reaction for the synthesis of 3&#8208;selenylchromones and deutero&#8208;selenylated chalcones of alkynyl aryl ketones. This method is free from metal catalysts and oxidants, and is regulated by solvents. The reaction conditions are mild, and a wide range of substrates can be employed to produce selenylated chromones and deutero&#8208;selenylated chalcones, displaying potential anti&#8208;inflammatory activities. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the applicability of this approach for the late&#8208;stage deutero&#8208;selenylation of the drug molecule, metochalcone.

Abstract
Herein, we report a direct method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;imidoketones and &#945;&#8208;azolylketones via hypoiodite&#8208;catalyzed oxidative &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;N coupling of ketones with the corresponding imides and azoles, respectively. The use of inorganic base additives such as cesium carbonate in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 as a phase transfer catalyst was crucial to induce high reactivity. Control experiments revealed that the basic additives might not only facilitate high&#8208;turnover hypoiodite catalysis, but also be involved in the activation of coupling partners.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Bicyclo[3.2.1]octanes via Catalyst&#8208;Free Cascade Michael/Henry Reaction with a Functionalized Vinylogous Nucleophile</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A readily prepared and functionalized vinylogous nucleophile has been explored and utilized to construct bridged bicyclic compounds. The corresponding cascade Michael/Henry reaction occurred with relatively high reactivity under catalyst&#8208;free and mild conditions. A range of structurally distinct bicyclo[3.2.1]octanes were generated in 40&#8211;96% isolated yields with excellent diastereoselectivities (&#8805;10:1 dr). Gram&#8208;scale synthesis was also demonstrated.

Abstract
Visible&#8208;light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot tandem regioselective synthesis of C4&#8208;phosphorylated phthalazin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones from arylhydrazines, 2&#8208;formylbenzoic acids with diarylphosphine oxides is described. This three&#8208;component transformation occurs smoothly under mild conditions, providing regiospecific access to various phosphorylated products in 73&#8211;91% yield. The efficacy of the current catalysis arises from the use of organic 1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) as the photocatalyst and cheap K2S2O8 as the oxidant.

Abstract
&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated enones possessing an unactivated olefin at the &#1013;&#8208;, &#950;&#8208; or &#951;&#8208;position underwent an aluminum chloride&#8208;promoted Conia&#8208;ene&#8208;related cyclization, affording unsaturated decalones or hexahydroindenones in generally good yields. Cyclopropanes could be used as olefin surrogates in this process, leading to the same bicyclic products in slightly improved efficiency as the result of 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;hydroalkenylation reactions. This method provided an access to a whole range of bi&#8208; or tricyclic enone synthons, some of which were potentially useful as odorants or in the synthesis of biologically active molecules.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#945;,&#946;-Unsaturated enones possessing an unactivated olefin at the &#1013;-, &#950;- or &#951;-position underwent an aluminum chloride-promoted Conia-ene-related cyclization, affording unsaturated decalones or hexahydroindenones in generally good yields. Cyclopropanes could be used as olefin surrogates in this process, leading to the same bicyclic products in slightly improved efficiency as the result of 1,2- or 1,3-hydroalkenylation reactions. This method provided an access to a whole range of bi- or tricyclic enone synthons, some of which were potentially useful as odorants or in the synthesis of biologically active molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reductive Denitrogenation of Six&#8208;membered Cyclic Nitronates to Densely Substituted Dihydrofurans with Raney&#174; Nickel/AcOH System</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A protocol for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;dihydrofurans by reductive denitrogenation/ring contraction of 6&#8208;membered cyclic nitronates was developed. The process utilizes cheap Raney&#174; nickel both as catalyst and stoichiometric agent without the need for high&#8208;pressure equipment. The products are formed in high purity and column chromatography is often not required. Studies on the substrate scope, functional group tolerance, and mechanism were performed. The developed approach provides a straightforward two&#8208;step access to densely substituted 2,3&#8208;dihydrofurans from nitrostyrenes and alkenes.

         <title>Cu(III) Trifluoromethyl Complexes with 1,3&#8208;Diketonate Ligands and Their Versatile Reactivity in C&#8722;H Trifluoromethylation</title>

Abstract
High&#8208;valent Cu(III) trifluoromethyl complexes with 1,3&#8208;diketonates as bidentate oxygen donor ligands LCu(III)(CF3)2 were prepared for the first time and fully characterized, including by X&#8208;ray crystallography. These complexes are bench stable and soluble in most organic solvents. Promising reactivity of Cu(III) trifluoromethyl diketonates in radical and radical&#8208;polar crossover trifluoromethylation reactions was demonstrated. Direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of electron&#8208;rich arenes and indoles using Cu(III) trifluoromethyl diketonates under blue light irradiation is described. Azolo&#8208; and oxy&#8208;trifluoromethylation of terminal alkynes and S&#8208;trifluoromethylation of aromatic thiol can be achieved using LCu(III)(CF3)2 in mild conditions.

         <title>Visible Light Induced Difunctional Hetero&#8208;annulation of Unsaturated C&#8208;C Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterocyclic scaffolds are beneficial structural architects in a wide range of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, biological and also functional materials. In this regard, several investigations have been performed to synthesize them. Among these, visible light&#8208;induced difunctionalization cyclization strategy provides attractive solutions by adopting greener routes, breaking the monopoly of conventional thermal processes. A review on these methodologies is also desirable as unsaturated aliphatics, especially alkenes are one of the cheapest feedstocks available. They offer diverse options and modifications to generate different products, including heterocycles, which are highly sought after due to their applications in various sectors.
To account for the advancements in this strategy, we summarized the visible light induced difunctionalization strategies that directly lead to the  synthesis of heterocyclic scaffolds from unsaturated C&#8208;C bonds. We have categorized the relevant reaction schemes into three mechanistically distinct sections namely (i) Two component oxidative annulations (ii) Radical mediated annulations (iii) Polar radical crossover annulations and (iv) Three component oxidative annulations.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrophilic cyclization via the boronate complex between various homoallylic boronates and Selectfluor&#174; is reported. This reaction provides a fluoromethylated cyclopropane ring that was difficult to synthesize by previous methods. The use of phenyl lithium, which activates the homoallylic boronate, is important for the reaction. The intermediate boronate species in this reaction was observed through &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B NMR experiments. We also demonstrate the synthesis of a building block including fluoromethyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropane for a bioactive compound.</dc:description>

Abstract
A pyrrolidine&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction of azlactone, N,O&#8208;acetal and alcohol for the synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;diamino ester was reported. The N,O&#8208;acetal served as the imine equivalent to occur Mannich reaction with azlactone, and the in&#8197;situ generated &#945;&#8208;functionalized azlactone subsequently underwent a ring&#8208;opening process in the presence of alcohol. A series of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;diamino esters were obtained in 36&#8211;99% yields under mild reaction conditions. The product could be synthesized on gram&#8208;scale and transformed into the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;diamino acid.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Aliphatic C&#8722;H Chlorination and Bromination Using Haloform as the Halogen Donor and Azidobenziodoxole as the Mediator</title>

Abstract
An azidobenziodoxole (BIN3)&#8208;mediated tunable radical reaction system for selective chlorination and bromination of tertiary and secondary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of alkyl substrates using haloform as the halogen donor was developed. Reactions of various substrates with BIN3 under visible light irradiation without any photo or metal catalysts gave C&#8722;H chlorinated or brominated products. These reactions are selective, and compatible with many functional groups. Mechanistic studies suggest that haloform serves as the halogen atom donor and HN3 generated in&#8197;situ from the reaction of BIN3 and water relays the radical chain reaction as the hydrogen atom donor. HN3 reacts with CHX2&#8901; to form CH2X2 and N3&#8901;, which propagates a radical chain by abstracting a hydrogen atom of the alkane substrate.

         <title>Synthesis of Tetraazamacrocycles by Sequential Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Substitution Reactions</title>

Abstract
In this study, we focused on the synthesis of tetraazamacrocycles, an essential class of macrocyclic compounds with applications in coordination chemistry, pharmaceuticals, and catalysis. To accomplish this, we developed a ligand&#8208;controlled palladium&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution approach using bicyclic bridgehead phosphoramidite (briphos) ligands. This approach allowed us to selectively achieve [1+1] and [1+2] allylic aminations between allylic diols and diamines, while avoiding the formation of cyclic [1+1] products. By combining this approach with sequential acetylation and allylic amination, we successfully synthesized tetraazamacrocycles with ring sizes ranging from 16 to 38. These findings demonstrate the potential of a sequential allylation strategy for synthesizing complex molecules with broad applications in the fields of chemistry, pharmaceuticals, and medicine.

Abstract
In this study, 3H&#8208;phenothiazin&#8208;3&#8208;one is identified as a photocatalyst for the photochemical oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides. This photocatalytic method uses a low catalyst loading (0.05&#8197;mol%), molecular oxygen as the sole oxidant, and a blue LED lamp as the irradiation source. It can be applied to the oxidation of both alkyl&#8208;aryl and alkyl&#8208;alkyl sulfides. Moreover, the method is also applicable in the synthesis of the known pharmaceutically active compounds Modafinil and Sulforaphane.

         <title>Palladium and Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Friedel&#8211;Crafts Acylation with Activated Amides.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inside cover picture illustrates a new approach that was devised for the Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation reaction, involving the combination of an activated amide and an arene. To activate the arene, a catalytic system composed of [Pd(cinnamyl)Cl]2 and Cu(OTf)2 was employed. The reaction between the activated arene and the amide resulted in the formation of the desired aryl ketone, demonstrating favorable yields. This advancement opens up possibilities for the synthesis of diverse aryl ketones through the Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation process. Details can be found in the Update by Haeun Park and Sunwoo Lee (H. Park, S. Lee, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2023, 365, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202300376)

The front cover picture illustrates the synthetic strategy for the regioselective installation of various soft nucleophiles at the C6 position of the highly reactive o&#8208;quinol acetate by 1,6&#8208;addition. Afterward, the substituted phenol intermediate further chemoselectively cyclizes to provide a variety of isocoumarin or flavone products via a lactonization or SNAr pathway. The high selectivity reached for all product types makes the synthetic map effectively extend in diverse directions and unimpeded.

         <title>Electrophilic C3&#8211;H Alkenylation of 2,6&#8208;Dialkoxypyridine Derivatives via Pd(II)/Tl(III) Reaction System</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the reaction system based on Pd(II) catalyst and Tl(OCOCF3)3 for the electrophilic C3&#8211;H alkenylation of 2,6&#8208;dialkokypyridines with alkenes. Synergistic action of the Pd/thioether ligand catalytic system and Tl(III) results in efficient C&#8211;H alkenylation of various nitrogen heteroaromatics with complete regioselectivity. Remarkably, the use of a sterically hindered thioether ligand and the Pd(II)/Tl(III) system enables mono&#8208;selective C3(5)&#8211;H alkenylation of 2,6&#8208;dialkoxypyridines, and subsequent introduction of a second, different alkene affords unsymmetrical, multi&#8208;substituted pyridine derivatives. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds via electrophilic thallation of heteroarenes followed by Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck&#8208;type reaction. The utility of this method is showcased by its application to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of structurally complex bioactive molecules having 2,6&#8208;dialkoxypyridine as a core structure.</dc:description>

Abstract
In a tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3]&#8208;catalyzed reaction of alkenes with cyanogen halides (XCN), BrCN proceeds in a cyanation/bromination manner, in which a cationic CN character is realized. The reaction using ICN switched the mode to iodination/cyanation for enamide substrates and electron&#8208;enriched styrenes. The origin of the iodination/cyanation is the B(C6F5)3&#8208;enhanced &#963;&#8208;hole generated on ICN.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Construction of Fluorinated Chiral Alcohols via Sequential Substitution/Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Bromoarylketones and Fluoroalcohols</title>

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot synthesis of fluorinated chiral alcohols from &#945;&#8208;bromoarylketones and fluoroalcohols is described. The fluorinated ketone intermediates were formed from &#945;&#8208;bromoarylketones with fluoroalcohols as nucleophiles and solvents, which were reduced subsequentially by adding a chiral Ru catalyst and a mixture of formic acid and triethyl amines (FA: TEA=1.1:1) as hydrogen donor to give 27 examples of fluorinated chiral alcohols in 60&#8211;93% yields and 85&#8211;98% ee values. Notably, K3PO4 acts as a base in nucleophilic substitution and an additive in reductive step to enhance the reactivity and enantioselectivity, which is crucial for constructing compatible conditions for one&#8208;pot process. This one&#8208;pot process is also applicable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

         <title>Short and Scalable Synthesis of Plant&#8208;Based Cholesterol in GMP Grade</title>

Abstract
A plant&#8208;based straightforward and short four&#8208;step synthesis of cholesterol starting from commercially available diosgenin is reported. This offers a large&#8208;scale production of highly needed GMP&#8208;grade cholesterol, which is part of the lipid cocktail for the assembly of effective mRNA&#8208;based vaccines against the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. These lipids are formulated into the delivery system of the mRNA fragments by forming Lipid Nano Particles (LNP) that introduce the mRNA into the cells. Cholesterol plays a crucial role because it stabilizes LNP and facilitates endosome escape of the mRNA into the cytosol.

Abstract
We report a photocatalytic strategy for selective reduction of nitroarenes to azoxy&#8208;, azo&#8208; and hydrazo&#8208;compounds catalyzed by bismuth porphyrin metal organic framework (Bi&#8208;MOF) through controlling time, atmosphere, or the quantity of NaBH4 under mild conditions (Rt, Light). The photocatalytic protocol exhibited excellent functional group compatibility, and the recyclability of Bi&#8208;MOF was demonstrated by five cycle tests. More importantly, the scale&#8208;up experiment of 10&#8197;g can also be carried out smoothly with excellent yield of 95%. This green and effective photocatalytic strategy provides a practical possibility for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of azo intermediates.

         <title>Direct Access to meta&#8208;Alkylated N&#8208;Arylazolium Salts via Ruthenium Catalyzed Electronically Controlled Site Selective Functionalization: Scope and Mechanistic Aspect</title>

Abstract
Effective access to azolium salts with varying stereoelectronic properties has always fascinated the organometallic chemists. Herein, we described a Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;step access to diverse meta&#8208;alkylated N&#8208;aryl (benz)imidazolium salts (&gt;40&#8197;examples) via &#963;&#8208;bond activation strategy starting from the readily available azolium salts using alkyl bromide. Notably, the present method is compatible with a wide range of azolium salts and secondary/tertiary alkyl bromides, including the biologically relevant motifs. Various control experiments along with the DFT calculation established the reaction pathway of orthometalated Ru(II)&#8208;NHC complex (6) formation followed by the generation of a Ru(III)&#8208;intermediate, which controls the observed meta&#8208;selectivity, via single electron transfer. Crucially, detailed insight of the reaction mechanism helped to comprehend why some substrates are challenging for this methodology.

Abstract
N,N&#8217;&#8208;Diaryl ethylenediamines are common feedstocks in organic synthesis and important structural motifs in medicinal chemistry. Whereas the C&#8722;N formation reactions based on anilines and aryl halides are the most direct methods to access N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl ethylenediamines, the photocatalytic synthetic version remains undeveloped. Herein we describe the dual nickel/photoredox&#8208;catalyzed amination reaction using nitroarenes and trimethylamine as reaction substrates. This cascade transformation hinges on the multiple C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C coupling events based on the nitrogen radical and &#945;&#8208;aminomethyl radical derived from nitroarene and trimethylamine, respectively. A variety of N&#8208;formyl N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl ethylenediamines can be obtained under the reaction protocol. Subsequent hydrolysis offers the N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl ethylenediamines for further derivatizations.

Abstract
A synthetic method to prepare 1,2&#8208;diamines efficiently that relies on the 4CzPN&#8208;catalysed &#945;&#8208;aminoalkylation of azomethine imines by secondary and tertiary &#945;&#8208;silylamines under blue light emitting diode (LED) light (456&#8197;nm) is described. Achieved under metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free reaction conditions at room temperature, the synthetic protocol was shown to afford product yields up to 99% and applicable to the late&#8208;stage functionalisation of three drug molecules and the gramme&#8208;scale preparation of one example.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation of Ynamides with Aminocarbonyls as a Route to 2&#8208;Aminoquinolines Diversely Substituted at the 4th&#8208;Position</title>

Abstract
Gold&#8208;catalyzed interplay between ynamides and aminocarbonyls comprises a route to 2&#8208;aminoquinolines. This modular annulation proceeds under relatively mild conditions (Ph3PAuCl/AgNTf2 5&#8197;mol&#8201;%, DCE, 60&#8211;80 &#176;C), and a number of functionalities were compatible (42&#8197;examples; 25&#8211;98% yields). In contrast to a group of other gold&#8208;catalyzed methods employing the ynamide/amine combinations for the assembly of 2&#8208;aminoquinolines, the developed approach utilizes a diversity of aminocarbonyl substrates and, in particular, allows a variation of the substituents in the 4th quinoline position. The synthetic potential of the obtained heterocyclic products was illustrated by post&#8208;modifications of the quinoline backbone and the peripheral substituents.

Abstract
This report describes a general method for the one&#8208;pot direct N&#8208;acylation of N&#8208;heterocycles using our previously developed 4&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethylamino)pyridine N&#8208;oxide (DMAPO)/di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl dicarbonate (Boc2O) system. This system enables one&#8208;pot N&#8208;acylation reactions to provide bulky N&#8208;acyl heterocycles starting from a wide variety of less nucleophilic N&#8208;heterocycles and sterically hindered &#945;&#8208;fully substituted carboxylic acids in high yields. Moreover, this one&#8208;pot method does not involve pre&#8208;activation of substrates. The protocol has been successfully extended to one&#8208;pot N&#8208;acylation of 7&#8208;azaindoles.

         <title>Dehydrogenative Fluorination of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes to Access Multi&#8208;Substituted Trifluoromethylalkenes</title>

Abstract
A dehydrogenative fluorination method is developed to access multi&#8208;substituted trifluoromethylalkenes starting from a variety of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. The reaction proceeds with electrophilic fluorination source NFSI only and accommodates a wide range of functional groups, thus complementing the previously reported protocols. Additionally, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted stereoinversion is revealed to enable the access to E&#8208;isomer enriched products.

Their syntheses were performed on a multi&#8208;gram scale by an oxidative cyclization connecting the nitrogen of a sulfoximine and a sulfur atom previously introduced in the ortho position of this group. The structures and properties of these new molecules were carefully examined by X&#8208;Ray diffraction, DFT calculations and cyclic voltammetry. These data clearly highlight the enhanced reactivity of these cyclic sulfoximines compared to their open analogues. This was confirmed by photoredox catalysis experiments that revealed interesting reactivity, most especially for the introduction of di&#8208; and monofluoroalkyl chains.

Abstract
Phosphonothioates, phosphinothioates and phosphorothioates are regarded as an important class of sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds. Because of the unique P(O)S&#8722;R group, these compounds have important biological activities and thus have been widely used in the fields of pharmaceuticals and pesticides. In recent years, the development of sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds by radical processes has attracted considerable attention in organophosphorus chemistry. Along these lines, in this review, the recent advances in the synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds were systematically summarized. According to the different ways of generating radicals during the formation process of phosphonothioates, phosphinothioates and phosphorothioates, these transformations can be divided into four categories: (1) Oxidant or metal&#8208;free promoted radical transformation to fabricate sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds; (2) Copper&#8208;catalyzed radical transformation to produce sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds; (3) Photo&#8208;induced radical transformation to prepare sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds; (4) Electro&#8208;induced radical transformation to derive sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds.

         <title>Recent Developments in Selenylation and Thiolation of Alkenes via Three&#8208;component Reactions</title>

Abstract
Alkenes are valuable feedstocks in organic synthesis. Selenium or sulfur&#8208;containing coumpounds with a neighboring functional group can be easily prepared by direct difunctionalization of alkenes via three&#8208;component reactions. It will reduce the number of steps and waste generation, and form complicated molecules from simple starting materials. Herein, recent developments (2013&#8211;2022) have been summarized via two categories: (1)&#8197;selenylation via seleniranium intermediates or Se&#8208;centered radicals; (2)&#8197;thiolation with more diverse mechanisms and products Reactions with electron&#8208;rich arenes, alcohols, water, acids, NaN3, amines, KSCN, and sulfamides, TMSNCS, TMSN3, Et3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3HF, SOCl2, HCl, NFSI, tBuONO, pyridinium salts, tBuOOH, ArN2BF4, CO2, CO, O2, CF3SO2Cl, R2P(O)&#8722;H, (RO)2P(O)SH, (RO)2P(O)OH et al will be discussed. We hope this review will do help for future research in this area.

Abstract
The employing visible light to drive organic transformations is the most promising choice to meet the needs for green synthesis, in which the reactions promoted by visible light may provide a more efficient and greener method. Currently, the most abundant methods for activation and functionalization of reaction substrates have relied on the direct single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) between the excited photocatalyst and substrates, and these wonderful works were summarized and docoumented in many reviews. As a complement to the above reactions, the photoredox&#8208;mediated atom transfer transformations (photocatalyst&#8208;to&#8208;HAT catalyst&#8208;to&#8208;substrates) to generate radical species are showing an explosively growing trend. In this review, we highlight recent significant developments in this rapidly growing area, mainly focusing on the photoinduced base&#8208;to&#8208;substrates charge transfer reactions.

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot synthesis of 2,3,4&#8208;unprotected &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;glycopyranosides from glycals and amines with exclusive &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity under room temperature conditions is reported. This method was achieved via palladium&#8208;catalyzed Tsuji&#8208;Trost amination followed by dihydroxylation directly, tolerating anilines, heterocyclic aromatic amines, and N,O&#8208;dimethylhydroxylamine, especially the reaction of primary amines and glycals has not been reported before. Furthermore, the protocol was applied to modify clinical drugs (prazosin, imiquimod) and construct the analogue of the natural product amphimedoside A.

Abstract
Accessing homogenous glycoconjugates is of significance for assessing their biophysical activities and sometimes as vaccine candidate. Synthesis of glycoconjugates involves two species of which, glycosyl donor plays pivotal role in controlling the outcome of the glycosylation. Recently discovered alkynyl glycosyl carbonate donors possess self&#8208;stability, high reactivity, and fast reaction time (15&#8211;30&#8197;min) when activated with [Au]/[Ag]&#8208;catalysts. Herein, we report metal free conditions for the activation of the same alkynyl glycosyl carbonate donors using I2/TMSOTf in stoichiometric quantities. Extrusion product was characterized to be the vinylidene iodide by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The reaction conditions were illustrated to be suitable for synthesis of various glycosides, purine/pyrimidine nucleosides and a pentasaccharide repeating unit of Klebsiella pneumoniae (O&#8208;3&#8208;antigen).

Abstract
A mild photocatalyzed approach to achieve the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of esters via formation of an &#945; &#8208;radical is disclosed here. Cesium enolates of esters were generated in&#8197;situ using Cs2CO3 as a base. A subsequent photocatalyzed oxidation at the &#945;&#8208;carbon of these enolates produced an &#945;&#8208;radical that was added into activated alkenes. This is the first example accessing the &#945;&#8208;carbon radical of esters in photoredox catalyed transformations.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of 1,4&#8208;Dienes via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Allylation of N&#8208;Tosylhydrazones</title>

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed allylic C&#8722;H oxidative allylation of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones to synthesize skipped 1,4&#8208;dienes is demonstrated. This direct allylic alkylation reaction has excellent site selectivity, tolerates a wide range of functional groups, and affords 1,4&#8208;dienes in moderate to good yield. Moreover, this olefination method allows the regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of 1,4&#8208;dienes containing a trisubstituted alkene. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction undergoes allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H activation and a subsequent carbene migratory insertion.

         <title>Cobalt(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Diamination of &#945;&#8208;Alkyl Styrenes with Anilines</title>

Abstract
A commercially available cobalt complex Cp*CoIII(CO)I2 has been found to effectively catalyze the diamination of &#945;&#8208;alkyl styrenes with anilines under a mild reaction condition, using dioxygen as the oxidant. This reaction features a reasonably good substrate scope of amines and a good functional group tolerance. Preliminary mechanistic studies have shown that Cp*CoIII(CO)I2 alone can promote the diamination reaction.

Abstract
Spirocyclic frameworks could enhance the drug&#8208;like properties of planar bioactive molecules by increasing their three&#8208;dimensionality, making the development of synthetic methodology and bioactivity assays for spiro compounds highly attractive. This work reported the silver&#8208;catalyzed tandem cycloisomerization/Povarov reaction between &#946;&#8208;alkynyl ketones and hexahydro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazines, access to spiro[isochromene&#8208;1,4&#8217;&#8208;quinoline]. This synthetic protocol was characterized by remarkable efficiency, low catalyst&#8208;loading and high diastereoselectivity. Moreover, the spirocyclic quinolines exhibited good cytotoxicity in U937 cells by activating the Notch&#8208;signaling pathway exclusively.

Abstract
The mono&#8208;&#945;&#8208;arylation of 2&#8208;tetrahydropyranyl O&#8208;protection of hydroxyacetone is reported. When using a catalyst system comprised of [Pd(cinnamyl)Cl]2 and the JosiPhos ligands PhPF&#8208;tBu or (4&#8208;CF3Ph)PF&#8208;tBu, such transformations are achieved with ortho&#8208;substituted aryl bromides and triflates in the presence of potentially contending functionalities including chloro groups.

When using a catalyst system comprised of [Pd(cinnamyl)Cl]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the JosiPhos ligands PhPF-&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu or (4-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ph)PF-&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu, such transformations are achieved with &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-substituted aryl bromides and triflates in the presence of potentially contending functionalities including chloro groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Olefinic C(sp2)&#8722;H Activation/Carbene Insertion/Ester Hydrolysis/Cyclization with Aryl Diazo Esters for the Synthesis of Multisubstituted Furanones</title>

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed olefinic C(sp2)&#8722;H activation/carbene insertion/ester hydrolysis/cyclization sequence has been developed for the synthesis of substituted 2(5H)&#8208;furanones employing readily available enaminones and aryl diazo esters as substrates. This method features operationally simple and good functional group tolerance. The transformation could be scaled up to gram quantities and the obtained 2(5H)&#8208;furanone derivatives could be easily converted to a wide range of useful synthetic building blocks, indicative of the applicability of the synthetic strategy. Isotope labeling experiments demonstrated the ester group of diazo esters was hydrolyzed during the reaction.

         <title>Zinc Chelate Complexes of N&#8208;Acyl Hydrazones as Substrates for Addition of Alkyl and Fluorinated Radicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Zinc chelate complexes can be generated in&#8197;situ from N&#8208;acyl hydrazones by treatment with isopropyl zinc iodide. These complexes couple with alkyl and fluorinated radicals under photoredox conditions. Alkyl radicals were generated from organozinc halides using an organic photocatalyst and afford hydrazines as a result of reductive mode of addition. Fluorinated radicals were formed from perfluorinated alkyl iodides under photoredox conditions leading to fluoroalkylated hydrazones via neutral reaction pathway.

         <title>C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage of &#945;&#8208;Pyridinium Amides: A Synthetic Approach to Hydantoin Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
This study reports a mild reaction&#8208;condition approach for the direct C&#8722;C bond cleavage of amides to form hydantoin structures in the presence of 4&#8208;methylpyridine and a base. This approach presents an amide C&#8722;C bond cleavage strategy enabling nucleophilic addition to the amide carbonyl involving a reactive spiro intermediate. A broad spectrum of pseudo peptide Ugi adducts as bifunctional starting materials was synthesized and used in this transformation. The mechanistic pathway of this reaction was investigated using experimental and theoretical studies.

Abstract
This work describes the palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective C8&#8208;H olefination of 1&#8208;naphthamides. Interestingly, naphthamide fused lactam 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[de]isoquinolin&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives were also synthesized in the case of a particular class of napthamides. This protocol was found well compatible with a diverse range of acrylates and styrenes leading to product formation in good yields along with a wide functional group tolerance. The developed strategy was further applied to the synthesis of different drug derivatives.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed direct C(sp2)&#8722;H bond aminosulfonylation of maleimides is demonstrated. This protocol enables concurrent construction of C(sp2)&#8722;N and C(sp2)&#8722;SO2 bonds in one&#8208;step and features high efficiency, broad substrate scopes, good functional&#8208;group tolerance, and mild reaction conditions. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction probably involves a radical way. Significantly, this method is applicable to synthesize derivatives of pharmaceuticals such as Desloratadine, Fluoxetine, Atomoxetine, and Maprotiline.

Abstract
A concise and flexible protocol to assemble structurally diverse 1H&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]quinoline&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;diones (29 examples, 70&#8211;87% yields) has been developed via one&#8208;pot stepwise synthesis. The potentially valuable quinine&#8208;fused heterocycles were synthetized by utilizing aliphatic alcohol hydroxyl as directing group which promoted a sequential transformation to form functionalized aminomaleimides, and then underwent an I2&#8208;oxidized tandem annulations. This route involved the formation of multiple new chemical bonds (C=N, 2C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C) in a one&#8208;pot fashion under mild conditions.

Abstract
We present here an iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidative Csp3&#8722;Csp3 bond cleavage of unstrained tertiary alkyl aromatics to provide a range of synthetically useful arylketones even with H2O2 as the oxidant. This method is operationally simple, scalable, and eco&#8208;friendly, as well as suitable for the late&#8208;stage oxidation of complex molecules bearing hydroxy groups, making it a valuable tool in organic synthesis.

         <title>Harnessing Supported Gold Nanoparticle as a Single&#8208;Electron Transfer Catalyst for Decarboxylative Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
We found that gold nanoparticles function as single&#8208;electron transfer catalysts to promote decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling between N&#8208;hydroxy phthalimide esters and disilanes or diborons. A variety of disilanes coupled with alkyl radicals could be generated from N&#8208;hydroxy phthalimide esters via single&#8208;electron reduction by active carbon&#8208;supported gold nanoparticle catalysts to afford diverse alkylsilanes without the need for external bases. Furthermore, the present gold catalytic system was also effective for decarboxylative carbon&#8208;boron coupling to afford alkyl boronates. A detailed mechanistic investigation revealed that single&#8208;electron transfer mediated by supported gold nanoparticles enabled the generation of alkyl radical and silyl radical, thereby enabling radical cross&#8208;coupling. The reusability and environmentally&#8208;friendly nature of supported gold catalyst as well as the scalability of the reaction system enable the practical transformation of carboxylic acid derivatives into value&#8208;added organosilicon and organoboron compounds.

         <dc:description>The potential of phosphites as nucleophiles for the synthesis of chiral chromene derivatives has been overlooked in the literature. Herein, we report a promising approach via asymmetric organocatalyzed phospha&#8208;Michael addition to iminochromenes, using a bifunctional squaramide, which gives access to chromenylphosphonates, an interesting family of bioactive compounds. Our optimized protocol provides very good reactivity, affording yields of up to 95% and with chiral products exhibiting an enantiomeric excess of up to 98%.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Direct Intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H Alkylation of Saccharides and Switching of Reaction Sites by Changing Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
We developed a site&#8208;selective intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation of saccharides with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes using photocatalysis by anthraquinone and tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT). The main reaction site of anthraquinone&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation is determined by the weakness of the C&#8722;H bond. The reaction site can be switched by changing the photocatalyst to TBADT, and the site&#8208;selectivity is controlled by the steric hindrance between the bulkier TBADT photocatalyst and the substituents of the saccharides. The reaction is compatible with several electron&#8208;deficient alkenes and saccharides, and provides C&#8208;saccharides in good yields. Furthermore, the monoalkylated product was obtained in excellent yield, even on the gram scale, under TBADT photocatalysis. Applicability was demonstrated by site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation of glycosyl derivatives. The reactions proceed via a site&#8208;selective hydrogen atom transfer between the photocatalyst and saccharide, and the generated carbon radical reacts with an electron&#8208;deficient alkene to give alkylated products.

Abstract
Chiral aza&#8208;heterocycles, as a sort of key frameworks of natural products et al, are deeply concerned by synthetic chemists. In recent years, catalytic asymmetric reactions of several types of zwitterionic intermediates, originating form benzoxazinone derivatives, have become a popular and efficient approach to obtain chiral aza&#8208;heterocycles. Given that, this review attempts to summarize recent development in the field of catalytic asymmetric reactions of benzoxazinone derivatives as a powerful dipole precursors for the construction of aza&#8208;heterocycles. In the past years, various benzoxazinone derivatives and their catalytic asymmetric reactions have been developed. Herein, this review is organized by the types of benzoxazinone derivatives and their catalytic asymmetric reactions to display their important synthetic potentials and values.

         <dc:description>Mixing i&#8208;PrI and DABCO in solvent EtCN gave two quaternary ammonium salts (QASs) quantitatively, one of which is monocationic (QAS&#8208;1) and the other is dicationic (QAS&#8208;2). These QASs were found to catalyze hydrosilylation of alkynes with hydrosilanes (HAH) without the aid of metal and metalloid catalysts. This organocatalysis can be applied to a variety of alkynes: terminal/internal aryl and alkyl alkynes with/without a functional group. With dihydrosilanes (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si), the HAH occurred with high E&#8208;selectivity through syn addition, which was exclusively observed when using terminal alkyl alkynes, irrespective of a hydrosilane used. A scalable HAH is also feasible. The H&#8208;Si unit remaining in alkenylsilanes derived from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si is available for dehydrogenative alkynylation and N&#8208;heteroarylation under zinc&#8208;pyridine catalysis. This synthetic application delivers unique silicon compounds that have, for instance, alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, and alkynyl groups in a single molecule. Mechanistic studies suggested that alkynes activated by QASs irreversibly react with hydrosilanes that become more nucleophilic by the coordination of EtCN. A radical pathway is unlikely. The QAS catalysts can be recovered and reused at least 5 times.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances and Development in Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Glycosylation: An Expanding Research Area in Glycochemistry</title>

Abstract
In the last fifteen years, the development of visible&#8208;light photocatalysis, metal/photoredox dual catalysis has become the forefront as a new paradigm in organic synthesis as well as in carbohydrate chemistry. It led to the discovery of unprecedented transformations and also the improvement of known reactions under mild conditions, employing simple household light sources and bench&#8208;stable precursors, which meet the requirements of green chemistry and sustainable development in excellent yield and stereocontrol. In a general sense, the exploitation of photoredox catalysis hinges on the capability of photocatalyst or redox mediator to transform visible light into chemical energy via photo&#8208;irradiated SET (single electron transfer), PET (photoinduced electron transfer), HAT (hydrogen atom transfer), and XAT (halogen atom transfer) to potentially unlock unique reaction pathways, thereby generating a diverse array of reactive intermediates. In view of reaction type, mechanism, and status, this review will systematically summarize the latest advances in visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photocatalytic glycosylation reactions, which are driven by single or dual photoredox catalysis and by the photoactivity of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes.

         <title>Advances in Catalytic Asymmetric Construction of Quaternary Stereogenic Centers by Conjugate Addition to &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Disubstituted Nitroalkenes</title>

Abstract
Quaternary stereogenic centers are of great importance because of their prevalence in a series of bioactive natural products and pharmaceuticals. Although the catalytic asymmetric construction of these highly congested centers poses a formidable challenge, this field has been extensively explored in the past few decades, and several elegant strategies, such as the asymmetric conjugate addition to &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted nitroalkenes, have been developed. The resultant &#946;&#8208;nitro quaternary stereocenters can be conveniently transformed into the corresponding &#946;&#8208;amino quaternary stereocenters commonly found in bioactive compounds. This review summarizes the recent advances in the construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary or hetero&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via metal&#8208;catalyzed and organocatalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition to &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted nitroalkenes, focusing on the scope, applications, and mechanisms of these reactions.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective, Intramolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition of Allenes, Promoted by Visible Light Photocatalysis</title>

Abstract
Enallenylamides have been utilized for the synthesis of heterobicycle[4.2.0]octane derivatives via Ir/h&#957; promoted [2+2] cycloaddition reaction. The reaction specifically targets the distal double bond of the allene moiety, and results in the exclusive formation of the trans product. The process is conducted at room temperature and under an inert atmosphere. An extensive study on the substituent propensities during the cycloaddition step revealed variable effects. Electron&#8208;withdrawing groups conjugated with the double bond participating in the cycloaddition either hindered the process or reduced its yield. Conversely, electron&#8208;donating substituents enhanced the efficiency, resulting in product yields ranging from 60% to 88%. Our study also demonstrated the influence of protecting groups on the reaction pathway.

         <title>Modular Photochemical Flow Synthesis of Structurally Diverse Benzyne and Triazine Precursors</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Benzyne and related arynes are classical high&#8208;energy species with a rich history of widespread applications in synthesis. However, despite several synthetic routes being available to generate arynes and their precursors, none represents an ideal entry to benzyne chemistry in view of safety, scalability, and sustainability. Here we report a new photochemical flow process allowing for the generation of benzyne precursors in high yields, and throughput, with easy isolation of multigram quantities of products. This process leverages a catalyst&#8208;free photochemical rearrangement via a photoexcited nitro arene which involves a cyclic hydroxylamine intermediate that has been fully characterized. The resulting precursors were converted to benzynes via a second photochemical flow process generating heterocyclic targets upon trapping with azide and sydnone partners. Remarkably, when reacting the benzyne precursors with secondary amines, a wide range of aryl triazines is obtained in good yields via a third photo&#8208;flow transformation. This represents a modular approach to synthesize these species, that avoids the use of potentially explosive diazonium salts. Ultimately, three photochemical flow processes using a single high&#8208;power LED light source (365&#8197;nm, adjustable in&#8208;put power) are presented with manifest benefits compared to batch processing. Moreover, the functionalization of a pendent carboxyl group to form sets of biologically relevant aryl triazine&#8208;based amides highlights further applications of these unique and industrially relevant triazine entities.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Mediated Hydroperfluoroalkylation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The direct hydroperfluoroalkylation of a wide range of unactivated alkenes has been achieved at room temperature with readily available iodoperfluoroalkanes using 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcatechol as a source of hydrogen atom and triethylborane. The hydrotrifluoromethylation could also be achieved under these conditions using gaseous trifluoromethyl iodide. An experimentally simple two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot hydrotrifluoromethylation process using the easy&#8208;to&#8208;use trifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride as the source of trifluoromethyl radicals has also been developed. Using these two approaches, a broad range of substrates, including isoprenoid natural products, were efficiently derivatized.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Homoallylamines from Unactivated Imines and Allyl Bromides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed umpolung strategy for the synthesis of homoallylamines from unactivated imines and allyl bromides is described. This strategy exploited N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) as an auxiliary agent to indirectly realize the cross&#8208;coupling of imines and allyl bromides. Various sterically hindered homoallylamines were synthesized by combining photocatalysis with halogen atom transfer (XAT). Notable characteristics of this approach include water&#8208;insensitive reaction conditions, high yield (up to 99%), wide substrate scope (suitable for N&#8208;aryl/alkyl and C&#8208;aryl ketimines and aldimines, 39 examples), and high tolerance of functional groups (such as cyano, ester, amide, and thioamide).

Abstract
Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular cyclization of 2&#8208;amidoazulene derivatives, prepared by the reaction of 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;aminoazulene derivatives with perfluoroalkyl acid anhydrides, resulted in the formation of 2&#8208;perfluoroalkylazuleno[2,1&#8208;d]pyrimidin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones. Heating of these products in phosphoryl chloride led to 4&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;perfluoroalkylazuleno[2,1&#8208;d]pyrimidines. We also evaluated the reactivity of these pyrimidin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones and pyrimidine derivatives toward the electrophilic and nucleophilic substitution reactions, revealing that a variety of functional groups can be incorporated into these derivatives. The NMR studies, NICS calculations, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analyses revealed structural features including the bond&#8208;length alternation of the azuleno[2,1&#8208;d]pyrimidin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones and pyrimidine derivatives.

Abstract
A general method for the functionalization of 4a&#8208;aza&#8208;8a&#8208;boranaphthalene in the position &#946; to the nitrogen atom has been developed. This method is based on a regioselective iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation process for the introduction of a boronate group, which can subsequently be transformed into a variety of aryl or alkynyl groups via cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Selective mono&#8208; or difunctionalization can be achieved by controlling the reaction conditions during the borylation step. The photophysical properties of the obtained 3&#8208; or 3,6&#8208;substituted BN&#8208;naphthalenes have been evaluated, and some of them have been found to be significantly fluorescent, with fluorescence quantum yields up to 0.85.
