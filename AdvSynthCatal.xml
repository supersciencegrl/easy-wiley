         <title>Direct Site&#8208;Selective Difunctionalization of Pyrazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
This study presents a protocol for the direct site&#8208;selective difunctionalization of pyrazoles under mild reaction conditions. This protocol showcase a notable site&#8208;selectivity and encompasses a wide substrate scope. Detailed mechanistic investigations elucidate the dual role of the sulfonium salt acting both as the reaction substrate and acid donor, thereby effectively catalyzing the reaction. The demonstrated one&#8208;pot synthesis, scale&#8208;up reaction and subsequent product modifications can assist in advancing the potential application of this protocol in organic synthesis and its associated domains.

         <title>Synthesis and Organo&#8208;Catalyzed Ring&#8208;Opening of a Six&#8208;Membered Heterocycle Combining Phosphonate and Ester Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The synthesis of a difunctional P&#8208;heterocycle combining phosphonate and ester moieties in a six&#8208;membered ring is described. Using trifluoromethane sulfonic acid HOTf as organocatalyst, ring&#8208;opening with neopentyl alcohol readily occurs with complete selectivity for O&#8208;acyl bond cleavage. In turn, ring&#8208;opening polymerization proceeds in a controlled manner when an excess of P&#8208;heterocycle is used. Copolymerization with &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone is also reported and semi&#8208;batch conditions are shown to enable regular incorporation of the phosphonate moieties along the polymer chains.

         <title>Visible&#8208;light Catalysed Trifluoromethylthiolation and Related Dearomative Spirocyclizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We conceptualized an efficient radical cyclization approach for the synthesis of SCF3, SAr, SO2Ar and COAr featured spirocyclic [4.5] and [5.5] trienone between biaryls and ArSO2H or ArCOCO2H in presence of RFTA as a photocatalyst whereas ArSSAr or AgSCF3 devoid of photocatalyst via an energetically demanding dearomative transformation under visible&#8208;light catalysis. 	The unprecedented photo&#8208;excited charge transfer complex with biaryl tethered ynones provides a way to promote S&#8208;centered radical generation followed by its insertion to enable a wide range of biologically important molecules.

Abstract
Thanks to an unprecedented gem&#8208;dialkyl substituent effect, an efficient synthesis of tetrahydro oxepine derivatives is achieved by ring expansion of vinyl oxetanes using acceptor(&#8722;acceptor) diazo reagents under Cu(II)&#8208;catalysis. A large scope of 2&#8208;vinyl oxetanes and either diazo mono or diester reagents give access to a series of functionalized oxepines.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Organocatalysis Enabled Photocatalytic Intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The combination of organocatalytic activation and photocatalysis for enabling the intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of enone&#8208;ene substrates bearing one Lewis base binding site is reported. While in a variety of solvents a poor conversion or no reaction takes place in the absence of a hydrogen bonding catalyst, the corresponding ring&#8208;fused cyclobutane products could be built in moderate to good yields using a synergistic dual iridium&#8208;urea co&#8208;catalytic system. Control and mechanistic studies supported the postulated interaction between the organocatalyst and the substrate, which proved essential for an efficient energy transfer from the photosensitizer.

Abstract
We report herein a chiral CpXRh(III)&#8208;catalyzed domino cyclization/C3&#8208;arylation process using 2&#8208;alkynylanilines and 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones as viable substrates, delivering indole&#8208;based derivatives endowed with axial chirality. The method features high enantioselectivity, broad substrate scope, and robust functional group tolerance. Subsequent functionalization of the synthesized scaffolds underlines the practicality of this approach in the design of indole&#8208;derivated axially chiral frameworks, demonstrating its substantial promise in synthetic and medicinal chemistry applications.

         <title>Enantioselective Flow Synthesis of a Tetrahydroquinoline SERM Enabled by Immobilized Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalysis and Diboronic Acid Mediated Selective Nitro Reduction</title>

Abstract
An asymmetric enantioselective flow process is reported for the formal synthesis of a 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline selective estrogen receptor modulator. Starting from an easily available 2&#8208;nitrochalcone, the first part of the process comprised a telescoped nitro reduction/intramolecular cyclocondensation sequence using diboronic acid as a simple reductant. Subsequent enantioselective transfer hydrogenation in the presence of an immobilized phosphoric acid organocatalyst followed by telescoped N&#8208;alkylation furnished the targeted chiral intermediate. The approach ensures flexibility regarding the scale of the synthesis, whilst minimizing the need for intermediate purifications and ensuring environmentally benign metal&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Electronic and Steric Effects in a Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Activation Reaction of 1&#8208;Bromoalkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The functional group compatibility of our recently disclosed gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1&#8208;bromoalkynes is studied in detail. Two main features are addressed, the minimum distances at which polar functional groups are tolerated and the influence of both electronic and steric effects on the performance of aryl ether derivatives. Moreover, robustness assessment experiments have been carried out shedding light on the factors dictating functional group tolerance. In addition, the reaction has been applied to the synthesis of a key intermediate in the total synthesis of a natural product and a heterobifunctional molecule. DFT calculations have shed light on the mechanistic features behind the observed reactivity trends. On one hand, the destabilization of the TS by the proximity of the polar group may hamper the reactivity for proximal functional groups. On the other hand, some polar functional groups are not tolerated regardless of their position due to the preferential coordination of gold to the oxygen atom over the alkyne, resulting presumably in competitive catalyst deactivation pathways.

         <title>A Silica&#8208;Supported Yttrium Triflate Packed Bed Reactor for Continuous Flow Michael Addition of Indoles to Benzylidene Malonates</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
The catalytic properties of packed bed reactors filled with Y(OTf)3 immobilised onto functionalised silica have been tested in the Michael addition of indoles to benzylidene malonates under flow conditions, providing improved productivity over the batch conditions, a greater ease of recovery of the final products and a prolonged life of the catalyst. Noteworthy, the same catalytic reactor, after being used for five days, was employed to perform a different reaction, a stereoselective Diels Alder cycloaddition in flow, with a 24&#8197;times higher productivity compared to the in&#8208;batch reaction.

         <title>FeCl3/KI&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Oxidative Cyclization for Switchable Total Synthesis of Luotonin A, B and Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A total synthesis strategy was developed for the synthesis of luotonin A, B and their analogues using synergistic FeCl3/KI&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization. This protocol utilizes cheap and widely available N&#8208;propargyl 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;quinazolinones and arylamines under mild conditions, and it has a wide substrate scope and high atom economy. Different natural products (luotonin A, B and derivatives) can be synthesized via a unique switchable approach. Further transformations from luotonin B to luotonin E and structural modification of natural products demonstrate the potential applications of this method. Moreover, camptothecin can also be modified with the reported protocol to afford the hydroxyl&#8208;substituted product.

         <title>Weak&#8208;Chelation Assisted Regioselective Indole C(4)&#8208;Alkynylation via Six&#8208;Membered Cobaltacycle Intermediate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein a regioselective indole C4&#8208;alkynylation has been uncovered utilizing an earth&#8208;abundant cobalt(III)&#8208;catalyst. For this process, (bromoethynyl)benzene was used as an alkynylating agent. Also, after screening various amide&#8208;protected chelating groups we found dimethyl&#8208;amide is optimal for the in&#8208;situ generation of cobaltacycle intermediate. The six&#8208;membered cobaltacycle intermediate has been detected through high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry HRMS, which is a key intermediate for this conversion. Further, mechanistic studies were performed such as KIE experiments, and reactions with radical scavengers, and based on the results a plausible mechanism has been proposed. Moreover, to show the application of this methodology, the product has been oxidized to diketone, monoketone, alkene, alkane and further derivatized to a tricycle indole derivative, which is a core structure of many natural products.

         <title>Engineered Immobilised Organocatalysts for the Synthesis of Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The art of tuning functional polymeric materials through the covalent incorporation of organocatalysts lies at the core of creating asymmetric immobilized chiral catalysts that mimic the enzymatic action. Herein, we explore diverse synthetic techniques to immobilize l&#8208;proline&#8208;derived N&#8208;carbonyl amides on functional polymeric matrices, transforming them into chiral Lewis bases for facilitating the asymmetric reduction of ketimines with HSiCl3. A comprehensive examination of the design factors, encompassing linker selection, anions, and polymeric support characteristics, enables precise adjustment of steric and electronic features in these immobilized catalysts. This approach establishes structure&#8208;performance relationships, ultimately enabling the development of an engineered immobilized organocatalytic system that meets the desired criteria for activity, stability, and selectivity.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Pyridination of Benzylic and Allylic C&#8213;H bonds via Radical&#8208;Radical Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of site&#8208;selective radical reaction is a long&#8208;standing challenge in synthetic chemistry. One important advance in this area has been the Minisci&#8208;type reaction, which has proven to be a powerful tool for functionalizing medicinally&#8208;relevant heterocycles by allowing nucleophilic carbon radicals to add to heteroarenes. Herein, we report a modular photocatalytic platform for the site&#8208;selective pyridination of saturated hydrocarbon compounds employing organic photoredox catalysis to forge new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. The site&#8208;selective C&#8213;H pyridination could successfully couple benzylic/allylic C&#8213;H bonds with pyridylphosphonium salts, which installed directly and regioselectively from C&#8213;H heteroarenes through a radical&#8208;radical cross coupling mechanism. This synthetic methodology could tolerance a variety of functional groups, complex heteroarenes, even late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals selectively and efficiently.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroformylation of Alkynyl Sulfides: A Stereo&#8208; and Regioselective Route to &#945;&#8208;Sulfenyl Acroleins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation of alkynyl sulfides under mild conditions is described. The method gives access to &#945;&#8208;sulfenyl acroleins with good regioselectivities (ratio &#945;/&#946; up to 89/11) and is applicable to variously substituted substrates. It is effective even on more complex substrates, such as cysteine and cholesterol derivatives. To demonstrate the synthetic potential of the obtained products, (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;cyclohexyl&#8208;2&#8208;methylsulfenyl acrolein was selected as an example and its sulfur atom selectively oxidized to the corresponding sulfoxide or sulfone. Acid&#8208;promoted (Z) to (E) isomerization of the double bond occurred during oxidation. The three obtained sulfenyl&#8208;, sulfinyl&#8208;, and sulfonyl&#8208;functionalized acroleins have been then used as dienophiles to access cyclohexene carbaldehydes.</dc:description>

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted cascade difluoromethylation/cyclization reaction to access various difluoromethylated pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indolediones was developed using difluoromethyltriphenylphosphonium bromide salt as the difluoromethylating reagent. A possible radical mechanism has been investigated and proven as a	single electron transfer (SET) procedure.

Abstract
Lewis base dependent (3+3) and (4+2) annulations of &#946;&#8242;&#8208;acetoxy allenoates with N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines offer m&#8208;teraryl and fused dihydropyridines with varying substituents depending on the tertiary amine as well as subtle changes in the reaction conditions. The triazabicyclodecene (TBD)&#8208;catalyzed (3+3) annulation involves 1,2&#8208;elimination followed by 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization as key steps in delivering fused 1,4&#8208;hydropyridines. The same reactants under DMAP catalysis offer m&#8208;teraryl via Mannich coupling, rather than 1,2&#8208;elimination followed by C&#8722;N bond cleavage/aromatization. Key intermediates have been identified by HRMS studies.

Abstract
Two Ru(II)&#8208;catalytic systems were developed for anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselective hydroacyloxylations of terminal alkynes to vinylic esters. [Ru(NCCH3)6][(BF4)2] favors (E)&#8208;vinylic ester products with arylacetylenes and select carboxylic acids, whereas a Ru scorpionate complex with two electron&#8208;withdrawing ligands favors (Z)&#8208;vinylic ester isomers.

         <title>A Mechanistic Insight on CuI&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Oxazolidinones through a Four&#8208;Component Reaction</title>

Abstract
In this contribution, we describe a straightforward and efficient synthesis of oxazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones through a Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component coupling of amines, aldehydes, terminal alkynes, and CO2 via carboxylative cyclization of propargylamine intermediates. This strategy enables the selective synthesis of a variety of (Z)&#8208;5&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;oxazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones substituted in positions 3, 4 and 5 of the heterocyclic core with a variety of functional groups, well&#8208;tolerated in terms of scope. A mechanistic study was carried out monitoring the process in solution by different techniques (operando FTIR, multi&#8208;nuclear NMR), with the aim of identifying the intermediates, both organic compounds and Cu(I) coordination complexes, which showed the plausible multi&#8208;metallic nature of the catalytic intermediates (identified by X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses on monocrystal).

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Gas Triphasic Hydrogenation of Bicarbonate to Formate in a Continuous Flow Tubular Reactor</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Multiphasic reaction of bicarbonate hydrogenation to form formate using homogeneous Ru PNP pincer catalyst in a continuous flow tubular reactor is reported. The reaction system consists of three phases. Catalyst is dissolved in toluene while potassium bicarbonate is dissolved in water. The significance of efficient mixing among the organic phase, aqueous phase and gaseous hydrogen to improve hydrogenation reaction by using different inert packing materials is studied by operando visualization and also quantitatively discussed. The bicarbonate conversion of up to 67% is achieved after optimization of important reaction and reactor parameters. The designed reactor setup comprised of effective recycling system that recycles the catalyst with &gt;99% activity.

         <title>Expanding the Synthetic Toolbox: Discovery of a Robust Aldehyde Dehydrogenase for Integrated Chemocatalysis and Enzyme Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Chemobiocatalysis has recently emerged as a promising tool in organic synthesis; nonetheless, chemobiocatalytic transformations remain challenging due to the incompatibility between the two types of catalysts. Many enzymes, especially aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs), are readily inactivated under the chemocatalytic conditions. Herein, we present a robust NADP+&#8208;dependent p&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaHBDH) for integrated chemocatalysis and enzyme catalysis. Apart from good activities toward a number of aromatic aldehydes, PaHBDH showed excellent thermal and storage stability in the absence of any stabilizer, but was also highly tolerant toward various organic solvents. The usefulness of PaHBDH in integrated catalysis was demonstrated by the synthesis of a group of aromatic carboxylic acids in good yields by combining with photo&#8208;/electrochemical NADP+ regeneration. The photoenzymatic approach was further extended by integrating with a chemo(bio)catalytic cascade in one pot to allow for the conversion of furfural into value&#8208;added C4 chemicals. The finding of this work may expand the synthetic toolbox for integrated catalysis.

Abstract
In this study, a synthetic method to access benzo[4,5]imidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines is developed by the reaction of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromoaryl)benzimidazoles with 1,3&#8208;diketones under basic conditions. A reaction pathway involving the initial formation of a C&#8722;C coupled intermediate by nucleophilic aromatic substitution and subsequent deacylative cyclocondensation is proposed for this process.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, a synthetic method to access benzo[4,5]imidazo[2,1-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]isoquinolines is developed by the reaction of 2-(2-bromoaryl)benzimidazoles with 1,3-diketones under basic conditions. A reaction pathway involving the initial formation of a C&#8722;C coupled intermediate by nucleophilic aromatic substitution and subsequent deacylative cyclocondensation is proposed for this process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative annulation of 2&#8208;alkenylanilines with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl diazoester or diazoketones is described. The reaction has broad substrate scope, affording a range of gem&#8208;difluorocyclobutane&#8208;fused indolines in moderate to good yields with cis&#8208;configuration. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the reaction proceeds through a sequential N&#8722;H insertion/C&#8722;F bond cleavage/[2+2] cycloadditon process. &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazo reagents serve as gem&#8208;difluorinated C2 subunits by cleaving one C&#8722;F bond.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal catalysis employing disilanes and silylboranes for synthesizing organosilanes circumvents the limitations of conventional hydrosilylations. While disilanes require special conditions, silylboranes have yet to be developed as TMS sources. Functional group compatibility renders silylzinc reagents desirable; however, their development is hindered by their synthesis using pyrophoric silyllithium and dissolved lithium salts. Our solid Me3SiZnI circumvents these limitations and herein, we demonstrate its significance in the cross&#8208;coupling of aryl and alkyl bromides.</dc:description>

Abstract
This research presents a method for the oxidative selenylation and thiolylation of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman adducts through constant&#8208;current electrolysis in an undivided cell at room temperature. The reaction enables direct production of trisubstituted (Z)&#8208;allyl aryl selenides and sulfides with yields of 27&#8211;98%. A wide variety of different functionalities are well tolerated under these reaction conditions. This strategy could be carried out on gram scale and several synthetic transformations were accomplished for the construction of other allyl selenide derivatives. Control experiments and mechanistic studies indicate a radical or an ionic addition pathway for this electrochemical transformation.

         <title>B(C6F5)3&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Allylation of Hydrazines with Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An N&#8208;allylation of monosubstituted acyl hydrazines with allylic alcohols has been developed by using B(C6F5)3 catalysis. This protocol allows for convenient access to various synthetically useful N&#8208;allylated hydrazine products in 48&#8211;96% yields with broad substrate scope and wide functional group compatibility. The operationally simple reaction proceeds without calling for stringent removal of air and moisture, and can be readily scaled up to gram scale. Preliminary mechanistic studies support the generation of an allylic carbon cation that is involved in the catalytic cycle, and the reaction proceeds via the in&#8197;situ formation of diallyl ethers as intermediates.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study describes the palladium&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective amination of chloro(hetero)aryl triflates in the C&#8722;Cl bond for the first time. A newly designed and synthesized alkyl&#8208;pyrazole&#8208;based phosphine ligand, &lt;b&gt;L26&lt;/b&gt; (BirdPhos), which is featured with the pyrazole ligand core and the cyclohexyl group at the C3 and C5 positions, was key to the success of this reaction. A variety of chloro(hetero)aryl triflates coupled with aromatic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic amines smoothly afforded the corresponding products up to 97% yields with general chemoselectivity (&gt;99%) in the C&#8722;Cl bond. Drug analogs were also synthesized via the chemoselective intermolecular amination. This study attempts to investigate the structure&#8208;activity relationship of this new class of ligand through experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate the application of chiral magnesium complexes in an asymmetric carbon&#8208;sulfur bond&#8208;forming reaction. Enantioselective and cost&#8208;effective methodology under mild condition for the thia&#8208;Michael addition, utilizing an in situ generated chiral dinuclear magnesium&#8208;ProPhenol complex, has been developed. The versatility of this protocol is demonstrated with a broad range of thiol nucleophiles and a wide selection of enones. Enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;ketosulfides are obtained in good to excellent yields and moderate to excellent enantioselectivity. The presented catalytic system exhibits excellent tolerance for structurally different substrates while maintaining high enantioselectivity. This observation aligns with proposed mechanism, wherein the sulfur atom coordinates to the catalyst in close proximity to the reaction center.</dc:description>

The NHC&#8208;mediated transformation involves the reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes with suitable substituted benzothiazinone derivatives. This process encompasses the initial formation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acylazoliums from ynals and concurrent generation of enolates from benzothiazinone. The culmination of these reactions results in an efficient annulation, yielding the desired products with reasonable yields and high stereoselectivities. This study underscores the potential of NHC catalysis in the streamlined synthesis of complex heterocyclic structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective (4+2) Annulation of Cyclopropane Carbaldehydes with 2&#8208;Mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;Arylethanones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report the organocatalytic enantioselective synthesis of dihydrothiopyran derivatives from trans racemic donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane carbaldehydes (DACCs) and 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;arylethanone via formal thio (4+2) cycloaddition involving thia&#8208;Michael aldol condensation and annulation. Mechanistic studies indicate a typical kinetic resolution (KR) is involved in this transformation, which results in moderate yields and enantiomeric ratios. Remarkably, this method is characterized by its one&#8208;pot simplicity, mild reaction conditions, and resilience towards air and moisture interference.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalytic domino reaction involving cyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione&#8208;derived enaminones, 5&#8208;alkenyl rhodanines, and haloalkanes has been developed. This protocol produces a wide range of 3&#8208;thioquinoline&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones in yields of 52&#8211;81%. The construction of a C&#8722;S bond at the C&#8208;3 position of the quinoline&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione framework expands its structural diversity. Studies into the reaction mechanism revealed that the reaction undergoes a conjugate addition, ammonolysis, elimination, and nucleophilic substitution sequence. The synthetic potential of the reaction was demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale syntheses of representative products. Chloroalkyl chains were installed on the sulfur atoms of most products obtained in this reaction. Diversified product derivatives were obtained by exploiting the favorable leaving nature of chloride moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Reaction of 2&#8208;Styrylbenzaldehydes with Indoles in the Synthesis of 1H&#8208;Indenes via 4&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization</title>

         <dc:description>A cascade reaction between 2&#8208;styrylbenzaldehydes and indoles has been developed for the synthesis of 1H&#8208;indenes. An iodine&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic addition of indoles to an aldehyde group of 2&#8208;styrylbenzaldehydes leads to the formation of carbocation intermediates that undergo 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization to give indenes with a trisubstituted double bond. These indenes are transformed into thermodynamically more stable products with a fully substituted double bond under the reaction conditions. Minor quantities of indolylbenzo[b]carbazoles are also produced as by&#8208;products.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Cyclization Reactions of 1,6&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elaborated molecular architectures, specifically those bearing one or more carbon stereocenters, stand as an important class of carbocyclic and heterocyclic frameworks because they are frequently occurring core structures in numerous natural products and biologically active pharmaceutical molecules. Over the past few decades, the development of novel and versatile synthetic approaches via cascade cyclization reactions of 1,6&#8208;enynes for the construction of a series of fused and spiro compounds has been the focus of a great deal of research initiatives. These synthesis strategies are peculiarly fascinating in the context of the assembly of a wide array of pharmaceutical molecules, natural products, agrochemicals, and functional materials. In this review, recent developments in the transformations of 1,6&#8208;enynes with diverse coupling reagents are summarized since 2018, which could be divided into five categories: 1) Introduction; 2) Transition metal catalyzed cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes; 3) Metal&#8208;free cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes; 4) Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes; 5) Electrocatalytic cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed &#947;&#8208;Arylation of Acylketene Synthons with Aryl Chlorides Enabled by Ylide&#8208;Functionalized Phosphines (YPhos)</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalyst system based on palladium 2&#8208;methylnaphthyl complexes bearing ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines (YPhos) was found to enable the selective &#947;&#8208;arylation of 1,3&#8208;dioxinone derivatives with diversely functionalized aryl, heteroaryl, and vinyl chlorides. The products were further converted into 1,3&#8208;diketones and heterocycles, highlighting their function as synthetic hubs. Experimental and computational studies revealed that bulky, electron&#8208;rich YPhos ligands are uniquely effective because they enable the oxidative addition of aryl chlorides at room temperature while at the same time efficiently promoting the rate&#8208;limiting reductive elimination step of the thermally sensitive enolates.</dc:description>

Abstract
We report an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution protocol for the one&#8208;pot asymmetric synthesis of substituted purine derivatives. The controllable N&#8208;9/N&#8208;7 substitution, which posed formidable challenges in organic synthesis, could be accomplished by choosing different types of enzymes as catalysts. This method was proved scalable and was used to prepare a series of prodrugs of medicinally active acids. In addition, the recyclability test of the biocatalysts indicated the potential of this strategy for applications in the pharmaceutical industry.

         <title>Shifting Access from Pyrimidine&#8208;Spirofused to Fused Benzoheterocycles by Modifying the Activated Group Position</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of pyrimidine&#8208;spirofused indolines from 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes with 2&#8208;sulfonyliminoindolines has been achieved under catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions, in which five atoms of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes were introduced to the spiro&#8208;annulation products via a (5 + 1) pathway. Subsequently, this strategy was extended to 3&#8208;aminoindoles and 3&#8208;aminobenzothiophenes, but a different reaction pathway (3 + 3) was observed. In these cases, three&#8208;atoms of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes were incorporated into pyrimidine&#8208;fused indoles/benzothiophenes. These two transformations demonstrate the potential and versatility of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes to construct nitrogen&#8208;heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. The chemical and reaction spaces are incredibly vast and special procedures are required to study them. Their complex and multiparametric nature encompass myriads of compounds and interactions and endless modifications involving the distinct impact of relevant variables (temperature, solvent, stoichiometry, etc.). This often calls for the design, collection, and analysis / interpretation of large datasets. Reaction charting, the systematic scanning, description, analysis, and guided modifications of a given process, stands as the most promising approach. It offers fast and accurate solutions as well as expanding the knowledge about the systems. This deeper understanding enables reliable predictions, improvement of the productivity (yields, scope), eventually leading to sustainable, economic, and safe applications. The present review introduces the topic, analyzing selected examples and recent advancements in different organic chemistry&#8208;related fields. The covered methodologies range from classical experimentation modifying one factor at a time, to Design of Experiments and more modern computational approaches involving Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. In this way, the impact of charting in process development, biological and medicinal chemistry, catalysis, reaction discovery and computational methods is accounted. Finally, the conclusion / outlook section gives a general appraisal and a prospect on the future implementation of the methodology. 	1.	Introduction

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Pd&#8208;catalyzed vinylation reactions of aryl iodides using 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane is developed for the synthesis of styrenes and stilbenes.  In these reactions, vinyl bromide is generated from 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane and then undergoes reductive cross&#8208;coupling with aryl iodides, affording styrene products. Under slightly modified reaction conditions, styrenes can continue reacting with vinyl bromide to form &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;stilbenes, which provides a one&#8208;pot synthetic method for stilbenes. Alcohols, including iso&#8208;propanol and methanol, are employed as the reductant in these reductive cross&#8208;coupling reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Use of 2&#8208;Aminobenzyl Alcohols in the Synthesis of Quinolines, Quinazolines and Other N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
A class of 3&#8208;(azidomethyl)&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine has been obtained through a copper&#8208;catalyzed diazidation of allenes and a subsequent azirination involving vinyl azides. A variety of functional groups in the allenes are well tolerated, providing a series of 3&#8208;(azidomethyl)&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine motifs in 51%&#8208;93% yields (26 examples).

         <title>Regioselective 1,2&#8208;Dicarbofunctionalization of Silylated 1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;regioselective dicarbofunctionalization of silylated 1,3&#8208;dienes with functionalized solid organozinc pivalates and alkyl bromides is disclosed, thus affording the alkylarylated and dialkylated silanes in a regioselective manifold. Herein, regioselectivity is steered by steric hindrance of the bulky silyl groups, which could prohibit the formation of the flexible &#960;&#8208;allylcobalt intermediate. Furthermore, derivatizations of the resulting products and modifications of bioactive molecules demonstrate the synthetical utility of our method.

Abstract
We report a strategy for stereoselective O&#8208;aryl&#8208;glycoside synthesis by copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of a variety of anomeric sugars and (hetero)aromatic iodides. Stereocontrol of the &#945;/&#946; selectivity can be successfully realized by slight structural modifications of the oxalic diamide ligands. Mechanistic studies indicated a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) reaction mechanism controlled by the ligand structures. This reaction could be performed on gram scale, and has also been applied to the synthesis of some natural products.

         <title>Organocatalytic Stereoselective Decarboxylative Addition of &#945;&#8208;Amido Malonic Acid Half Oxyesters to Isatins</title>

Abstract
The stereoselective reaction of &#945;&#8208;amido&#8208;substituted malonic acid half oxyesters (&#945;&#8208;amido&#8208;MAHOs) with isatins was developed. A cinchona alkaloid thiourea catalyst gave products bearing a tetrasubstituted stereogenic centre in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (75&#8211;99% yield, 83:17&#8211;97:3 dr, 92:8&#8211;99:1 er). The obtained products can be converted into some chiral compounds without loss of enantiopurity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to clarify the origin of stereoselectivities, and suggested that the first stereogenic centre is set in the decarboxylation, the second in the protonation.

Abstract
This study details an aluminum&#8208;catalyzed regioselective isomerization of 2,2&#8208;disubstituted oxetanes to yield homoallylic alcohols. The reaction takes place in toluene at 40&#8201;&#176;C, employing 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of Al(C6F5)3 as catalyst. This catalytic system shows a wide substrate scope (12 examples). The optimized conditions are especially useful for electron&#8208;rich aryl oxetanes, completely suppressing the formation of allyl isomers and reducing the amount of the dimer by&#8208;product. The synthetic applicability of the reported methodology is demonstrated by the enantioselective formal synthesis of curcuquinone and the &#963;1 receptor agonist RC&#8208;33.

Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H acyloxylation of 2&#8208;aroyl pyridine derivatives with simple sodium carboxylate utilizing transformable directing groups is described. This protocol features broad functional group tolerance and chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectivity, providing the acyloxylation products in 45%&#8208;84%yield. Furthermore, the synthetic utility of this protocol was demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical compounds.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H acyloxylation of 2-aroyl pyridine derivatives with simple sodium carboxylate utilizing transformable directing groups is described. This protocol features broad functional group tolerance and chemo- and regio-selectivity, providing the acyloxylation products in 45%-84%yield. Furthermore, the synthetic utility of this protocol was demonstrated by the late-stage functionalization of pharmaceutical compounds. Notably, the acyloxylation products could be further transformed into a variety of useful heterocycles under mild conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Continuous Manufacturing of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients: Current Trends and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The pharmaceutical industry has traditionally employed batch processing as a means of synthesizing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) on a commercial scale. Batch manufacturing enables API synthesis in large quantities in order to meet regulations. Yet, this strategy remains cumbersome, is labor&#8208;intensive, and creates complex logistical networks. In recent decades, batch API processing has gradually eroded American economic competitiveness and has led to the offshoring of API manufacturing from the United States. Today it is estimated that +80% of APIs are manufactured overseas.[1] Meanwhile, disruptions from the Coronavirus Disease (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) have exacerbated weaknesses in the global supply chain, culminating with widespread shortages of critical life&#8208;saving drugs.[2] These shortages have emphasized the importance of reshoring drug manufacturing to the U.S. and fostered a regulatory landscape that seeks advanced methods of API manufacturing in order to bolster America's supply chain resiliency.[3] Recently, increased attention has been directed towards continuous drug manufacturing to enable nonstop API production within modular stand&#8208;alone flow systems. Continuous manufacturing (CM) facilitates modular automation, offers new avenues towards process intensification, and even enables in&#8208;line analytical monitoring from raw materials to packaged products. This strategy offers better conversion, increased safety, reduced waste, and overall cost savings versus traditional batch&#8208;style processing. The rise of advanced API manufacturing, coupled with the current regulatory landscape, offers a rare window of opportunity to convert traditional batch pharmaceutical processes into continuous, streamlined production systems to on&#8208;shore API manufacturing and eliminate drug shortages. This review will outline the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the CM of APIs and will highlight the translation of chemistry and unit operations from batch processes to modular CM systems.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Vinyl Triflates and 1,4&#8208;Dicyanobenzene to Access Alkenyl Nitriles</title>

Abstract
We report a vinyl cyanation reaction of vinyl triflates and readily available 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene through a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling process. The reaction is operated under mild conditions with remarkable functional&#8208;group compatibility. Cyclic vinyl triflates with various ring sizes and substituents at different positions all reacted smoothly. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by the derivatization of pharmaceutical and natural compounds, a scale&#8208;up synthesis, and various functional group transformations. Preliminary mechanistic studies demonstrate that vinyl triflates are more reactive than 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene towards the oxidative addition to nickel catalyst.

         <title>Regioselective Reductive Elimination from Bismuth(V) Compounds for Aryl Transfer to Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We demonstrate that regioselective aryl transfer to the nucleophile occurs rapidly under mild conditions via reductive elimination and show that regioselectivity is primarily governed by steric factors imparted by ortho substituents on the recipient ring. Computational modeling and x&#8208;ray crystallography confirm that the recipient aryl ring is positioned in the equatorial coordination site and oriented orthogonally to the axial X&#8722;Bi&#8722;Ph bond (X=nucleophile) in a trigonal bipyramidal structure. The orientation of the ortho&#8208;substituted aryl ring allows the appropriate orbital to overlap between its ipso carbon and nucleophile, which enhances the rate of aryl transfer to the nucleophile and dictates the regioselective reductive elimination from Bi(V) compounds. This level of stereoelectronic control results in significantly enhanced reaction rate and selectivity and creates an opportunity to rationally design ligand systems for selective aryl transfer reactions.

         <title>Ru(II) Catalyzed Oxidative Dehydrogenative Annulation and Spirocyclization of Isoquinolones with N&#8208;Substituted Maleimides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A Ruthenium(II) catalyzed additive&#8208;free oxidative, dehydrogenative annulation of different malemides on 3,4&#8208;disubstituted isoquinolone to afford fused and spiro&#8208;cyclized isoquinolo&#8208;isoquinolone and isoindolo&#8208;isoquinolone derivatives is reported here. By simply changing solvent and oxidizing agents, under two different conditions, this methodology produced two different poly&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclized products. Isoquinolone&#8208;NH was strategically used as the internal directing group in the ortho C&#8722;H activation using Ru(II) catalyst. Mechanistically dehydrogenative, oxidative C&#8722;C followed by C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling and aza&#8208;michael reaction pathway led to the corresponding fused and spiro&#8208;products respectively. A diversified library of eighty&#8208;one (81) such two products were synthesized by employing this methodology. The fused and the spirocyclized polyheterocyclic compounds absorbed at &#955;max 240&#8211;270&#8197;nm range, however only spiro&#8208;compounds produced blue fluorescence at &#955;em 391&#8211;450&#8197;nm range.

         <title>Aryl Ketone&#8208;Catalyzed Light&#8208;Driven Radical Oxy&#8208;Functionalization of Non&#8208;Acidic C(sp3)&#8211;H Bonds Enabled by Triple Role of TEMPO</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A light&#8208;driven radical oxy&#8208;functionalization of non&#8208;acidic aliphatic and benzylic C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds was achieved with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) in a single&#8208;step by employing an aryl ketone as a sole catalyst.  The transformation was initiated by homolysis of a C(sp3)&#8211;H bond in starting substance by the photo&#8208;excited aryl ketone.  The derived carbon radical was then promptly trapped by TEMPO leading to the formation of the TEMPO&#8208;adduct.  The derived TEMPO&#8208;adduct is synthetically versatile as an alcohol equivalent since it can be readily converted to the corresponding ketone by oxidation and to the corresponding alcohol by reduction.  The key to realizing the present catalytic reaction relies on the distinctive triple role of TEMPO, which acts as the precursor of the oxygen functionality, the oxidant to regenerate the aryl ketone, and the protective group for the derived TEMPO&#8208;adduct from over&#8208;oxidation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An organocatalytic remote stereocontrolled 1,8&#8208;conjugated addition of in situ formed propargylic aza&#8208;p&#8208;quinone methides from &#945;&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl) propargylic alcohols and indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates was developed, affording axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes in 62&#8208;99% yield with 52&#8208;99% ee.

         <dc:description>The prospect of developing methods to control the reactivity of metal(oxo) holds appeal for both synthetic and bioinorganic chemistry. In this study, we observed that carboxylic acids enhance reactivity in C&#8211;H oxidation by forming hydrogen bonds with the oxo ligand, thereby increasing the basicity and electrophilicity of the oxo intermediate. Additionally, we discovered that H&#8208;dicarboxylate ligands, such as oxalate, malonate, and maleate, significantly improve the catalyst turnover frequency (up to 760/h) in unactivated C(sp3)&#8211;H oxidation. Furthermore, the addition of maleic acid was also found to activate Fe and Mn(pdp)&#8208;catalysed C&#8211;H oxygenation. Notably, Ru(bpga)(H&#8208;maleate)2 3&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization exhibited a broad functional group tolerance, including bromine, hydroxyl, benzoate, nitro, nitryl, sulfonate, imide, sulfonylamide, and carbamate, yielding up to 98% in a site&#8208; and chemoselective manner with only 0.1&#8208;2.0 mmol% loading.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrosonium ion catalyzed oxidative bromination of arenes.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A nitrosonium catalyzed bromination of electron&#8208;rich arenes has been developed, using bromide salts as bromine sources, oxygen gas as a terminal oxidant and Br&#248;nsted acids (sulfuric acid, TFA or HBr). This arene bromination process is free of transition metals, proceeding in acetic acid and under mild temperatures (25&#8208;50 &#176;C) to give brominated arenes with good to excellent yields. Our mechanistic studies indicated that this oxidative bromination of arenes reaction is catalyzed by nitrosnium ion (NO+), without the involvement of Br2 or Br+. The kinetic isotope effect of this reaction was measured using pentadeuteriophenyl phenyl ether (kH/kD = 1.1).</dc:description>

         <title>Borylated Cyclopentanes via Atom Transfer Radical [3+2] Annulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. An atom transfer radical [3+2] annulation (ATRAn) reaction involving alkenyl boronic esters and homoallylic iodides provides a rapid access to polysubstituted borylated cyclopentanes. A variety of &#945;&#8208;substituted vinylboronic esters are suitable substrates and offer unique opportunities for further modification of the formed 5&#8208;membered ring. For instance, the oxidation of the boronic ester to an alcohol allows the preparation of products that corresponds to an annulation involving the enol form of acetone. Substitution of the iodide by a nucleophile such as lithium methoxide without modifying the boronic ester moiety is also feasible. Finally, by using a (3&#8208;acetoxyprop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;yl)boronic ester, a facile 1,2&#8208;elimination reaction provided a methylenecyclopentane. In this case, the alkenylboronate radical trap acts as an equivalent to allene, a building block so far elusive for preparative radical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Intramolecular Coupling of Primary/Secondary Alcohols with Secondary Alcohols for Macrocyclic Alkenylation Using Ni&#8208;Zeolite Catalyst Under Continuous&#8208;Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the direct intramolecular coupling of primary and secondary alcohols for the selective synthesis of macrocyclic olefins in the presence of Ni&#8208;zeolite catalyst under continuous flow. This reaction proceeds via dehydration of secondary alcohols to alkenes, which subsequently undergo intramolecular dehydrative coupling reaction with a primary alcohol to obtain moderate yields of macrocyclic olefins. This reaction is also effective for the coupling of secondary&#8208;secondary alcohols and alkene&#8208;alcohols to produce diverse macrocyclic olefin products. This unique approach has various advantages including step&#8208;economy, no additives and pre&#8208;functionalization required, inexpensive and reusable catalysts, and exemplification with 23 macrocycles in different ring sizes. The continuous flow macrocyclisation afforded higher productivity and space&#8208;time yield than the batch reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Organo&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Dehydrative Coupling Reaction to Prepare Arylacetic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, the use of triphenylmethylium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate as an efficient catalyst for the intermolecular dehydrative coupling of p&#8208;hydroxymandelic acid hydrate with substituted aromatic amines and (thio)phenols was developed, which allows for the preparation of arylacetic acid derivatives in a convenient manner. Notably, this method offers several advantages, including being prefunctionalization free, high atom efficiency, and high regioselectivity. Additionally, it exhibits a broad substrate scope, enabling the synthesis of a range of arylacetic acid derivatives. Furthermore, this method can also be applied to the etherification of arylthiol derivatives, facilitating the preparation of various thiolated products, which would enhance the applicability and potential utility of this method in organic synthesis.

         <dc:description>Here we show successful continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of a key inter&#8208;mediate of (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;Metolachlor, which is a widely used agrochemical that is in huge demand, with asymmetric hydrogenation using a heterogeneous catalyst immobilized on a core/shell&#8208;type support. We have immobilized a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art homogeneous catalyst onto a core/shell&#8208;type heterogeneous support that was developed in our laboratory, which successfully showed high turnover frequency and turnover number over a long period when used in a solvent&#8208;free continuous&#8208;flow manner. This result demonstrates the feasibility of continuous&#8208;flow production of sophisticated chiral agrochemicals with packed&#8208;bed heterogeneous catalysts. Moreover, the heterogenization protocol was shown to be applicable to elaborate practical catalysts used in industry, especially the group of phosphine ligands.</dc:description>

Indolyl&#8208;ynone, owing to its highly reactive ynone moiety, frequently partakes in dearomatizing spirocyclization reactions and subsequent rearrangment reactions when subjected to various reaction conditions. Hence, various heterocycles such as densly functionalized spiroindolenines, carbazoles, quinolines and carbo&#8208;and hetero&#8208;cycle substituted indoles are synthesized from indolyl&#8208;ynones. In addition to this, the versatile spirocyclic indole scaffold exhibits the capability to produce tetracyclic and polyclic structures through intricate skeletal rearrangement processes. Moreover, the total synthesis of natural products using the indolyl&#8208;ynone moiety was also compiled in this review.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereospecific Indium(III)&#8208;Catalysed Tandem Cycloisomerization of Functionalized 1,6&#8208;enynes: Scope and Mechanistic Insights</title>

Abstract
Tandem cycloisomerization reactions of functionalized 1,6&#8208;enynes under indium(III) catalysis are described. This atom&#8208;economic transformation proceeds smoothly with 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig regioselectivity using commercial In(III) halides and 1,6&#8208;enynes furnished with alcohol, carboxylic acid or amine functional groups to give bicyclic structures in good yields and diastereoselectivities. The reaction with enynals involves a three&#8211;step mechanism to give an oxatricycle and a conjugated 1,3&#8208;diene. In the absence of the internal nucleophile the enyne cycloisomerization evolves through a skeletal rearrangement or a cyclopropanation reaction after the regioselective 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization. The 1,6&#8208;enyne cycloisomerization is stereospecific and the stereoselectivity appears to be independent of the internal nucleophile. Experimental data support a common reaction mechanism involving an initial alkyne electrophilic &#960;&#8208;coordination of In(III) followed by Markovnikov electrophilic alkene addition and ring&#8208;closure by nucleophilic attack. DFT studies hold up a stepwise mechanism involving the formation of a chiral non&#8208;classical carbocation intermediate that determines the diastereoselectivity of this tandem cycloisomerization reaction.

&lt;p&gt;Tandem cycloisomerization reactions of functionalized 1,6-enynes under indium(III) catalysis are described. This atom-economic transformation proceeds smoothly with &lt;i&gt;5-exo-dig&lt;/i&gt; regioselectivity using commercial In(III) halides and 1,6-enynes furnished with alcohol, carboxylic acid or amine functional groups to give bicyclic structures in good yields and diastereoselectivities. The reaction with enynals involves a three&#8211;step mechanism to give an oxatricycle and a conjugated 1,3-diene. In the absence of the internal nucleophile the enyne cycloisomerization evolves through a skeletal rearrangement or a cyclopropanation reaction after the regioselective &lt;i&gt;5-exo-dig&lt;/i&gt; cyclization. The 1,6-enyne cycloisomerization is stereospecific and the stereoselectivity appears to be independent of the internal nucleophile. Experimental data support a common reaction mechanism involving an initial alkyne electrophilic &#960;-coordination of In(III) followed by Markovnikov electrophilic alkene addition and ring-closure by nucleophilic attack.

         <title>Photocatalytic Dehydrogenative 6&#960;&#8208;Photocyclisation of Indole Derivatives via Successive Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, a successive energy transfer (sEnT) strategy to enable a dehydrogenative 6&#960;&#8208;photocyclisation, without the need for an external oxidant is reported, in which the energetically unfavourable dehydrogenation is driven by energy transfer. The valuable applicability of this method was demonstrated by the scaffold hopping of indole containing bioactive molecules, as well as by the succinct synthesis of naturally occurring tetracyclic furocarbazole alkaloids. Moreover, experimental and computational studies were conducted to elucidate the reaction mechanism.

Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkylation of indoles with &#945;&#8208;diazoesters is well&#8208;known, however, the underlying mechanisms of this reaction, particularly the origin of stereoselectivity, remain uncertain. For the Pd catalysis, we address this cutting&#8208;edge challenge from two complementary viewpoints &#8211; i) the molecular level regarding a single catalytically active Pd center; and ii) nano&#8208;level Pd species investigating the factors favoring the appearance of the preferred catalytic centers. The formation of the active catalytic species was monitored by structural methods (NMR and ESI&#8208;MS), and metal particles were characterized with electron microscopy (SEM, EDX). On the molecular level, chiral bipyridine&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dioxides proved to be competent chiral controllers. The kinetic and DFT computational data revealed a crucial role of water in the rate and selectivity determining steps and showed that the enantioselectivity of the process is controlled by the protodepalladation step. On the nano&#8208;scale, the important effect of catalyst precursor on the overall reaction performance was shown.

Abstract
A substrate and catalyst&#8208;controlled synthetic strategy was employed to construct two distinct types of fused polycyclic heterocycles, namely pyrido[2,3,4&#8208;de]quinazolinones and indolo[1,2&#8208;c]quinazolinones. The most notable advantage of this method is its ability to rapidly generate two different polycyclic scaffolds via a simple C&#8722;H activation and subsequent cyclization cascade pathway. Specifically, sulfoxonium ylides played a crucial role in both transformations, serving as a two&#8208;carbon synthon and a one&#8208;carbon synthon, to independently construct the two fused polycyclic scaffolds through [4+2] and [4+1] annulation pathways, respectively.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Coupling Reaction of Cyclopropanols with Electrophilic Alkenes Enabled by Decatungstate as Photoredox Catalyst</title>

Abstract
We introduce a methodology for the photocatalytic generation of &#946;&#8208;ketoalkyl radicals from tertiary cyclopropanols, utilizing tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as a photoredox catalyst. The application is demonstrated by the synthesis of distantly functionalized ketones via the redox&#8208;neutral addition of the cyclopropanol&#8208;derived &#946;&#8208;ketoalkyl radicals to the double bond of electrophilic olefins. The transformation occurs under ambient temperature conditions and is suitable for coupling a wide range of cyclopropanol and alkene substrates. This was demonstrated by the preparation of 33 ketone products with 35&#8211;92% yield. The method's preparative robustness has been validated through upscaled preparations conducted under continuous flow conditions. Mechanistic investigations support the role of TBADT as a photoredox catalyst, which facilitates the single electron oxidation of cyclopropanols, followed by the electron transfer from the reduced form of decatungstate to the electrophilic double bond of alkene. Moreover, we found that electron&#8208;rich aromatic cyclopropanols and electron&#8208;deficient olefins form photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes. This property allows the reaction to proceed under UV light irradiation via the photoinduced charge transfer in the absence of the photocatalyst.

Abstract
New synthetic routes were devised for total synthesis of Fe3+&#8208;bound (ferri&#8722;) salmycin B (Sal B) (1), glycan&#8208;based Sal analogues 2&#8211;5 and their Fe3+&#8208;unbound (desferri&#8722;) counterparts 1&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; for the structure to activity relationship (SAR) study. The results of SAR study reveal the effective structure of 1 and its desferri&#8208;counterpart 1&#8242; that are responsible for the observed inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Among the analogues 2&#8211;5 and 2&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242;, glucose&#8208;based analogue 2 and its desferri&#8208;counterpart 2&#8242; exhibited inhibitory potency comparable to 1 and 1&#8242;. Chemical modification of 2&#8242; for further antibacterial study enabled us to discover desferri&#8208;Sal analogue 7&#8242; that endowed with a simpler pharmacophore structure but significantly higher antibacterial potency against methicillin&#8208;sensitive and resistant S. aureus than the natural product 1&#8242; and even the clinical vancomycin. Together with a better hydrolytic stability and shorter synthetic route, the analogue 7&#8242; represents an attractive antibiotic lead for further exploration.

Abstract
In this study, we developed a process for the [2+1+3] cyclization of 2&#8208;methylbenzothiazole salts, aldehydes and amidine hydrochlorides, which allows rapid synthesis of 1,3&#8208;diazaphenothiazines with moderate to good yields. The use of ethanol as solvent, oxygen as the terminal oxidant, mild reaction conditions, good functionality tolerance show the promising application in organic synthesis.

Abstract
Palladium catalyzed S&#8208;allylation of vinyl carbinols from ionones (or conjugated carbonyls) with 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzothiazole (BT&#8208;SH) provides versatile C15 dienyl benzothiazolyl (BT) sulfides. This Pd(dppe)Cl2&#8208;catalyzed S&#8208;allylation is highly selective for free allylic alcohols in the presence of allylic acetates, resulting in 3&#8208; or 4&#8208;acetoxy C15 dienyl BT&#8208;sulfides suitable for xanthophyll synthesis. The corresponding C15 dienyl BT&#8208;sulfones undergo Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination reactions with C10 2,7&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;octatrienedial under mild conditions to produce carotenoids natural products. Efficient synthesis is achieved for a range of carotenoids including xanthophylls such as iso&#8208;zeaxanthin, zeaxanthin, and lutein as well as carotenes like &#946;&#8208;carotene, &#1013;&#8208;carotene, and 9&#8242;&#8208;Z&#8208;phenyl&#8208;carotene.

Abstract
A strategy for sulfonylation of boronic acids with sulfonyl chlorides has been established via Suzuki&#8208;type radical cross&#8208;coupling. This approach allows for the synthesis of more than 50 sulfone examples enabled by photoredox catalysis under visible light radiation. Moreover, the title reaction is applied in late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules, and further transformation of the resulting sulfones into 2&#8208;functionalized sulfones, borates, triphenylphosphine oxide and N&#8208;arylcarbazole can be also achieved.

Abstract
Presented herein is a synthesis of indane fused bicyclic pyrazolidinones based on the reactions of aryl azomethine imines with cyclopropanols. Mechanistically, the formation of product involves Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed direct aryl C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of aryl azomethine imine with cyclopropanol through in&#8197;situ ring&#8208;opening, followed by cascade intramolecular C&#8208; and N&#8208;nucleophilic addition. In this tandem process, cyclopropanol acts as not only an alkylating agent but also masked nucleophile and electrophile to participate in the construction of both the indane and the bicyclic pyrazolidinone scaffolds. To our knowledge, such a cascade reaction pattern has not been disclosed. In general, this synthetic protocol has advantages such as easily obtainable substrates, valuable products, concise synthetic procedure, unique reaction pathway, and good compatibility with diverse functional groups.

Abstract
An EDA complex comprising N&#8208;allyl bromodifluoroacetamides and tertiary alkyl amine was exploited to facilitate annulative difunctionalization reaction under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This external photocatalyst&#8208;free methodology garners olefin&#8208;olefin coupling featuring a radical Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement and produced long&#8208;chain functionalized gem&#8208;difluoropyrrolidones from N&#8208;substituted methacryloyl sulfonamides, while simple N&#8208;aryl methacrylamides furnished pyrrolidinone&#8208;oxindole hybrid lactams in high yields. Mechanistic investigations substantiate a combined reaction mechanism, involving charge&#8208;transfer EDA complex&#8208;based radical cascade, alongside an &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical&#8208;triggered XAT process, exhibiting a quantum yield value of 1.48.

Abstract
A (3+2) cycloaddition reaction of linear N,N&#8208;disilyl enamines and organic azides is investigated. The N,N&#8208;disilyl enamines, derived from the selective double hydrosilylation of conjugated nitriles, are employed in&#8208;situ for this investigation. The resulting triazoline intermediate from the (3+2) cycloaddition reaction promptly undergoes retro&#8208;(3+2) cycloaddition to yield versatile non&#8208;stabilized diazoalkane, along with formamidine. The presence of a transient and unstable alkyl diazomethane is confirmed by utilizing carboxylates as trapping reagents. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of these alkyl diazomethanes by utilizing them in reactions with various reagents, including hydroborane, diboron, silaborane, alkenes, and alkynes.

Abstract
We found that gold nanoparticles function as single&#8208;electron transfer catalysts to promote decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling between N&#8208;hydroxy phthalimide esters and disilanes or diborons. A variety of disilanes coupled with alkyl radicals could be generated from N&#8208;hydroxy phthalimide esters via single&#8208;electron reduction by active carbon&#8208;supported gold nanoparticle catalysts to afford diverse alkylsilanes without the need for external bases. Furthermore, the present gold catalytic system was also effective for decarboxylative carbon&#8208;boron coupling to afford alkyl boronates. A detailed mechanistic investigation revealed that single&#8208;electron transfer mediated by supported gold nanoparticles enabled the generation of alkyl radical and silyl radical, thereby enabling radical cross&#8208;coupling. The reusability and environmentally&#8208;friendly nature of supported gold catalyst as well as the scalability of the reaction system enable the practical transformation of carboxylic acid derivatives into value&#8208;added organosilicon and organoboron compounds.

Abstract
The compound, 2H&#8208;pyrrole, is a key scaffold contained in natural products, bioactive compounds, pharmaceuticals, and organic functional materials. However, the development of efficient synthetic strategies for 2H&#8208;pyrroles is challenging. This is because 2H&#8208;pyrroles, owing to their nonaromatic nature, are easily converted into the thermodynamically more stable 1H&#8208;pyrroles. Recently, efficient and straightforward synthetic strategies for 2H&#8208;pyrroles have been developed, including the dearomatization of 1H&#8208;pyrrole, oxidation of pyrrolines or pyrrolidines, ring construction via catalytic cycloaddition, and rearrangement of 3H&#8208;pyrroles. In this review, we summarize the progress in the research on 2H&#8208;pyrrole synthesis since 2000 and briefly discuss the synthesis reaction mechanisms.

Abstract
Here, we present an electrochemically induced synthesis of 9&#8208;sulfenylarylphenanthrenes and 3&#8217;&#8208;sulfenylarylspiro&#8208;cyclohexa[4.5]trienones starting from o&#8208;alkynylbiphenyls and diaryl disulfides. This method was accomplished through constant current electrolysis of 10&#8197;mA in an undivided cell setup by utilizing CH3CN as a solvent and LiClO4 as an electrolyte at room temperature. Notably, the present strategy enabled the formation of sulfenylphenanthrenes and sulfenyl spiro cyclohexa[4.5]trienones in 70%&#8211;95% yield. Scale&#8208;up synthesis, mechanistic studies, and cyclic voltammetry have also been carried out.

         <title>Synthesis of Pyrido&#8208;[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline Derivatives via Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Cascade Reaction of Enamides</title>

Abstract
A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cascade reaction of tertiary enamides has been developed, which provides a method for the preparation of diverse pyrido[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives with good function group tolerance. Preliminary investigation of the reaction mechanism indicate that this process comprises a nucleophilic addition of the enamide to an alkynyl group, followed by the capture of the acyliminium ion by an electron&#8208;rich aromatic component. Additionally, scale&#8208;up experiments and further transformations of pyrido&#8208;[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines underscore the utility of this methodology.

Abstract
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes with anilines/indoles and acetonitrile has been developed. This protocol provides an access to functionalized cyano&#8208;containing molecules. In this transformation, employing di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide as a radical initiator, a variety of commercialized nucleophiles and electronically diverse arenes were well tolerated. In addition, we also studied the kinetic isotope effect.

Abstract
C10a&#8208;Acetoxylated perhydroazepino[1,2&#8208;a]&#8208;indoles, accessible via visible light&#8208;mediated sensitized photooxygenation of cyclo&#8208;hepta[b]indoles, are precursors to structurally elaborate carbon&#8208;centered radicals. Their photoredox&#8208;catalyzed SET reduction by phenothiazine or phenoxazine photocatalysts, followed by fragmentation and C&#8722;O bond cleavage, liberates tricyclic &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals that readily engage in radical addition reactions with silyl enol ethers and silyl ketene acetals. The C&#8722;C functionalized azepinoindole[1,2&#8208;a]indoles are useful building blocks for the synthesis of polycyclic indole derivatives as shown by the controlled borohydride reduction of a C10a&#8208;methylenecarboxylate derivative, which leads stereoselectively to tetracyclic azepino[1,2&#8208;a]furo[3,2&#8208;b]indoles. The photocatalytic method developed herein is also suitable for the radical functionalization of simple &#945;&#8208;acetoxy acetophenones.

Abstract
The aza&#8208;Prins cyclization in presence of a variety of aliphatic, aromatic, and heterocyclic ketones is disclosed. The developed method allows an access to diverse C&#8208;2 functionalized piperidines, bearing a tetrasubstituted or spiranic carbon stereocenter, in a range of 30 to 87% yields. When diastereomers were formed, the trans isomer was identified as the major product.

Abstract
We introduce a strategy for the one&#8208;step synthesis of chiral diazabicycloalkanes that delivers the annulated ring system in a single reaction step. The method entails a direct aza&#8208;Michael/aldol reaction of enals in conjunction with modified oxopropanamides and establishes the chiral center via iminium&#8208;enamine tandem catalysis. For this purpose, we developed simple diphenylethylendiamine frameworks as dual activation organocatalyst, effectively engaging both the substrate and reagent, thus leading to yields of 31&#8211;86% and enantioselectivities in the range of 80&#8211;98%. The final product features not only the diazabicycloalkane moiety but includes also additional functionalities, such as aldehyde motives that can be modified in&#8197;situ without loss of enantioselectivity, and an sp2&#8208;bearing methyl group. Our approach accommodates a wide array of enals with high functional group tolerance. Additionally, we demonstrated the adjustability of enantioselectivity and yield by modulating the acid cocatalyst&#8216;s quantity, thus offering multiple optimization possibilities.

Abstract
We report a process to access a variety of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluorinated alcohols. A Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation method was developed in 85&#8211;98% yields and enantiomeric excesses ranging from 52% to &gt;99%. The reduction proceeds under mild conditions with a range of difluorinated molecules including 3,3&#8208;difluorochromanone, 3,3&#8208;difluorothiochromanone, 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;dihydroquinolinone and &#945;&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;ketosulfone derivatives to provide the desired enantioenriched difluorinated alcohols which are valuable fluorinated building blocks.

Abstract
A four&#8208;component reaction of N&#8208;arylpropiolamides, Hantzsch esters, Na2S2O5 and water via a radical cascade cyclization process with the insertion of sulfur dioxide mediated by K2S2O8 is reported. A series of alkylsulfonated spiro[4,5] trienones are prepared up to 86% yield with a good functional group tolerance and substrate applicability. Preliminary mechanism experiments indicate that carbonyl oxygen of spiro[4,5] trienones originated from water.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Length Scale Communication Effects in Catalysis: Thinking Big and Acting Small</title>

Abstract
The use of hierarchically structured materials as catalysts has been finding increasing application in the past years. For these catalytic systems, not only the nano&#8208;scale matters: a high degree of order across multiple length scales, along with its control and analytical assessment, is of paramount importance to obtain innovative properties that can find application in catalysis. Most reviews dealing with hierarchically structured materials are concerned with the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; transfer of structural information along the different length scales, with special emphasis on the transmission of chirality. Due to their mesoscale size together with their complex behaviour, these systems are often susceptible to feel the effects of macroscopic forces, that can exert a &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; control of their catalytic properties, so that an external stimulus, acting at the level of the supramolecular architecture of the catalyst, can ultimately determine the outcome of the catalyzed reaction at the molecular level. We review in this paper some recent reports that deal with the experimental implementation of this concept, either by using a mechanical force in a full range direct transmission to the reaction coordinate, or by means of a stepwise relay transmission from the macroscopic level (purely supramolecular chirality) to the nanoscopic one. We focus in this review on these multi&#8208;length scale communication control effects, identifying the different mechanisms that are affecting the catalytic activity.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of 2&#8208;(Quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzyl Alcohols by Biocatalytic Dynamic Kinetic Resolutions</title>

Abstract
A highly enantioselective biocatalytic dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of 2&#8208;(quinoline&#8208;8&#8208;yl) 3&#8208;methylbenzaldehydes and 1&#8208;naphthaldehydes is described. The reaction proceeds by atroposelective carbonyl reduction catalyzed by commercial ketoreductases (KREDs), generally reaching high conversions and excellent enantiomeric excesses. Both atropoisomers of the final alcohols can be obtained by a proper selection of the biocatalyst. The DKR strategy relies in the racemization of the stereogenic axis that takes place thanks to a transient Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction (LABI) between the nitrogen in the quinoline and the carbonyl group.

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidative Cleavage of Alkenes Followed by Carbonyl Stereoselective Bioreduction for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched Secondary Alcohols</title>

Abstract
Oxidative alkene cleavage of a series of (hetero)aryl alkyl styrenes in aqueous medium has been developed using either 9&#8208;mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methylacridinium perchlorate ([AcrMes]ClO4) and sodium anthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonate (SAS) as photosensitizers under blue LED irradiation. Reaction conditions were studied to find a suitable media for the development of a linear cascade after subsequent stereoselective reduction of the corresponding ketone intermediate. The use of cesium carbonate provided an adequate pH to the reaction medium for the alcohol dehydrogenase action. [AcrMes]ClO4 was found to be the best photocatalyst, allowing the development of concurrent or sequential cascades depending on the ability of the photosensitizer to oxidize back the chiral alcohol to the ketone. Overall, the photobiocatalytic approach has allowed the synthesis of a wide number of alcohol compounds, the formation of (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;enantiomers being attained with excellent stereoselectivity and moderate to good yields.

         <title>Aryne&#8208;based synthesis of cyclobutadiene&#8208;containing oligoacenes and related extended biphenylene derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. A previously undescribed aryne derived from a &#960;&#8208;extended biphenylene, 2,3&#8208;didehydrobenzo[b]biphenylene, has been developed. The participation of this new aryne building block in [4+2] and palladium&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions has been applied to the synthesis of a variety of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) with appealing structures which combine (aromatic) benzene and (antiaromatic) cyclobutadiene (CBD) rings. Among them, a family of unsubstituted (or barely substituted) CBD&#8208;oligoacenes has been accessed by iterative Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of the new aryne with furans and/or isobenzofurans, followed by deoxygenative aromatization of the resulting 	epoxy&#8208;derivatives. The experimental and computational studies of the newly synthesized PCHs suggest an important degree of electron delocalization along the polycyclic skeleton, more pronounced in the linearly fused derivatives. The computed ACID plots reveal clockwise current density vectors at the peripheral bonds, originating from the sigma contributions of the antiaromatic cyclobutadiene rings..</dc:description>

Abstract
In this paper, we present a one&#8208;pot protocol that enables a straightforward and selective transformation of alkyl benzothiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl and phenyltetrazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl sulfones and acyl chlorides into ketones, E&#8208;olefins, Z&#8208;olefins, and even pyrroles. The final product of the reaction depends on the proper choice of the reaction workup. Notably, the protocol designed for olefin formation allows a switch between E&#8208; and Z&#8208;olefin formation by the correct choice of the reaction workup. These developed protocols facilitate the formation of all compounds under mild reaction conditions, as evidenced by the synthesis of (nitro)&#8208;fatty acids, and the concept can be extended to other product formations, as demonstrated by the synthesis of pyrroles.

         <title>Chiral 1&#8208;Phosphabarrelene&#8208;Pyridines as Suitable Ligands for the Rh/Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Olefins</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of chiral phosphabarrelene&#8208;pyridine ligands. Their synthesis benefit from modified reaction conditions to overcome the low yields normally associated with the [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of phosphinines with hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;butyne, which is a key to install the P&#8208;stereocenter in the phosphabarrelene. Their potential as chelating ligands in asymmetric catalysis was assessed in the Rh&#8208; and Ir&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of cyclic &#946;&#8208;enamides and &#946;&#8208;dehydroamino acid derivatives. The catalytic system containing a tert&#8208;butyl substituent at the ortho position of the phosphabarrelene moiety successfully hydrogenates a range of cyclic &#946;&#8208;enamides (ee's between 92% to 94%) and &#946;&#8208;dehydroamino acid derivatives (ee's between 93% to 95%). Moreover, the reactions can be carried out in the environmentally friendly 1,2&#8208;propylene carbonate as solvent with no loss of enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies with the Rh/P,N catalytic systems agree with the Landis&#8208;Halpern mechanism and explain the influence of the substituent at the phosphabarrelene on enantioselectivity. Finally, the hydrogenation reactions can be carried out at large scale maintaining high enantioselectivities.

         <title>Electrochemical Ruthenium&#8208;Catalysed Directed C&#8722;H Functionalization of Arenes with Boron Reagents</title>

Abstract
Ortho&#8208;directed electrochemical C&#8722;H functionalization of aromatics with boron&#8208;based coupling partners has been achieved under ruthenium catalysis through an oxidatively induced reductive elimination mechanism. Our method provides a single set of conditions delivering C&#8722;H arylation, alkenylation and methylation, yielding ortho&#8208;functionalized products with good functional group tolerance, including examples of late&#8208;stage functionalization in synthetically useful yields. By harnessing electricity as a &#8216;green&#8217; oxidant, this method circumvents the need for stoichiometric quantities of chemical oxidants, enhancing our sustainability metrics.

Abstract
An electrochemical methodology for the construction of &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;substituted carbonyl compounds in moderate to good yields under exogenous metal and oxidant&#8208;free conditions has been developed.

         <title>Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloaddition of C60 with Enynes: Unveiling the Mechanistic Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
In this study we present a method for functionalizing C60 through a Rh&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction with 1,6&#8208;enynes, resulting in the formation of a fused bicyclic structure. Additionally, fullerene derivatives are further functionalized through regioselective photooxygenation reactions. Our DFT calculations reveal two distinct reaction pathways: one involving rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of the enyne followed by Diels&#8208;Alder with C60, and the other featuring a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of enyne and C60 followed by isomerization. Surprisingly, both pathways exhibit nearly identical energy barriers. However, experimental tests indicate that the predominant pathway varies depending on the substitution motifs of the substrates.

         <title>Accessing Borazine Substitution Patterns through Late&#8208;Stage Iodination</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We have defined a procedure for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of aryl borazines to facilitate the synthesis of a diverse array of borazine derivatives with varying substitution patterns, paving the way for further exploration of the field. More in detail, we have studied and disclosed a simple iodination procedure that could be applied to several differently substituted substrates (1&#8201;a&#8211;i) with mostly good to excellent yields (47&#8211;96%). The representative iodinated compounds 2&#8201;b and 2&#8201;e, were utilized to test their use in further representative functionalization steps such as cyanation, Heck, and Sonogashira reactions. All products 3&#8201;a&#8211;e were obtained in satisfactory good to very good yields considering the multiple (three or six times) concomitant reactions.

Abstract
A direct thiocyanatosulfonation of alkynes with sulfinic acids and potassium thiocyanate was developed at room temperature. This method provided a efficient and practical pathway to selectively access (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;(thiocyanato)vinyl sulfones by two C&#8722;S bonds formation in one step under metal&#8208;free condition. The advantages of this method included simple reaction conditions, easily available starting materials, good functional group compatibility, high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity and good to excellent yields of products.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of Polysubstituted Carbazoles from Indoles and Simple Dicarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polysubstituted carbazoles were efficiently synthesized through direct benzannulation reaction between 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds and indoles with catalytic amount of inexpensive zirconium(IV) chloride. This transformation proved to be regioselective and furnishes 1,4&#8208;disubstituted and 1,2,4&#8208;trisubstituted carbazoles with yields ranging from 26% to 91% and broad substrate scope. Moreover, this protocol benefits from using readily accessible starting materials without the need of their pre&#8208;functionalization. The synthetic utility of the products was exemplified by functionalization of an iodocarbazole by means of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions and by the synthesis of a 3&#8208;deaza&#8208;derivative of the natural product canthin&#8208;6&#8208;one.</dc:description>

         <title>Acceleration of the Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction between 9&#8208;Functionalized Anthracenes and C60/C70 in the Cavity of a Water Soluble Subphthalocyanine Cage</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report on the acceleration of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between a series of 9&#8208;functionalized anthracenes and C60/C70  encapsulated in a water&#8208;soluble  metallo&#8208;organic Pd(II)&#8208;subphthalocyanine cage (SubPc&#8208;cage), which performs as a catalytic molecular reactor that provides a beneficial hydrophobic environment. Negatively and positively charged anthracenes do not react either with C60 or C70, due to a favored solvation in water medium and/or to detrimental interactions with positively&#8208;charged Pd(II) corners of SubPc&#8208;cage. Experiments with C60 and C70 rendered parallel results, although C70 proved more reactive, leading to anthracene cycloadducts by reaction in the &#945; bonds. All the results have been rationalized by theoretical calculations at the GFN2&#8208;xTB level.</dc:description>

         <title>The Intermolecular Pauson&#8208;Khand Reaction: Applications, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The rapid assembly of complex organic molecules from simple and structurally diverse building blocks is a prevalent challenge in organic synthesis. The Pauson&#8208;Khand reaction (PKR) is a method of choice for the construction of five membered rings that has historically been popularized as a late&#8208;stage intramolecular cyclization method. The intermolecular version of the PKR, on the other hand, constitutes a powerful approach for the rapid assembly of densely functionalized cyclopentanic cores at early stages of a synthetic sequence. Despite its potential, the intermolecular PKR is much less prevalent in the organic synthesis literature due to several historical limitations, most importantly a reduced scope with respect to the alkene component of the reaction. The last decade has witnessed important developments in the area including a) experimental and theoretical studies that provide a good mechanistic understanding of the reaction and its selectivity, b) methodological developments that have broadened the scope of potential alkene partners, and c) the development of catalytic enantioselective versions that provide useful levels of enantioselectivity. In parallel, remarkable synthetic applications of the intermolecular PKR have emerged, including (enantioselective) total syntheses of complex natural products (polycyclic terpenes, alkaloids, prostanes) as well as examples of industrial relevance. A fundamental limitation of the PKR that needs to be addressed in the future is the current lack of a ligand&#8208;accelerated version of the reaction, which would be a promising advance towards developing more efficient and general catalytic (enantioselective) reactions.

Abstract
Herein, we report a strategy for pyrimidination of inert alkanes via synergistic visible light&#8208;driven redox reaction and FeCl3 catalysis. This transformation involves C&#8722;H activation by a chlorine radical generated during the iron&#8208;promoted ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer process, triggering subsequent C&#8722;H pyrimidination. The substrates and catalysts are inexpensive and readily available, while the reaction conditions and procedures are simple without the need for external oxidants. This work provides a practical approach for synthesizing pyrimidine derivatives with high structural diversity.

Abstract
A regio&#8208; and diastereoselective conjugate addition reaction of Grignard reagents to fluoroalkyl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl ketimines was disclosed. A range of different fluoroalkyls and Grignard reagents were well tolerated, giving up to 99% diastereomeric and regioisomeric ratios.

Abstract
A strategy was developed for synthesizing furan&#8208;fused dibenzotropones via intramolecular Wittig reactions of alkylidene dibenzo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;tropolones and acylating reactants in catalytic or stoichiometric conditions. With these protocols, a series of furo[2,3&#8208;f]dibenzotropones were obtained in 49&#8211;99% yields within 1&#8211;10&#8197;hours. Mechanistic studies of the base&#8208;free phenomena revealed that the organophosphane acts both as a mediator and a regenerable Br&#248;nsted base under heating.

         <title>Synthesis of Selenooxazoles through Electrochemical Oxidative Selenocyclization of N&#8208;Propargylamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An electrocatalytic approach for the bromide&#8208;mediated selenocyclization of N&#8208;propargylamides with diselenides is described, providing a synthetic route for the synthesis of various seleno&#8208;oxazoles in 41&#8211;73% yields. The success of gram&#8208;scale experiments demonstrate the potential value of this protocol in synthetic chemistry. Mechanistic investigations suggest that this selenocyclization protocol proceed through two possible pathways, including selenium cation and radical processes.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Cascade Cyclization Reactions of 1,7&#8208;Enynes</title>

Abstract
Elaborated molecular architectures, especially carbocyclic, heterocyclic, endocyclic, and polycyclic molecular structures, serve as an important class of organic complexes because they are frequently occurring core structural units in a variety of biologically and pharmacologically relevant natural products, drug molecules, agrochemicals, and functional materials. A main challenge of current synthetic approaches is the development of strategically efficient and selective formation of these compounds from easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle starting materials. The cascade cyclizations of 1,7&#8208;enynes have afforded an indispensable method for accessing molecular complexity and diversity, thus highlighting their potential significance in both academic and industrial communities. In the last decades, tremendous efforts have been devoted to discovering convenient routes to access sophisticated annulation derivatives, and a wide range of powerful and straightforward synthetic strategies have been reported. In this review, the latest achievements in the cascade cyclization reactions of 1,7&#8208;enynes are summarized, which could be separated into three categories: (1) Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reactions of 1,7&#8208;enynes; (2) Metal&#8208;free catalyzed reactions of 1,7&#8208;enynes; (3) Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions of 1,7&#8208;enynes.

Abstract
Photoinduced chemical transformations have become a promising aspect of organic synthesis. This review focuses on the recent advancements in harnessing photoinduced processes for the formation of carbon&#8208;chalcogen (C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, C&#8722;Se, and C&#8722;Te) bonds under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. These pathways typically involve either a radical mechanism or the creation of electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes. The review explores the intricacies of the underlying mechanisms, discusses limitations, and evaluates the applicability of various methodologies in this field. Notably, photocatalyst and transition metal&#8208;free photochemical reactions offer effective alternatives to enhance sustainability in this research area.

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component, base&#8208;mediated [3+2] cycloaddition reaction to synthesize 1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones from readily available amino acid esters, aldehydes, and terminal alkynes was reported. Isolation of the intermediate and the detailed mechanistic study revealed the course of the reaction. This multi&#8208;component reaction proceeds via imine formation followed by the nucleophilic addition of alkyne to form a propargylamine precursor. Base&#8208;mediated conversion of propargylamine precursor into 1&#8208;azadiene followed by in&#8197;situ ketene formation leading to [3+2] cycloaddition that ultimately produces unusual 1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones.

Abstract
Herein, the selective ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;C&#8722;H bond borylation of NH&#8208;aryl sulfoximines is reported. Regioselectivity is achieved by the choice of commercially available ligands giving fast excess to valuable borylated aryl sulfoximine building blogs. The utility of the borylated products is demonstrated for the formation of C&#8722;O, C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;D, and C&#8722;I bonds.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, the selective &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-C&#8722;H bond borylation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;H-aryl sulfoximines is reported. Regioselectivity is achieved by the choice of commercially available ligands giving fast excess to valuable borylated aryl sulfoximine building blogs. The utility of the borylated products is demonstrated for the formation of C&#8722;O, C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;D, and C&#8722;I bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of &#945;&#8208;arylated sulfoxonium ylides has been achieved from mesitylene&#8208;derived diaryliodonium salts and &#945;&#8208;carbonyl sulfoxonium ylides. The reaction is believed to proceed via an electrophilic Cu(III)&#8208;aryl intermediate that can be trapped upon nucleophilic attack of the sulfoxonium ylide precursor. The reaction was tolerant to both &#945;&#8208;keto and &#945;&#8208;ester&#8208;derived sulfoxonium ylides, to drug&#8208;derived ylide motifs and to electronically&#8208;diverse arenes, and enabled the direct synthesis of 32 &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;sulfoxonium ylides in 42&#8211;85% yield.
