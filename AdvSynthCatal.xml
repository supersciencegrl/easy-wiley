         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Amide Synthesis in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the present study, for the first time environmentally friendly deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are used as reaction media to perform an efficient, simple and straightforward photocatalytic amide synthesis at room temperature using thioacids and amines. This method features mild conditions, a broad substrate scope, high yields (&#8804;99%) under ambient conditions with air and moisture tolerance. Moreover, the applied operationally mild reaction conditions tolerate the presence of several different functional group substituents on the amine counterpart. Finally, the developed approach allows the recycling of the reaction medium and catalyst for at least three consecutive cycles without a significant decrease in the reaction yield</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Organocatalyzed Phospha&#8208;Michael Addition for the Direct Synthesis of Biologically Active Chromenylphosphonates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The potential of phosphites as nucleophiles for the synthesis of chiral chromene derivatives has been overlooked in the literature. Herein, we report a promising approach via asymmetric organocatalyzed phospha&#8208;Michael addition to iminochromenes, using a bifunctional squaramide, which gives access to chromenylphosphonates, an interesting family of bioactive compounds. Our optimized protocol provides very good reactivity, affording yields of up to 95% and with chiral products exhibiting an enantiomeric excess of up to 98%.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Regulated Electrochemical Selenylation and Deuteration of Alkynyl Aryl Ketones: Chemoselective Synthesis of 3&#8208;Selenylated Chromones and Deutero&#8208;Selenylated Chalcones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed an electrochemical reaction for the synthesis of 3&#8208;selenylchromones and deutero&#8208;selenylated chalcones of alkynyl aryl ketones. This method is free from metal catalysts and oxidants, and is regulated by solvents. The reaction conditions are mild, and a wide range of substrates can be employed to produce selenylated chromones and deutero&#8208;selenylated chalcones, displaying potential anti&#8208;inflammatory activities. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the applicability of this approach for the late&#8208;stage deutero&#8208;selenylation of the drug molecule, metochalcone.</dc:description>

         <title>Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Hydration/C&#8211;F Bond Cleavage of Fluorinated Diazoalkanes Enabling Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates</title>

         <dc:description>(&#946;&#8208;Diazo&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroethyl)phosphonates have been emerging as useful building blocks in organic synthetic chemistry in recent years, which can be used as diazo analog or masked carbene for the rapid assembly of difluoromethylene phosphonate&#8208;containing compounds. Herein, we elaborate a method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates from hydration/C&#8211;F bond cleavage of in situ generated (&#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroethyl)phosphonates via a Rh&#8208;carbene intermediate. Divers (&#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroethyl)phosphonates are tolerated in this reaction affording &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates in good yields. This reaction used the in situ generated water as the coupling partner, which represents a reaction of (&#946;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroethyl)phosphonates and also a method for generating bioactive &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclizations and [3+2]&#8208;Annulation Cascades between 1,5&#8208;Diyn&#8208;3&#8208;ols and Nitrones to Construct Carbazole Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions between 1,5&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;ols and nitrones to deliver carbazole derivatives are described. Such cascade reactions are applicable to facile synthesis of polyaromatic compounds containing carbazole subunits. Notably, the reaction mechanism involves unexpected oxoarylations, rather than oxidative Mannich reactions as known for but&#8208;1&#8208;yn&#8208;4&#8208;ols. Our control experiments indicate that the presence of a second alkyne as in 1,5&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;ols enables such oxoarylations due to a weak bonding between gold and this alkyne, rending the tethered alcohol less conformationally flexible.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized 2&#8208;Pyrrolidinones Bearing N&#8208;Trifluoromethylphenyl through A Formal [4+1] Cycloaddition of Cinnamaldehyde Nitrones and 1&#8208;Ethynylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A variety of functionalized 2&#8208;pyrrolidinones bearing N&#8208;trifluoromethylphenyl moieties were prepared in moderate to good yields with high diastereoselectivity through copper(II)&#8208;catalyst and base co&#8208;catalyzed formal [4+1] cycloaddition of cinnamaldehyde nitrones with 1&#8208;ethynylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ols in the presence of m&#8208;CPBA as the oxidant. The triple bond of 1&#8208;ethynylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol served as one&#8208;carbon synthon for the pyrrolidinone ring formation. Mechanistic studies revealed that m&#8208;CPBA played an important role to interrupt the intramolecular O&#8208;cyclization to afford the 2&#8208;pyrrolidinones. Moreover, the reaction could be easily performed at gram scales and the obtained products were selectively converted into diverse pyrroline scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Access to Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;Aminothiophenes via Regio&#8208; and Chemoselective Domino Reactions of Dithioesters with Fumaronitrile at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot viable protocol to synthesize tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;aminothiophenes engaging readily accessible &#945;&#8208;enolic dithioesters and abundant fumaronitrile under metal&#8208;free conditions at room temperature in open air. The reaction proceeds via successive Michael&#8208;type addition/intramolecular cyclization/isomerization cascades. The added features are benign conditions, exclusive regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity, excellent atom&#8208;/step&#8208;economy, easy purification, and tolerance of wide range of functional groups of a diverse electronic and steric nature. This protocol not only provided a robust and modular approach to various 2&#8208;aminothiophenes in moderate to excellent yields, but also demonstrated the potential of dithioesters and fumaronitrile in the challenging intermolecular 100% atom&#8208;economic cross&#8208;coupling reactions widening the arsenal of synthetic methods.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report a one-pot viable protocol to synthesize tetrasubstituted 2-aminothiophenes engaging readily accessible &#945;-enolic dithioesters and abundant fumaronitrile under metal-free conditions at room temperature in open air. The reaction proceeds via successive Michael-type addition/intramolecular cyclization/isomerization cascades. The added features are benign conditions, exclusive regio- and chemoselectivity, excellent atom-/step-economy, easy purification, and tolerance of wide range of functional groups of a diverse electronic and steric nature. This protocol not only provided a robust and modular approach to various 2-aminothiophenes in moderate to excellent yields, but also demonstrated the potential of dithioesters and fumaronitrile in the challenging intermolecular 100% atom-economic cross-coupling reactions widening the arsenal of synthetic methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>An original uncatalyzed three&#8208;component reaction employing mixed aliphatic organozinc reagents for the preparation of &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;ketoesters is described. This modular procedure, which relies on a formal conjugate addition/crossed&#8208;Claisen domino reaction between an organozinc, an acrylate and an acyl chloride, allows the straightforward synthesis of the reaction products under mild conditions. The three&#8208;component coupling can also be conducted from alkyl iodides, in an even more simple procedure. Experimental findings account for a probable polar concerted mechanism involving at least two organozinc compounds at the stage of the transition state.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Direct Intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H Alkylation of Saccharides and Switching of Reaction Sites by Changing Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
We developed a site&#8208;selective intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation of saccharides with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes using photocatalysis by anthraquinone and tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT). The main reaction site of anthraquinone&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation is determined by the weakness of the C&#8722;H bond. The reaction site can be switched by changing the photocatalyst to TBADT, and the site&#8208;selectivity is controlled by the steric hindrance between the bulkier TBADT photocatalyst and the substituents of the saccharides. The reaction is compatible with several electron&#8208;deficient alkenes and saccharides, and provides C&#8208;saccharides in good yields. Furthermore, the monoalkylated product was obtained in excellent yield, even on the gram scale, under TBADT photocatalysis. Applicability was demonstrated by site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation of glycosyl derivatives. The reactions proceed via a site&#8208;selective hydrogen atom transfer between the photocatalyst and saccharide, and the generated carbon radical reacts with an electron&#8208;deficient alkene to give alkylated products.

Abstract
Chiral aza&#8208;heterocycles, as a sort of key frameworks of natural products et al, are deeply concerned by synthetic chemists. In recent years, catalytic asymmetric reactions of several types of zwitterionic intermediates, originating form benzoxazinone derivatives, have become a popular and efficient approach to obtain chiral aza&#8208;heterocycles. Given that, this review attempts to summarize recent development in the field of catalytic asymmetric reactions of benzoxazinone derivatives as a powerful dipole precursors for the construction of aza&#8208;heterocycles. In the past years, various benzoxazinone derivatives and their catalytic asymmetric reactions have been developed. Herein, this review is organized by the types of benzoxazinone derivatives and their catalytic asymmetric reactions to display their important synthetic potentials and values.

         <title>Quaternary Ammonium Salts: Catalysts for Hydrosilylation of Alkynes with Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixing i&#8208;PrI and DABCO in solvent EtCN gave two quaternary ammonium salts (QASs) quantitatively, one of which is monocationic (QAS&#8208;1) and the other is dicationic (QAS&#8208;2). These QASs were found to catalyze hydrosilylation of alkynes with hydrosilanes (HAH) without the aid of metal and metalloid catalysts. This organocatalysis can be applied to a variety of alkynes: terminal/internal aryl and alkyl alkynes with/without a functional group. With dihydrosilanes (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si), the HAH occurred with high E&#8208;selectivity through syn addition, which was exclusively observed when using terminal alkyl alkynes, irrespective of a hydrosilane used. A scalable HAH is also feasible. The H&#8208;Si unit remaining in alkenylsilanes derived from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si is available for dehydrogenative alkynylation and N&#8208;heteroarylation under zinc&#8208;pyridine catalysis. This synthetic application delivers unique silicon compounds that have, for instance, alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, and alkynyl groups in a single molecule. Mechanistic studies suggested that alkynes activated by QASs irreversibly react with hydrosilanes that become more nucleophilic by the coordination of EtCN. A radical pathway is unlikely. The QAS catalysts can be recovered and reused at least 5 times.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances and Development in Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Glycosylation: An Expanding Research Area in Glycochemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
In the last fifteen years, the development of visible&#8208;light photocatalysis, metal/photoredox dual catalysis has become the forefront as a new paradigm in organic synthesis as well as in carbohydrate chemistry. It led to the discovery of unprecedented transformations and also the improvement of known reactions under mild conditions, employing simple household light sources and bench&#8208;stable precursors, which meet the requirements of green chemistry and sustainable development in excellent yield and stereocontrol. In a general sense, the exploitation of photoredox catalysis hinges on the capability of photocatalyst or redox mediator to transform visible light into chemical energy via photo&#8208;irradiated SET (single electron transfer), PET (photoinduced electron transfer), HAT (hydrogen atom transfer), and XAT (halogen atom transfer) to potentially unlock unique reaction pathways, thereby generating a diverse array of reactive intermediates. In view of reaction type, mechanism, and status, this review will systematically summarize the latest advances in visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photocatalytic glycosylation reactions, which are driven by single or dual photoredox catalysis and by the photoactivity of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes.

         <title>Advances in Catalytic Asymmetric Construction of Quaternary Stereogenic Centers by Conjugate Addition to &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Disubstituted Nitroalkenes</title>

Abstract
Quaternary stereogenic centers are of great importance because of their prevalence in a series of bioactive natural products and pharmaceuticals. Although the catalytic asymmetric construction of these highly congested centers poses a formidable challenge, this field has been extensively explored in the past few decades, and several elegant strategies, such as the asymmetric conjugate addition to &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted nitroalkenes, have been developed. The resultant &#946;&#8208;nitro quaternary stereocenters can be conveniently transformed into the corresponding &#946;&#8208;amino quaternary stereocenters commonly found in bioactive compounds. This review summarizes the recent advances in the construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary or hetero&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via metal&#8208;catalyzed and organocatalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition to &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted nitroalkenes, focusing on the scope, applications, and mechanisms of these reactions.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective, Intramolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition of Allenes, Promoted by Visible Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Enallenylamides have been utilized for the synthesis of heterobicycle[4.2.0]octane derivatives via Ir/h&#957; promoted [2+2] cycloaddition reaction. The reaction specifically targets the distal double bond of the allene moiety, and results in the exclusive formation of the trans product. The process is conducted at room temperature and under an inert atmosphere. An extensive study on the substituent propensities during the cycloaddition step revealed variable effects. Electron&#8208;withdrawing groups conjugated with the double bond participating in the cycloaddition either hindered the process or reduced its yield. Conversely, electron&#8208;donating substituents enhanced the efficiency, resulting in product yields ranging from 60% to 88%. Our study also demonstrated the influence of protecting groups on the reaction pathway.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a direct method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;imidoketones and &#945;&#8208;azolylketones via hypoiodite&#8208;catalyzed oxidative &#945;&#8208;C&#8211;N coupling of ketones with the corresponding imides and azoles, respectively. The use of inorganic base additives such as cesium carbonate in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 as a phase transfer catalyst was crucial to induce high reactivity. Control experiments revealed that the basic additives might not only facilitate high&#8208;turnover hypoiodite catalysis, but also be involved in the activation of coupling partners.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Aliphatic C&#8211;H Chlorination and Bromination Using Haloform as the Halogen Donor and Azidobenziodoxole as the Mediator</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An azidobenziodoxole (BIN3)&#8208;mediated tunable radical reaction system for selective chlorination and bromination of tertiary and secondary C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds of alkyl substrates using haloform as the halogen donor was developed. Reactions of various substrates with BIN3 under visible light irradiation without any photo or metal catalysts gave C&#8211;H chlorinated or brominated products. These reactions are selective, and compatible with many functional groups. Mechanistic studies suggest that haloform serves as the halogen atom donor and HN3 generated in situ from the reaction of BIN3 and water relays the radical chain reaction as the hydrogen atom donor. HN3 reacts with CHX2&#8226; to form CH2X2 and N3&#8226;, which propagates a radical chain by abstracting a hydrogen atom of the alkane substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Denitrogenation of Six&#8208;membered Cyclic Nitronates to Densely Substituted Dihydrofurans with Raney&#174; Nickel/AcOH System</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A protocol for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;dihydrofurans by reductive denitrogenation/ring contraction of 6&#8208;membered cyclic nitronates was developed. The process utilizes cheap Raney&#174; nickel both as catalyst and stoichiometric agent without the need for high&#8208;pressure equipment. The products are formed in high purity and column chromatography is often not required. Studies on the substrate scope, functional group tolerance, and mechanism were performed. The developed approach provides a straightforward two&#8208;step access to densely substituted 2,3&#8208;dihydrofurans from nitrostyrenes and alkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Photochemical Flow Synthesis of Structurally Diverse Benzyne and Triazine Precursors</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Benzyne and related arynes are classical high&#8208;energy species with a rich history of widespread applications in synthesis. However, despite several synthetic routes being available to generate arynes and their precursors, none represents an ideal entry to benzyne chemistry in view of safety, scalability, and sustainability. Here we report a new photochemical flow process allowing for the generation of benzyne precursors in high yields, and throughput, with easy isolation of multigram quantities of products. This process leverages a catalyst&#8208;free photochemical rearrangement via a photoexcited nitro arene which involves a cyclic hydroxylamine intermediate that has been fully characterized. The resulting precursors were converted to benzynes via a second photochemical flow process generating heterocyclic targets upon trapping with azide and sydnone partners. Remarkably, when reacting the benzyne precursors with secondary amines, a wide range of aryl triazines is obtained in good yields via a third photo&#8208;flow transformation. This represents a modular approach to synthesize these species, that avoids the use of potentially explosive diazonium salts. Ultimately, three photochemical flow processes using a single high&#8208;power LED light source (365&#8197;nm, adjustable in&#8208;put power) are presented with manifest benefits compared to batch processing. Moreover, the functionalization of a pendent carboxyl group to form sets of biologically relevant aryl triazine&#8208;based amides highlights further applications of these unique and industrially relevant triazine entities.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Mediated Hydroperfluoroalkylation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The direct hydroperfluoroalkylation of a wide range of unactivated alkenes has been achieved at room temperature with readily available iodoperfluoroalkanes using 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcatechol as a source of hydrogen atom and triethylborane. The hydrotrifluoromethylation could also be achieved under these conditions using gaseous trifluoromethyl iodide. An experimentally simple two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot hydrotrifluoromethylation process using the easy&#8208;to&#8208;use trifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride as the source of trifluoromethyl radicals has also been developed. Using these two approaches, a broad range of substrates, including isoprenoid natural products, were efficiently derivatized.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Homoallylamines from Unactivated Imines and Allyl Bromides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed umpolung strategy for the synthesis of homoallylamines from unactivated imines and allyl bromides is described. This strategy exploited N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) as an auxiliary agent to indirectly realize the cross&#8208;coupling of imines and allyl bromides. Various sterically hindered homoallylamines were synthesized by combining photocatalysis with halogen atom transfer (XAT). Notable characteristics of this approach include water&#8208;insensitive reaction conditions, high yield (up to 99%), wide substrate scope (suitable for N&#8208;aryl/alkyl and C&#8208;aryl ketimines and aldimines, 39 examples), and high tolerance of functional groups (such as cyano, ester, amide, and thioamide).

Abstract
Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular cyclization of 2&#8208;amidoazulene derivatives, prepared by the reaction of 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;aminoazulene derivatives with perfluoroalkyl acid anhydrides, resulted in the formation of 2&#8208;perfluoroalkylazuleno[2,1&#8208;d]pyrimidin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones. Heating of these products in phosphoryl chloride led to 4&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;perfluoroalkylazuleno[2,1&#8208;d]pyrimidines. We also evaluated the reactivity of these pyrimidin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones and pyrimidine derivatives toward the electrophilic and nucleophilic substitution reactions, revealing that a variety of functional groups can be incorporated into these derivatives. The NMR studies, NICS calculations, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analyses revealed structural features including the bond&#8208;length alternation of the azuleno[2,1&#8208;d]pyrimidin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones and pyrimidine derivatives.

&lt;p&gt;Br&#248;nsted acid-mediated intramolecular cyclization of 2-amidoazulene derivatives, prepared by the reaction of 1-cyano-2-aminoazulene derivatives with perfluoroalkyl acid anhydrides, resulted in the formation of 2-perfluoroalkylazuleno[2,1-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]pyrimidin-4(3&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-ones. Heating of these products in phosphoryl chloride led to 4-chloro-2-perfluoroalkylazuleno[2,1-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]pyrimidines. We also evaluated the reactivity of these pyrimidin-4(3&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-ones and pyrimidine derivatives toward the electrophilic and nucleophilic substitution reactions, revealing that a variety of functional groups can be incorporated into these derivatives. The NMR studies, NICS calculations, and single-crystal X-ray structure analyses revealed structural features including the bond-length alternation of the azuleno[2,1-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]pyrimidin-4(3&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-ones and pyrimidine derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Direct &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Esters Using Styrenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A mild photocatalyzed approach to achieve the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of esters via formation of an &#945; &#8208;radical is disclosed here. Cesium enolates of esters were generated in&#8197;situ using Cs2CO3 as a base. A subsequent photocatalyzed oxidation at the &#945;&#8208;carbon of these enolates produced an &#945;&#8208;radical that was added into activated alkenes. This is the first example accessing the &#945;&#8208;carbon radical of esters in photoredox catalyed transformations.

Abstract
A general method for the functionalization of 4a&#8208;aza&#8208;8a&#8208;boranaphthalene in the position &#946; to the nitrogen atom has been developed. This method is based on a regioselective iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation process for the introduction of a boronate group, which can subsequently be transformed into a variety of aryl or alkynyl groups via cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Selective mono&#8208; or difunctionalization can be achieved by controlling the reaction conditions during the borylation step. The photophysical properties of the obtained 3&#8208; or 3,6&#8208;substituted BN&#8208;naphthalenes have been evaluated, and some of them have been found to be significantly fluorescent, with fluorescence quantum yields up to 0.85.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling of Aryl Phosphates with Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A step&#8208;economical and operationally simple nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of aryl phosphates with aryl bromides through C&#8722;O bond cleavage, which precluded the employment of relatively moisture&#8208;labile and unreadily available organometallics, was developed. The reaction proceeded smoothly in the presence of magnesium turnings and lithium chloride in THF to afford the corresponding biaryls in moderate to good yields with reasonable functionality tolerance.

Abstract
We report a photocatalytic strategy for selective reduction of nitroarenes to azoxy&#8208;, azo&#8208; and hydrazo&#8208;compounds catalyzed by bismuth porphyrin metal organic framework (Bi&#8208;MOF) through controlling time, atmosphere, or the quantity of NaBH4 under mild conditions (Rt, Light). The photocatalytic protocol exhibited excellent functional group compatibility, and the recyclability of Bi&#8208;MOF was demonstrated by five cycle tests. More importantly, the scale&#8208;up experiment of 10&#8197;g can also be carried out smoothly with excellent yield of 95%. This green and effective photocatalytic strategy provides a practical possibility for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of azo intermediates.

Abstract
Herein, Bi(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type annulation of sulfonyl o&#8208;hydroxyacetophenones with benzofused cycloethers is described. This single&#8208;step strategy provides a variety of functionalized dibenzofused medium&#8208;size (9&#8211;12) oxacycles through the formation of carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;oxygen single bonds. Further, the oxidative application of target oxacycles was investigated. The chemical structures of the key products were determined based on the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. In the overall process, water was generated as the byproduct.

         <dc:description>High&#8208;valent Cu(III) trifluoromethyl complexes with 1,3&#8208;diketonates as bidentate oxygen donor ligands LCuIII(CF3)2 were prepared for the first time and fully characterized, including by X&#8208;ray crystallography. These complexes are bench stable and soluble in most organic solvents. Promising reactivity of Cu(III) trifluoromethyl diketonates in radical and radical&#8211;polar crossover trifluoromethylation reactions was demonstrated. Direct C&#8211;H trifluoromethylation of electron&#8208;rich arenes and indoles using Cu(III) trifluoromethyl diketonates under blue light irradiation is described.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In a tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3]&#8208;catalyzed reaction of alkenes with cyanogen halides (XCN), BrCN proceeds in a cyanation/bromination manner, in which a cationic CN character is realized. The reaction using ICN switched the mode to iodination/cyanation for enamide substrates and electron&#8208;enriched styrenes. The origin of the iodination/cyanation is the B(C6F5)3&#8208;enhanced &#963;&#8208;hole generated on ICN.</dc:description>

         <title>3H&#8208;Phenothiazin&#8208;3&#8208;one: A New Photocatalyst for the Aerobic Photochemical Oxidation of Sulfides to Sulfoxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aerobic photochemistry is a rapidly advancing field that provides sustainable solutions for traditional transformations. In this study, 3H&#8208;phenothiazin&#8208;3&#8208;one is identified as a photocatalyst for the photochemical oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides. This new photocatalytic method uses a low catalyst loading (0.05 mol%), molecular oxygen as the sole oxidant, and a blue LED lamp as the irradiation source. It can be applied to the oxidation of both alkyl&#8208;aryl and alkyl&#8208;alkyl sulfides. Moreover, the method is also applicable in the synthesis of the known pharmaceutically active compounds Modafinil and Sulforaphane.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Zinc chelate complexes can be generated in situ from N&#8208;acyl hydrazones by treatment with isopropyl zinc iodide. These complexes couple with alkyl and fluorinated radicals under photoredox conditions. Alkyl radicals were generated from organozinc halides using an organic photocatalyst and afford hydrazines as a result of reductive mode of addition. Fluorinated radicals were formed from perfluorinated alkyl iodides under photoredox conditions leading to fluoroalkylated hydrazones via neutral reaction pathway.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The palladium (II) catalyzed direct C3&#8208;(sp2)&#8208;H alkenylation of five membered heterocyclic aldehydes has been developed using 3&#8208;aminobutanoic acid as a catalytic transient directing group. A wide range of heterocyclic aldehydes reacted with various acrylates to afford highly site&#8208;selective C3&#8208;alkenylated products. This method features an exclusive E&#8208;selective alkenylation at the C3&#8208;position of heterocyclic aldehydes with a broad substrate scope.

         <dc:description>This study reports a mild reaction&#8211;condition approach for the direct C&#8211;C bond cleavage of amides to form hydantoin structures in the presence of 4&#8208;methylpyridine and a base. This approach presents an amide C&#8211;C bond cleavage strategy enabling nucleophilic addition to the amide carbonyl involving a reactive spiro intermediate. A broad spectrum of pseudo peptide Ugi adducts as bifunctional starting materials was synthesized and used in this transformation. The mechanistic pathway of this reaction was investigated using experimental and theoretical studies.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A copper&#8208;catalyzed direct C(sp2)&#8208;H bond aminosulfonylation of maleimides is demonstrated. This protocol enables concurrent construction of C(sp2)&#8208;N and C(sp2)&#8208;SO2 bonds in one&#8208;step and features high efficiency, broad substrate scopes, good functional&#8208;group tolerance, and mild reaction conditions. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction probably involves a radical way. Significantly, this method is applicable to synthesize derivatives of pharmaceuticals such as Desloratadine, Fluoxetine, Atomoxetine, and Maprotiline.

Abstract
Substituted piperidine rings are a common motif in natural products and pharmaceutical drugs. The asymmetric synthesis of piperidines bearing multiple stereocentres remains a challenge, and current approaches often rely on lengthy reaction sequences and &#8216;chiral pool&#8217; strategies. Herein, we report multi&#8208;enzymatic and chemo&#8208;enzymatic methods that allow the preparation of piperidines with three chirality centres in only two steps from achiral diketoester precursors. Stereocontrol is achieved by a highly enantioselective transamination leading to optically pure (ee &gt;99%) enamine or imine intermediates, followed by diastereoselective reduction of these unsaturated N&#8208;heterocycles using either platinum(0)&#8208;catalysed flow hydrogenation or enzymatic imine reduction. In the latter case, coupling of the two biocatalytic reactions in a concurrent one&#8208;pot process is possible, thus reducing the synthetic sequence to a single biotransformation. In total, nine trisubstituted piperidines were prepared in high stereoisomeric purities (dr &#8805;98:2) and isolated yields of up to 73%. Lead&#8208;likeness analysis of five representative products using an open&#8208;source webtool suggests that these compounds possess considerable application potential as building blocks in drug discovery.

Abstract
The established process proceeds through copper (II)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722; functionalization of &#946;&#8208;diketones/&#946;&#8208;ketoesters with 2&#8208;bromobenzaldehyde oximes followed by the intramolecular cyclization of in&#8197;situ generated acylated intermediates to deliver isoquinoline N&#8208;oxides. The copper(II) acetate catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization showed maximum efficacy at 60&#8201;&#176;C in methanol/toluene as solvent. The described reaction conditions were applicable over a wide range of substrates with a variety of functional groups to yield isoquinoline N&#8208;oxides in yields up to 85%. The developed approach was further elucidated by means of control experiments and DFT calculations.

         <title>Catalytic Cycloisomerization of Enyne Diesters Derived from Biaryls and Related Substrates</title>

Abstract
Enyne diesters derived from biaryls and related substrates undergo intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition and concomitant cyclo&#8208;reversion when treated with 10&#8197;mol% In(OTf)3 in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane. This enyne metathesis type cycloisomerization reaction enables the synthesis of phenanthrene, benzophenanthrene, benzotetraphene and other polycyclic (hetero)aromatic compounds bearing a synthetically useful diethyl &#946;&#8208;(hetero)arylidene malonate moiety in a step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economic manner. In(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed two independent intramolecular cycloisomerization on substrates 5&#8201;a and 5&#8201;b provides direct access to benzotetraphenes 6&#8201;a and 6&#8201;b containing bis(diethyl &#946;&#8208;phenylmethylene malonate) moiety. Tetrasubstituted vinylidene malonate 4&#8201;a, substiututed by two different aromatic groups, is stereoselectively converted into E&#8208; and Z&#8208;isomer of triaryl group containing all carbon tetrasubstituted olefins (8&#8201;a, 8&#8201;a&#8242; and 8&#8201;b) via Pd&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective decarboxylative arylation reaction.

Grignard reagent&#8208;mediated and solvent&#8208;controlled regioselective 1,8&#8208;addition of &#945;&#8208;(2&#8208;thienylidene)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketosulfones provides diversified substituted 2&#8208;thienylmethyl &#946;&#8208;ketosulfones in moderate yields in a diethyl ether&#8211;dioxane cosolvent and dioxane (v/v=4/1) under ice&#8208;bath conditions. The 1,4&#8208;addition of &#945;&#8208;heterocyclic &#946;&#8208;ketosulfones was also studied. The structure of the key product was confirmed via X&#8208;ray analysis. The uses of various reaction solvents and organomagnesium bromides were investigated for transition metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H functionalization. Related plausible mechanisms are proposed and discussed. The DFT calculations are utilized to rationalize the regioselectivity of the 1,8&#8208;addition reaction.

Abstract
A three&#8208;component vicinal carbophosphorothiolation of vinyl arenes by the cooperation of visible light and iron(II) catalysis has been established for the synthesis of S&#8208;alkyl phosphorothioates. Noteworthy, the late&#8208;stage functionalization of biologically active compounds has been performed using this procedure. The preliminary mechanistic study reveals that the catalytic cycle is accomplished by single&#8208;electron transfer (SET).

Abstract
A three&#8208;component strategy for the synthesis of an important class of trifluoromethylated cyanopyrazoles from aldehydes, malononitrile and trifluorodiazoethane is reported. This approach involves a domino Knoevenagel condensation/1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition/dehydrocyanation process. Surprisingly, the use of cyanoacetate in place of malononitrile resulted in the formation of trifluoromethylated cyanopyrazolines. The protocol provides access to a wide variety of trisubstituted pyrazoles and pyrazolines thus expanding the chemical space for these structural units.

Abstract
Herein, an eco&#8208;friendly and atom&#8208;economical electrochemical methodology with isatins and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinolines through NHPI/O2&#8208;mediated intermolecular oxidation/annulation is disclosed, leading to a variety of polycyclic quinazolinones in 46&#8211;82% yields. This oxidative cyclization proceeded in transition metal&#8208; and strong oxidant&#8208;free conditions and generated H2 and CO2 as byproducts. Additionally, late&#8208;stage functionalization and broad substrate scope demonstrated the synthetic usefulness of this protocol.

         <title>Highly Atom&#8208;Economic and Efficient Electrochemical Selenylative Annulation of 2&#8208;Alkynyl Biaryls</title>

Abstract
A catalyst&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free, highly efficient, scalable, and sustainable synthetic method is developed for the selenylative annulation of 2&#8208;alkynyl biaryls or 2&#8208;heteroaryl&#8208;substituted alkynyl benzenes with readily available diselenides under electrochemical conditions to synthesize a wide variety of selanyl polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic heteroaromatics in high to excellent yield up to 99% at room temperature in a short time (2&#8208;5&#8197;h). The transformation required only electricity as a green reagent and produces hydrogen gas as the only innocuous byproduct. Notably, the green chemistry metrics of the protocol are found excellent. Mechanistic studies revealed a radical pathway being initiated by the in&#8197;situ generation of the corresponding selenyl radical from diselenides under electrochemical conditions. Significantly, a direct comparison of the electrochemical approach with that of our previously developed iodine&#8208;catalyzed chemical approach revealed that the electrochemical approach is not only catalyst&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free, but also more energy&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;yielding, sustainable, and practical.

Abstract
Selective reduction of nitro&#8208;containing arenes and heteroarenes was achieved in 5&#8197;minutes at room temperature utilizing inexpensive NaBH4 as a hydrogen source and a newly developed Ni@N&#8722;C catalyst, obtained via a simple carbon coating process without the need for an external carbon source. A wide variety of nitro derivatives, including pharmaceutical molecules, was successfully reduced to the corresponding amines in yields ranging from 45% to 99% using the Ni@N&#8722;C catalyst under general batch conditions. The reactivity and selectivity of the nitro reduction were further enhanced by a continuous flow reaction system, especially when a newly designed Y&#8208;type column was used, and the Osimertinib intermediate was produced on gram scale after 24&#8197;hours without any nickel metal contamination or silica gel chromatography purification.

Abstract
A Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling reaction for the regioselective assembly of various monofluoroalkene derivatives was disclosed using readily available difluorovinyl tosylates as fluorinated coupling partners. This strategy was intended for the preparation of fluorovinyl heterocycles, and the main OTs intermediates could be further processed to various fluorinated alkenyl compounds.

Abstract
(&#8722;)&#8208;Agelastatin A was synthetized employing a flow photorearrangement of a pyridinium salt, constructing in one step the cyclopentene core possessing the desired functionalities and relative configurations. A flow enzymatic kinetic resolution of the resulting bicyclic vinyl aziridine delivered the enantiopure precursor to the natural product. This total synthesis required the use of a single protective group. Two novel agelastatin N3&#8208;derivatives were synthesized and their cytotoxicity evaluated against a series of cancer cell lines, which corroborated the importance of unsubstituted N3 in the biological activity of (&#8722;)&#8208;agelastatin A.

         <title>Carboline Regioisomers Based on Unified Synthetic Approaches</title>

Abstract
Carbolines are a prominent class of tricyclic alkaloids omnipresent in natural products and bioactive compounds. Four different carboline regioisomers are known (&#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, and &#948;&#8208;carbolines), which can be classified according to the nitrogen atom position inside the pyridine ring. As an emerging structural motif in drug discovery, a multitude of synthetic methods have been established for the construction of carboline frameworks, which in general requires customized approaches for the assembly of each regioisomer. Distinguishingly, their frameworks are also accessible from unified approaches, which are capable of generating multiple regioisomers, thus suitable for introducing diversity in isomeric carbolines. In this review, the construction of isomeric carbolines based on unified synthetic approaches is summarized.

         <title>Fluoroalkyl Iodides in Fluoroalkylative Difunctionalization of C&#8722;C Multiple Bonds</title>

Abstract
Fluorinated alkyl iodides serve as a convenient and inexpensive source of fluoroalkyl radicals that can readily undergo addition to the C&#8722;C unsaturated bonds of alkynes and alkenes which is the foundation for a variety of useful synthetic protocols. Since 2010 this field has witnessed huge progress in several respects. First the portfolio of fluorinated alkyl iodides was extended beyond only simple perfluoroalkyl iodides (CnF2n+1I). In particular, employment of iododifluoro&#8722;methyl&#8208; carbonyls and phosphonates has enabled facile installation of the medicinally relevant difluoromethylene motif. Secondly, from a conceptual point of view, novel strategies for activation of fluoroalkyl iodides towards radical formation have been introduced, relying on the formation of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes, photoredox catalysis, frustrated Lewis pairs and transition metal catalysis, complementing prior approaches based on heat and UV induced C&#8722;I homolysis, radical initiators, and simple electron transfer processes. Based on these strategies a range of novel fluoroalkylative transformations of unsaturated systems have been added to classical iodoperfluoroalkylation. Broadly applicable protocols for simple fluoroalkylation and hydrofluoroalkylation, as well as for more sophisticated, complexity&#8208;building methods of fluoroalkylation&#8208;annulation and tandem multicomponent fluoroalkylations with concomitant installation of another functionality have been recently disclosed. This review summarizes the progress achieved since 2010 in the reactivity of fluoroalkyl iodides towards alkenes and alkynes with emphasis placed on the above&#8208;mentioned advances.

         <title>Radical Decyanations of Unactivated Carbon&#8208;CN Bonds: Recent Achievements and Mechanistic Studies</title>

Abstract
Decyanation is an important process in the synthesis of aromatic molecules in the studies of pharmaceutical research, medical and materials sciences. In late&#8208;stage modifications of privileged carbo/heterocyclic scaffolds, radical&#8208;type decyanation techniques have been devised to date. As a result, the chemistry of cyano&#8208;involved conversions, a hotly debated subject over the past few decades, has advanced significantly. The cyano group (CN), on the other hand, has rarely been acknowledged as a good reaction site due to its thermodynamic robustness. The most recent advancements in catalytic radical decyanation protocols that CN behaved as a leaving group has made are surveyed in this article. Following the introduction of a number of different reaction modes, the catalytic reactions that are used to activate the C&#8722;CN bonds are primarily categorized, and the text herein are divided into three groups: (1) photo&#8208;catalyzed decyanation transformations, (2) electro&#8208;catalyzed decyanation transformations, and (3) transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed or metal&#8208;free decyanation transformations. With an emphasis on the catalytic systems and synthetic applications in C&#8722;CN bond activation, this review will provide the readers with an overview of decyanation chemistry in radical reactions.

Abstract
A multicomponent tandem arylation reaction was established under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions to synthesize structurally diverse imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines. As N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline is not only a reactant but also a methylation reagent, its use affords an alternative route for methylation. This approach features mild reaction conditions and good functional group tolerance, providing 29 compounds in acceptable yields.

Abstract
A method for the construction of the indane skeleton through palladium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening diarylation of Cyclobutanols with aryl 1,2&#8208;dihalides has been described. The ring&#8208;expansion reaction involves &#946;&#8208;carbon elimination of Cyclobutanols and subsequent &#945;&#8208;carbon arylation of ketone to give 2&#8208;acylindanes in 42&#8211;93% yields.

Abstract
Introducing the primary amino group into aromatic ring is one of the most important study issues in organic chemistry, particularly for the pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals chemistry. Herein, we describe a photoinduced direct C&#8722;H amination of arenes with ammonia via the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H thianthrenation that forms a new C&#8722;N bond with excellent regioselectivity. The reaction is carried out under mild conditions, and with a wide range of functional group tolerance, such as sensitive &#8722;Cl, &#8722;Br, and &#8722;OH groups which are poorly tolerated in conventional approaches. Moreover, the synthetic utility of our amination protocol has been confirmed through late&#8208;stage modification and gram&#8208;scale synthesis of complex drug&#8208;like molecules.

         <title>Enantioselective C&#8722;P Bond Formation through C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization</title>

Abstract
An enantioselective C&#8722;P bond formation has been developed through a C(sp3)&#8722;H activation in an oxidation step followed by an organocatalyzed hydrophosphonylation protocol. The asymmetric organocatalytic Pudovik reaction has been achieved following a one&#8208;pot strategy, starting from different benzylic and allylic alcohols and dibenzyl phosphite, using MnO2 as the oxidant and a chiral squaramide as organocatalyst. The scope of the reaction provides enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxy phosphonates with yields from 40% to &gt;95% and enantioselectivities from 64% to &gt;99%. Furthermore, the use of this methodology has been demonstrated to form a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter, generating an acetophenone derivative in&#8197;situ, using diphenyl phosphite. Therefore, this approach represents an asymmetric strategy for constructing chiral C&#8722;P bonds, which are of interest to the pharmaceutical industry.

Abstract
Carbon dioxide is a harmful greenhouse gas, as well as a valuable resource. Here, a three&#8208;component cyclization reaction was developed for the synthesis of oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones by immobilizing CO2 under the electrochemistry and copper catalyst. Propargyl amide was used as the reaction substrate to capture carbon dioxide to produce carboxyl anion, while selenide produced electrophilic receptor to activate the triple bond under electrochemical conditions. Then, intramolecular cyclization reaction was carried out to obtain the target product. Through this environmentally friendly strategy, a series of important oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones was synthesized.

Abstract
Herein, we report a direct method to prepare alkylzinc compounds from functionalized alkyl bromides using cobalt catalysis under mild conditions. This procedure only requires a simple catalytic system composed of CoBr2 and bipyridine as ligand in a mixture of acetonitrile/pyridine. This reaction is stable under air and moisture conditions opening the way to an accessible procedure. A wide range of functional groups such as esters, cyano and halogens on primary and secondary alkyl bromides was well tolerated and gave high yields of the corresponding alkylzinc compounds. Additionally, we managed to form alkylzinc reagents bearing sensitive functional groups such as ketones and aldehydes with good yields. The direct application of these alkylzinc derivatives in palladium&#8208;catalyzed Negishi cross&#8208;coupling with various functionalized aryl bromides proved the efficiency and robustness of this methodology.

Abstract
Methods for chemical modification of proteins and peptides at certain positions are required for the preparation of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates, protein&#8208; or peptide&#8208;biotin conjugates, and conjugates used as therapeutics or as tools in biomedical research. We have developed chemical modification methods that use spirooxindole oxirane derivatives for the synthesis of protein&#8208; and peptide&#8208;conjugates. In most cases, the epoxide group of the spirooxindole oxirane derivatives reacted to form a covalent bond with certain histidine residues and/or the N&#8208;terminal amino group of peptides and proteins. The modification reactions of various proteins resulted in the formation of proteins modified at only one or two positions.

         <dc:description>A concise and flexible protocol to assemble structurally diverse 1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]quinoline&#8208;1,3(2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;diones (29 examples, 70&#8208;87% yields) has been developed via an unprecedented one&#8208;pot stepwise synthesis. The potentially valuable quinine&#8208;fused heterocycles were synthetized by utilizing aliphatic alcohol hydroxyl as directing group which promoted a sequential transformation to form functionalized aminomaleimides, and then underwent an I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;oxidized tandem annulations. This efficient and practical route involved the formation of multiple new chemical bonds (C=N, 2C&#8208;N, C&#8208;C) in a one&#8208;pot fashion under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Olefinic C(sp2)&#8211;H Activation/Carbene Insertion/Ester Hydrolysis/Cyclization with Diazo Esters for the Synthesis of Multisubstituted Furanones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A copper&#8208;catalyzed olefinic C(sp2)&#8211;H activation/carbene insertion/ester hydrolysis/cyclization sequence has been developed for the synthesis of substituted 2(5H)&#8208;furanones employing readily available enaminones and diazo esters as substrates. This method features operationally simple and good functional group tolerance. The transformation could be scaled up to gram quantities and the obtained 2(5H)&#8208;furanone derivatives could be easily converted to a wide range of useful synthetic building blocks, indicative of the applicability of the synthetic strategy. Isotope labeling experiments demonstrated the ester group of diazo esters was hydrolyzed during the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Tetraazamacrocycles by Sequential Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Substitution Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we focused on the synthesis of tetraazamacrocycles, an essential class of macrocyclic compounds with applications in coordination chemistry, pharmaceuticals, and catalysis. To accomplish this, we developed a ligand&#8208;controlled palladium&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution approach using bicyclic bridgehead phosphoramidite (briphos) ligands. This approach allowed us to selectively achieve [1 + 1] and [1 + 2] allylic aminations between allylic diols and diamines, while avoiding the formation of cyclic [1 + 1] products. By combining this approach with sequential acetylation and allylic amination, we successfully synthesized tetraazamacrocycles with ring sizes ranging from 16 to 38. These findings demonstrate the potential of a sequential allylation strategy for synthesizing complex molecules with broad applications in the fields of chemistry, pharmaceuticals, and medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Trivalent Phosphine&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions Using Fluorinated Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The development of novel synthetic methodologies to incorporate fluorine/s or fluoroalkyl group/s into the frameworks of organic molecules has become a highly prioritized research area because such modifications can tune their physiochemical and biological properties. In recent years, nucleophilic phosphine catalysis has been extensively explored to achieve this goal, and significant progress has been made. This review summarizes the methodological advancements of cycloaddition, addition and coupling reactions employing fluorinated building blocks as electrophilic and/or nucleophilic reaction partners under phosphine catalysis to construct structurally and synthetically valuable organofluorine compounds, with special emphasis on the synthetic strategies, proposed reaction mechanisms and synthetic utilities.

         <title>Harnessing Supported Gold Nanoparticle as a Single&#8208;Electron Transfer Catalyst for Decarboxylative Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We found that gold nanoparticles function as single&#8208;electron transfer catalysts to promote decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling between N&#8208;hydroxy phthalimide esters and disilanes or diborons. A variety of disilanes coupled with alkyl radicals could be generated from N&#8208;hydroxy phthalimide esters via single&#8208;electron reduction by active carbon&#8208;supported gold nanoparticle catalysts to afford diverse alkylsilanes without the need for external bases. Furthermore, the present gold catalytic system was also effective for decarboxylative carbon&#8211;boron coupling to afford alkyl boronates. A detailed mechanistic investigation revealed that single&#8208;electron transfer mediated by supported gold nanoparticles enabled the generation of alkyl radical and silyl radical, thereby enabling radical cross&#8208;coupling. The reusability and environmentally&#8208;friendly nature of supported gold catalyst as well as the scalability of the reaction system enable the practical transformation of carboxylic acid derivatives into value&#8208;added organosilicon and organoboron compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation of Ynamides with Aminocarbonyls as a Route to 2&#8208;Aminoquinolines Diversely Substituted at the 4th&#8208;Position</title>

Abstract
Gold&#8208;catalyzed interplay between ynamides and aminocarbonyls comprises a route to 2&#8208;aminoquinolines. This modular annulation proceeds under relatively mild conditions (Ph3PAuCl/AgNTf2 5&#8197;mol&#8201;%, DCE, 60&#8211;80 &#176;C), and a number of functionalities were compatible (42&#8197;examples; 25&#8211;98% yields). In contrast to a group of other gold&#8208;catalyzed methods employing the ynamide/amine combinations for the assembly of 2&#8208;aminoquinolines, the developed approach utilizes a diversity of aminocarbonyl substrates and, in particular, allows a variation of the substituents in the 4th quinoline position. The synthetic potential of the obtained heterocyclic products was illustrated by post&#8208;modifications of the quinoline backbone and the peripheral substituents.

Abstract
Effective access to azolium salts with varying stereoelectronic properties has always fascinated the organometallic chemists. Herein, we described a Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;step access to diverse meta&#8208;alkylated N&#8208;aryl (benz)imidazolium salts (&gt;40&#8197;examples) via &#963;&#8208;bond activation strategy starting from the readily available azolium salts using alkyl bromide. Notably, the present method is compatible with a wide range of azolium salts and secondary/tertiary alkyl bromides, including the biologically relevant motifs. Various control experiments along with the DFT calculation established the reaction pathway of orthometalated Ru(II)&#8208;NHC complex (6) formation followed by the generation of a Ru(III)&#8208;intermediate, which controls the observed meta&#8208;selectivity, via single electron transfer. Crucially, detailed insight of the reaction mechanism helped to comprehend why some substrates are challenging for this methodology.

         <title>Benzodithiazoles&#8208;Sulfoximines: Preparation, Properties and Reactivities as Radical Perfluoroalkylating Agents</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We describe the preparation of S&#8208;perfluoroalkyl benzodithiazole trioxides as radical perfluoroalkylating reagents. Their syntheses were performed on a multi&#8208;gram scale by an oxidative cyclization connecting the nitrogen of a sulfoximine and a sulfur atom previously introduced in the ortho position of this group. The structures and properties of these new molecules were carefully examined by X&#8208;Ray diffraction, DFT calculations and cyclic voltammetry. These data clearly highlight the enhanced reactivity of these cyclic sulfoximines compared to their open analogues. This was confirmed by photoredox catalysis experiments that revealed interesting reactivity, most especially for the introduction of di&#8208; and monofluoroalkyl chains.

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot synthesis of 2,3,4&#8208;unprotected &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;glycopyranosides from glycals and amines with exclusive &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity under room temperature conditions is reported. This method was achieved via palladium&#8208;catalyzed Tsuji&#8208;Trost amination followed by dihydroxylation directly, tolerating anilines, heterocyclic aromatic amines, and N,O&#8208;dimethylhydroxylamine, especially the reaction of primary amines and glycals has not been reported before. Furthermore, the protocol was applied to modify clinical drugs (prazosin, imiquimod) and construct the analogue of the natural product amphimedoside A.

         <title>Cobalt(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Diamination of &#945;&#8208;Alkyl Styrenes with Anilines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A commercially available cobalt complex Cp*CoIII(CO)I2 has been found to effectively catalyze the diamination of &#945;&#8208;alkyl styrenes with anilines under a mild reaction condition, using dioxygen as the oxidant. This reaction features a reasonably good substrate scope of amines and a good functional group tolerance. Preliminary mechanistic studies have shown that Cp*CoIII(CO)I2 alone can promote the diamination reaction.

         <title>Bench&#8208;Stable Electrophilic Reagents for the Direct Di&#8208; and Trifluoroethylthiolation of Indoles.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This inside cover picture illustrates how the developed saccharin&#8208;based electrophilic reagents can incorporate SCH2CF3 and SCH2CF2H motifs into electronically rich substrates such as indole or pyrrole under mild and direct conditions. These reactions are favored by the presence of trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) and exhibit high compatibility with water, enabling open&#8208;flask reactions. Moreover, they allow access to sulfone derivatives, providing agrochemical modification, among others. Details can be found in the Communication by Omar Boutureira and co&#8208;workers (P. Casas&#250;s, J. Mestre, M. Bern&#250;s, S. Castill&#243;n, O. Boutureira, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2023, 365, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202300586)

         <title>Recent Progress in Synthetic Applications of Cyclic Hypervalent Iodine(III) Reagents.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture, designed by Yoshimura, illustrates applications of benziodoxoles as group transfer reagents. Cyclic hypervalent iodine compounds based on the benziodoxole system have higher stability compared to their acyclic analogues, which makes possible the preparation and safe handling of the reagents with special ligands such as azido, cyano, and trifluoromethyl groups. Substituted benziodoxoles have been widely utilized as reagents for transfer of the substituent on hypervalent iodine to organic substrates. Details can be found in the Review Article by Akira Yoshimura, Akio Saito, and Viktor Zhdankin (A. Yoshimura, A. Saito, V. V. Zhdankin, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2023, 365, xxxx&#8208;xxxx; DOl: 10.1002/adsc.202300275)

Abstract
A synthetic method to prepare 1,2&#8208;diamines efficiently that relies on the 4CzPN&#8208;catalysed &#945;&#8208;aminoalkylation of azomethine imines by secondary and tertiary &#945;&#8208;silylamines under blue light emitting diode (LED) light (456&#8197;nm) is described. Achieved under metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free reaction conditions at room temperature, the synthetic protocol was shown to afford product yields up to 99% and applicable to the late&#8208;stage functionalisation of three drug molecules and the gramme&#8208;scale preparation of one example.

         <dc:description>Abstract. This work describes a suitable approach for palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective C8&#8208;H olefination of 1&#8208;naphthamides. Interestingly, naphthamide fused lactam 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[de]isoquinolin&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives were also synthesized in case of a particular class of napthamides. This protocol was found well compatible with a diverse range of acrylates and styrenes, leading product formation in good yields along with a wide functional group tolerance. The developed strategy was further applicable for the synthesis of different drug derivatives.

         <title>Dual Nickel/Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of N&#8208;formyl N,N&#8217;&#8208;Diaryl Ethylenediamines via Multiple C&#8722;N/C&#8722;C Coupling of Nitroarenes with Trimethylamine</title>

Abstract
N,N&#8217;&#8208;Diaryl ethylenediamines are common feedstocks in organic synthesis and important structural motifs in medicinal chemistry. Whereas the C&#8722;N formation reactions based on anilines and aryl halides are the most direct methods to access N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl ethylenediamines, the photocatalytic synthetic version remains undeveloped. Herein we describe the dual nickel/photoredox&#8208;catalyzed amination reaction using nitroarenes and trimethylamine as reaction substrates. This cascade transformation hinges on the multiple C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C coupling events based on the nitrogen radical and &#945;&#8208;aminomethyl radical derived from nitroarene and trimethylamine, respectively. A variety of N&#8208;formyl N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl ethylenediamines can be obtained under the reaction protocol. Subsequent hydrolysis offers the N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl ethylenediamines for further derivatizations.

         <title>Metal Free Activation of Alkynyl Glycosyl Carbonate Donors</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Accessing homogenous glycoconjugates is of significance for assessing their biophysical activities and sometimes as vaccine candidate. Synthesis of glycoconjugates involves two species of which, glycosyl donor plays pivotal role in controlling the outcome of the glycosylation. Recently discovered alkynyl glycosyl carbonate donors possess self&#8208;stability, high reactivity, and fast reaction time (15&#8211;30&#8197;min) when activated with [Au]/[Ag]&#8208;catalysts. Herein, we report metal free conditions for the activation of the same alkynyl glycosyl carbonate donors using I2/TMSOTf in stoichiometric quantities. Extrusion product was characterized to be the vinylidene iodide by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The reaction conditions were illustrated to be suitable for synthesis of various glycosides, purine/pyrimidine nucleosides and a pentasaccharide repeating unit of Klebsiella pneumoniae (O&#8208;3&#8208;antigen).

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Two saccharine&#8208;based electrophilic reagents were developed for the direct introduction of SCH2CF3 and SCH2CF2H motifs via a C&#8722;S bond forming reaction. Their large&#8208;scale preparation and reactivity performance has been carefully examined, enabling access to a series of indoles through open&#8208;flask reactions. Sulfone and sulfoxide analogs (S(O)nCH2RF, n=1,2) are also accessible by sequential oxidation reactions.

         <title>Catalytic Difluoromethylation of Alkenes with Difluoroacetic Anhydride: Reactivity of Fluorinated Diacyl Peroxides and Radicals.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates the difluoromethylation of alkenes with bis(difluoroacetyl) peroxide (BDFAP), which is easily preparable from difluoroacetic anhydride and hydrogen peroxide. The use of a copper catalyst enables amino&#8208;, allylic, and oxy&#8208;difluoromethylation under thermal conditions. Moreover, metal&#8208;free carbo&#8208;difluoromethylation of an alkene bearing a pendant aromatic group takes place through a radical chain mechanism. Computational investigations shed light on the unique reactivity of BDFAP and the difluoromethyl radical. Details can be found in Research Article by Shintaro Kawamura, Mikiko Sodeoka and co&#8208;workers (T. Tagami, Y. Mitani, S. Kawamura, M. Sodeoka, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2023, 365, xxxx&#8208;xxxx; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202300337)

         <title>Dehydrogenative Fluorination of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes to Access Multi&#8208;Substituted Trifluoromethylalkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A dehydrogenative fluorination method is developed to access multi&#8208;substituted trifluoromethylalkenes starting from a variety of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. The reaction proceeds with electrophilic fluorination source NFSI only and accommodates a wide range of functional groups, thus complementing the previously reported protocols. Additionally, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted stereoinversion is revealed to enable the access to E&#8208;isomer enriched products.

         <title>Recent Developments in Selenylation and Thiolation of Alkenes via Three&#8208;component Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Alkenes are valuable feedstocks in organic synthesis. Selenium or sulfur&#8208;containing coumpounds with a neighboring functional group can be easily prepared by direct difunctionalization of alkenes via three&#8208;component reactions. It will reduce the number of steps and waste generation, and form complicated molecules from simple starting materials. Herein, recent developments (2013&#8211;2022) have been summarized via two categories: (1)&#8197;selenylation via seleniranium intermediates or Se&#8208;centered radicals; (2)&#8197;thiolation with more diverse mechanisms and products Reactions with electron&#8208;rich arenes, alcohols, water, acids, NaN3, amines, KSCN, and sulfamides, TMSNCS, TMSN3, Et3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3HF, SOCl2, HCl, NFSI, tBuONO, pyridinium salts, tBuOOH, ArN2BF4, CO2, CO, O2, CF3SO2Cl, R2P(O)&#8722;H, (RO)2P(O)SH, (RO)2P(O)OH et al will be discussed. We hope this review will do help for future research in this area.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Transformations Involving the Heck Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Elaborated molecular architectures including complex carbocycles, heterocycles, and polycyclic molecular structures represent an important class of organic compounds because they are ubiquitous structural units in a broad variety of biologically and pharmacologically relevant natural products, medicinal molecules, and functional materials. A major challenge in modern synthetic methodology is the development of strategically efficient and selective construction of these compounds from readily available starting materials. Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations involving Heck reaction as the pivotal step have afforded a powerful approach for accessing sophisticated polycyclic skeletons from a set of easy&#8208;to handle starting materials, thus highlighting its potential significance in streamlining the drug discovery process. Over the past few decades, significant effort has been devoted to accessing complex polycyclic derivatives in efficient and versatile routes, and a number of powerful and direct synthetic strategies have been reported. In this review, the latest advances in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations involving Heck reaction as the critical step are summarized, which could be divided into six categories: 1) Heck/Sonogashira tandem reaction; 2) Heck/Suzuki tandem reaction; 3) Heck/Heck tandem reaction; 4) Heck/Hiyama tandem reaction; 5) Heck/Cacchi tandem reaction; 6) Heck/C&#8722;H bond functionalization tandem reaction.

         <title>Fluorinated Substrates as Michael Acceptors Towards Fine Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Michael addition reaction, known since the 19th century, appeared as a relevant method with a great potential to design new organofluorinated fine chemicals and enlarged their structural diversity. In the Michael addition reaction for the synthesis of organofluorine compounds, the fluorinated blocks can be both used as the Michael donors and acceptors, but the latter is relatively rare. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the use of fluorinated substrates as Michael acceptors in Michael reactions.

Abstract
This report describes a general method for the one&#8208;pot direct N&#8208;acylation of N&#8208;heterocycles using our previously developed 4&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethylamino)pyridine N&#8208;oxide (DMAPO)/di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl dicarbonate (Boc2O) system. This system enables one&#8208;pot N&#8208;acylation reactions to provide bulky N&#8208;acyl heterocycles starting from a wide variety of less nucleophilic N&#8208;heterocycles and sterically hindered &#945;&#8208;fully substituted carboxylic acids in high yields. Moreover, this one&#8208;pot method does not involve pre&#8208;activation of substrates. The protocol has been successfully extended to one&#8208;pot N&#8208;acylation of 7&#8208;azaindoles.

         <title>Hypervalent Halogen Compounds in Electrochemical Reactions: Advantages and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The clean and facile electrochemical synthesis of hypervalent iodine reagents is a fast growing field. In the past 5&#8197;years, a diverse number of reaction types have been established, from fluorinations, oxidative cyclizations, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;H couplings and oxidations. Electrochemistry is beneficial in terms of sustainability as the requirement for chemical oxidants is eliminated. This contributes to cleaner processes with limited by&#8208;product waste. Often, the purification of iodine(III) compounds is simple, since electrolysis is performed in the absence stoichiometric oxidants. Significant breakthroughs have been made recently, including the first asymmetric application, electrocatalytic applications, and even the synthesis of bromine(III) reagents using similar methodologies.

Abstract
Spirocyclic frameworks could enhance the drug&#8208;like properties of planar bioactive molecules by increasing their three&#8208;dimensionality, making the development of synthetic methodology and bioactivity assays for spiro compounds highly attractive. This work reported the silver&#8208;catalyzed tandem cycloisomerization/Povarov reaction between &#946;&#8208;alkynyl ketones and hexahydro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazines, access to spiro[isochromene&#8208;1,4&#8217;&#8208;quinoline]. This synthetic protocol was characterized by remarkable efficiency, low catalyst&#8208;loading and high diastereoselectivity. Moreover, the spirocyclic quinolines exhibited good cytotoxicity in U937 cells by activating the Notch&#8208;signaling pathway exclusively.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of 1,4&#8208;Dienes via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Allylation of N&#8208;Tosylhydrazones</title>

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed allylic C&#8722;H oxidative allylation of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones to synthesize skipped 1,4&#8208;dienes is demonstrated. This direct allylic alkylation reaction has excellent site selectivity, tolerates a wide range of functional groups, and affords 1,4&#8208;dienes in moderate to good yield. Moreover, this olefination method allows the regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of 1,4&#8208;dienes containing a trisubstituted alkene. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction undergoes allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H activation and a subsequent carbene migratory insertion.

         <title>Continuous Synthesis of Epoxides from Alkenes by Hydrogen Peroxide with Titanium Silicalite&#8208;1 Catalyst Using Flow Reactors</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Abstract. Continuous&#8208;flow epoxidation of aliphatic and aromatic alkenes with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was carried out to give epoxides using a fixed&#8208;bed liquid flow reactor equipped with a solid titanium silicalite&#8208;1 (TS&#8208;1) catalyst column. The developed flow reaction enables continuous synthesis of 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;epoxybutane from 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;butene in 90%&#8211;98% yields (22.4&#8197;g) for 150&#8197;h from a catalyst column of 5&#8197;mm inner diameter with 100&#8197;mm length. Employment of a mixed solution of MeCN and MeOH with preservation of the Ti active site in TS&#8208;1 crystal structures with few defects permits continuous epoxidation of less&#8208;reactive long&#8208;chain terminal alkene and multifunctional alkene to give epoxides in 12%&#8211;98% yields with 78%&#8211;99% selectivity.

Abstract
The Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation reaction between activated amides and arenes was carried out by employing [Pd(cinnamyl)Cl]2 and Cu(OTf)2 as catalysts. A range of N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;N&#8208;tosylbenzamides, which were substituted at the phenyl ring of the benzamide moiety, underwent reaction with various arenes, such as mesitylene, toluene, anisole, 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzene, o&#8208;xylene, m&#8208;xylene, and p&#8208;xylene, affording the corresponding diaryl ketones with yields ranging from 49% to 89%.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free O&#8208;Arylation of N&#8208;Alkoxybenzamides Enabled by Aryl(trimethoxyphenyl)iodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we develop a metal catalyst&#8208;free protocol for O&#8208;arylation of benzamide hydroxamate esters. The chemoselective O&#8208; versus N&#8208;arylation of the amides was tuned by varying the electronic and/or steric properties of the diaryliodonium salt and/or the substrate. The O&#8208;arylation reaction would preferentially occur for sterically and electronically diverse substrates. This study, which reveals the possibility of substituent&#8208; and reagent&#8208;controlled chemoselectivity, with diaryliodonium salts might attract interest in the area of hypervalent iodine chemistry.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present here an iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidative Csp3&#8211;Csp3 bond cleavage of unstrained tertiary alkyl aromatics to provide a range of synthetically useful arylketones even with H2O2 as the oxidant. This method is operationally simple, scalable, and eco&#8208;friendly, as well as suitable for the late&#8208;stage oxidation of complex molecules bearing hydroxy groups, making it a valuable tool in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Direct Synthesis of Sulfur&#8208;Containing Organophosphorus Compounds via Radical Processes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Phosphonothioates, phosphinothioates and phosphorothioates are regarded as an important class of sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds. Because of the unique P(O)S&#8722;R group, these compounds have important biological activities and thus have been widely used in the fields of pharmaceuticals and pesticides. In recent years, the development of sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds by radical processes has attracted considerable attention in organophosphorus chemistry. Along these lines, in this review, the recent advances in the synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds were systematically summarized. According to the different ways of generating radicals during the formation process of phosphonothioates, phosphinothioates and phosphorothioates, these transformations can be divided into four categories: (1) Oxidant or metal&#8208;free promoted radical transformation to fabricate sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds; (2) Copper&#8208;catalyzed radical transformation to produce sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds; (3) Photo&#8208;induced radical transformation to prepare sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds; (4) Electro&#8208;induced radical transformation to derive sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds.

         <title>Synthesis of Dibenzo[b,f]azepines via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade [4 + 3] Annulation of o&#8208;Alkenyl Bromoarenes and o&#8208;Bromoaniline Derivatives</title>

Abstract
A cascade [4+3] annulation of o&#8208;alkenyl bromoarenes and o&#8208;bromoaniline derivatives was described. Various dibenzo[b,f]azepines with substitutions on the 10/11 position were obtained in 14&#8211;97% yields. The synthetic versatility of this protocol is highlighted by the preparation of a precursor of the drug molecule oxcarbazepine, a gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and two product transformations. Unlike previous amination/Heck sequence, this cascade process is supposed to undergo a C(vinyl), C(aryl)&#8208;palladacycle involved pathway.

         <title>Thiols as Powerful Atom Transfer Catalyst: Opportunities in Photoredox&#8208;Mediated Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The employing visible light to drive organic transformations is the most promising choice to meet the needs for green synthesis, in which the reactions promoted by visible light may provide a more efficient and greener method. Currently, the most abundant methods for activation and functionalization of reaction substrates have relied on the direct single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) between the excited photocatalyst and substrates, and these wonderful works were summarized and docoumented in many reviews. As a complement to the above reactions, the photoredox&#8208;mediated atom transfer transformations (photocatalyst&#8208;to&#8208;HAT catalyst&#8208;to&#8208;substrates) to generate radical species are showing an explosively growing trend. In this review, we highlight recent significant developments in this rapidly growing area, mainly focusing on the photoinduced base&#8208;to&#8208;substrates charge transfer reactions.

         <title>Dibenzoylperoxide as a Versatile Oxidant for Oxidative Azidations of Phenols Using Quaternary Ammonium Iodides or Bromides.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Dibenzoylperoxide emerged as a versatile oxidant for quaternary ammonium iodide or bromide&#8208;catalyzed reactions of phenol derivatives with NaN3. While the use of iodides allowed for efficient benzylic azidations under these oxidative conditions, the use of bromides allowed for dearomative azidations instead. Both approaches have been successfully applied to different phenol derivatives and a first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for an enantioselective variant using chiral quat. ammonium bromides has been obtained as well.

Abstract
A diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of spirocyclopropylpyrazolones has been described through a Michael/alkylation cascade reaction of 4&#8208;arylidenepyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones with diethyl 2&#8208;bromomalonate catalyzed by (DHQ)2AQN. The reaction afforded selectively the corresponding spirocyclic compounds with 30&#8211;83% yield, diastereoselectivities ranging from 60:40 to &gt;95:5 and 26&#8211;93% enantiomeric excess under mild reaction conditions. Moreover, we performed two selective transformations with the corresponding chiral compounds.

         <title>Computational Insights into the Reactivity Difference between Hypervalent Bromine(III) and Hypervalent Iodine(III) Reagent in the C&#8722;H Amination and Alkene Aziridination</title>

Abstract
We present herein a computational exploration into the mechanism and origin of the reactivity difference between N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodane and N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;bromane in the C&#8722;H amination and alkene aziridination. Our calculations revealed that the preferred mechanism for C&#8722;H amination involves the generation of free nitrene intermediate, while the alkene aziridination proceeds via a concerted reaction mechanism. The superior reactivity of N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;bromane over N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodane could be mainly ascribed to better nucleofugality of the bromanyl moiety, which can be characterized by the strength of I&#8722;N and Br&#8722;N bond. The effect of solvent polarity on the reactivity of N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;bromane as a nitrene precursor will be discussed.

         <title>Enantioselective Intramolecular Hydroacylation of Alkynes by Rhodium Catalysis through Dynamic Kinetic Resolution.</title>

         <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroacylation of racemic alkynals having a substituent at the &#945;&#8208;position of the carbonyl group. Mechanistic studies revealed that hydroacylation occurs preferentially from one enantiomer of the racemic substrate via a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process. The picture shows an outline of the DKR process by using an illustration of soccer, in which the player getting the good ball (i.&#8201;e., enantiomer) successfully scores a goal. Details can be found in the Communication by Yoshihiro Sato and co&#8208;workers (Y. Oonishi, K. Takagishi, Y.&#8208;M. Liu, Y. Sato, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2023, 365, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202300206).

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Aminopiperidines via I(III)&#8208;Mediated Olefin Diamination with (Hetero)aryl Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
3&#8208;Aminopiperidines are a valuable motif present in small molecule pharmaceuticals and bioactive natural products. Synthesis of these moieties via olefin diamination would be an attractive approach, however significant challenges remain with regards to both regioselectivity and exogenous nucleophile scope. Herein, we report a metal&#8208;free olefin diamination via a &#8220;heterocyclic group transfer&#8220; (HGT) reaction of I(III) N&#8208;HVI reagents, giving rise to 3&#8208;aminopiperidines with high selectivity. The HGT strategy leverages heteroarenes as oxidatively masked amine nucleophiles, giving rise to (hetero)arylonium salt products which are isolated via simple trituration and provide a versatile handle for downstream diversification. This represents only the second 6&#8208;endo selective I(III)&#8208;mediated diamination reaction and mechanistic studies indicate ring opening of an intermediate aziridinium ion is responsible for the 6&#8208;endo selectivity.

Abstract
The combination of the catalytic power of amorphous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (aMOFs) and biocatalysis has greatly boosted the development of novel synthetic strategies due to its functional diversity and stereospecificity. 2&#8208;Cyanoacrylamides are important building blocks for many biologically active molecules. Herein, we described a chemical&#8208;biological relay catalytic method to access (E)&#8208;2&#8208;cyanoacrylamides based on the catalysis of amorphous porphyrin&#8208;MOFs SPUZ&#8208;1 and whole cells of Rhodococcus rhodochrous (nitrile hydratase). The approach was proved to be simple and efficient, and the highest conversion was up to 99%

         <title>Discovery and Engineering of an Ene&#8208;reductase for Kinetic Resolution and Cascade Reduction of Hajos&#8208;Parrish/Wieland&#8208;Miescher Ketones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Ene&#8208;reductase (ERED)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones is an attractive method in organic synthesis. Through the discovery and further structure&#8208;guided protein engineering of BsER, an ERED from Bacillus subtilis, the selective bio&#8208;reduction of the well&#8208;known building blocks Hajos&#8208;Parrish ketone (HPK, 1&#8201;a) and Wieland&#8208;Miescher ketone (WMK, 1&#8201;b) was achieved in this study. The optically pure (R)&#8208;HPK ((R)&#8208;1&#8201;a) and (R)&#8208;WMK ((R)&#8208;1&#8201;b) with corresponding &gt;99% and 98% enantiomeric excess (ee) values were obtained by kinetic resolution of the racemic substrates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of ERED mediated kinetic resolution of rac&#8208;HPK and rac&#8208;WMK. In addition, the reduction products cis&#8208;7a&#8208;methylhexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;indene&#8208;1,5(4H)&#8208;dione (cis&#8208;2&#8201;a) and cis&#8208;8a&#8208;methylhexahydronaphtha&#8208; lene&#8208;1,6(2H,5H)&#8208;dione (cis&#8208;2&#8201;b) with high diastereomeric ratios (dr) were also obtained. We also developed four routes of biocatalytic cascade reduction involving BsER and ketoreductases (KREDs). Using optimized ERED&#8208;KRED and KRED&#8208;ERED cascades, (S)&#8208;HPK ((S)&#8208;1&#8201;a) and (S)&#8208;WMK ((S)&#8208;1&#8201;b) could be reduced stepwise, yielding the bioactive products all with &gt;91% purity.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ene-reductase (ERED)-catalyzed asymmetric reduction of &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated ketones is an attractive method in organic synthesis. Through the discovery and further structure-guided protein engineering of BsER, an ERED from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, the selective bio-reduction of the well-known building blocks Hajos-Parrish ketone (HPK, &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) and Wieland-Miescher ketone (WMK, &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;) was achieved in this study. The optically pure (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;HPK ((&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) and (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;WMK ((&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;) with corresponding &amp;gt;99% and 98% enantiomeric excess (&lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;) values were obtained by kinetic resolution of the racemic substrates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of ERED mediated kinetic resolution of &lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-HPK and &lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-WMK. In addition, the reduction products &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-7a-methylhexahydro-1H-indene-1,5(4H)-dione (&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-8a-methylhexahydronaphtha- lene-1,6(2H,5H)-dione (&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;2&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;) with high diastereomeric ratios (&lt;i&gt;dr&lt;/i&gt;) were also obtained. We also developed four routes of biocatalytic cascade reduction involving BsER and ketoreductases (KREDs). Using optimized ERED-KRED and KRED-ERED cascades, (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;HPK ((&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;WMK ((&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;) could be reduced stepwise, yielding the bioactive products all with &amp;gt;91% purity. This study presents a biocatalytic strategy for the kinetic resolution and cascade reduction of HPK and WMK (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>In situ Generated Copper(II)&#8208;Quinoline Complexes as Robust and Versatile Photocatalysts for the Chlorosulfonylation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A series of copper complexes was synthesized and studied as photocatalysts for the chlorosulfonylation of olefins. Featuring a tetradentate ligand consisting of one amino quinoline and two methyl pyridine moieties, the resulting Cu(II)&#8208;complex is effective under visible light irradiation to add sulfonyl chlorides to alkenes and alkynes, including unactivated aliphatic olefins. A weak base additive such as Na2CO3 prevents catalyst poisoning, resulting in an improvement of reaction yields and catalyst lifetime. A broad scope of sulfonyl chlorides and alkenes/alkynes as coupling partners are amenable for the title process, including examples previously reported unsuccessful with established copper&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Enantioselective Intramolecular Hydroacylation of Alkynes by Rhodium Catalysis through Dynamic Kinetic Resolution.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroacylation of racemic alkynals having a substituent at the &#945;&#8208;position of the carbonyl group. Mechanistic studies revealed that hydroacylation occurs preferentially from one enantiomer of the racemic substrate via a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process. The picture shows an outline of the DKR process by using an illustration of soccer, in which the player getting the good ball (i.&#8201;e., enantiomer) successfully scores a goal. Details can be found in the Communication by Yoshihiro Sato and co&#8208;workers (Y. Oonishi, K. Takagishi, Y.&#8208;M. Liu, Y. Sato, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2023, 365, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202300206).

         <title>Catalytic Difluoromethylation of Alkenes with Difluoroacetic Anhydride: Reactivity of Fluorinated Diacyl Peroxides and Radicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Given the importance of difluoromethylated molecules for drug and agrochemical development, much attention has been drawn to the establishment of related synthetic protocols, as exemplified by the CF2H radical&#8208;mediated catalytic difluoromethylation of alkenes. However, most of these difluoromethylations proceed under photocatalytic conditions, whereas those requiring thermal conditions are few. Herein, we developed a general and practical method of Cu&#8208;catalyzed alkene difluoromethylation with difluoroacetic anhydride (DFAA) as a CF2H source, showing that the thus realized amino&#8208;, allylic&#8208;, and oxy&#8208;difluoromethylations involve bis(difluoroacetyl) peroxide (BDFAP) in&#8197;situ generated from DFAA and H2O2 and further demonstrating the occurrence of carbo&#8208;difluoromethylation under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The obtained results pave the way to the simple and efficient synthesis of a broad range of difluoromethylated species and thus facilitate their practical applications, including those in medicinal and agricultural chemistry. Moreover, we probed the mechanisms of the observed transformations, rationalized the extraordinary fast decomposition of BDFAP compared to that of diacyl peroxides containing CF3 or CF2Cl groups, and performed DFT calculations to shed light on the low stability and decomposition mode of BDFAP. Finally, we examined the influence of fluorinated radical philicity on the reaction outcome.

         <title>Merging Continuous Flow Technology, Photochemistry and Biocatalysis to Streamline Steroid Synthesis</title>

Abstract
Since their structural elucidation in 1935, the introduction and substitution of functional groups and the modification of the steroidal scaffolds have been a fertile ground of research for synthetic and medicinal chemists. The discovery of steroids with hormonal and pharmacological activity has stimulated tremendous efforts to the development of highly selective and efficient synthetic procedures. Despite the progress made, steroid chemistry remains challenging and the preparation of steroidal compounds of pharmaceutical interests and in clinical practice, often requires long and elaborated synthesis. In recent years, a new impetus in the field came with the advent of enabling chemical technologies, such as continuous flow chemistry, which are exploited to overcome problems that arise from batch synthesis. Although it is still a niche sector, the use of flow technology in steroid synthesis and functionalization holds the premise to empower methodology development and to provide innovative tactics also for many hitherto uncharted chemistries. In this review, scientific contributions are reported and discussed in terms of flow set&#8208;up and advantages offered concerning process efficiency, optimization, waste minimization, safety improvement, easy scale&#8208;up and costs. We also highlight the main challenges, key improvements and the future trajectory in the application of continuous flow chemistry and its implementation to different disciplines such as photochemistry and biocatalysis with the ultimate goal of streamlining steroid synthesis.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Enabled Photo&#8208;Sulfonylation of Aryl Halides Using Alkylsulfinates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A photochemical synthetic method to access sulfones from aryl halides and sodium alkylsulfinates in the presence of CuCl is reported. Regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity for the sulfonylation is observed for polyhalogenated arenes. Mechanistic studies indicate that a copper sulfinate reagent is formed in&#8197;situ from CuCl and sodium sulfinate based on NMR experiments. Potential reaction intermediates, including excited state aryl halides are studied using density functional theory calculations and reveal energetically accessible non&#8208;planar triplet geometries.

         <title>Selective C&#8722;H Acyloxylation of Sulfides/Disulfides Enabled by Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we report the &#945;&#8722;C&#8722;H acyloxylation of sulfides and disulfides enabled by hypervalent iodine(III) reagents via photoredox catalysis. The methoxylbenziodoxole derivatives serve as the hydrogen atom transfer agent, the mild oxidant, and the acyloxylation source in the reaction. External nucleophiles can also be introduced to the &#945;&#8722;C&#8722;H of sulfides. The reaction applies to various aryl and alkyl sulfides including methionine peptide derivatives. Disulfides are applicable for the first time with excellent chemoselectivity and functional group compatibility.
