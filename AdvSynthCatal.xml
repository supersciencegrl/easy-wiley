         <title>Formation of N&#8208;P(O)&#8208;S Bonds from White Phosphorus via a Four&#8208;Component Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalization of white phosphorus with disulfides, amines and KOH to phosphoramidodithioates containing both P&#8208;N, P&#8208;S and P=O bonds via a four&#8208;component reaction is presented. It proceeds with high yields and provides an attractive approach for the construction of valuable N&#8208;P(O)&#8208;S motif using a one&#8208;step strategy. The advantages of this newly developed process include a clean reaction profile, complete conversion of white phosphorus, transition metal&#8208;free and halogen&#8208;free environmentally benign system, and large&#8208;scale synthetic application. Besides, phosphoramidodithioates can also be utilized to construct P&#8208;C, P&#8208;O and P=S bonds with the appropriate reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Quinolines and 2&#8208;Functionalized Quinolines by Difluorocarbene Incorporation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general method is developed to allow de novo construction of quinolines and C2&#8208;functionalized quinolines from ortho&#8208;alkenyl anilines in the presence of a difluorocarbene precursor. This method exploits a crucial reactivity of in&#8208;situ generation of isocyanides from condensation of primary aniline with difluorocarbene. Subsequent &#945;&#8208;addition of isocyanide by neighbouring alkenyl group constructs the quinoline ring. Furthermore, when a combination of difluorocarbene precursor and Se are present, selenoisocyanate intermediates are tentatively generated that upon nucleophilic addition by ortho&#8208;alkenyl produce 2&#8208;SeH quinolines. In the presence of a second nucleophile such as anilines, competing nucleophilic addition of anilines to the selenoisocyanate is preferred, generating selenourea intermediate. Further nucleophilic addition of the ortho&#8208;alkenyl to selenourea followed by elimination of H2Se produces 2&#8208;aminoquinolines. This allows one&#8208;step multi&#8208;component modular preparation of various C2&#8208;functionalized quinolines from readily available starting compounds. This method shows good yields, scope and chemoselectivity. It is operationally convenient and friendly without manipulating unpleasant isocyanides. The difluorocarbene&#8208;enabled primary amine to isocyanide conversion may be exploited to develop other interesting reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Asymmetric Addition of Heteroatom Nucleophiles to Imines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The direct asymmetric addition of heteroatom nucleophiles to imines represents one of the most efficient tools for the formation of carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds and has received much interest recently. The review is devoted to the asymmetric addition reactions of non&#8208;carbon nucleophiles to imines. The present review is divided into five main sections: reactions with N&#8208;nucleophiles; reactions with P&#8208;nucleophiles; reactions with O&#8208;nucleophiles; reactions with S&#8208;nucleophiles; reactions with Se&#8208;nucleophiles. It has been seen that chiral catalysts such as quinines, BINOLs, chiral phosphoric acids as well as various Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids are the source of asymmetry of the presented reactions of asymmetric addition of non&#8208;carbon nucleophiles to imines.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Induced Synthesis of Coumarin&#8208;Fused Quinolinones from Anilines, 4&#8208;Hydroxycoumarins and DMSO under Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Substrate&#8208;induced synthesis of 6H&#8208;Chromeno[4,3&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;6&#8208;ones has been developed directly from anilines, 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins and DMSO under air without any catalysts and additives in one pot. This protocol highlights dual roles of 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins which were not only used as reactants but also activated DMSO to provide one&#8208;carbon unit in the desired products.

The front cover picture illustrates iodoarene as a precatalyst and dimethyl(fluoro)&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfane as a real oxidant derived from DMSO and F&#8208;TEDA&#8208;PF6, and the Japanese kanji stands for the initial letters of key elements, sulfur, iodine, and fluorine. A hypervalent iodine(III) catalyst, generated in&#8197;situ from these reagents, is effective on the dehydrogenative cycloisomerization/arylation reaction of N&#8208;propargyl carboxamides and arenes.

         <title>Ylide&#8208;Functionalized Diisopropyl Phosphine (prYPhos): A Ligand for Selective Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Couplings of Aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ylide&#8208;functionalized diisopropyl phosphine (prYPhos) efficiently promotes Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings of aryl chlorides and bromides with arylboronic acids. Using Pd2(dba)3 / prYPhos as the catalyst and K2CO3 as the base, various (hetero)biaryls were synthesized in 45&#8208;98% yields at mild reaction conditions, tolerating sensitive functional groups and steric hindrance. The electron rich, sterically demanding ligand induces a remarkably high selectivity for halides versus triflate. Chloroaryl triflates were selectively coupled at the chloride, leaving inherently more reactive triflate groups in place.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced [2+2+1] Dearomative Cascade Cyclization of Indole/Furan Alkynes to Synthesize Sulfonyl Polycycles</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced [2+2+1] dearomative cascade cyclization of indole/furan alkynes with NaHSO3, providing an array of diverse highly strained sulfonyl polycycles. Compared to our previous work, this method does not require the use of additional sacrificial oxidants and have wider reaction scope. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the indole moiety initiated the reaction, which proceeded via single&#8208;electron oxidation pathway. An alkenyl radical formed by intramolecular addition capture SO2, and the resulting specie is cyclized to furnish the final product. Also, DFT calculations disclosed that the groups on the indole ring or at the side chain probably affect the single electron distribution at the reaction site of IM&#8208;RC&#8208;I, and the distribution may be a decisive factor of spirocyclization.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam Coupling of NH&#8208;Diaryl Sulfondiimines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Sulfondiimines, which contain a tetrasubstituted sulfur centre bearing two nitrogens and two carbon substituents, are a class of underexplored scaffolds in organic chemistry. Fascinated by some unique yet intriguing properties, sulfondiimines appear as leads in discovery industry, but the lack of efficient synthetic approaches holds back their further uptake by medicinal chemistry. Herein, a general and practical copper&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam coupling of NH&#8208;diaryl sulfondiimines with arylboronic acids is presented. A simple copper catalyst efficiently facilitated the highly chemoselective construction of C&#8722;N bond, allowing the preparation of a variety of N&#8208;arylated diaryl sulfondiimines in good yields under mild and environmentally benign conditions. An array of protecting groups on imine moieties were well tolerated, offering diversified accesses to NH,NAr&#8208;diaryl sulfondiimines, a class of versatile building blocks. Moreover, an aza&#8208;analogue of an EphB4 inhibitor featuring a sulfondiimine&#8208;based pharmacophore was generated employing our Chan&#8208;Lam coupling as the key step.

Abstract
Arylation of tertiary aryl and alkyl phosphines bearing 2&#8208;cyanoethyl group with aryl(mesityl)iodonium triflates under blue light irradiation followed by retro&#8208;Michael reaction of the in&#8197;situ generated quaternary phosphonium salts initiated by DBU represent a novel efficient and general method for the preparation of distinctly substituted tertiary arylphosphines. An operationally simple, one&#8208;pot protocol features mild, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, high selectivity, broad functional group compatibility, as well as scalability and would be applied to substrates with different electronic and steric nature.

         <title>Metal&#8208; and Solvent&#8208;Free Synthesis of Maleimide Fused Carbazoles from (Indol&#8208;3&#8208;Yl)cyclohexanones and Maleimides</title>

Abstract
A metal&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free strategy for the preparation of maleimide&#8208;fused carbazoles has been developed. This protocol started from 2&#8208;(indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)cyclohexanones and maleimides, providing various maleimide&#8208;fused carbazoles in 45&#8211;90% yields. The present approach was catalyzed by trimethylsulfoxonium iodide and involved a cascade of oxidation, [4+2] annulation, and dehydrogenative aromatization. Moreover, these maleimide&#8208;fused carbazole products could be further transformed into other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free photoinduced radical&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;oxy C&#8722;H cyclobutylation reaction of bicyclo[1.1.0]butane (BCB) compounds was described. In this protocol, &#945;&#8208;oxy C(sp3)&#8722;H motifs including ethers and alcohols were activated via photocatalytic conditions, releasing the ring strain of BCBs and generating 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutanes in 40&#8211;80% yields. Control experiments and Stern&#8208;Volmer quenching experiments indicated that the reaction proceeded through the generation of &#945;&#8208;oxy carbon&#8208;centered radical intermediates by photoinduced hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process.

Abstract
Azido radical mediated photocatalytic oxidation method for the selective oxidation of various well&#8208;known feedstocks, such as (hetero)aromatic or aliphatic alcohols, alkylarenes, and terminal alkenes, is successfully accomplished. Herein, the catalytic HAT and reversible addition/elimination strategies of azido radical have been explored to convert the commonly oxidizable functionalities into invaluable carbonyls or tertiary alcohols using an organic photocatalyst 4CzIPN with tetrabutyl ammonium azide (TBAN3) and air/O2 as an oxidant. Indeed, this mild, operationally simple, and productive method offers good to excellent product yields with a wide range of structurally diverse substrates, including pharmaceutical derivatives with good functional group tolerance. Several control experiments have been carried out to investigate the detailed reaction mechanism.

Abstract
The mechanochemical fluorination of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds has been achieved using N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide as both a precursor of the hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer reagent and a bench&#8208;stable fluorine source. The control experiments revealed that mechanical energy is essential for realizing this reaction.

         <title>Well&#8208;defined Ni&#8208;SNS Complex Catalysed Borrowing Hydrogenative &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Ketones and Dehydrogenative Synthesis of Quinolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#8220;borrowing hydrogen&#8221; (BH) method for C&#8208;alkylation reactions using alcohol as alkylating agents is an important synthetic transformation. In this respect, designing cheap and bench stable earth abundant metal catalyst for borrowing hydrogen transformation is a key challenge to be witnessed. Herein we have presented a synthesis of non&#8208;phosphine, easily accessible and bench stable SNS&#8208;Ni complexes. The Ni&#8208;catalyst was successfully applied for the C&#8208;alkylation of ketone enolates to &#945;&#8208;alkylated ketones. Primary alcohol with different functional groups and various heteroaromatic alcohols are well tolerated. 	The present catalyst system was efficiently applied to gram scale synthesis and also the green chemistry metrics of the reaction were calculated. The present protocol was also extended successfully for the synthesis of biologically important quinoline moieties. Finally, various control experiments and deuterium labelled experiments suggest that the reaction proceeds via borrowing hydrogen pathway.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported herein is a photocatalytic platform for the vicinal aminopyridylation of indoles. The accurate difunctionalization reaction undergoes a tandem process involving a radical&#8208;mediated 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddtion which generated from the single&#8208;electron oxidation of N&#8208;aminopyridinium ylides, a cleavage of the N&#8208;N bond as well as an oxidation of indoline ring. The electrophilic pyridyl and nucleophilic amino groups can be installed simultaneously into a wide range of indoles under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions. Moreover, the protocol shows high levels of step and atom economy.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dirhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular insertion of aryldiazoacetates into an unactivated primary C&#8211;H bond was described in this study. The insertion reaction of aryldiazoacetates with ortho&#8208;isopropyl or ortho&#8208;ethyl groups in the presence of a catalytic amount of dirhodium(II) tetrakis(triphenylacetate), Rh2(tpa)4, at room temperature proceeded site&#8208;selectively to afford 2&#8208;unsubstituted indane&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylates in 75%&#8211;96% yields. In the case of o&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;substituted aryldiazoacetates, cis&#8208;isomers were obtained as major products. Furthermore, a chemoselective C&#8211;H insertion reaction of aryldiazoacetate bearing 1&#8208;oxyethyl&#8208;substituent at the ortho position was achieved by using a bulky and electron&#8208;deficient pivaloyl group as the protecting group of a highly active oxygen atom. The present reaction provided a direct route to 2&#8208;unsubstituted indanes.</dc:description>

Abstract
The additive&#8208;free 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction of isatin&#8208;derived azomethine ylides with &#945;&#8208;cyano&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds was developed, which enabled diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of a series of novel and structurally complex 3,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidinyl&#8208;spirooxindoles derivatives containing four contiguous and two quaternary stereogenic centers in high yields (up to 92%) and excellent diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;25:1 dr). The reaction displays switchable regioselectivity depending on the steric effect of the substrates.

Abstract
This review highlights the allylic C&#8722;H alkylation of alkenes (AAH) with nucleophiles under Pd0 or PdII catalysis and achiral or chiral conditions. The &#951;3&#8208;allylpalladium intermediates of these reactions are formed from the cleavage of an allylic hydrogen which becomes a leaving group, like the acetate moiety of allyl acetates during the classical Tsuji&#8208;Trost procedure. Most of these cross&#8208;dehydrogenative&#8208;couplings require quinones as key components; they may play the role of ligand, proton trap and oxidant. Efficient asymmetric allylic C&#8722;H alkylations (AAAH&#8217;s) have been performed. The diversity of the procedures, their limitation and application in synthesis are underlined as well as the proposed mechanisms with, in some cases, personal comments. The data are grouped according to the reaction conditions.

         <title>Defluorinative Alkylation of Trifluoromethyl Alkenes with Soft Carbon Nucleophiles Enabled by a Catalytic Amount of Base</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Direct manipulation of readily accessible trifluoromethyl alkenes (TAs) represents an attractive approach to the preparation of diversified fluorine&#8208;containing compounds. In this study, defluorinative alkylation reactions of TAs with a broad array of soft carbon nucleophiles have been documented. Nucleophilic substitutions occur enabled by a catalytic amount of base, providing access to tertiary alkyl substituted gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrans. By extending the nucleophiles to silyl enol ethers, defluorination can be achieved in the absence of base to give gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. This process, which eliminates the requirement of organometallic reagents, transition metals, or strong bases for the C&#8722;F bond cleavage, is applicable to late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules.

         <dc:description>A synthetic method of o&#8208;sulfanylanilines from cyclohexanones, amines, and thiophenols under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions is disclosed. This is the first report on the direct thioamination of cyclohexanones via N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) promoted oxidative dehydroaromatization. Non&#8208;aromatic cyclohexanones were smoothly dehydrogenated, and acted as an aryl source using oxygen as a green oxidant.

         <title>Tartramide Ligands for Copper&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Arylation at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Readily accessible tartramide ligands have been demonstrated to promote copper&#8208;catalysed N&#8208;arylation under mild conditions. In addition, the coupling protocol employs cheap and readily available pre&#8208;catalyst, ligand, and base (NaOH), and overcomes many current limitations often associated with Ullmann coupling: it can be run with low catalyst loadings, does not require the use of excess amine, operates at room temperature, is fully homogeneous, and displays improved tolerance to air and moisture. Detailed kinetic studies using reaction progress kinetic analysis (RPKA) methods have provided insight into the factors influencing the reaction rate in terms of impact of ligand structure, reactant/catalyst dependence and catalyst (in)stability. These kinetic insights have been used in a quality&#8208;by&#8208;design approach for further optimization of the reaction protocol. The reaction scope was extended to 22 examples, showing broad applicability for a wide range of substituted aryl iodides with both primary and secondary amines.

         <title>N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidation of Aldehydes under Continuous Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The efficacy of synthetic methodologies is based not only on potent chemistries but also on processing strategies that amplify reaction performance and overall safety. The N&#8208;hydroxyphtalimide&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation of aldehydes is an environmentally reliable and inexpensive approach for the synthesis of valuable carboxylic acids. However, the reaction may lead to the accumulation of significant amounts of peracid in crude product mixtures thereby generating a considerable safety hazard. Also, in the case of deactivated substrates, long reaction times, high catalyst loading, and stoichiometric additives are required to promote oxidation. Therefore, we developed a flow chemistry&#8208;based process for N&#8208;hydroxyphtalimide&#8208;catalyzed aldehyde oxidations and exploited its benefits to minimize peracid buildup, thereby enhancing the process safety. By performing the aerobic oxidation of aldehydes under continuous flow conditions, chemically intensified and scalable carboxylic acid formation was obtained even in the reactions of deactivated substrates. Our findings are presented herein.

Abstract
A tertiary amino&#8208;thiourea catalyzed asymmetric aldol reaction between 2&#8208;isocyanatomalonate esters and isatins has been achieved. Optical active spirooxazolidinone oxindole derivatives could be obtained with excellent yields (80%&#8211;96%) and enantioselectivities (67%&#8211;99% ee) under mild conditions, providing an updated example to apply isatins as the electrophile in the asymmetric aldol reaction with 2&#8208;isocyanatomalonate esters.

         <title>Access to Nitrones from Amines via Electrocatalysis at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A self&#8208;enabled electrooxidative protocol for the synthesis of nitrones from bench stable amines has been developed under constant current electrolysis at room temperature, rendering metal and external oxidant&#8208;free protocol in an alkaline medium. The electrocatalysis steps of reported strategy involve anodic oxidation of benzyl amines followed by cathodic reduction of nitro&#8208;functional group in an undivided cell affording functional nitrones.

&lt;p&gt;A self-enabled electrooxidative protocol for the synthesis of nitrones from bench stable amines has been developed under constant current electrolysis at room temperature, rendering metal and external oxidant-free protocol in an alkaline medium. The electrocatalysis steps of reported strategy involve anodic oxidation of benzyl amines followed by cathodic reduction of nitro-functional group in an undivided cell affording functional nitrones. The robustness of the electrocatalysis was reflected by tolerant substrate scope, oxidant-free conditions, and an operationally friendly procedure. Moreover, the cyclic voltammetry and control experiment studies also support the electrochemical process in alkaline medium.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strategic Applications of the &#946;&#8208;Silicon Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organosilicon reagents are highly versatile and privileged scaffolds in modern synthetic chemistry, largely due to the range of transformations the groups are amenable to. The &#946;&#8208;Silicon effect is one of the fundamental phenomena underpinning the inherent reactivity of organosilicon reagents, allowing unsaturated organosilanes to undergo a range of electrophilic substitutions with a variety of nucleophiles. The application of the &#946;&#8208;Silicon effect in a range of organic transformations is reviewed with the discussion divided up based on the class of silane. The reactivity of these compounds towards carbon, heteroatom and metallic electrophiles is discussed from classical applications such as the Sakurai allylation to contemporary applications such as cross&#8208;coupling chemistry. In addition, examples of these transformations in the context of methodology development and natural product synthesis are provided.</dc:description>

Abstract
A method to synthesize benzofurylselenocyanates, benzothienylselenocyanates and indolylselenocyanates via electrophilic selenocyanogen cyclization was established. This sequential process was conducted under mild conditions in a short time. This protocol was successfully applied to late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules. Notablely, the selenocyanate can be converted into other valuable Se&#8208;containing compounds and showed antitumor activity to human hepatoma cells HepG2.

Abstract
Here we present a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free radical cyclization of 2&#8208;arylbenzoimidazoles with unactivated alkanes. By using di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide (DTBP) to promote the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization, this approach enables assembly of various benzimidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolin&#8208;6(5H)&#8208;ones in aqueous media. This strategy can not only well tolerate a wide range of cyclic alkanes, straight&#8208;chain alkanes, toluene derivatives, as well as pharmaceutical molecule eudesmol, but also provides an approach for the functionalization of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in aqueous media under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free systems.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2] Cycloaddition of Hydroxy&#8208;Tethered Allylic Carbonates with Alkenes: Synthesis of Functionalized Tetrahydropyrans</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition of hydroxy&#8208;tethered allyl carbonates with five types of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes has been achieved, in which a type of new hydroxy&#8208;tethered allyl carbonates acted as valuable precursors for the formation of 1,4&#8208;C,O&#8208;dipole allylpalladium intermediates. The reaction proceeded efficiently under mild reaction conditions to provide the corresponding tetrahydropyran derivatives in moderate to high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities.

Abstract
The development of catalytic tools for the late&#8208;stage modification of amino acids within a peptide framework is a challenging task of capital importance. Herein, we report a Ru&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H hydroxylation of a collection of Tyr&#8208;containing di&#8208; and tripeptides featuring the use of a carbamate as a removable directing group and PhI(OCOCF3)2 (PIFA) as oxidant. This air&#8208;compatible tagging technique is reliable, scalable and provides access to L&#8208;DOPA (L&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine) peptidomimetics in a racemization&#8208;free fashion. Density Functional Theory calculations support a Ru(II)/Ru(IV) catalytic cycle.

         <title>Hypertransglycosylating Variants of the GH20 &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;Acetylhexosaminidase for the Synthesis of Chitooligomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Fungal &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylhexosaminidases of the CAZy family 20 of glycoside hydrolases are well&#8208;established tools for the enzymatic synthesis of a wide variety of natural and modified oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates. In order to increase their synthetic efficiency, the &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylhexosaminidase from Aspergillus oryzae (AoHex) was employed as a model enzyme for enzyme engineering aiming at shifting the reaction course from hydrolysis toward transglycosylation. Specifically, nine mutant variants of AoHex were designed by molecular modeling based on its crystal structure and molecular dynamics simulations. The selected mutation hotspots included the tyrosine residue at the active site, which stabilizes the transition state of the reaction, and two residues at the aglycone&#8208;binding site, which were replaced by tryptophan residues to increase the hydrophobicity of this subsite. Besides the individual mutants, combined double&#8208;mutant variants were also prepared and characterized. As a result, eight out of the studied new AoHex variants had transglycosidase activity, with V306W/Y445N AoHex being a superior transglycosidase with a transglycosylation&#8208;to&#8208;hydrolysis ratio greater than 110, which is entirely unique among the hypertransglycosylating glycosidase mutants including the GH20 &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylhexosaminidases.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fungal &#946;-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylhexosaminidases of the CAZy family 20 of glycoside hydrolases are well-established tools for the enzymatic synthesis of a wide variety of natural and modified oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates. In order to increase their synthetic efficiency, the &#946;-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylhexosaminidase from &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus oryzae&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Ao&lt;/i&gt;Hex) was employed as a model enzyme for enzyme engineering aiming at shifting the reaction course from hydrolysis toward transglycosylation. Specifically, nine mutant variants of &lt;i&gt;Ao&lt;/i&gt;Hex were designed by molecular modeling based on its crystal structure and molecular dynamics simulations. The selected mutation hotspots included the tyrosine residue at the active site, which stabilizes the transition state of the reaction, and two residues at the aglycone-binding site, which were replaced by tryptophan residues to increase the hydrophobicity of this subsite. Besides the individual mutants, combined double-mutant variants were also prepared and characterized. As a result, eight out of the studied new &lt;i&gt;Ao&lt;/i&gt;Hex variants had transglycosidase activity, with V306W/Y445N &lt;i&gt;Ao&lt;/i&gt;Hex being a superior transglycosidase with a transglycosylation-to-hydrolysis ratio greater than 110, which is entirely unique among the hypertransglycosylating glycosidase mutants including the GH20 &#946;-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylhexosaminidases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Herein a radical hydroxyalkylation of N&#8208;heteroaromatics with aldehydes is reported. The constructive merging of photochemistry and electrochemistry is the key for the success of this atom&#8208;economical Minisci method. This protocol highlights the utility of electrophotocatalysis to promote a practical and general synthesis of secondary alcohols in good yields from readily available N&#8208;heteroaromatics and aldehydes under mild reaction condition.

Abstract
1,2&#8208;Addition reactions using organoboron compounds are one of the useful syntheses of various functionalized alcohols, but they generally require a large quantity of bases. In this study, we attempted to solve this problem by synthesizing unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;diarylimidazoline&#8208;type N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;coordinated C^C* cyclometalated palladium(II) complexes with bridging hydroxide ligands (CYPOHs) in two steps and one pot from the corresponding Cl bridged dimer and using them as catalysts. 2,6&#8208;di(pentan&#8208;3&#8208;yl)aniline (IPent)&#8208;based NHC coordinated PhS&#8208;IPent&#8208;CYPOH acted as a highly efficient catalyst for the 1,2&#8208;addition of (hetero)arylboronates to a large number of aldehydes and ketones, including unactivated ketones, under base&#8208;free conditions.

Abstract
A mild and safe photochemical methodology has been developed to access difluoroamidosulfonylated dioxodibenzothiazepines via three&#8208;component radical bicyclization cascades. This photocatalyst&#8208;free transformation avoids cumbersome photocatalyst removal procedure and potential toxicity. Mechanistic experiments reveal the generation of an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex in the reaction process. Moreover, synthetic value of the protocol is further demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale reaction, conversion of product and total synthesis of antidepressant drug.

Abstract
A methodology for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;carbolines from fluoropyridines and 2&#8208;haloanilines is reported. This procedure consists of a four&#8208;step directed ortho&#8208;lithiation, zincation, Negishi cross&#8208;coupling, and intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution, providing access to a diverse set of functionalized carbolines. While the procedure is applicable to batch conditions, the generation of arylzinc intermediates in continuous flow has been demonstrated.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Hydroacylation of Vinylethylene Carbonates for Regioselective Ester Synthesis</title>

Abstract
A rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative hydroacylation of readily available vinylethylene carbonates with salicylaldehydes for regioselective preparation of esters was developed. Reaction optimization revealed that methacrylamide might promote the hydroacylation by bidentate chelation assistance to the cationic rhodium. Mechanistic findings suggested that this one&#8208;pot coupling reaction proceeds via Markovnikov hydrorhodation&#8208;initiated site&#8208;selective &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;O bond cleavage with concurrent release of CO2.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free, Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Radical Cyclisation of Malonyl Radicals onto 5&#8208;Ring Heteroaromatics</title>

Abstract
Annulated heteroaromatics can be accessed through the addition of malonyl radicals onto heterocycles. Current methods are applicable to electron&#8208;rich heteroaromatics and reliant on transition metals or toxic tin reagents. Here we report a metal&#8208;free, visible light&#8208;mediated cyclisation of malonates onto 5&#8208;ring heteroaromatics using iodomalonates as key intermediates. The iodomalonates are prepared and photolysed in&#8197;situ to give the desired annulated products, in yields of 46&#8211;94% without the need for external catalysts. The scope of this transformation includes N&#8208;alkyl, N&#8208;acyl and carbon&#8208;tethered malonates adding onto a wide range of 5&#8208;membered heteroaromatics.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroborylative Polycyclization of Allenynes: an Atom&#8208;Economical and Diastereoselective Synthesis of Bicyclic 5&#8208;5 Fused Rings</title>

Abstract
A diastereoselective synthesis of borylated bicyclic 5&#8208;5 fused ring systems by a domino Ni&#8208;catalyzed hydroborylative polycyclization of allenynes has been developed. The reaction provides two new C&#8722;C and one C&#8722;B bonds and constitutes an atom&#8208;economical method. It occurs rapidly, in absence of inert atmosphere, with an inexpensive Ni&#8208;based catalyst and HBpin as boron source. The procedure showed excellent tolerance to functional groups and a wide scope. Derivatization of the borylated bicycles has been performed to explore the synthetic utility of the products. Experimental and DFT&#8208;calculation results suggest that the process starts by an oxidative cyclometallation involving Ni(0) and both the allene and the alkyne moieties, followed by a stereoselective &#963;&#8208;metathesis with HBpin. Formation of the second ring takes place through a non&#8208;fully coplanar 1,2&#8208;insertion into the Ni&#8722;H bond to give a nickelacyclohexene which finally evolves by reductive elimination.

Abstract
Aza&#8208;Michael addition is known to be one of the most exploited reactions in organic chemistry. Taking into account the fact that each seventh reaction in pharmaceutical industry involves the formation of at least one C&#8722;N bond, it is not surprising that this reaction is especially valuable for the synthesis of bioactive compounds and drugs. Traditionally, only push&#8208;pull alkenes are regarded as starting material for this reaction. The participation of pull&#8208;pull alkenes as Michael acceptors is much less studied. The presence of two vicinal electron&#8208;withdrawing groups makes them highly reactive in nucleophilic reactions especially with nitrogen&#8208;centered nucleophiles. This feature allows them to be excellent building blocks in the synthesis of bioactive molecules and polyfunctional materials. The review considers the most important and sometimes unexpected results obtained over the last two decades on the conjugate addition of nitrogen nucleophiles to pull&#8208;pull alkenes bearing various acceptor moieties (alkoxycarbonyl&#8208;, carbonyl&#8208;, formyl&#8208;, cyano&#8208;, trifluoromethyl&#8208; or nitro group) in various combinations.

         <title>Uncovering the Potential of Boronic Acid and Derivatives as Radical Source in Photo(electro)chemical Reactions</title>

Abstract
The chemistry of boron compounds has been profoundly investigated in the last decades, leading to ubiquity in many synthetic applications as well as biologically active molecules. Since the advent of photoredox catalysis, an upsurge in the discovery of suitable radical precursors has been witnessed, and boron is becoming a protagonist in this field. Despite many studies focused on trifluoroborates, the use of boronic acids and esters have received much less attention in this regard. Because of their high oxidation potential, the development of methods to enable their involvement in photocatalyzed reactions is only recent. Nonetheless, this review summarizes novel strategies developed to unlock their role as radical precursors in photochemical reactions and discloses the potential that boronic acids and esters own, when their intrinsic chemical properties are exploited.

Abstract
Herein, we report a Mn(OAc)2&#8208;promoted formal dehydrative dehydroaromatizing [4+2] cycloaddition of enamides with maleimides for the construction of pyridine rings to access the diverse synthetically valuable pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]&#8208;pyridine derivatives. This protocol allows two C&#8722;C bond formation for the assembly of pyridine derivatives from enamides synthesizable in two steps and inexpensive maleimides, which exhibits broad substrate scope and good functional group compatibility.

         <title>Remote Giese Radical Addition by Photocatalytic Ring Opening of Activated Cycloalkanols</title>

Abstract
The application of proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes in organic synthesis has opened the door to new radical intermediates for synthesis such as alkyl radicals in remote positions to a ketone. Herein, we present the addition of these remote alkyl radicals to electron deficient double bonds under photoorganocatalyzed and very mild conditions. The method is not only applicable to diactivated double bonds, but monoactivated ones are also accessible using more stabilized alkyl radicals, and alkyl chains of any length can be introduced. The final products can be easily converted into more complex structures via a one&#8208;pot process, and the activating functional groups were transformed in the more versatile methyl esters. Mechanistic investigations support a mechanistic proposal based on a PCET process.

Abstract
We describe a DBU&#8208;controlled 6&#960;&#8208;azaelectrocyclization of dibenzylideneacetone&#8208;derived N&#8208;vinyl&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitrones to prepare 6&#8208;alkyl pyridine N&#8208;oxides in 24&#8211;82% yields. Mechanistic studies revealed that DBU had a great impact on the formation of 6&#8208;alkyl pyridine N&#8208;oxides and served as a base and the carrier of hydrogen sources to in&#8197;situ reduce C=C bonds. The 6&#8208;alkyl pyridine N&#8208;oxide was prepared at gram&#8208;scales and converted to estrone&#8208;derived pyridine and pyrido[2,3&#8208;c]carbazole 4&#8208;oxide in 46% and 52% yields in two steps, respectively.

Abstract
We describe here the conjugate addition of tert&#8208;butyllithium to vinyl systems of boronic esters to generate a borata&#8208;alkene intermediate, followed by a sequential SN2 reaction with alkyl halides, at room temperature. We envisioned this goal through engaged C(sp3) chemical entities avoiding metal catalysts, additives, radical initiators or specific irradiation. This reaction guarantees that the new tetrasubstituted carbon formed retains all the C atoms from the three starting materials involved in the assembly.

         <title>Chiral Phosphoric Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Formal [4+2] Cycloaddition Between Dienecarbamates and 2&#8208;Benzothioazolimines</title>

Abstract
An enantioselective chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed formal [4+2] cycloaddition between 2&#8208;benzothiazolimines and N&#8208;H&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienecarbamates is described. A divergence in reaction pathways was observed depending on the dienes employed. The reaction performed with 4&#8208;substituted dienes produced benzothiazolopyrimidines as major product in yields ranging from 42 to 67%, as single diastereoisomer and with enantioselectivity between 93 and 99%. The same reaction performed with 3&#8208;substituted dienes, however, gave highly enantioenriched 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines as the major products albeit with moderate diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Alkylthioimidazoles: One&#8208;Pot Three&#8208;Component Cross&#8208;Coupling Mediated by Paired Electrolysis</title>

Abstract
The direct synthesis of alkylthioimidazoles was initially accomplished via a one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component cross&#8208;coupling mediated by a paired electrolysis strategy using non&#8208;activated chloroalkane as the alkylating agent. This protocol provides a straightforward method for the preparation of alkylthioimidazoles by employing water as the co&#8208;solvent at room temperature without any exogenous&#8208;oxidants and metal catalysts. Inactivated primary, secondary, tertiary haloalkanes and various isothiocyanates can be compatible with the established conditions to obtain the corresponding products with a moderate yield. The mechanism of this one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component cross&#8208;coupling reaction undergoes a radical process mediated by paired electrolysis.

Abstract
We describe a cationic Ir&#8208;catalyzed tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimerization of aryl acrylates starting from vinylic sp2 C&#8722;H activation, which gives industrially useful adipic acid ester derivatives in high yields. We further expanded the reaction to an enantioselective dimerization using aryl methacrylates and achieved the first example of catalytic asymmetric dimerization of acrylate derivatives.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Chiral Oxathiazine 2&#8208;Oxide Scaffolds as Sulfinyl Transfer Agents</title>

Abstract
An efficient diastereoselective route for the preparation of chiral oxathiazine 2&#8208;oxide scaffolds as sulfinyl transfer agents, using tert&#8208;butanesulfinamide (tBSA) both as the source of chirality and as the precursor to the required nitrogen electron withdrawing group on the scaffold, was developed. This methodology allows the introduction of different substituents on the chiral scaffold, using commercially available reagents and standard synthetic transformations. The synthesized scaffolds were tested in the preparation of enantioenriched sulfinamides, providing results comparable to the sulfinyl transfer agents so far proposed in the literature, and opening the possibility to further elaborate these scaffolds, with the aim to support them on solid phases so to facilitate their recovery and reuse.

Abstract
Six&#8208; or seven&#8208;membered dibenzosultams were synthesized upon treatment of N&#8208;aryl&#8208; or N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2&#8208;halobenzenesulfonamides with HCOONa&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O in DMSO without using additional measures and additives, such as light irradiation, electrochemical apparatus, transition metals, and oxidants. Further functionalization of the free NH group of the resultant dibenzosultams demonstrates the synthetic practicability of this method.

Abstract
A DBU/AgOTf relay&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction of 2&#8208;alkynylbenzaldehydes and &#945;&#8208;diazo esters for the efficient construction of 1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofuran derivatives has been documented. This protocol can tolerate a wide range of substrates and its scalability is demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale reaction. Moreover, the obtained 1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofurans can be converted to indanone derivatives by a AgOTf&#8208;catalyzed ring recombination process. Both of the resulting products, 1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofurans and indanones, are important structural units of a variety of pharmaceuticals and natural products, and their structures are clearly confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <title>Diarylprolinol with Trifluoromethyl Substituents and Diphenylprolinol&#8208;Derived Perfluoroalkanesulfonamide as Organocatalysts in the Cross&#8208;Aldol Reaction of Aldehydes</title>

Abstract
The asymmetric cross&#8208;aldol reaction of two different aldehydes is a synthetically relevant reaction. Diarylprolinol catalyst with trifluoromethyl substituents and sulfonamide catalyst derived from diphenylprolinol are organocatalysts for the cross&#8208;aldol reaction. The reactivity and stereoselectivity of these two catalysts were compared in the asymmetric cross&#8208;aldol reactions of propanal and acetaldehyde as nucleophilic aldehydes and several electrophilic aldehydes. Depending on the electrophilic aldehydes, the preferable catalyst differs. By the proper selection of these two catalysts, potentially synthetically useful chiral building blocks can be synthesized with diastereoselectivities of anti:syn=2.6:1&#8764;&gt;20:1 and enantioselectivities of 60&#8764;&gt;98% ee.

         <title>Recent progress in solid&#8208;phase total synthesis of naturally occurring small peptides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many naturally occurring small peptides have significant therapeutic properties. Total synthesis of these peptides is not only helpful in the identification of their structures and providing methods to synthesize their analogues, but also contributes to their biosynthetic studies. As solid&#8208;phase synthesis simplifies the tedious and time&#8208;consuming isolation of intermediates, it has been widely applied in peptide synthesis. This review has highlighted the recent progress in solid&#8208;phase total synthesis of both linear and cyclic naturally occurring small peptides from 2014 to July 2021.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Difunctionalization of alkenes enables  construction of complex compounds in one pot. In this report, we presented an intermolecular, redox&#8208;neutral three&#8208;component dicarbofunctionalization of activated alkenes under mild reaction conditions. The mechanistic studies indicated tertiary alkyl radicals from oxalate salts were first added to alkenes in Giese&#8208;type fashion, followed by nucleophilic addition with aldehydes to produce the desired 1,2&#8208;dialkylation products. The catalyst system does not require any additives, with good functional group compatibility, regioselectivity, and constructs two tertiary carbon centers simultaneously.</dc:description>

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced oxidation of diazenyl&#8208;protected tetrahydroisoquinolines and isoindolines for the synthesis of structurally diverse lactams is developed. The reaction was carried out with Eosin Y&#8208;Na2 as an organic photocatalyst and molecular oxygen as an oxidant, and the desired functionalized N&#8208;aryldiazenyl&#8208;lactams were obtained under mild and transition metal&#8208;free conditions. The utility of this method is showcased by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and deprotection of the N&#8208;aryldiazenyl&#8208;lactam product.

         <title>Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Keto Sulfoxides via Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reaction between aromatic aldehydes and DMSO was developed, which afforded &#946;&#8208;keto sulfoxides in 73&#8211;92% yields. The reaction process involved base&#8208;promoted DMSO addition to aldehydes, and copper&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation. Furthermore, the aromatic alcohols which could be oxidized to aldehydes are also suitable substrates for this catalytic system.

         <title>Combined Approach of Hypervalent Iodine Reagents and Transition Metals in Organic Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
This review outlines the progress over recent years in the reactions involving combined approach of hypervalent iodine reagents and transition metals such as palladium, nickel, iridium, gold, rhodium, copper, iron, ruthenium, platinum, silver, zinc, rhenium and cobalt. This approach enables organic transformations complimentary to traditional manifolds. Hypervalent iodine reagents play a preeminent role in organic chemistry due to their versatile reactivity, heteroatom ligands and mild reaction conditions. These reagents in combination of transition metal compounds are used in many synthetically useful organic reactions such as oxidation, rearrangement, amination, halogenation, amidation, ring&#8208;opening, cyclization and C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C functionalization reactions, etc. which are discussed here.

Abstract
An asymmetric decarboxylative Mannich reaction of phosphonate sultam&#8208;ketimines with malonic acid half esters is developed enabled by saccharide&#8208;derived bifunctional amino thiourea catalysis. This protocol provides access to a broad range of &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carboxylic phosphonates featuring the N,P&#8208;containing tetrasubstituted stereocenters with 78&#8211;99% ee. Further synthetic derivatizations could allow the introduction of amide, alcohol, and azetidine scaffolds to the core structures.

Abstract
We report a one&#8208;pot reaction of (&#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroethyl)phosphonates involving aza&#8208;Wittig reagents, in which, difluoromethylphosphonate&#8208;containing diazo and trifluoromethylated ketones assemble to furnish azo&#8208;containing &#945;&#8208;fluorovinylphosphonates. Mechanism studies disclose a pathway, which contains an aza&#8208;Wittig reaction, water addition to hydrazone, and C&#8722;F bond cleavage with an aza&#8208;Wittig reagent as a key intermediate. This reaction is conducted at 60&#8201;&#176;C affording a series of &#945;&#8208;fluorovinylphosphonate compounds in 42&#8211;94% yields and Z&#8208;stereoselectivity. This work opens a vision for the difluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted diazos, and provides a strategy for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;fluorovinylphosphonate derivatives.

         <title>Synergistic Pd/Cu Catalyzed Allylation of Cyclic Ketimine Esters with Vinylethylene Carbonates: Enantioselective Construction of Trisubstituted Allylic 2H&#8208;Pyrrole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An asymmetric allylation of cyclic ketimine esters with vinylethylene carbonates was accomplished through a Pd/Cu dual catalysis system under a mild condition, providing a range of trisubstituted allylic 2H&#8208;pyrrole analogues bearing a chiral quaternary stereogenic center in high yields (up to 92% yield) and with excellent regioselectivities and enantioselectivities (up to 96% ee). A gram&#8208;scale operation was also conducted in high efficiency without erosion of enantioselectivity and stereoselectivity.

         <title>Pentafluorophenyl Group as Activating Group: Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Deuterio Carboxylic Acid Derivatives via Et3N Catalyzed H/D Exchange</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We discovered that highly regioselective H/D exchange can be achieved on the &#945;&#8208;position of the pentafluorophenyl (Pfp) ester using Et3N as the catalyst and D2O as the deuterium source. Our computational and experimental results showed that the Pfp group can significantly increase the acidity of the &#945;&#8208;hydrogen of the ester. This mild reaction condition tolerated a variety of functional groups. Excellent yields and deuterium incorporations were obtained with all the tested Pfp esters.Taking advantage of the high reactivity of Pfp esters, a series of valuable &#945;&#8208;deuterio carboxylic acid derivatives, including herbicide and drug intermediates, have been synthesized using &#945;&#8208;deuterio Pfp esters as precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Organocatalyzed Friedel&#8211;Crafts Reaction of Trihalogenacetaldehydes and Phenols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the asymmetric organocatalyzed method for the Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction between activated phenols and trihaloacetaldehydes. An extensive three&#8208;phase screening including 41 compounds was employed to identify a catalyst structure based on 3,5&#8208;dinitrobenzamide of 9&#8208;amino&#8208;epi&#8208;cinchonidine as the lead catalytic molecule. Under the thoroughly optimized reaction conditions, the above catalyst conveniently offered trihalohydroxyalkylated adducts in yields ranging from 26 to 92% and enantiomeric ratios within 69:31&#8211;99:1. The reaction scope determined on 29 entries suggests a reasonable generality of the developed process. Moreover, several follow&#8208;up transformations of the enantioenriched products were accomplished.</dc:description>

The front cover image, provided by Fener Chen, illustrates an asymmetric allylation of cyclic ketimine esters with vinylethylene carbonates through a Pd/Cu dual catalysis system under a mild conditions. This protocol provides a range of trisubstituted allylic 2H&#8208;pyrrole analogues bearing a chiral tetrasubstituted stereogenic center in high yields and with excellent regioselectivities and enantioselectivities. A gram&#8208;scale operation was also conducted in high efficiency without erosion of enantioselectivity and stereoselectivity. Details can be found in the communication by Fener Chen and co&#8208;workers (M. Ke, Y. Yu, K. Zhang, S. Zuo, Z. Liu, X. Xiao, F. Chen, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2022, 364, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202200039)

         <title>Selective 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig versus 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of benzoimidazole thiols with propargyl alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe here the Lewis acid&#8208;promoted cyclization reaction of benzoimidazole thiols with propargyl alcohols for the selective synthesis of benzoimidazolo thiazines and benzothiazolo imidazoles. The reaction is regioselective and the solvent controls the formation of products. The systematic study to determine the best reaction conditions revealed that the six&#8208;membered benzoimidazolo thiazines were obtained by reacting the benzoimidazole thiols with propargyl alcohols in the presence of boron trifluoride etherate, using dichloromethane as the solvent. Replacement of dichloromethane with dimethylformamide, by using the same starting material and reagents, gave selectively the five&#8208;membered benzothiazolo imidazoles. The mechanism of this cyclization was proposed based on the results obtained and several control experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed, Chelation&#8208;Assisted C&#8208;H Alkenylation and Allylation of Organic Molecules with Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Olefins are important building blocks and are widely utilized in synthetic organic chemistry. Owing to its omnipresence and unique reactivity, the functionalization of alkenes has become a powerful method for constructing complex organic molecules. In this context, direct chelation&#8208;assisted C&#8208;H olefination at the inert C&#8208;H bonds represents the most straightforward synthetic method for introducing the alkenyl group into organic compounds in a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner. Despite the remarkable advances in chelation&#8208;assisted C&#8208;H olefination reaction, most of the successful transformations are restricted to activated or electronically biased olefins such as acrylates, styrenes, acrylamides, vinyl sulfones, and vinyl phosphonates. Literature reports on chelation&#8208;assisted C&#8211;H olefination with unactivated or electronically unbiased alkenes are limited due to poor intrinsic reactivity and regioselectivity issues. Despite significant challenges, the past few years have witnessed tremendous growth. The present review describes the recent advances in the chelation&#8208;assisted C&#8208;H olefination and allylation of aromatics, alkenes, and heteroaromatics with unactivated alkenes via the concerted&#8208;metallation&#8208;deprotonation pathway.Transition metals such as palladium, rhodium, iridium and cobalt are widely used for these kind of transformations. . The scope, mechanistic investigation, and limitation of the alkenylation and allylation reactions are discussed elaborately. The present review includes all the reported C&#8208;H olefination and allylation reactions with unactivated olefins via the base&#8208;assisted deprotonation pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoconfinement Effects of Micellar Media in Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Replacement of organic solvents, in particular chlorinated, aromatic, and polar aprotic ones, is an emerging issue that can find a solution in the development of catalytic reactions in water. Nature performs a multitude of chemical transformations in water under mild conditions mediated by enzymes. In particular the nanoconfinement effects of the enzymes ensure high activity and impressive stereoselectivities. Micellar catalysis is nowadays a real alternative approach to catalysis in traditional organic media, enabling good activity under mild conditions, with the advantage of possible catalyst and micellar medium recycling. Micellar media emerged also as good nano&#8208;environments for stereoselective reactions, with many examples of chemical transformations mediated by metal and organo&#8208;catalysts for which improvements of stereoselectivity were observed with respect to the same reaction under homogeneous conditions in traditional organic solvents. More specifically, both the catalytically active site and the micelles provided by the surfactant can contribute to the asymmetric induction, partially resembling what known in terms of stereoselectivity imparted by the active site of enzymes and metallo&#8208;enzymes.

Abstract
Dehydrogenative cycloisomerization/arylation sequence of heteroatom nucleophile&#8208;tethered unactivated alkynes provides a facile and powerful approach to C&#8722;C bond formation between the generated heterocycles and unfunctionalized arenes. Here, we describe a hypervalent iodine(III)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of oxazoles concomitant with the introduction of aryl groups into side chain from N&#8208;propargyl carboxamides and arenes, representing first C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bond formation by the catalytic dehydrogenative cycloisomerization/arylation reaction in exo&#8208;dig modes.

Abstract
5&#8208;Oxazoyl&#8208;sulfamates have been profiled as versatile building blocks for modifications of oxazoles with various nucleophiles. The unified approach provides a diversification platform to directly access 5&#8208;amino&#8208;oxazoles, 5&#8208;oxazolyl&#8208;sulfides, and 5&#8208;oxazoyl&#8208;aryl ethers from a single precursor.

         <title>Insights into the Mechanism of Enantioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Ring&#8208;Opening Allylic Alkylation of Cyclopropanols</title>

Abstract
Enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening allylic alkylation of a cyclopropanol with an allyl phosphate was developed using a phenol&#8208;NHC chiral ligand. DFT calculations indicated that a copper homoenolate is formed via Li&#8722;Cu bimetallic activation of a cyclopropoxide and that syn&#8208;SN2&#8217; attack of the Cu center of the homoenolate to the allyl phosphate followed by facile C&#8722;C bond formation affords the &#946;&#8208;allylated ketone. Noncovalent interaction analysis showed that the enantiocontrol is achieved by the synergy of electrostatic interactions among Cu, Li, and O atoms, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions, and C&#8722;H/&#960; London dispersions.

         <title>Integrating Terminal CoBrn Salts into a 2D Cobalt(II) Coordination Polymer to Promote the &#946;&#8208;(E)&#8722;Selective Hydroboration of Alkynes</title>

Abstract
In the present study, 2D Co(II) coordination polymers (CP&#8208;1), which integrate terminal CoBrn (CoBr2 and CoBr3) sites immobilized on the framework, are synthesized at the gram level. As a special heterogeneous catalyst, CP&#8208;1 shows regioselectivity (&#946;:&#945;&gt;99:1) and stereoselectivity (only E configuration) in the hydroboration of alkynes. The hydroboration reaction conditions are mild and cover a broad substrate range (31 examples). In addition, the heterogeneous catalyst can be recycled for at least five times.

         <title>In Tandem Auto&#8208;Sustainable Enantioselective Heck&#8208;Matsuda Reactions Directly from Anilines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An in tandem enantioselective Heck&#8208;Matsuda (HM) reaction of cyclic and acyclic olefins directly from anilines is described. The method relies on a process involving the progressive in&#8197;situ diazotization of the starting anilines followed by a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Heck&#8208;Matsuda arylation using chiral N,N&#8208;ligands. This intermolecular enantioselective HM arylation strategy was applied to the desymmetrization of three distinct unactivated olefins as proof of concept. The method demonstrates broad substrate scope furnishing the Heck adducts in good to excellent enantiomeric ratios of up to 99:1, high diastereoselectivities (cyclopenten&#8208;3&#8208;ol with&gt;20:1 dr), and good overall yields of up to 82% over 2 or 3 steps.

         <title>Diastereospecific Enantiodivergent Allylation of Pyrazolones as an Entry to &#946;&#8208;Aminoamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A diastereospecific enantiodivergent allylation of pyrazolones is reported which is catalyzed by a planar chiral pentaphenylferrocene based palladacycle. With the same catalyst batch both product enantiomers were selectively available. The method is applicable to structurally diverse substrates and gave products with enantiomeric excesses between 85 and 94%. In addition, we could show that pyrazolones are transformable into &#946;&#8208;aminoamides.
