         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Homoallylamines from Unactivated Imines and Allyl Bromides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed umpolung strategy for the synthesis of homoallylamines from unactivated imines and allyl bromides is described. This strategy exploited N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) as an auxiliary agent to indirectly realize the cross coupling of imines and allyl bromides. Various sterically hindered homoallylamines were synthesized by combining photocatalysis with halogen atom transfer (XAT). Notable characteristics of this approach include water&#8208;insensitive reaction conditions, high yield (up to 99%), wide substrate scope (suitable for N&#8208;aryl/alkyl and C&#8208;aryl ketimines and aldimines, 39 examples) and high tolerance of functional groups (such as cyano, ester, amide, and thioamide).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, Bi(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type annulation of sulfonyl o&#8208;hydroxyacetophenones with benzofused cycloethers is described. This single&#8208;step strategy provides a variety of functionalized dibenzofused medium&#8208;size (9&#8208;12) oxacycles through the formation of carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;oxygen single bonds. Further, the oxidative application of target oxacycles was investigated. The chemical structures of the key products were determined based on the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. In the overall process, water was generated as the byproduct.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A step&#8208;economical and operationally simple nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of aryl phosphates with aryl bromides through C&#8208;O bond cleavage, which precluded the employment of relatively moisture&#8208;labile and unreadily available organometallics, was developed.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation of Ynamides with Aminocarbonyls as a Route to 2&#8208;Aminoquinolines Diversely Substituted at the 4th&#8208;Position</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold&#8208;catalyzed interplay between ynamides and aminocarbonyls comprises a route to 2&#8208;aminoquinolines. This modular annulation proceeds under relatively mild conditions (Ph3PAuCl/AgNTf2 5 mol %, DCE, 60&#8211;80 &#176;&#1057;), and a number of functionalities was compatible (42 examples; 25&#8211;98% yields). In contrast to a group of other gold&#8208;catalyzed methods employing the ynamide/amine combinations for the assembly of 2&#8208;aminoquinolines, the developed approach utilizes a diversity of aminocarbonyl substrates and, in particular, allows a variation of the substituents in the 4th quinoline position. The synthetic potential of the obtained heterocyclic products was illustrated by post&#8208;modifications of the quinoline backbone and the peripheral substituents.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We present here an iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidative Csp3&#8211;Csp3 bond cleavage of unstrained tertiary alkyl aromatics to provide a range of synthetically useful arylketones even with H2O2 as the oxidant.

         <title>Modular Photochemical Flow Synthesis of Structurally Diverse Benzyne and Triazine Precursors</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzyne and related arynes are classical high&#8208;energy species with a rich history of widespread applications in synthesis. However, despite several synthetic routes being available to generate arynes and their precursors, none represents an ideal entry to benzyne chemistry in view of safety, scalability, and sustainability. Here we report a new photochemical flow process allowing for the generation of benzyne precursors in high yields and throughput, with easy isolation of multigram quantities of products. This process leverages a catalyst&#8208;free photochemical rearrangement via a photoexcited nitro arene which involves a cyclic hydroxylamine intermediate that has been fully characterized. The resulting precursors were converted to benzynes via a second photochemical flow process generating heterocyclic targets upon trapping with azide and sydnone partners. Remarkably, when reacting the benzyne precursors with secondary amines, a wide range of aryl triazines is obtained in good yields via a third photo&#8208;flow transformation. This represents a modular approach to synthesize these species, that avoids the use of potentially explosive diazonium salts. Ultimately, three photochemical flow processes using a single high&#8208;power LED light source (365 nm, adjustable in&#8208;put power) are presented with manifest benefits compared to batch processing. Moreover, the functionalization of a pendent carboxyl group to form sets of biologically relevant aryl triazine&#8208;based amides highlights further applications of these unique and industrially relevant triazine entities.</dc:description>

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Functionalization of 4a&#8208;aza&#8208;8a&#8208;boranaphthalene via Iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H Borylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general method for the functionalization of 4a&#8208;aza&#8208;8a&#8208;boranaphthalene in the position &#946; to the nitrogen atom has been developed. This method is based on a regioselective iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation process for the introduction of a boronate group, which can subsequently be transformed into a variety of aryl or alkynyl groups via cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Selective mono&#8208; or difunctionalization can be achieved by controlling the reaction conditions during the borylation step. The photophysical properties of the obtained 3&#8208; or 3,6&#8208;substituted BN&#8208;naphthalenes have been evaluated, and some of them have been found to be significantly fluorescent, with fluorescence quantum yields up to 0.85.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzodithiazoles&#8208;Sulfoximines: preparation, properties and reactivities as radical perfluoroalkylating agents</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the preparation of S&#8208;perfluoroalkyl benzodithiazole trioxides as radical perfluoroalkylating reagents. Their syntheses were performed on a multi&#8208;gram scale by an oxidative cyclization connecting the nitrogen of a sulfoximine and a sulfur atom previously introduced in the ortho position of this group. The structures and properties of these new molecules were carefully examined by X&#8208;Ray diffraction, DFT calculations and cyclic voltammetry. These data clearly highlight the enhanced reactivity of these cyclic sulfoximines compared to their open analogues.  This was confirmed by photoredox catalysis experiments that revealed interesting reactivity, most especially for the introduction of di&#8208; and monofluoroalkyl chains.

         <dc:description>A commercially available cobalt complex Cp*CoIII(CO)I2 has been found to effectively catalyze the diamination of &#945;&#8208;alkyl styrenes with anilines under a mild reaction condition, using dioxygen as the oxidant.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Direct Synthesis of Sulfur&#8208;Containing Organophosphorus Compounds via Radical Processes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Phosphonothioates, phosphinothioates and phosphorothioates are regarded as an important class of sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds. Because of the unique P(O)S&#8722;R group, these compounds have important biological activities and thus have been widely used in the fields of pharmaceuticals and pesticides. In recent years, the development of sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds by radical processes has attracted considerable attention in organophosphorus chemistry. Along these lines, in this review, the recent advances in the synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds were systematically summarized. According to the different ways of generating radicals during the formation process of phosphonothioates, phosphinothioates and phosphorothioates, these transformations can be divided into four categories: (1) Oxidant or metal&#8208;free promoted radical transformation to fabricate sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds; (2) Copper&#8208;catalyzed radical transformation to produce sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds; (3) Photo&#8208;induced radical transformation to prepare sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds; (4) Electro&#8208;induced radical transformation to derive sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds.

         <title>Synthesis of Dibenzo[b,f]azepines via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade [4 + 3] Annulation of o&#8208;Alkenyl Bromoarenes and o&#8208;Bromoaniline Derivatives</title>

Abstract
A cascade [4+3] annulation of o&#8208;alkenyl bromoarenes and o&#8208;bromoaniline derivatives was described. Various dibenzo[b,f]azepines with substitutions on the 10/11 position were obtained in 14&#8211;97% yields. The synthetic versatility of this protocol is highlighted by the preparation of a precursor of the drug molecule oxcarbazepine, a gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and two product transformations. Unlike previous amination/Heck sequence, this cascade process is supposed to undergo a C(vinyl), C(aryl)&#8208;palladacycle involved pathway.

         <title>Thiols as Powerful Atom Transfer Catalyst: Opportunities in Photoredox&#8208;Mediated Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The employing visible light to drive organic transformations is the most promising choice to meet the needs for green synthesis, in which the reactions promoted by visible light may provide a more efficient and greener method. Currently, the most abundant methods for activation and functionalization of reaction substrates have relied on the direct single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) between the excited photocatalyst and substrates, and these wonderful works were summarized and docoumented in many reviews. As a complement to the above reactions, the photoredox&#8208;mediated atom transfer transformations (photocatalyst&#8208;to&#8208;HAT catalyst&#8208;to&#8208;substrates) to generate radical species are showing an explosively growing trend. In this review, we highlight recent significant developments in this rapidly growing area, mainly focusing on the photoinduced base&#8208;to&#8208;substrates charge transfer reactions.

         <title>Chemical Modification of Peptides and Proteins Using Spirooxindole Oxirane Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Methods for chemical modification of proteins and peptides at certain positions are required for the preparation of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates, protein&#8208; or peptide&#8208;biotin conjugates, and conjugates used as therapeutics or as tools in biomedical research. We have developed chemical modification methods that use spirooxindole oxirane derivatives for the synthesis of protein&#8208; and peptide&#8208;conjugates. In most cases, the epoxide group of the spirooxindole oxirane derivatives reacted to form a covalent bond with certain histidine residues and/or the N&#8208;terminal amino group of peptides and proteins. The modification reactions of various proteins resulted in the formation of proteins modified at only one or two positions.

         <title>Photoinduced Arene C&#8722;H Amination with Ammonia: A Practical and Regioselective Strategy for Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Introducing the primary amino group into aromatic ring is one of the most important study issues in organic chemistry, particularly for the pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals chemistry. Herein, we describe a photoinduced direct C&#8722;H amination of arenes with ammonia via the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H thianthrenation that forms a new C&#8722;N bond with excellent regioselectivity. The reaction is carried out under mild conditions, and with a wide range of functional group tolerance, such as sensitive &#8722;Cl, &#8722;Br, and &#8722;OH groups which are poorly tolerated in conventional approaches. Moreover, the synthetic utility of our amination protocol has been confirmed through late&#8208;stage modification and gram&#8208;scale synthesis of complex drug&#8208;like molecules.

         <title>A Direct Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Approach to Trifluoromethylated Cyanopyrazoles and Cyanopyrazolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A three&#8208;component strategy for the synthesis of an important class of trifluoromethylated cyanopyrazoles from aldehydes, malononitrile and trifluorodiazoethane is reported. This approach involves a domino Knoevenagel condensation/1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition/dehydrocyanation process. Surprisingly, the use of cyanoacetate in place of malononitrile resulted in the formation of trifluoromethylated cyanopyrazolines. The protocol provides access to a wide variety of trisubstituted pyrazoles and pyrazolines thus expanding the chemical space for these structural units.

Structure of these two hypervalent iodine reagents were established by X&#8208;ray crystallography and their reaction with base, aniline, methanol and cyclic ether were investigated. A previously reported 1&#8208;cyanato benziodoxole compound was revisited and its structure was revised.

         <title>Dibenzoylperoxide as a Versatile Oxidant for Oxidative Azidations of Phenols Using Quaternary Ammonium Iodides or Bromides.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Dibenzoylperoxide emerged as a versatile oxidant for quaternary ammonium iodide or bromide&#8208;catalyzed reactions of phenol derivatives with NaN3. While the use of iodides allowed for efficient benzylic azidations under these oxidative conditions, the use of bromides allowed for dearomative azidations instead. Both approaches have been successfully applied to different phenol derivatives and a first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for an enantioselective variant using chiral quat. ammonium bromides has been obtained as well.

         <title>Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Organocatalytic Synthesis of Spirocyclopropyl Pyrazolones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of spirocyclopropylpyrazolones has been described through a Michael/alkylation cascade reaction of 4&#8208;arylidenepyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones with diethyl 2&#8208;bromomalonate catalyzed by (DHQ)2AQN. The reaction afforded selectively the corresponding spirocyclic compounds with 30&#8211;83% yield, diastereoselectivities ranging from 60:40 to &gt;95:5 and 26&#8211;93% enantiomeric excess under mild reaction conditions. Moreover, we performed two selective transformations with the corresponding chiral compounds.

Abstract
A Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling reaction for the regioselective assembly of various monofluoroalkene derivatives was disclosed using readily available difluorovinyl tosylates as fluorinated coupling partners. This strategy was intended for the preparation of fluorovinyl heterocycles, and the main OTs intermediates could be further processed to various fluorinated alkenyl compounds.

         <title>A Simple Preparation of Alkylzinc Reagents Compatible with Carbonyl Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we report a direct method to prepare alkylzinc compounds from functionalized alkyl bromides using cobalt catalysis under mild conditions. This procedure only requires a simple catalytic system composed of CoBr2 and bipyridine as ligand in a mixture of acetonitrile/pyridine. This reaction is stable under air and moisture conditions opening the way to an accessible procedure. A wide range of functional groups such as esters, cyano and halogens on primary and secondary alkyl bromides was well tolerated and gave high yields of the corresponding alkylzinc compounds. Additionally, we managed to form alkylzinc reagents bearing sensitive functional groups such as ketones and aldehydes with good yields. The direct application of these alkylzinc derivatives in palladium&#8208;catalyzed Negishi cross&#8208;coupling with various functionalized aryl bromides proved the efficiency and robustness of this methodology.

Abstract
Regiodivergent [3+2] and [4+2] C&#8722;H annulation of imines and imidate esters with unsymmetrical alkynes has been achieved under Rh(III) catalysis. Further transformation of the aldehyde and TMS functionality on the indene products is also demonstrated. The current work highlights the alcohols&#8208;directed multiple C&#8722;H annulation of imines and imidate esters, leading to diverse fused heterocycles.

Abstract
A selenium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular oxidative amination of cyclopentenes has been described. A variety of 2&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptenes were obtained with 58%&#8211;96% yields. This protocol was featured with mild reaction conditions and broad substrate scope. The subsequent modification of the bicyclic backbone and amino group further demonstrated the application value of this aza&#8208;bridged ring.

Abstract
Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed cascade oxidative C&#8722;H functionalization/aza&#8208;annulation of indole and pyrrole&#8208;N&#8208;carboxamides with 1,3&#8208;enynes involving 1,4&#8208;rhodium migration is disclosed. This [4+1] annulation protocol provides an approach for the synthesis of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]indol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones from easily accessible substrates. Moreover, sulfonamides are also found to be well compatible in this method, leading to the corresponding benzo[d]sultams. The efficacy of this protocol is highlighted by handy downstream conversions of the dienyl&#8208;sultam.

Abstract
An alternative strategy for the mechanochemical defluorinative acylation of ortho&#8208;hydroxyarylenaminones has been developed to synthesise 3&#8208;acylchromones utilizing CF3&#8208;compounds via activation of the C&#8722;F bound of the trifluoromethyl group in the presence of ytterbia (Yb2O3). The current protocol tolerated a wide range of coupling substrates to access a library of diversely substituted 3&#8208;acylchromones under the mechanochemically induced domino cyclisation mode. This is the first report for the deflourinative transformation of the inert CF3 group to the corresponding carbonyl functionality under the mechanochemical conditions.

Abstract
A gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade double cyclization reaction has been designed to synthesize heterobiaryl compounds such as furanyl and pyrrolyl 2H&#8208;chromenes from bis(alkynyl)&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols and 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols. The starting materials are readily available from biomass platform molecules such as &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids and &#945;&#8208;amino acids. The process involves an initial heterocyclodehydration step enabling the formation of the furan or pyrrole ring, followed by an alkyne hydroarylation to form the chromene core.

Abstract
Iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C2&#8208;alkylation of indole derivatives with terminal alkenes proceeded to give branched alkylation products with high enantioselectivity (39&#8211;99% yields, 20&#8211;91% ee). The reaction of indole derivatives having an N&#8208;substituted benzimidazolyl as a directing group gave the branch&#8208;selective alkylated products. Styrene derivatives and allylsilanes were good substrates displaying high enantioselectivity. The directing group was readily removed in several ways.

Abstract
An oxidative sulfonylation/cyclisation of N&#8208;propargylindoles with Hantzsch esters through sulfur dioxide insertion has been developed. The method uses Na2S2O5 as sulfur dioxide source along with 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted Hantzsch esters as radical precursors for accessing sulfonyl radicals, and allows for the synthesis of 2&#8208;sulfonated 9H&#8208;pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles.

         <title>Dissymmetrically Substituted Diphosphines with Two Atropisomeric Axes and Their Application in Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Imines</title>

Abstract
Despite the great potential and widespread applications, the majority of diphosphine ligands used in asymmetric catalysis are C2&#8208;symmetric and their structural modifications are often limited. Herein, we reported the design of original enantiopure dissymmetrical diphosphines, BiaxPhos, bearing two atropisomeric axes. Their original chiral architecture combined with important modularity, renders BiaxPhos ligands appealing candidates for asymmetric catalysis, as illustrated by the Ir&#8208;BiaxPhos catalyzed asymmetric imines hydrogenation, furnishing chiral amines with excellent enantioselectivities under mild conditions. Remarkably, combined experimental mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations delineate yet unexplored mechanistic scenario implying the hydrogenation of the enamine tautomeric form instead of the classic reduction of the imine.

Abstract
Conjugate addition is one of the most powerful and practical methods for the formation of carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds in organic synthesis. Owing to the rapid development of asymmetric catalysis, significant progress has been made in the field of asymmetric conjugate addition, such as 1,4&#8208;addition and 1,6&#8208;addition. However, formidable challenge of controlling chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity arises with the extended conjugated systems. Recently, with the aid of Br&#248;nsted acids catalysis, functionalized benzyl alcohols and indolylmethanols has been successfully developed as suitable precursors of electron&#8208;deficient conjugate systems for organocatalytic remote stereocontrolled conjugate additions. This review investigates the advances in the field of organocatalytic enantioselective 1,8&#8208;conjugate addition and 1,10&#8208;conjugate addition of in&#8197;situ formed electron&#8208;deficient conjugate systems from functionalized alcohols, which is organized according to the substrates.

Abstract
2&#8208;Pyrazolines are important five&#8208;membered heterocycles, containing two adjacent nitrogen atoms. They can incorporate various functional groups and possess unique biological properties. Moreover, they have been used as useful building blocks. In recent years, the field of 2&#8208;pyrazoline synthesis has experienced enormous progress. Novel strategies have been developed, and many studies reporting improvements or adaptations of existing protocols have been published, giving access to new functionalizations, unexplored structures, and/or enantioselective synthesis. This review summarizes the progress made in synthetic methodologies during the period from 2012 to 2022. The functionalization challenges and capabilities, scopes and limitations of the reactions, substitution patterns, and mechanisms of the reactions, where appropriate, will be discussed.

Abstract
The 1,4&#8208;conjugated addition of nitrogen centered nucleophiles to electron&#8208;deficient alkenes is one of the most significant and widely used reactions in modern synthetic organic chemistry. To date, various protocols for the aza&#8208;Michael reaction have been developed. However, these reports mainly focus on the use of strong Michael donors. In recent years, the conjugate addition of weak nitrogen nucleophiles to various Michael acceptors gained increasing popularity. Impressive progress in this area has been achieved by the use of more efficient catalyst systems. This review aims to provide a critical analysis of the results obtained in reactions of weak nucleophiles (azoles, pyrroles, indoles, carbamates, purines, amides, hydrazides, uraciles etc) with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes which were reported over the past twelve years.

Abstract
The synthesis of chiral contiguous cyclopropylaziridine was achieved through cyclopropanation of (E)&#8208;3&#8208;((S)&#8208;1&#8208;[(R)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethyl)aziridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl]acrylaldehyde with bromomalonate in the presence of (2R)&#8208; or (2S)&#8208;[diphenyl(trimethylsilyloxy) methyl]pyrrolidine as a chiral organocatalyst and 2,6&#8208;lutidine as a base. This chiral cyclopropylaziridine was then subjected to various functional transformations, leading to the construction of a wide range of structurally important motifs.

Abstract
Tricyclic imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones have been found in several classes of alkaloids. We report here an asymmetric approach to instal substituted imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones, which relied on a Pd/diamidophosphite&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular dearomative allylic substitution of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles derived from 3&#8208;formylindoles and amino acids. Enantioselective total syntheses of (&#8722;)&#8208;spiroquinazoline and three related alkaloids were achieved.

Abstract
Herein, we report the reactivity of cobalt(III)&#8208;catalyst towards hydroarylative functionalization of 1,6&#8208;diyne, which has never been explored before. The N&#8208;aryl lactam is the prime substrate that undergoes sp2 C&#8722;H bond activation. C&#8722;Co(III) bond formation occurs through weakly coordinating lactam group. The reaction mechanism reveals the in&#8208;situ formation of a six&#8208;membered cobaltacycle which undergoes further functionalization with 1,6&#8208;diyne. Also, radical quenching experiments suggest the involvement of the ionic pathway for this conversion. In addition, hydrogen scrambling and kinetic isotope experiments support the proposed mechanism. A wide range of electronically biased substrates and reacting partners work well with this method in a highly atom&#8208;economical fashion.

C&#8722;Co(III) bond formation occurs through weakly coordinating lactam group. The reaction mechanism reveals the &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; formation of a six-membered cobaltacycle which undergoes further functionalization with 1,6-diyne. Also, radical quenching experiments suggest the involvement of the ionic pathway for this conversion. In addition, hydrogen scrambling and kinetic isotope experiments support the proposed mechanism. A wide range of electronically biased substrates and reacting partners work well with this method in a highly atom-economical fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed One&#8208;Pot Cycloisomerization/Nucleophilic Addition/Rearrangement of Acenaphthylene Carbaldehyde Derivatives</title>

Abstract
Merging the latest advances in the field of gold catalysis and the efficiency of hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP), a gold&#8208;catalyzed orthogonal tandem reaction has been developed to access carbocyclic ketone on naphthalene substrates. The methodology involved a cycloisomerization/nucleophilic addition and a C&#8594;O rearrangement. The HFIP solvent most probably acted as a Lewis&#8208;acid on isochromene derivatives, through hydrogen donor bond activity. A large range of acenaphthylene carbaldehyde has been engaged in this process coupling gold catalysis and Lewis&#8208;acid behavior of HFIP leading to cyclic ketones with a yield ranging from 15 to 91% (27 compounds). The mechanism was investigated, and the reaction most presumably occurred via a classical cyclization process followed by a [Au]&#8208;HFIP interaction for the final rearrangement. The interest of such transformation was demonstrated by performing it on a gram&#8208;scale. Moreover, a post&#8208;functionalization bromination was performed, as well as the isomerization of some functionalized ketones leading to full trans derivatives with a yield ranging from 78 to 90% yields.

         <title>Synergistic Photoredox and Iron(II) Catalyzed Carbophosphorothiolation of Vinyl Arenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A three&#8208;component vicinal carbophosphorothiolation of vinyl arenes by the cooperation of visible light and iron(II) catalysis has been established for the synthesis of S&#8208;alkyl phosphorothioates. Noteworthy, the late&#8208;stage functionalization of biologically active compounds has been performed using this procedure. The preliminary mechanistic study reveals that the catalytic cycle is accomplished by single&#8208;electron transfer (SET).

         <title>Computational Insights into the Reactivity Difference between Hypervalent Bromine(III) and Hypervalent Iodine(III) Reagent in the C&#8722;H Amination and Alkene Aziridination</title>

Abstract
We present herein a computational exploration into the mechanism and origin of the reactivity difference between N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodane and N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;bromane in the C&#8722;H amination and alkene aziridination. Our calculations revealed that the preferred mechanism for C&#8722;H amination involves the generation of free nitrene intermediate, while the alkene aziridination proceeds via a concerted reaction mechanism. The superior reactivity of N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;bromane over N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodane could be mainly ascribed to better nucleofugality of the bromanyl moiety, which can be characterized by the strength of I&#8722;N and Br&#8722;N bond. The effect of solvent polarity on the reactivity of N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;bromane as a nitrene precursor will be discussed.

         <title>Catalytic Cycloisomerization of Enyne Diesters Derived from Biaryls and Related Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Enyne diesters derived from biaryls and related substrates undergo intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition and concomitant cyclo&#8208;reversion when treated with 10&#8197;mol% In(OTf)3 in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane. This enyne metathesis type cycloisomerization reaction enables the synthesis of phenanthrene, benzophenanthrene, benzotetraphene and other polycyclic (hetero)aromatic compounds bearing a synthetically useful diethyl &#946;&#8208;(hetero)arylidene malonate moiety in a step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economic manner. In(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed two independent intramolecular cycloisomerization on substrates 5&#8201;a and 5&#8201;b provides direct access to benzotetraphenes 6&#8201;a and 6&#8201;b containing bis(diethyl &#946;&#8208;phenylmethylene malonate) moiety. Tetrasubstituted vinylidene malonate 4&#8201;a, substiututed by two different aromatic groups, is stereoselectively converted into E&#8208; and Z&#8208;isomer of triaryl group containing all carbon tetrasubstituted olefins (8&#8201;a, 8&#8201;a&#8242; and 8&#8201;b) via Pd&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective decarboxylative arylation reaction.

In(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed two independent intramolecular cycloisomerization on substrates &lt;b&gt;5&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;5&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; provides direct access to benzotetraphenes &lt;b&gt;6&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;6&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; containing bis(diethyl &#946;-phenylmethylene malonate) moiety. Tetrasubstituted vinylidene malonate &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;, substiututed by two different aromatic groups, is stereoselectively converted into &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-isomer of triaryl group containing all carbon tetrasubstituted olefins (&lt;b&gt;8&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;8&#8201;a&#8242;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;8&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;) via Pd-catalyzed stereoselective decarboxylative arylation reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
The established process proceeds through copper (II)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722; functionalization of &#946;&#8208;diketones/&#946;&#8208;ketoesters with 2&#8208;bromobenzaldehyde oximes followed by the intramolecular cyclization of in&#8197;situ generated acylated intermediates to deliver isoquinoline N&#8208;oxides. The copper(II) acetate catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization showed maximum efficacy at 60&#8201;&#176;C in methanol/toluene as solvent. The described reaction conditions were applicable over a wide range of substrates with a variety of functional groups to yield isoquinoline N&#8208;oxides in yields up to 85%. The developed approach was further elucidated by means of control experiments and DFT calculations.

Abstract
A multicomponent tandem arylation reaction was established under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions to synthesize structurally diverse imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines. As N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline is not only a reactant but also a methylation reagent, its use affords an alternative route for methylation. This approach features mild reaction conditions and good functional group tolerance, providing 29 compounds in acceptable yields.

         <title>Enantioselective C&#8722;P Bond Formation through C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An enantioselective C&#8722;P bond formation has been developed through a C(sp3)&#8722;H activation in an oxidation step followed by an organocatalyzed hydrophosphonylation protocol. The asymmetric organocatalytic Pudovik reaction has been achieved following a one&#8208;pot strategy, starting from different benzylic and allylic alcohols and dibenzyl phosphite, using MnO2 as the oxidant and a chiral squaramide as organocatalyst. The scope of the reaction provides enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxy phosphonates with yields from 40% to &gt;95% and enantioselectivities from 64% to &gt;99%. Furthermore, the use of this methodology has been demonstrated to form a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter, generating an acetophenone derivative in&#8197;situ, using diphenyl phosphite. Therefore, this approach represents an asymmetric strategy for constructing chiral C&#8722;P bonds, which are of interest to the pharmaceutical industry.

Abstract
A method for the construction of the indane skeleton through palladium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening diarylation of Cyclobutanols with aryl 1,2&#8208;dihalides has been described. The ring&#8208;expansion reaction involves &#946;&#8208;carbon elimination of Cyclobutanols and subsequent &#945;&#8208;carbon arylation of ketone to give 2&#8208;acylindanes in 42&#8211;93% yields.

         <title>Recent Developments in Selenylation and Thiolation of Alkenes via Three&#8208;component Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkenes are valuable feedstocks in organic synthesis. Selenium or sulfur&#8208;containing coumpounds with a neighboring functional group can be prepared by direct difunctionalization of alkenes via three&#8208;component reactions. It will reduce the number of steps and waste generation, and form complicated molecules from simple starting materials. Herein, recent developments (2013&#8208;2022) have been summarized via two categories: (1) selenylation via seleniranium intermediates or Se&#8208;centered radicals; (2) thiolation with more diverse mechanisms and products. Reactions with electron&#8208;rich arene, alcohols, water, acids, NaN3, amines, KSCN, and sulfamides, TMSNCS, TMSN3, Et3N&#8226;3HF, SOCl2, HCl, NFSI, tBuONO, pyridinium salts, tBuOOH, ArN2BF4, CO2, CO, O2, CF3SO2Cl, R2P(O)&#8208;H, (RO)2P(O)SH, (RO)2P(O)OH et al will be discussed. We hope this review will do help for future research in this area.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Synthesis of Epoxides from Alkenes by Hydrogen Peroxide with Titanium Silicalite&#8208;1 Catalyst Using Flow Reactors</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Continuous&#8208;flow epoxidation of aliphatic and aromatic alkenes with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was carried out to give epoxides using a fixed&#8208;bed liquid flow reactor equipped with a solid titanium silicalite&#8208;1 (TS&#8208;1) catalyst column. The developed flow reaction enables continuous synthesis of 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;epoxybutane from 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;butene in 90%&#8211;98% yields (22.4 g) for 150 h from a catalyst column of 5 mm inner diameter with 100 mm length. Employment of a mixed solution of MeCN and MeOH with preservation of the Ti active site in TS&#8208;1 crystal structures with few defects permits continuous epoxidation of less&#8208;reactive long&#8208;chain terminal alkene and multifunctional alkene to give epoxides in 12%&#8211;98% yields with 78%&#8211;99% selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Intramolecular Hydroacylation of Alkynes by Rhodium Catalysis through Dynamic Kinetic Resolution.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroacylation of racemic alkynals having a substituent at the &#945;&#8208;position of the carbonyl group. Mechanistic studies revealed that hydroacylation occurs preferentially from one enantiomer of the racemic substrate via a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process. The picture shows an outline of the DKR process by using an illustration of soccer, in which the player getting the good ball (i.&#8201;e., enantiomer) successfully scores a goal. Details can be found in the Communication by Yoshihiro Sato and co&#8208;workers (Y. Oonishi, K. Takagishi, Y.&#8208;M. Liu, Y. Sato, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2023, 365, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202300206).

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N,N&#8217;&#8208;Diaryl ethylenediamines are common feedstocks in organic synthesis and important structural motifs in medicinal chemistry. Whereas the C&#8208;N formation reactions based on anilines and aryl halides are the most direct methods to access N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl ethylenediamines, the photocatalytic synthetic version remains undeveloped. Herein we describe the dual nickel/photoredox&#8208;catalyzed amination reaction using nitroarenes and trimethylamine as reaction substrates. This cascade transformation hinges on the multiple C&#8208;N and C&#8208;C coupling events based on the nitrogen radical and &#945;&#8208;aminomethyl radical derived from nitroarene and trimethylamine, respectively. A variety of N&#8208;formyl N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl ethylenediamines can be obtained under the reaction protocol. Subsequent hydrolysis offers the N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl ethylenediamines for further derivatizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Free Activation of Alkynyl Glycosyl Carbonate Donors</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accessing homogenous glycoconjugates is of significance for assessing their biophysical activities and sometimes as vaccine candidate. Synthesis of glycoconjugates involves two species of which, glycosyl donor plays pivotal role in controlling the outcome of the glycosylation. Recently discovered alkynyl glycosyl carbonate donors possess self&#8208;stability, high reactivity, and fast reaction time (15&#8208;30 min) when activated with [Au]/[Ag]&#8208;catalysts.  Herein, we report metal free conditions for the activation of the same alkynyl glycosyl carbonate donors using I2/TMSOTf in stoichiometric quantities.  Extrusion product was characterized to be the vinylidene iodide by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis.  The reaction conditions were illustrated to be suitable for synthesis of various glycosides, purine/pyrimidine nucleosides and a pentasaccharide repeating unit of Klebsiella pneumoniae (O&#8208;3&#8208;antigen).</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Aminopiperidines via I(III)&#8208;Mediated Olefin Diamination with (Hetero)aryl Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
3&#8208;Aminopiperidines are a valuable motif present in small molecule pharmaceuticals and bioactive natural products. Synthesis of these moieties via olefin diamination would be an attractive approach, however significant challenges remain with regards to both regioselectivity and exogenous nucleophile scope. Herein, we report a metal&#8208;free olefin diamination via a &#8220;heterocyclic group transfer&#8220; (HGT) reaction of I(III) N&#8208;HVI reagents, giving rise to 3&#8208;aminopiperidines with high selectivity. The HGT strategy leverages heteroarenes as oxidatively masked amine nucleophiles, giving rise to (hetero)arylonium salt products which are isolated via simple trituration and provide a versatile handle for downstream diversification. This represents only the second 6&#8208;endo selective I(III)&#8208;mediated diamination reaction and mechanistic studies indicate ring opening of an intermediate aziridinium ion is responsible for the 6&#8208;endo selectivity.

         <title>Fluorinated Substrates as Michael Acceptors Towards Fine Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Michael addition reaction, known since the 19th century, appeared as a relevant method with a great potential to design new organofluorinated fine chemicals and enlarged their structural diversity. In the Michael addition reaction for the synthesis of organofluorine compounds, the fluorinated blocks can be both used as the Michael donors and acceptors, but the latter is relatively rare. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the use of fluorinated substrates as Michael acceptors in Michael reactions.

         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed allylic C&#8208;H oxidative allylation of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones to synthesize skipped 1,4&#8208;dienes is demonstrated. This direct allylic alkylation reaction has excellent site selectivity, tolerates a wide range of functional groups, and affords 1,4&#8208;dienes in moderate to good yield. Moreover, this olefination method allows the regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of 1,4&#8208;dienes containing a trisubstituted alkene. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction undergoes allylic C(sp3)&#8208;H activation and a subsequent carbene migratory insertion.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Nitro Reduction using Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon&#8208;Encapsulated Ni Catalyst and Y&#8208;Type Packed Bed Column for Continuous Flow Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective reductions of nitro&#8208;containing arenes and heteroarenes were achieved in 5 min at room temperature utilizing inexpensive NaBH4 as a hydrogen source and a newly developed Ni@N&#8208;C catalyst, obtained via a simple carbon coating process without the need for an external carbon source. A wide variety of nitro derivatives, including pharmaceutical molecules, were successfully reduced to their corresponding amines in yields ranging from 45% to 99% using the Ni@N&#8208;C catalyst under general batch conditions. The reactivity and selectivity of nitro reduction were further enhanced by a continuous flow reaction system, especially when a newly designed Y&#8208;type column was used, and the Osimertinib intermediate was produced on a gram scale after 24 h without any nickel metal contamination or silica gel chromatography purification.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a photocatalytic strategy for selective reduction of nitroarenes to azoxy&#8208;, azo&#8208; and hydrazo&#8208;compounds catalyzed by bismuth porphyrin metal organic framework (Bi&#8208;MOF) through controlling time, atmosphere, or the quantity of NaBH4 under mild conditions (Rt, Light). The photocatalytic protocol exhibited excellent functional group compatibility, and the recyclability of Bi&#8208;MOF was demonstrated by five cycle tests. More importantly, the scale&#8208;up experiment of 10 g can also be carried out smoothly with excellent yield of 95%. This green and effective photocatalytic strategy provides a practical possibility for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of azo intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically mediated fixation of CO2: synthesis of functionalized oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones by three&#8208;component reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Carbon dioxide is a harmful greenhouse gas, as well as a valuable resource. Here, a three&#8208;component cyclization reaction was developed for the synthesis of oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones by immobilizing CO2 under the electrochemistry and copper catalyst. Propargyl amide was used as the reaction substrate to capture carbon dioxide to produce carboxyl anion, while selenide produced electrophilic receptor to activate the triple bond under electrochemical conditions. Then, intramolecular cyclization reaction was carried out to obtain the target product. Through this environmentally friendly strategy, a series of important oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones was synthesized.

Abstract
The combination of the catalytic power of amorphous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (aMOFs) and biocatalysis has greatly boosted the development of novel synthetic strategies due to its functional diversity and stereospecificity. 2&#8208;Cyanoacrylamides are important building blocks for many biologically active molecules. Herein, we described a chemical&#8208;biological relay catalytic method to access (E)&#8208;2&#8208;cyanoacrylamides based on the catalysis of amorphous porphyrin&#8208;MOFs SPUZ&#8208;1 and whole cells of Rhodococcus rhodochrous (nitrile hydratase). The approach was proved to be simple and efficient, and the highest conversion was up to 99%

         <dc:description>Effective access to new types of azolium salts with varying stereoelectronic properties has always fascinated the organometallic chemists. Herein, we described a Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed unprecedented one&#8208;step access to diverse meta&#8208;alkylated N&#8208;aryl (benz)imidazolium salts (&gt;40 examples) via &#963;&#8208;bond activation strategy starting from the readily available azolium salts using alkyl bromide. Notably, the present method is compatible with a wide range of azolium salts and secondary/tertiary alkyl bromides, including the biologically relevant motifs. Various control experiments along with the DFT calculation established the reaction pathway of first the orthometalated Ru(II)&#8208;NHC complex (6) formation followed by the generation of a Ru(III)&#8208;intermediate, which controls the observed meta&#8208;selectivity, via single electron transfer. Crucially, detailed insight of the reaction mechanism helped to comprehend why some substrates are challenging for this methodology.</dc:description>

Abstract
Grignard reagent&#8208;mediated and solvent&#8208;controlled regioselective 1,8&#8208;addition of &#945;&#8208;(2&#8208;thienylidene)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketosulfones provides diversified substituted 2&#8208;thienylmethyl &#946;&#8208;ketosulfones in moderate yields in a diethyl ether&#8211;dioxane cosolvent and dioxane (v/v=4/1) under ice&#8208;bath conditions. The 1,4&#8208;addition of &#945;&#8208;heterocyclic &#946;&#8208;ketosulfones was also studied. The structure of the key product was confirmed via X&#8208;ray analysis. The uses of various reaction solvents and organomagnesium bromides were investigated for transition metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H functionalization. Related plausible mechanisms are proposed and discussed. The DFT calculations are utilized to rationalize the regioselectivity of the 1,8&#8208;addition reaction.

         <title>Discovery and Engineering of an Ene&#8208;reductase for Kinetic Resolution and Cascade Reduction of Hajos&#8208;Parrish/Wieland&#8208;Miescher Ketones</title>

Abstract
Ene&#8208;reductase (ERED)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones is an attractive method in organic synthesis. Through the discovery and further structure&#8208;guided protein engineering of BsER, an ERED from Bacillus subtilis, the selective bio&#8208;reduction of the well&#8208;known building blocks Hajos&#8208;Parrish ketone (HPK, 1&#8201;a) and Wieland&#8208;Miescher ketone (WMK, 1&#8201;b) was achieved in this study. The optically pure (R)&#8208;HPK ((R)&#8208;1&#8201;a) and (R)&#8208;WMK ((R)&#8208;1&#8201;b) with corresponding &gt;99% and 98% enantiomeric excess (ee) values were obtained by kinetic resolution of the racemic substrates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of ERED mediated kinetic resolution of rac&#8208;HPK and rac&#8208;WMK. In addition, the reduction products cis&#8208;7a&#8208;methylhexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;indene&#8208;1,5(4H)&#8208;dione (cis&#8208;2&#8201;a) and cis&#8208;8a&#8208;methylhexahydronaphtha&#8208; lene&#8208;1,6(2H,5H)&#8208;dione (cis&#8208;2&#8201;b) with high diastereomeric ratios (dr) were also obtained. We also developed four routes of biocatalytic cascade reduction involving BsER and ketoreductases (KREDs). Using optimized ERED&#8208;KRED and KRED&#8208;ERED cascades, (S)&#8208;HPK ((S)&#8208;1&#8201;a) and (S)&#8208;WMK ((S)&#8208;1&#8201;b) could be reduced stepwise, yielding the bioactive products all with &gt;91% purity. This study presents a biocatalytic strategy for the kinetic resolution and cascade reduction of HPK and WMK (1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b).

         <title>In situ Generated Copper(II)&#8208;Quinoline Complexes as Robust and Versatile Photocatalysts for the Chlorosulfonylation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A series of copper complexes was synthesized and studied as photocatalysts for the chlorosulfonylation of olefins. Featuring a tetradentate ligand consisting of one amino quinoline and two methyl pyridine moieties, the resulting Cu(II)&#8208;complex is effective under visible light irradiation to add sulfonyl chlorides to alkenes and alkynes, including unactivated aliphatic olefins. A weak base additive such as Na2CO3 prevents catalyst poisoning, resulting in an improvement of reaction yields and catalyst lifetime. A broad scope of sulfonyl chlorides and alkenes/alkynes as coupling partners are amenable for the title process, including examples previously reported unsuccessful with established copper&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Enantioselective Intramolecular Hydroacylation of Alkynes by Rhodium Catalysis through Dynamic Kinetic Resolution.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroacylation of racemic alkynals having a substituent at the &#945;&#8208;position of the carbonyl group. Mechanistic studies revealed that hydroacylation occurs preferentially from one enantiomer of the racemic substrate via a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process. The picture shows an outline of the DKR process by using an illustration of soccer, in which the player getting the good ball (i.&#8201;e., enantiomer) successfully scores a goal. Details can be found in the Communication by Yoshihiro Sato and co&#8208;workers (Y. Oonishi, K. Takagishi, Y.&#8208;M. Liu, Y. Sato, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2023, 365, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202300206).

         <title>Hypervalent Halogen Compounds in Electrochemical Reactions: Advantages and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. The clean and facile electrochemical synthesis of hypervalent iodine reagents is a fast growing field. In the past 5 years, a diverse number of reaction types have been established, from fluorinations, oxidative cyclizations, C&#8211;N and C&#8211;H couplings and oxidations. Electrochemistry is beneficial in terms of sustainability as the requirement for chemical oxidants is eliminated. This contributes to cleaner processes with limited by&#8208;product waste. Often, the purification of iodine(III) compounds is simple, since electrolysis is performed in the absence stoichiometric oxidants. Significant breakthroughs have been made recently, including the first asymmetric application, electrocatalytic applications, and even the synthesis of bromine(III) reagents using similar methodologies.

         <title>Highly Atom&#8208;Economic and Efficient Electrochemical Selenylative Annulation of 2&#8208;Alkynyl Biaryls</title>

Abstract
A catalyst&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free, highly efficient, scalable, and sustainable synthetic method is developed for the selenylative annulation of 2&#8208;alkynyl biaryls or 2&#8208;heteroaryl&#8208;substituted alkynyl benzenes with readily available diselenides under electrochemical conditions to synthesize a wide variety of selanyl polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic heteroaromatics in high to excellent yield up to 99% at room temperature in a short time (2&#8208;5&#8197;h). The transformation required only electricity as a green reagent and produces hydrogen gas as the only innocuous byproduct. Notably, the green chemistry metrics of the protocol are found excellent. Mechanistic studies revealed a radical pathway being initiated by the in&#8197;situ generation of the corresponding selenyl radical from diselenides under electrochemical conditions. Significantly, a direct comparison of the electrochemical approach with that of our previously developed iodine&#8208;catalyzed chemical approach revealed that the electrochemical approach is not only catalyst&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free, but also more energy&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;yielding, sustainable, and practical.

&lt;p&gt;A catalyst- and oxidant-free, highly efficient, scalable, and sustainable synthetic method is developed for the selenylative annulation of 2-alkynyl biaryls or 2-heteroaryl-substituted alkynyl benzenes with readily available diselenides under electrochemical conditions to synthesize a wide variety of selanyl polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic heteroaromatics in high to excellent yield up to 99% at room temperature in a short time (2-5&#8197;h). The transformation required only electricity as a green reagent and produces hydrogen gas as the only innocuous byproduct. Notably, the green chemistry metrics of the protocol are found excellent. Mechanistic studies revealed a radical pathway being initiated by the &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; generation of the corresponding selenyl radical from diselenides under electrochemical conditions.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Transformations Involving the Heck Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elaborated molecular architectures including complex carbocycles, heterocycles, and polycyclic molecular structures represent an important class of organic compounds because they are ubiquitous structural units in a broad variety of biologically and pharmacologically relevant natural products, medicinal molecules, and functional materials. A major challenge in modern synthetic methodology is the development of strategically efficient and selective construction of these compounds from readily available starting materials. Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations involving Heck reaction as the pivotal step have afforded a powerful approach for accessing sophisticated polycyclic skeletons from a set of easy&#8208;to handle starting materials, thus highlighting its potential significance in streamlining the drug discovery process. Over the past few decades, significant effort has been devoted to accessing complex polycyclic derivatives in efficient and versatile routes, and a number of powerful and direct synthetic strategies have been reported. In this review, the latest advances in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations involving Heck reaction as the critical step are summarized, which could be divided into six categories: 1) Heck/Sonogashira tandem reaction; 2) Heck/Suzuki tandem reaction; 3) Heck/Heck tandem reaction; 4) Heck/Hiyama tandem reaction; 5) Heck/Cacchi tandem reaction; 6) Heck/C&#8208;H bond functionalization tandem reaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we develop a metal catalyst&#8208;free protocol for O&#8208;arylation of benzamide hydroxamate esters. The chemoselective O&#8208; versus N&#8208;arylation of the amides was tuned by varying the electronic and/or steric properties of the diaryliodonium salt and/or the substrate. The O&#8208;arylation reaction would preferentially occur for sterically and electronically diverse substrates. This study, which reveals the possibility of substituent&#8208; and reagent&#8208;controlled chemoselectivity, with diaryliodonium salts is expected to attract great interest in the area of hypervalent iodine chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Carboline Regioisomers Based on Unified Synthetic Approaches</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Carbolines are a prominent class of tricyclic alkaloids omnipresent in natural products and bioactive compounds. Four different carboline regioisomers are known (&#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, and &#948;&#8208;carbolines), which can be classified according to the nitrogen atom position inside the pyridine ring. As an emerging structural motif in drug discovery, a multitude of synthetic methods have been established for the construction of carboline frameworks, which in general requires customized approaches for the assembly of each regioisomer. Distinguishingly, their frameworks are also accessible from unified approaches, which are capable of generating multiple regioisomers, thus suitable for introducing diversity in isomeric carbolines. In this review, the construction of isomeric carbolines based on unified synthetic approaches is summarized.

Abstract
Herein, an eco&#8208;friendly and atom&#8208;economical electrochemical methodology with isatins and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinolines through NHPI/O2&#8208;mediated intermolecular oxidation/annulation is disclosed, leading to a variety of polycyclic quinazolinones in 46&#8211;82% yields. This oxidative cyclization proceeded in transition metal&#8208; and strong oxidant&#8208;free conditions and generated H2 and CO2 as byproducts. Additionally, late&#8208;stage functionalization and broad substrate scope demonstrated the synthetic usefulness of this protocol.

         <title>Fluoroalkyl Iodides in Fluoroalkylative Difunctionalization of C&#8722;C Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Fluorinated alkyl iodides serve as a convenient and inexpensive source of fluoroalkyl radicals that can readily undergo addition to the C&#8722;C unsaturated bonds of alkynes and alkenes which is the foundation for a variety of useful synthetic protocols. Since 2010 this field has witnessed huge progress in several respects. First the portfolio of fluorinated alkyl iodides was extended beyond only simple perfluoroalkyl iodides (CnF2n+1I). In particular, employment of iododifluoro&#8722;methyl&#8208; carbonyls and phosphonates has enabled facile installation of the medicinally relevant difluoromethylene motif. Secondly, from a conceptual point of view, novel strategies for activation of fluoroalkyl iodides towards radical formation have been introduced, relying on the formation of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes, photoredox catalysis, frustrated Lewis pairs and transition metal catalysis, complementing prior approaches based on heat and UV induced C&#8722;I homolysis, radical initiators, and simple electron transfer processes. Based on these strategies a range of novel fluoroalkylative transformations of unsaturated systems have been added to classical iodoperfluoroalkylation. Broadly applicable protocols for simple fluoroalkylation and hydrofluoroalkylation, as well as for more sophisticated, complexity&#8208;building methods of fluoroalkylation&#8208;annulation and tandem multicomponent fluoroalkylations with concomitant installation of another functionality have been recently disclosed. This review summarizes the progress achieved since 2010 in the reactivity of fluoroalkyl iodides towards alkenes and alkynes with emphasis placed on the above&#8208;mentioned advances.

     alt="Fluoroalkyl Iodides in Fluoroalkylative Difunctionalization of C&#8722;C Multiple Bonds"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorinated alkyl iodides serve as a convenient and inexpensive source of fluoroalkyl radicals that can readily undergo addition to the C&#8722;C unsaturated bonds of alkynes and alkenes which is the foundation for a variety of useful synthetic protocols. Since 2010 this field has witnessed huge progress in several respects. First the portfolio of fluorinated alkyl iodides was extended beyond only simple perfluoroalkyl iodides (C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2n+1&lt;/sub&gt;I). In particular, employment of iododifluoro&#8722;methyl- carbonyls and phosphonates has enabled facile installation of the medicinally relevant difluoromethylene motif. Secondly, from a conceptual point of view, novel strategies for activation of fluoroalkyl iodides towards radical formation have been introduced, relying on the formation of electron donor-acceptor (EDA) complexes, photoredox catalysis, frustrated Lewis pairs and transition metal catalysis, complementing prior approaches based on heat and UV induced C&#8722;I homolysis, radical initiators, and simple electron transfer processes. Based on these strategies a range of novel fluoroalkylative transformations of unsaturated systems have been added to classical iodoperfluoroalkylation. Broadly applicable protocols for simple fluoroalkylation and hydrofluoroalkylation, as well as for more sophisticated, complexity-building methods of fluoroalkylation-annulation and tandem multicomponent fluoroalkylations with concomitant installation of another functionality have been recently disclosed. This review summarizes the progress achieved since 2010 in the reactivity of fluoroalkyl iodides towards alkenes and alkynes with emphasis placed on the above-mentioned advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Catalytic Difluoromethylation of Alkenes with Difluoroacetic Anhydride: Reactivity of Fluorinated Diacyl Peroxides and Radicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Given the importance of difluoromethylated molecules for drug and agrochemical development, much attention has been drawn to the establishment of related synthetic protocols, as exemplified by the CF2H radical&#8208;mediated catalytic difluoromethylation of alkenes. However, most of these difluoromethylations proceed under photocatalytic conditions, whereas those requiring thermal conditions are few. Herein, we developed a general and practical method of Cu&#8208;catalyzed alkene difluoromethylation with difluoroacetic anhydride (DFAA) as a CF2H source, showing that the thus realized amino&#8208;, allylic&#8208;, and oxy&#8208;difluoromethylations involve bis(difluoroacetyl) peroxide (BDFAP) in&#8197;situ generated from DFAA and H2O2 and further demonstrating the occurrence of carbo&#8208;difluoromethylation under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The obtained results pave the way to the simple and efficient synthesis of a broad range of difluoromethylated species and thus facilitate their practical applications, including those in medicinal and agricultural chemistry. Moreover, we probed the mechanisms of the observed transformations, rationalized the extraordinary fast decomposition of BDFAP compared to that of diacyl peroxides containing CF3 or CF2Cl groups, and performed DFT calculations to shed light on the low stability and decomposition mode of BDFAP. Finally, we examined the influence of fluorinated radical philicity on the reaction outcome.

Abstract
Since their structural elucidation in 1935, the introduction and substitution of functional groups and the modification of the steroidal scaffolds have been a fertile ground of research for synthetic and medicinal chemists. The discovery of steroids with hormonal and pharmacological activity has stimulated tremendous efforts to the development of highly selective and efficient synthetic procedures. Despite the progress made, steroid chemistry remains challenging and the preparation of steroidal compounds of pharmaceutical interests and in clinical practice, often requires long and elaborated synthesis. In recent years, a new impetus in the field came with the advent of enabling chemical technologies, such as continuous flow chemistry, which are exploited to overcome problems that arise from batch synthesis. Although it is still a niche sector, the use of flow technology in steroid synthesis and functionalization holds the premise to empower methodology development and to provide innovative tactics also for many hitherto uncharted chemistries. In this review, scientific contributions are reported and discussed in terms of flow set&#8208;up and advantages offered concerning process efficiency, optimization, waste minimization, safety improvement, easy scale&#8208;up and costs. We also highlight the main challenges, key improvements and the future trajectory in the application of continuous flow chemistry and its implementation to different disciplines such as photochemistry and biocatalysis with the ultimate goal of streamlining steroid synthesis.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Enabled Photo&#8208;Sulfonylation of Aryl Halides Using Alkylsulfinates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A photochemical synthetic method to access sulfones from aryl halides and sodium alkylsulfinates in the presence of CuCl is reported. Regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity for the sulfonylation is observed for polyhalogenated arenes. Mechanistic studies indicate that a copper sulfinate reagent is formed in&#8197;situ from CuCl and sodium sulfinate based on NMR experiments. Potential reaction intermediates, including excited state aryl halides are studied using density functional theory calculations and reveal energetically accessible non&#8208;planar triplet geometries.

         <title>Radical Decyanations of Unactivated Carbon&#8208;CN Bonds: Recent Achievements and Mechanistic Studies</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Decyanation is an important process in the synthesis of aromatic molecules in the studies of pharmaceutical research, medical and materials sciences. In late&#8208;stage modifications of privileged carbo/heterocyclic scaffolds, radical&#8208;type decyanation techniques have been devised to date. As a result, the chemistry of cyano&#8208;involved conversions, a hotly debated subject over the past few decades, has advanced significantly. The cyano group (CN), on the other hand, has rarely been acknowledged as a good reaction site due to its thermodynamic robustness. The most recent advancements in catalytic radical decyanation protocols that CN behaved as a leaving group has made are surveyed in this article. Following the introduction of a number of different reaction modes, the catalytic reactions that are used to activate the C&#8722;CN bonds are primarily categorized, and the text herein are divided into three groups: (1) photo&#8208;catalyzed decyanation transformations, (2) electro&#8208;catalyzed decyanation transformations, and (3) transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed or metal&#8208;free decyanation transformations. With an emphasis on the catalytic systems and synthetic applications in C&#8722;CN bond activation, this review will provide the readers with an overview of decyanation chemistry in radical reactions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decyanation is an important process in the synthesis of aromatic molecules in the studies of pharmaceutical research, medical and materials sciences. In late-stage modifications of privileged carbo/heterocyclic scaffolds, radical-type decyanation techniques have been devised to date. As a result, the chemistry of cyano-involved conversions, a hotly debated subject over the past few decades, has advanced significantly. The cyano group (CN), on the other hand, has rarely been acknowledged as a good reaction site due to its thermodynamic robustness. The most recent advancements in catalytic radical decyanation protocols that CN behaved as a leaving group has made are surveyed in this article. Following the introduction of a number of different reaction modes, the catalytic reactions that are used to activate the C&#8722;CN bonds are primarily categorized, and the text herein are divided into three groups: (1) photo-catalyzed decyanation transformations, (2) electro-catalyzed decyanation transformations, and (3) transition-metal-catalyzed or metal-free decyanation transformations. With an emphasis on the catalytic systems and synthetic applications in C&#8722;CN bond activation, this review will provide the readers with an overview of decyanation chemistry in radical reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
Herein, we report the &#945;&#8722;C&#8722;H acyloxylation of sulfides and disulfides enabled by hypervalent iodine(III) reagents via photoredox catalysis. The methoxylbenziodoxole derivatives serve as the hydrogen atom transfer agent, the mild oxidant, and the acyloxylation source in the reaction. External nucleophiles can also be introduced to the &#945;&#8722;C&#8722;H of sulfides. The reaction applies to various aryl and alkyl sulfides including methionine peptide derivatives. Disulfides are applicable for the first time with excellent chemoselectivity and functional group compatibility.

         <title>Advancements in the Synthesis of Diaryliodonium Salts: Updated Protocols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Our group has reported several one&#8208;pot protocols for the synthesis of diaryliodonium salts, which have been recognized as attractive multi&#8208;purpose reagents in areas ranging from organic synthesis to materials chemistry. Over the years, we have identified limitations in the published protocols concerning synthesis of mixed electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor, as well as highly electron&#8208;poor diaryliodonium salts, as the corresponding starting materials are either too reactive or too unreactive. In this update, we discuss the underlying limitations concerning the stability and reactivity of the involved reagents and provide strategies to overcome these challenges through updated synthetic protocols.

         <title>Enantioselective Intramolecular Hydroacylation of Alkynes by Rhodium Catalysis through Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroacylation of racemic alkynals having a substituent at the &#945;&#8208;position of the carbonyl group is described. This reaction can be applied for the wide range of substrates (22 examples), and mechanistic studies revealed that a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process occurs during the hydroacylation, giving various cyclic ketones in 47&#8211;93% yields with 59:41 to 97:3 er from racemic starting materials.

         <title>Recent Progress in Synthetic Applications of Cyclic Hypervalent Iodine(III) Reagents</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Hypervalent iodine compounds have found broad application in modern organic chemistry as reagents and catalysts. Cyclic hypervalent iodine reagents based on the benziodoxole heterocyclic system have higher stability compared to their acyclic analogues, which makes possible the preparation and safe handling of the reagents with special ligands such as azido, cyano, and trifluoromethyl groups. Numerous iodine&#8208;substituted benziodoxole derivatives have been prepared and utilized as reagents for transfer of the substituent on hypervalent iodine to organic substrate. Reactions of these reagents with organic substrates can be performed under metal&#8208;free conditions, in the presence of transition metal catalysts, or using photocatalysts under photoirradiation conditions. In this review, we focus on the most recent synthetic applications of cyclic hypervalent iodine(III) reagents with the following ligands: N3, NHR, CN, CF3, SCF3, OR, OAc, ONO2, and C(=N2)CO2R. The review covers literature published mainly in the last 5&#8197;years.

Abstract
A new N&#8722;F reagent, N,N&#8242;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium bis(tetrafluoroborate), for iodoarene&#8208;catalyzed fluorination reactions as a terminal oxidant is reported. This reaction is effective for the fluorination of simple alkenes, aromatic alkenes and 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds, giving 1,2&#8208;difluorinated alkanes, geminal difluorinated compounds, 2&#8208;fluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds in good to high yields, respectively. This is a useful fluorination reaction that not only improves the issues of the fluorination reaction using conventional mCPBA as a terminal oxidant but also constructs a simpler catalytic cycle. The present N&#8722;F reagent can be recovered as 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine.

         <title>Synthesis of Fluoroalkylated Pyrrolidines through Neat Reaction of Fluoroalkyl Iodides with N, N&#8208;Diallylamines</title>

Abstract
We presented a cascade transformation of N, N&#8208;diallylamines and fluoroalkyl iodides into various functionalized fluoroalkylated pyrrolidines through a visible light&#8208;induced synthetic process in the solvent&#8208;free conditions. In this reaction system, the substrate N, N&#8208;diallylamine acted both as the base and the electron donor. We further demonstrated the practicality of this protocol by the direct modification of amino acids and pharmaceutical molecules.

         <title>Multifaceted Domino Knoevenagel&#8208;Cyclization Reactions; Four Movements for 2H&#8208;Chromenes and Chromans</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Domino Knoevenagel&#8208;cyclization reactions of 2H&#8208;chromene and chroman derivatives containing o&#8208;formylaryl amine or ether side&#8208;chain was carried out to produce four series of chiral condensed heterocycles representing four novel skeletons and exhibiting antiproliferative activity. The cyclization step occurred with four different mechanisms: a concerted intramolecular hetero Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (IMHDA), a stepwise polar [2+2] cycloaddition, a [1,5]&#8208;hydride shift&#8208;6&#8208;endo cyclization or a multi&#8208;step nitro hetero Diels&#8208;Alder&#8208;ring&#8208;opening&#8208;Cadogan&#8208;type cyclization sequence. The latter reaction provided a new route to hydroxyindoles by an inverse Cadogan&#8208;type cyclization, in which the nitro group is deoxygenated by a nitro IMHDA&#8208;ring&#8208;opening sequence. The cyclization mechanisms and their stereoselectivity were studied by DFT calculations, based on which we proposed a mechanism for the multi&#8208;step cyclization to hydroxyindoles and explained the observed diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Construction of Functionalized Isocoumarin, Flavone, and Isoquinolinedione via a One&#8208;pot Reaction of o&#8208;Quinol Acetate and Soft Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A one&#8208;pot strategy for the synthesis of substituted isocoumarin, flavone, and isoquinolinedione derivatives through a switchable C&#8208;arylation/lactonization or SNAr reaction from a wide range of soft nucleophiles and o&#8208;quinol acetates has been developed. This base&#8208;mediated protocol proceeds under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions and selectively affords various heteroarenes in 13&#8211;98% yields from readily prepared or commercially available 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl and &#945;&#8208;EWG&#8208;substituted carbonyl compounds. The synthetic utility is further demonstrated in the synthesis of potential anti&#8208;HIV and anti&#8208;coronavirus derivatives and COX&#8208;2 inhibitors. In addition, detailed experimental and computational studies are performed to provide an intensive understanding and strong support of the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Short and Scalable Synthesis of Plant&#8208;Based Cholesterol in GMP Grade</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A plant&#8208;based straightforward and short four&#8208;step synthesis of cholesterol starting from commercially available diosgenin is reported. This offers a large&#8208;scale production of highly needed GMP&#8208;grade cholesterol, which is part of the lipid cocktail for the assembly of effective mRNA&#8208;based vaccines against the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. These lipids are formulated into the delivery system of the mRNA fragments by forming Lipid Nano Particles (LNP) that introduce the mRNA into the cells. Cholesterol plays a crucial role because it stabilizes LNP and facilitates endosome escape of the mRNA into the cytosol.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Cyclization of Spirocyclopropanes with Stabilized Phosphorus Ylides: Access to Indane and Azulene Skeletons</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
In this study, regio&#8208; and diastereoselective ring&#8208;opening cyclization of spirocyclopropanes with phosphorus ylides stabilized by electron&#8208;withdrawing groups were developed. The reaction of various cyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione&#8208;2&#8208;spirocyclopropanes with phosphorus ylides bearing alkoxycarbonyl groups proceeded smoothly without any additives to provide the corresponding 6,7&#8208;dihydroindan&#8208;4&#8208;ones in 32&#8211;87% yields. Cycloheptane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione&#8208;2&#8208;spirocyclopropanes were also used in this reaction, producing the corresponding products 1,2,3,6,7,8&#8208;hexahydroazulen&#8208;4&#8208;ones in 52&#8211;67% yields. The resulting [5.6]&#8208; and [5.7]&#8208;fused carbocyclic products were readily converted into highly substituted indanes and azulenes, respectively, by oxidation.

The reaction of various cyclohexane-1,3-dione-2-spirocyclopropanes with phosphorus ylides bearing alkoxycarbonyl groups proceeded smoothly without any additives to provide the corresponding 6,7-dihydroindan-4-ones in 32&#8211;87% yields. Cycloheptane-1,3-dione-2-spirocyclopropanes were also used in this reaction, producing the corresponding products 1,2,3,6,7,8-hexahydroazulen-4-ones in 52&#8211;67% yields. The resulting [5.6]- and [5.7]-fused carbocyclic products were readily converted into highly substituted indanes and azulenes, respectively, by oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Trisubstituted Piperidines via Biocatalytic Transamination and Diastereoselective Enamine or Imine Reduction</title>

Abstract
Substituted piperidine rings are a common motif in natural products and pharmaceutical drugs. The asymmetric synthesis of piperidines bearing multiple stereocentres remains a challenge, and current approaches often rely on lengthy reaction sequences and &#8216;chiral pool&#8217; strategies. Herein, we report multi&#8208;enzymatic and chemo&#8208;enzymatic methods that allow the preparation of piperidines with three chirality centres in only two steps from achiral diketoester precursors. Stereocontrol is achieved by a highly enantioselective transamination leading to optically pure (ee &gt;99%) enamine or imine intermediates, followed by diastereoselective reduction of these unsaturated N&#8208;heterocycles using either platinum(0)&#8208;catalysed flow hydrogenation or enzymatic imine reduction. In the latter case, coupling of the two biocatalytic reactions in a concurrent one&#8208;pot process is possible, thus reducing the synthetic sequence to a single biotransformation. In total, nine trisubstituted piperidines were prepared in high stereoisomeric purities (dr &#8805;98:2) and isolated yields of up to 73%. Lead&#8208;likeness analysis of five representative products using an open&#8208;source webtool suggests that these compounds possess considerable application potential as building blocks in drug discovery.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Construction of Fluorinated Chiral Alcohols via Sequential Substitution/Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Bromoarylketones and Fluoroalcohols</title>

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot synthesis of fluorinated chiral alcohols from &#945;&#8208;bromoarylketones and fluoroalcohols is described. The fluorinated ketone intermediates were formed from &#945;&#8208;bromoarylketones with fluoroalcohols as nucleophiles and solvents, which were reduced subsequentially by adding a chiral Ru catalyst and a mixture of formic acid and triethyl amines (FA: TEA=1.1:1) as hydrogen donor to give 27 examples of fluorinated chiral alcohols in 60&#8211;93% yields and 85&#8211;98% ee values. Notably, K3PO4 acts as a base in nucleophilic substitution and an additive in reductive step to enhance the reactivity and enantioselectivity, which is crucial for constructing compatible conditions for one&#8208;pot process. This one&#8208;pot process is also applicable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis.
