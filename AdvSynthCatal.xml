Abstract
Functionalized dihydrocoumarins, including 3&#8208;amino&#8208; and 4&#8208;amino dihydrocoumarins serving as &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives, have been synthesized using one&#8208;step site&#8208; and regioselective alkylamination from coumarins. This conversion offers 35 examples in 24% to 81% yields.

Abstract
Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed chelation&#8208;assisted C8&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkenylation and alkylation of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tretrahydroquinolines with styrenes and allylic alcohols have been realized. The cationic Rh(III) catalytic system in combination with a catalytic amount of copper acetate uses oxygen as the terminal oxidant and catalyzes the stereoselective C8&#8208;alkenylation of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines with styrenes to give the corresponding products in 56&#8211;93% yields with wide substrate scope and broad functional group compatibility. The reaction can be scaled up. Moreover, this protocol can be extended to the C8&#8208;alkylation of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines with allylic alcohols, providing access to various 8&#8208;(3&#8208;oxoalkyl)&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines in 77&#8211;90% yields. The selection of N&#8208;directing group is essential for catalysis, and the readily installable and removable N&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrimidyl) group proves to be optimal choice. Preliminary mechanistic studies are performed to gain insights into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Multifaceted Domino Knoevenagel&#8208;Cyclization Reactions; Four Movements for 2H&#8208;Chromenes and Chromans</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Domino Knoevenagel&#8208;cyclization reactions of 2H&#8208;chromene and chroman derivatives containing o&#8208;formylaryl amine or ether side&#8208;chain was carried out to produce four series of chiral condensed heterocycles representing four novel skeletons and exhibiting antiproliferative activity. The cyclization step occurred with four different mechanisms: a concerted intramolecular hetero Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (IMHDA), a stepwise polar [2+2] cycloaddition, a [1,5]&#8208;hydride shift&#8208;6&#8208;endo cyclization or a multi&#8208;step nitro hetero Diels&#8208;Alder&#8208;ring&#8208;opening&#8208;Cadogan&#8208;type cyclization sequence. The latter reaction provided a new route to hydroxyindoles by an inverse Cadogan&#8208;type cyclization, in which the nitro group is deoxygenated by a nitro IMHDA&#8208;ring&#8208;opening sequence. The cyclization mechanisms and their stereoselectivity were studied by DFT calculations, based on which we proposed a mechanism for the multi&#8208;step cyclization to hydroxyindoles and explained the observed diastereoselectivity.

Abstract
The synthesis of 2&#8208;aminopyrrolo[1,2&#8208;b]pyridazines from 1,3&#8208;diynamides and 1&#8208;aminopyrroles via gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective hydroamination/hydroarylation cascade was described. 26 examples were conducted to explore the scope of the substrates. A plausible reaction mechanism was also proposed. In addition, the fluorescence properties both in solutions and in the solid states of the resulting products were investigated.

         <title>Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted Benzofuran via HNTf2/TMSOTf Catalyzed Intermolecular Reaction of o&#8208;alkenyl phenols and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The synthetic methods of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted benzofurans have been widely studied, however, the maneuvers of using o&#8208;alkenyl phenols as starting materials are less explored. Herein, we report a general and efficient strategy via HNTf2/TMSOTf catalyzed cascade reaction with readily available o&#8208;alkenyl phenols and aldehydes as starting materials, which provides 2,3&#8208;disubstituted benzofuran derivatives in moderate to good yields.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthetic methods of 2,3-disubstituted benzofurans have been widely studied, however, the maneuvers of using &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-alkenyl phenols as starting materials are less explored. Herein, we report a general and efficient strategy via HNTf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TMSOTf catalyzed cascade reaction with readily available o-alkenyl phenols and aldehydes as starting materials, which provides 2,3-disubstituted benzofuran derivatives in moderate to good yields. This method features metal-free circumstances, broad substrate scope, mild reaction conditions, and easy scale preparation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Conjugated and non&#8208;conjugated allenones appear as recurring motifs in organic synthesis, natural products and mechanistic investigations showing unique properties and applications. The ability of allenones to build cycles has provided a direct access to strained systems, medium&#8208;sized rings, arenes, heterocycles and complex polycycles. In addition, allenones have served as models in mechanistic investigations and catalysis. The critic compilation herein presented will provide an exhaustive overview of the synthetic possibilities allenones may offer, which certainly will inspire our community in their search of more efficient synthetic methodologies, preparation of biological and pharmaceutical targets, and improve our knowledge in theoretical organic chemistry. Great part of this review will discuss synthetic aspects, catalysis innovation and mechanistic insights of the chemical transformations implying the allenone motif. In addition, many examples on total synthesis and pharmacologically active compounds will be described. We hope that this overview will be attractive to the organic chemistry, synthetic chemistry, catalysis, theoretical chemistry, natural products and medicinal chemistry communities.

         <title>Photoinduced Radical Cyclization of 1,6&#8208;Diynes: Rapid Access to Highly Substituted Carbocyclic and Heterocyclic Compounds</title>

Abstract
We have developed photoinduced sulfonyl radical&#8208;triggered cyclization of 1,6&#8208;dynes without metals, oxidants, or additives. During the reaction, three new bonds are formed (&#8722;SO2&#8722;C, C&#8722;C, and C&#8722;I/C&#8722;Se&#8722;) under mild conditions, with excellent selectivity. The conversion is temporally and atomically economical and is easy to handle even on a gram scale. Detailed mechanistic studies showed that the reaction proceeds via a radical pathway. Subsequent synthetic transformations of the new products produced various substituted compounds. Importantly, we observed an unprecedented and selective C&#8722;C single bond cleavage with boronic acid insertion under Suzuki reaction conditions.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Construction of Functionalized Isocoumarin, Flavone, and Isoquinolinedione via a One&#8208;pot Reaction of o&#8208;Quinol Acetate and Soft Nucleophiles</title>

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot strategy for the synthesis of substituted isocoumarin, flavone, and isoquinolinedione derivatives through a switchable C&#8208;arylation/lactonization or SNAr reaction from a wide range of soft nucleophiles and o&#8208;quinol acetates has been developed. This base&#8208;mediated protocol proceeds under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions and selectively affords various heteroarenes in 13&#8211;98% yields from readily prepared or commercially available 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl and &#945;&#8208;EWG&#8208;substituted carbonyl compounds. The synthetic utility is further demonstrated in the synthesis of potential anti&#8208;HIV and anti&#8208;coronavirus derivatives and COX&#8208;2 inhibitors. In addition, detailed experimental and computational studies are performed to provide an intensive understanding and strong support of the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Multicomponent Radical Cascade Versatile Alkylation of Quinoxalinones Enabled by Electron Donor Acceptor Complex in Water</title>

Abstract
An operationally simple aqueous phase three&#8208;component photochemical strategy for the alkylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with diethyl &#945;&#8208;bromomalonate and unactivated alkenes in the absence of both photoredox catalysts and additive has been developed. This reaction is driven by the photochemical activity of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes formed by quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and diethyl &#945;&#8208;bromomalonate. Irradiation with visible light triggered single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) from the quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones to the diethyl &#945;&#8208;bromomalonate, inducing the formation of the corresponding alkyl radical and the subsequent radical tandem reaction. It provides an efficient way to construct alkylated quinoxalinones from simple small molecules.

The front cover picture, designed by Tsuchimoto, illustrates the world of the formation of o&#8208;bis(3&#8208;indolyl)arenes that we had not anticipated. Before starting this research project, our purpose was to develop a unique&#8208;forming process of 3&#8208;arylindoles by reacting indoles with 7&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept&#8208;5&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;one in the presence of a (Lewis) acid catalyst and H&#8722;Si. Contrary to our expectations, the treatment of the two substrates in the presence of catalyst CF3SO3H but without H&#8722;Si was found to yield o&#8208;bis(3&#8208;indolyl)arenes with structural diversity. Details can be found in the Research Article presented by Tsuchimoto and co&#8208;workers (R. Tokunaga, T. Okusa, T. Tsuchimoto, Adv. Synth.

         <title>Sulfonamide as Photoinduced Hydrogen Atom Transfer Catalyst for Organophotoredox Hydrosilylation and Hydrogermylation of Activated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Readily available, sterically, and electronically tunable sulfonamides have been developed as effective photoinduced hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysts for selective Si&#8722;H functionalizations of a broad range of silanes. N&#8208;centered radicals, catalytically generated from sulfonamides by photoredox catalyzed single&#8208;electron oxidation, are the key intermediates that enable an effective HAT process for silyl radical generation to achieve hydrosilylation of activated alkenes. Additionally, this catalytic system can also be applied for the activation of Ge&#8722;H bond for hydrogermylation of activated alkenes through hydrogen atom transfer by sulfonamide derived nitrogen centered radical. The ability to generate silyl and germyl radical using this photochemical HAT process offers new avenue towards the sustainable synthesis of organosilicon and organogermanium compounds.

Abstract
Iridium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;alkylation of methyl ketones with primary carbohydrate alcohols proceeded via borrowing hydrogen strategy. Protected sugar derivatives having one free primary hydroxyl group reacted with methyl ketones to give the &#945;&#8208;alkylation products or alkylated 4,5&#8208;unsaturated sugars along with the elimination of an alkoxy group.

         <title>Multicomponent Tandem Triple Functionalization of Indoles via a Directing&#8208;group&#8208;free Strategy</title>

Abstract
The position&#8208;selective functionalization of the poorly reactive benzenoid nucleus of indoles has remained a great challenge in organic chemistry. Here we describe a directing&#8208;group&#8208;free, three&#8208;component tandem C3&#8208;acylation/C5,6&#8208;H disulfenylation of indoles via an iodine&#8208;, Lewis acid&#8208; and Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;cooperated mediated strategy. This protocol is remarkable for its exceptional regio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;selectivity, broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance and mild reaction conditions. Advantageously, the present protocol offers great potential for the development of general site&#8208;selective functionalization at the benzenoid nucleus of indoles, removing the requirement for neighbouring activating groups.

Abstract
An access to functionalised eight&#8208;membered carbocyclic ring compounds was developed by simply stirring an unusual vinylogous Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropane (DAC) in boiling o&#8208;xylene. Both experimental and computational studies were performed to explain the diastereoselectivity/regioselectivity transfer observed and to provide an overall picture of the mechanism.

         <title>Condition&#8208;Controlled Divergent Synthesis of Imidazoindolone Spiroisoquinolinones from N&#8208;Alkoxycarboxamide Indoles and Diazo Homophthalimides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Presented herein is a condition&#8208;controlled divergent synthesis of imidazoindolone spiro&#8208;isoquino&#8208; linones (IISIQs) via the cascade reactions of N&#8208;alkoxy&#8208; carboxamide indoles with diazo homophthalimides. When the reaction is carried out under air and in the absence of an acid additive, IISIQ tethered with a N&#8208;alkoxy moiety (IISIQ&#8208;OR) is formed through Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H metalation, carbene formation/ migratory insertion followed by reductive elimination, in which air acts as an oxidant to regenerate the Rh(III) catalyst. When the reaction is run under argon and in the presence of MesCO2H, on the other hand, IISIQ&#8208;H is formed through rhodacycle intermediate formation, carbene insertion followed by acid&#8208;assisted intramolecular substitution/annulation and N&#8722;O bond cleavge. In general, this method provides a divergent approach toward spiroheterocyclic scaffolds and features accessible substrates, functional group compatibility and uses air as an external oxidant. Moreover, the value of this developed protocol is further showcased by gram&#8208;scale synthesis and structural transformation of products.</dc:description>

This reaction features broad substrate scope (39 examples), good tolerance of various functionalities, and circumvention of pregenerating organometallics, offering a general synthetic route to prepare diverse organofluorines incorporating both a gem&#8208;difluoroalkene and a gem&#8208;difluoroalkane moiety.

         <title>Design, synthesis and application of C2&#8209;symmetric cycloglycerodiphosphate catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral phosphoric acids (CPAs) and their salts are the privileged catalysts in a plethora of asymmetric transformations. All of the scaffolds of efficient CPAs rely on C2&#8209;symmetry and axial chirality, while the only examples of punctually chiral CPAs are TADDOL derivatives. Herein, we present the design and the synthesis of the first C2&#8209;symmetric cycloglycerophosphates (cGPAs) and their application throughout the addition of trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) to aldehydes and ketones, to obtain the corresponding cyanohydrins in excellent yield and high optical purity (average ee = 91.6% for 27 examples). A DFT computational model is moreover performed to rationalize the reaction mechanism and its stereochemical outcome.</dc:description>

Herein, we report the development of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208; and external&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free electrochemical cross&#8208;coupling hydrogen&#8208;evolution chemistry involving glycine amides and diarylphosphine oxides. A broad range of biologically active &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates was obtained in moderate to good yields in a clean and sustainable manner. Moreover, the TBAB (tetrabutylammonium bromide) electrolyte was recycled four times without obvious loss of reaction activity. Moreover, this protocol was performed on the gram scale under slightly modified electrolytic conditions or in combination with continuous flow microreactor technology. Control experiments were used to disclose a possible free&#8208;radical mechanism.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Functionalization of para&#8208;Benzoquinones: Access to Dihydroquinoxalines with a Tetrasubstituted Carbon Stereocenter</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 365, Issue 6, Page 892-899, March 21, 2023. </description>

Visible light induced activation of para&#8208;benzoquinone, and its sequential coupling with alkynes and ortho&#8208;phenylenediamines/ortho&#8208;aminophenols is reported. The protocol provides a route for synthesizing value&#8208;added quinoxaline derivatives with tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter at room temperature in 36&#8211;75% yields. Mechanistic investigation suggests that the reaction proceeds via in&#8208;situ generation of para&#8208;quinone methide through direct excitation of para&#8208;benzoquinone in blue light.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Construction of Sulfonyl Benzonorcaradienes</title>

         <dc:description>
We report here on a one&#8208;pot stereoselective synthesis of strained sulfonyl benzonorcaradienes, which proceeds through base&#8208;mediated tandem annulation of o&#8208;bis&#8208;sulfonylmethyl arenes with diversified chalcones (&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls) via intermolecular desulfonylative cyclopropanation, followed by intramolecular condensation. A plausible mechanism is proposed and discussed. The proposed synthetic route forms two carbon&#8208;carbon single (C&#8722;C) bonds and one carbon&#8208;carbon double (C=C) bond.

The front cover picture illustrates the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;functionalized and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;difunctionalized ketones from 1&#8208;arylallylic alcohols via dipotassio &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dianion intermediates using (trimethylsilyl)methylpotassium as the base. To reach the castle, a metaphor for the target product, a cannonball must hit the castle. Only cannonballs representing potassium bases reach the castle, whereas those of lithium and sodium bases fall into the woods. This implies that only potassium bases are effective in the synthesis. Details can be found in the Communication by Masahiro Sai and co&#8208;workers (R. Hayashi, K. Ando, T. Udagawa, M. Sai, Adv. Synth.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 365, Issue 6, Page 834-853, March 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semipinacol rearrangement has brought several elegant methods for the rapid synthesis of various complex scaffolds and as a result, has been applied extensively in the total synthesis of natural products. Apart from the classical ways, where transition metal or acids catalyzes the formation of carbocation, the semipinacol rearrangement has seen numerous revolutions and now are being happening in an eco&#8208;friendly manner relying on a catalytic radical&#8208;polar crossover tool. These catalytic processes are mainly occurring through photocatalysis or electrocatalysis. This review will provide a brief idea of these developments.

         <title>Recent Developments in Enantioselective Domino Reactions. Part B: First Row Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 365, Issue 6, Page 768-819, March 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review updates the field of enantioselective domino reactions promoted by chiral catalysts derived from first row metals, such as zinc, iron, copper, scandium, nickel, cobalt, titanium, chromium and magnesium as special case, published since the beginning of 2019. It illustrates how much a diversity of these catalysts allow an impressive range of novel highly enantioselective domino reactions of many types to be achieved, providing a one&#8208;pot access to very complex and functionalized chiral molecules from simple starting materials.

&lt;p&gt;This review updates the field of enantioselective domino reactions promoted by chiral catalysts derived from first row metals, such as zinc, iron, copper, scandium, nickel, cobalt, titanium, chromium and magnesium as special case, published since the beginning of 2019. It illustrates how much a diversity of these catalysts allow an impressive range of novel highly enantioselective domino reactions of many types to be achieved, providing a one-pot access to very complex and functionalized chiral molecules from simple starting materials.

         <title>Directed Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed pseudo&#8208;Anomeric C&#8722;H Functionalization of Glycal&#8208;Type Substrates: Access to Unsymmetrical gem&#8208;Diarylmethyl C&#8208;Glycosides</title>

Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed, bidentate directing group (BDG)&#8208;assisted C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization of C2&#8208;amido glycals onto the anomeric position is described as a contemporary method for the construction of various unsymmetrical gem&#8208;diarylmethyl C&#8208;glycosides. Thanks to a bidentate amidoquinoline&#8208;type directing group, the insertion of diverse para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) onto the pseudo&#8208;anomeric position of glycal substrates were executed in moderate to good yields. Further functionalization of the final product can be successfully demonstrated by known palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis of 5&#8208;Cyano&#8208;pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines Enabled by Aerobic Manganese Catalysis</title>

An aerobic Mn(III)&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component synthesis of 5&#8208;cyano&#8208;pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines has been described. The synergistic combination of Strecker reaction and oxidatively&#8208;induced 6&#960;&#8208;azacyclization is the key to the success of this multicomponent synthesis. Differing from previous reports relied on toxic cyanating agents or multistep synthesis, this mechanistically distinct protocol serves as a step&#8208;economic, regioselective and functionally tolerant strategy to obtain 5&#8208;cyano&#8208;pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines.

         <dc:description>
We describe a decarboxylative coupling reaction of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters with bromopolyfluorobenzene enabled by the synergetic action of Hantzsch ester, photoredox catalyst, and nickel catalyst. This method readily converts primary and secondary alkyl carboxylic acids into the corresponding polyfluoroaryl compounds with broad scope and excellent functional group compatibility. The practicality of this method was further demonstrated by the direct modification of amino acids and biologically active molecules

This study reports the synthesis of diverse &#946;&#8208;functionalized ketones from readily available 1&#8208;arylallylic alcohols in the presence of (trimethylsilyl)methylpotassium (TMSCH2K). The reaction proceeded via the formation of the highly nucleophilic dipotassio &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dianion as the key intermediate, which served as a metal homoenolate equivalent. This protocol also allowed the one&#8208;pot synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;difunctionalized ketones using two different electrophiles, thus demonstrating its synthetic advantages over other protocols involving metal homoenolates.

         <title>Martin Silicates as Partners in Photoredox/Ni Dual Catalysis for the Installation of CH3, CH2D, CD2H, CD3 and 13CH3 Groups onto (Hetero)Arenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 365, Issue 6, Page 884-891, March 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of a methyl group and its 13C and 2H labeled analogs on Csp2&#8208;centers remains a challenging issue in synthetic chemistry. While the photoredox/Ni dual catalysis has proven to constitute a valuable methodology for the forging of Csp2&#8722;Csp3 bonds, the high difficulty to generate the methyl radical and to control its reactivity has severely limited the development of reliable processes. Herein, we introduce the easily prepared and bench&#8208;stable Martin methylsilicates bearing two C,O&#8208;bidentate hexafluorocumyl alcohol ligands as a class of radical precursors for dual catalysis enabling the chemoselective methylation of (hetero)aryl halides and acyl chlorides as well as the access to the corresponding CD3, CD2H, CHD2 and 13CH3 analogs in good yields.

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced oxidative carboazidation of arylacrylamides by cascade C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming strategy is reported. Various functional groups are tolerated to afford the desired azide oxindoles in 22&#8211;86% yields under the standard conditions. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the reaction proceeded via a radical pathway.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Aldehydes or Alcohols from CO2 via Formamides or Silyl Formates</title>

The solvent&#8208;free N&#8208;formylation of 2&#8208;(methylamino)pyridine with CO2 and phenylsilane was catalyzed by Cu(OAc)2 alone to give N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)formamide called Comins&#8208;Meyers formamide. The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of a copper complex revealed a paddle&#8208;wheel structure consisting of two copper ions bridged by four acetate ions with two molecules of 2&#8208;(methylamino)pyridine on both axial sites, which suggested (i) the improved solubility of the copper ion and (ii) the enhanced nucleophilicity of the acetate ion for the activation of phenylsilane. 1H NMR spectra of benzene&#8208;d6 solutions containing Cu(OAc)2, 2&#8208;(methylamino)pyridine, and phenylsilane showed a singlet signal at 2.62&#8197;ppm, which was assigned to a catalytically active Cu&#8722;H species, and this signal disappeared upon exposure to CO2. Comins&#8208;Meyers formamide synthesized from 2&#8208;(methylamino)pyridine via the copper&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of CO2 under solvent&#8208;free conditions was directly subjected to the Grignard reactions in THF for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of aldehydes or alcohols. On the other hand, silyl formates prepared from CO2 and phenylsilane using tetrabutylammonium acetate (TBAA) as an organocatalyst were also found to be good precursors of alcohols.

         <title>Photoinitiated Deaminative Alkylation of Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones via Electron Catalysis</title>

A visible&#8208;light initiated deaminative C3 alkylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with Katritzky salts is reported. This radical process provides an approach to a range of C3 alkylated quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives in 40&#8211;96% yields under metal&#8208; and external photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions. The reaction is enabled by the deprotonation of acidic aminyl radical intermediates to generate the corresponding radical anions, which act as single electron transfer reducing reagents to sustain the radical chain. The late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug&#8208;based amines further demonstrates the value of this approach.

         <dc:description>The selective olefin isomerization of homoallyl silyl ethers and carbonates was studied using RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 as a catalyst.  While an aryl or alkyl substituent at the alpha&#8208;position to the oxygen atom caused the selective conversion to allyl silyl ethers, no substituent at the alpha&#8208;position resulted in the isomerization to enol silyl ethers.  In contrast, the isomerization of homoallyl carbonates gave the corresponding allyl carbonates selectively regardless of the substituent at alpha&#8208;position.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Dehydrogenation of Substituted Cyclohexanones to Phenols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of substituted phenols via a direct carbonyl desaturation is an intrinsic challenging task in modern synthetic chemistry. Herein, we develop a modular catalytic protocol for the synthesis of substituted phenols via the direct dehydrogenative aromatization of simple cyclohexanones in a metal&#8208;free manner. A broad variety of substrates bearing an assortment of functional substituent groups are compatible with this protocol. Preliminary mechanistic investigations revealed that the reaction underwent a hydride leaving mechanism in the presence of a catalytic amount of tetrabutylammonium iodide. The current approach features simple operation, low reagent cost and green conditions. Insight gained from our studies is expected to advance general efforts towards the green synthesis of structurally diverse phenols via readily available raw materials, offering an alternative strategy for the carbonyl desaturation in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An electrochemical oxidative approach to spirooxazolidinones from phenol derivatives via intramolecular dearomative amination reactions is developed. This reaction proceeds without metal catalysts and external chemical oxidants, and shows broad substrate scope and diverse functional group compatibility. The synthetic utility of this strategy is further exhibited by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage functionalization. By slightly tunning the reaction conditions, the alcohols (1&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;) can be afforded from phenol derivatives, which is a good strategy for the deprotection of &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;methoxyphenyl (PMP) group to recover the alcohol function.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A highly efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of N&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;quinolones was developed via C&#8208;N coupling reaction. Various chiral quinolones were readily obtained with desirable enantioselectivity (up to 95% ee) and excellent yield (up to 98%), enabled by a simple system of palladium acetate and chiral ferrocene bisphosphine as auxiliary ligand. The corresponding racemic derivatives can also be synthesized by a transition metal&#8208;free strategy of potassium hydroxide in DMSO. The influence of temperature on the configurational stability of these C&#8208;N axially chiral compounds was also investigated. The efficient functionalization at 3&#8208;position further expands the application range of this synthetic technique.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Benzylation of Carbonyl Compounds Enabled by Synergistic Copper/Amine Catalyzed Decarboxylation of Arylacetic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report synergistic copper/amine&#8208;catalyzed chemistry for directly &#945;&#8208;benzylating carbonyl compounds with arylacetic acids. These reactions represent the first examples of decarboxylative oxidative synergistic transition&#8208;metal/enamine catalysis for &#945;&#8208;functionalizing carbonyl compounds. The process features starting&#8208;material availability, good functional group tolerance, mild reaction conditions, and good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. Dibenzylated products were formed in moderate yields under slightly altered reaction conditions, and some products were transformed into 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indole derivatives by acid&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular cyclization reactions with indoles. Moreover, biological studies revealed that some products have anticancer properties and may be useful in drug&#8208;discovery studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Dual C&#8208;H Activation for Regioselective Triple Annulation of Enaminones: Access to Polycyclic Naphthopyran Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation of arenes for oxidative annulations with alkynes stands out as a protocol for polycyclic scaffolds. This perspective drives us to disclose herein a rhodium catalyzed regioselective triple annulation of enaminones with hydroxyl&#8208;alkynoates via double C&#8208;H functionalization for polycyclic naphtho&#8208;pyran scaffolds. Secondary coordination of OH in alkynoate dictated the regioselectivity. Initial lactonization occurred chemoselectively on to enamine part via carbo rhodation followed by reductive elimination. This protocol was scalable and has shown high functionality tolerance. KIE studies were done to get insight in to the mechanism, and some downstream transformations were achieved to show the synthetic potential of the method.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A catalytic system is described in which achiral Ni is immobilized on mesoporous silica material with external addition of a chiral modifier enabling continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective reactions with catalyst&#8208;packed bed reactors.

         <title>Base&#8208;Controlled Chemoselective Reaction of High&#8208;Valent Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 Compounds with Anilines: Access to Formamides or Hydrazines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports reactivity properties of Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 compounds with anilines wherein basicity&#8208;dictating distinct reactivities are achieved, giving rise to formamides or hydrazines. Competing generation of difluorocarbene and N&#8208;centered radical is proposed that is controlled by the basicity of reaction solution. Specifically, under acidic or neutral conditions, reaction of anilines with Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 compounds produces formamides wherein difluorocarbene is involved to undergo aniline formylation. In contrast, in the presence of a base, this same reaction selectively gives hydrazines instead wherein Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 compounds act as an oxidizing reagent to allow dehydrogenative N&#8208;H/N&#8208;H coupling of two anilines through N&#8208;centered radical. The scope of both reactions is studied, and application to medicinally relevant compounds is shown. This study shows the unusual use of high&#8208;valent Cu(III) trifluoromethyl compounds as a hydrogen&#8208;abstracting reagent to allow dehydrogenative reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Deconstructive cyanomethylation enabled by radical cross&#8208;coupling through multiple C&#8208;C bond and C&#8208;H bond cleavage</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Being in its infancy, radical cross&#8208;coupling is highly efficient for C&#8208;C bond construction, though suffers from selectivity problems and limited reaction types. New methodologies to realize radical cross&#8208;coupling selectively are highly desired. Herein, an iron catalyzed deconstructive cyanomethylation of unstrained cyclic and linear alcohols with acetonitrile has been developed through radical cross&#8208;coupling. The unprecedented method enables a ring&#8208;opening functionalization of cyclohexanols to produce &#945;&#8208;cyanomethyl ketones. Notably, the highly challenging reaction involves twice C&#8208;C single bond cleavage through &#946;&#8208;scission of alkoxyl radical intermediates, and twice C(sp3)&#8208;H bond transformation via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) procedures, resulting in two carbon radical species that realize a radical cross&#8208;coupling process to form a new C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) bond selectively. &#945;&#8208;arylketo and &#945;&#8208;aryl substituted tertiary alcohols can also be applied as substrates, leading to terminal cyano&#8208;functionalized linear products, with ketone as the leaving fragment. Mechanistically, a new procedure to generate alkoxyl radical with chlorine radical through the in&#8208;situ formed intermediate cycloalkyl hypochlorite was suggested.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Synthesis of 3&#8208;(Arylsulfonyl)benzothiophenes Using Acetic Acid as a Quencher for Methyl Radical&#8208;Mediated Side Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of 3&#8208;(arylsulfonyl)benzothiophenes has drawn a great deal of attention from the synthetic community because they displayed promising biological features as drug candidates. However, the multi&#8208;component synthesis of 3&#8208;(arylsulfonyl)benzothiophenes was not successful because of the formation of byproducts involving methyl radicals generated during the reaction. In this study, acetic acid was employed as a solvent and was found to be beneficial in suppressing the formation of the methyl radical&#8208;mediated byproducts. Moreover, this transformation features a green activation mode of radical&#8208;mediated processes; the reactions proceed under mild conditions, and the desired products are obtained at room temperature without the need for catalysts or additives. This one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component process eliminates the need for harsh or sensitive reaction conditions and multi&#8208;step procedures. This process provides more opportunities for synthesizing benzothiophene derivatives, which are found in many bioactive compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>COAP&#8208;Palladium&#8208;catalyzed Asymmetric Linear Allylic Alkylation of Vinyl Benzoxazinanones for Multifunctional 3,3&#8242;&#8208;Disubstituted Oxindole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective linear&#8208;allylic alkylation of vinyl benzoxazinanones with a series of 3&#8208;substituted oxindoles was reported in the presence of a chiral oxamide&#8211;phosphine ligand (COAP&#8208;Bn) under mild reaction conditions. A series of optically active multifunctional 3,3&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted oxindole derivatives bearing a quaternary stereogenic center and a linear aryl amino side chain were respectively obtained in 55&#8722;98% yields with &gt;96&#8722;99% ee for most cases. The developed protocol demonstrates that the COAP ligands could serve as a privileged chiral ligand to construct diverse chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindole compounds with various quaternary stereogenic centers, such as aza&#8208;, thio&#8208; or all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic centers. The salient features of the method include broad substrate scope, N&#8208;protecting group free, base&#8208;free, and high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Short and Scalable Synthesis of Plant&#8208;Based Cholesterol in GMP Grade</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A plant&#8208;based straightforward and short four&#8208;step synthesis of cholesterol starting from commercially available diosgenin is reported. This offers a large&#8208;scale production of highly needed GMP&#8208;grade cholesterol, which is part of the lipid cocktail for the assembly of effective mRNA&#8208;based vaccines against the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. These lipids are formulated into the delivery system of the mRNA fragments by forming Lipid Nano Particles (LNP) that introduce the mRNA into the cells. Cholesterol plays a crucial role because it stabilizes LNP and facilitates endosome escape of the mRNA into the cytosol.

         <title>Advancements in the Preparation of 4H&#8208;Chromenes: An Overview</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Functionalized 4H&#8208;chromenes represent one class of the most important structural scaffolds in both synthetic and medicinal chemistry. They often appear in an arrange of biological natural products, pharmaceutical agents and drug candidates. The significance has stimulated the development of efficient methodologies for the synthesis of such compounds. In this review, a comprehensive discussion on different synthetic approaches to 4H&#8208;chromenes has been presented with an emphasis on reaction features and mechanisms. Three main categories are outlined: 1) nucleophilic addition to 2H&#8208;chromene derivatives, 2) 4H&#8208;chromene ring formation involved cycloaddition or cyclization reactions, and 3) miscellaneous reactions.

         <title>Cyclic Diaryliodonium Salts: Eco&#8208;Friendly and Versatile Building Blocks for Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Cyclic diaryliodoniums are an important class of high&#8208;valent aromatic iodine reagents for the synthesis of various axially chiral biaryls and biaryl compounds. Moreover, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed annulation has been established for the construction of various heterocyclic rings and ladder&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with readily available cyclic diaryliodoniums as the starting materials. As halogen&#8208;bonding donors, cyclic aryliodoniums have been explored as organocatalysts in a variety of organic reactions. In this review, the application progress of cyclic diaryliodoniums has been systematically outlined, which highlights recent developments in the application reactions of cyclic diaryliodoniums, including synthetic application, limitations and reaction mechanisms in representative cascade reactions to provide insights for the development prospects of cyclic diaryliodoniums.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Cyclization of Spirocyclopropanes with Stabilized Phosphorus Ylides: Access to Indane and Azulene Skeletons</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
In this study, regio&#8208; and diastereoselective ring&#8208;opening cyclization of spirocyclopropanes with phosphorus ylides stabilized by electron&#8208;withdrawing groups were developed. The reaction of various cyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione&#8208;2&#8208;spirocyclopropanes with phosphorus ylides bearing alkoxycarbonyl groups proceeded smoothly without any additives to provide the corresponding 6,7&#8208;dihydroindan&#8208;4&#8208;ones in 32&#8211;87% yields. Cycloheptane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione&#8208;2&#8208;spirocyclopropanes were also used in this reaction, producing the corresponding products 1,2,3,6,7,8&#8208;hexahydroazulen&#8208;4&#8208;ones in 52&#8211;67% yields. The resulting [5.6]&#8208; and [5.7]&#8208;fused carbocyclic products were readily converted into highly substituted indanes and azulenes, respectively, by oxidation.

The front cover picture is an artistic illustration of gold associated with HFIP, represented by a golden ball surrounded with a banner. This Au/HFIP duo efficiently transformed alkynylnaphthaldehydes to major trans tricyclic derivatives, according to a 6&#8208;enolendo&#8208;exo&#8208;trig pathway. Scope and limitations as well as mechanistic studies for this rearrangement process were described leading to tricyclic functionalized ketones. Details can be found in the Communication by V&#233;ronique Michelet and co&#8208;workers (A. Truchon, A. Dupeux, S. Olivero, V. Michelet, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2023, 365, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202201387)

&lt;p&gt;The front cover picture is an artistic illustration of gold associated with HFIP, represented by a golden ball surrounded with a banner. This Au/HFIP duo efficiently transformed alkynylnaphthaldehydes to major &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; tricyclic derivatives, according to a 6-enolendo-exo-trig pathway. Scope and limitations as well as mechanistic studies for this rearrangement process were described leading to tricyclic functionalized ketones.

         <title>Recent Advances in Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor (EDA)&#8208;Complex Reactions involving Quaternary Pyridinium Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quaternary pyridinium compounds are valuable intermediates in organic synthesis, which have gained immense popularity in the synthetic community. The application of transition metal or photoredox catalysis in transforming quaternary pyridinium compounds into various C&#8208;C and C&#8208;X bonds is well established. A majority of these methods require high temperatures, expansive catalysts, and delicate conditions for successful execution. On the other hand, the use of transition metal&#8208;free and photocatalysis&#8208;free strategies in constructing C&#8208;C and C&#8208;X bonds using quaternary pyridinium derivatives has been sought&#8208;after. In this context, the electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA)&#8208;complex reactions have emerged as a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic synthetic methodology, which does not require any catalysts for its successful execution. EDA&#8208;complex photochemistry takes advantage of the electron&#8208;acceptor ability of quaternary pyridinium derivatives, which can quickly generate a radical precursor via the deaminative process. These newly generated radical intermediates are useful in several valuable transformations. We hereby, in this review, discuss an area of major progress in EDA&#8208;complex mediated reactions involving quaternary pyridinium compounds with mechanism, substrate scope, and limitations.

         <title>Recent Developments in Manganese, Iron and Cobalt Homogeneous Catalyzed Synthesis of Primary Amines via Reduction of Nitroarenes, Nitriles and Carboxamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The preparation of primary amines attracts huge attention in the molecular synthetic community. Indeed, amines play a crucial role in chemistry as they are important substructures in a huge amount of drug molecules, agrochemicals, dyes and molecular materials. Compared to stoichiometric reductions using metal hydride based reagents, the catalyzed reduction of nitroarenes, nitriles and carboxamides appears to be an attractive option, mainly when associated to first row transition metals such as manganese, iron, or cobalt. In this short review, we illustrate the progress achieved in homogeneous hydrogenation, hydrogen transfer, hydrogen borrowing and hydrosilylation of nitroarenes, nitriles and carboxamides.

         <title>Reactions Involving Multiple Isocyanide Insertions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Isocyanides (isonitriles or carbylamine) have been intensively used in organic synthesis to prepare a diverse variety of N&#8208;heterocycles on the basis of the carbene&#8208;like reactivity of their divalent carbon atom. Isocyanides participate in a variety of reactions involving one, two, or more isocyanides. Compared to the popularity of single isocyanide reactions, few examples of reactions involving two or more isocyanides have been reported. In this review, we categorized and classified the literatures of reactions involving two or more isocyanides especially double isocyanide insertions under metal&#8208;catalyzed or metal&#8208;free conditions from 2014 to 2022.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
This review outlines the most noteworthy achievements of the last few years in the renascent field of positional and geometrical isomerization of alkenes using iron catalysis, from a mechanistic perspective. Particular attention will be placed on the developments beyond the seminal contributions of iron carbonyl complexes and on their mechanistic aspects underlying the nature of the active iron species. The relevant literature has been covered until late 2022.

         <title>Enantioselective Organocatalytic Addition of Nitromethane to Trifluoromethyl Aryl Ketimines Promoted by Electron&#8208;Rich Bifunctional Iminophosphoranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiourea&#8208;based iminophosphorane (BIMP) organocatalysts featuring SPhos&#8208; or BIDIME phosphine units have been developed and successfully applied in the asymmetric addition of nitromethane to N&#8208;Boc&#8208;protected trifluoromethyl aryl ketimines. Alfa&#8208;Trifluoromethyl  beta&#8208;nitroamines were obtained in 40&#8208;82% isolated yields and 80&#8208;95% enantioselectivities. A careful evaluation of the catalytic activity of BIMPs indicates that the catalysts derived from the combination via Staudinger reaction of a chiral 1,2&#8208;amino alcohol&#8208;derived thiourea&#8208;organoazide with electron&#8208;rich phosphines, promote the aza&#8208;Henry reaction on fluorinated ketimines with the highest enantioselectivity, leading to the amine featuring a tetrasubstituted stereocenter in up to 95% ee. The reaction was performed also on gram scale, without loss of enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold and Biocatalysis for the Stereodivergent Synthesis of Nor(pseudo)ephedrine Derivatives: Cascade Design Toward Amino Alcohols, Diols, and Diamines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of gold(I) and enzyme catalysis has provided access to a series of nor(pseudo)ephedrine derivatives in a regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner. The approach involves developing IPrAuNTf2&#8208;catalyzed hydration of 1&#8208;phenylprop&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;yl acetate or N&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylprop&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;yl)acetamide, followed by (dynamic) asymmetric biotransamination or bioreduction of the corresponding keto ester or keto amide intermediates. Enzyme actions were completely selective towards the modification of the methyl ketones in a highly stereoselective manner, allowing the synthesis of enantio&#8208; and diastereomerically enriched products using either racemic or optically active starting materials. Thus, a series of amino alcohol, diol, and diamine derivatives were produced from propargyl esters or amides (57 to 86% isolated yield), the biocatalyst of choice determining the (stereo)selectivity of the overall cascade process (70&#8208;99% diastereomeric excess and &gt;98% enantiomeric excess), and providing access to nor(pseudo)ephedrine compounds in a straightforward manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed One&#8208;Pot Cycloisomerization/Nucleophilic Addition/Rearrangement of Acenaphthylene Carbaldehyde Derivatives</title>

Abstract
Merging the latest advances in the field of gold catalysis and the efficiency of hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP), a gold&#8208;catalyzed orthogonal tandem reaction has been developed to access carbocyclic ketone on naphthalene substrates. The methodology involved a cycloisomerization/nucleophilic addition and a C&#8594;O rearrangement. The HFIP solvent most probably acted as a Lewis&#8208;acid on isochromene derivatives, through hydrogen donor bond activity. A large range of acenaphthylene carbaldehyde has been engaged in this process coupling gold catalysis and Lewis&#8208;acid behavior of HFIP leading to cyclic ketones with a yield ranging from 15 to 91% (27 compounds). The mechanism was investigated, and the reaction most presumably occurred via a classical cyclization process followed by a [Au]&#8208;HFIP interaction for the final rearrangement. The interest of such transformation was demonstrated by performing it on a gram&#8208;scale. Moreover, a post&#8208;functionalization bromination was performed, as well as the isomerization of some functionalized ketones leading to full trans derivatives with a yield ranging from 78 to 90% yields.

Abstract
We described an Rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed divergent C&#8722;H bond functionalization of N&#8208;aryl amidines with iodonium ylides. Carbazolones and zwitterionic salts were diversely constructed through intermolecular annulation and intramolecular proton transfer under the different reaction conditions. This protocol is operationally simple and tolerates a variety of functional groups. The efficient post&#8208;modification of pharmaceutical molecules demonstrates its practicability.

The cover design shows a Chinese fairy tale &#8220;Carp jump over the dragon gate&#8221;. There was a Dragon Gate on the Yellow River. Carps could jump over it and turn into dragons, which means that everyone should conquer some difficulty before success. Herein, this design illustrates the Rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond intramolecular annulations and proton transfer strategy. The &#8220;dragon gate&#8221; represents the energy to be overcome in the catalytic cycle. The &#8220;leaping carp&#8221; represents the intramolecular annulation and proton transfer progress, indicating that the carp would become a dragon (products) after it crosses the dragon gate (energy).

         <title>Switchable Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Ring Contraction of Cyclooctatetraene Oxide towards the Enantioselective Synthesis of Cycloheptatrienyl&#8208;Substituted Homoallylic Alcohols and Oxaborinanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability of cyclooctatetraene oxide to undergo two sequential ring contraction events under mild conditions, using Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis, has been studied in detail. We have found that the selectivity can be controlled by the acidity of the catalyst and by the temperature, being able to obtain selectively either the cycloheptatriene carbaldehyde product, arising from a single ring&#8208;contraction event, or phenylacetaldehyde that is formed after a second ring contraction process. A complete mechanistic picture of the reaction and a rationale behind the influence of the catalyst is provided based on both experimental and computational 	data. Finally, this acid&#8208;catalyzed ring contraction has been coupled with an in situ enantioselective allylation reaction, delivering enantioenriched cycloheptatrienyl&#8208;substituted homoallylic alcohols when it is carried out in the presence of a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst. These homoallylic alcohols have also been converted into enantioenriched oxaborinanes through copper&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic borylation/cyclization protocol.

         <dc:description>L&#8208;Methionine is the unique sulfur&#8208;containing amino acid essential for humans and animals, which is widely used in pharmaceutical, food and feed industries. Its green and efficient production has attracted a great deal of attention. Fermentation&#8208;enzymatic coupling route is regarded to be promising for L&#8208;methionine biosynthesis, while &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;succinyl&#8208;L&#8208;homoserine mercaptotransferase (MetZ) is the key biocatalyst. Exploring and engineering of MetZ with ideal catalytic properties is highly desired. Herein, the MetZ from &lt;i&gt;Chromobacterium violaceum&lt;/i&gt; (CvMetZ) was screened and through in silico analyses, potential beneficial amino acid residues both at the access channel and around the oxygen anion holes were anchored for site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis. The positive mutants were obtained with improved activity for L&#8208;methionine production using &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;succinyl&#8208;L&#8208;homoserine (OSH) and methyl mercaptan as substrate. The best mutant was further applied for L&#8208;methionine biosynthesis and supply of methyl mercaptan was optimized in a fed&#8208;batch approach. The conversion of 100 g/L OSH reached 92% with L&#8208;methionine yield of 62.6 g/L, which was well coupled with the OSH fermentation level.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Trisubstituted Piperidines via Biocatalytic Transamination and Diastereoselective Enamine or Imine Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Substituted piperidine rings are a common motif in natural products and pharmaceutical drugs. The asymmetric synthesis of piperidines bearing multiple stereocentres remains a challenge, and current approaches often rely on lengthy reaction sequences and &#8216;chiral pool&#8217; strategies. Herein, we report multi&#8208;enzymatic and chemo&#8208;enzymatic methods that allow the preparation of piperidines with three chirality centres in only two steps from achiral diketoester precursors. Stereocontrol is achieved by a highly enantioselective transamination leading to optically pure (ee &gt;99%) enamine or imine intermediates, followed by diastereoselective reduction of these unsaturated N&#8208;heterocycles using either platinum(0)&#8208;catalysed flow hydrogenation or enzymatic imine reduction. In the latter case, coupling of the two biocatalytic reactions in a concurrent one&#8208;pot process is possible, thus reducing the synthetic sequence to a single biotransformation. In total, nine trisubstituted piperidines were prepared in high stereoisomeric purities (dr &#8805;98:2) and isolated yields of up to 73%. Lead&#8208;likeness analysis of five representative products using an open&#8208;source webtool suggests that these compounds possess considerable application potential as building blocks in drug discovery.

The front cover picture illustrates that intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition of a simply attained chiral allenecarboxanilide affords the pseudoenantiomeric alkenyl bromides shown, which can be readily functionalized to give diverse chiral &#8220;Himbert diene&#8221; ligands. The synthesis can be readily scaled to produce decagram quantities of ligands. These ligands match, or exceed, the performance of existing &#8220;best&#8208;in&#8208;class&#8221; chiral dienes over nine types of enantioselective Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;addition or 1,2&#8208;addition reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of o&#8208;Bis(3&#8208;indolyl)arenes under Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalysis: Carbonyl Compounds as Sources of Aryl Groups</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A method of synthesizing o&#8208;bis(3&#8208;indolyl)arenes was developed by reacting indoles with 7&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept&#8208;5&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;one and derivatives thereof having no aromatic ring. All 23 unknown o&#8208;bis(3&#8208;indolyl)arenes could be obtained using this method. Palladium catalysis is useful for enlarging the &#960;&#8208;conjugated area of o&#8208;bis(3&#8208;indolyl)arenes, delivering aryl&#8208;, alkynyl&#8208;, and alkenyl&#8208;unit&#8208;installed o&#8208;bis(3&#8208;indolyl)arenes, and benzo[c]indolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazoles, the derivatization to which is effective for raising fluorescence quantum yield. A possible reaction mechanism is proposed based on several mechanistic studies.

Abstract
Chiral dienes are important ligands in asymmetric catalysis but they are less accessible than other commonly used ligands such as chiral bisphosphines. Here, we show that intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition of a simply attained chiral allenecarboxanilide readily affords pseudoenantiomeric bicyclo[2.2.2]octa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dienes containing an alkenyl bromide, which can be readily functionalized to give diverse chiral diene ligands. The synthesis is straightforward and easily conducted on multigram scales. These ligands exhibit high performance in nine types of enantioselective Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;addition or 1,2&#8208;addition reactions.

         <title>Oxidative Annulation of Aldehydes, 5&#8208;Aminopyrazoles, and Nitriles: Synthesis and Applications of Pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;d]Pyrimidines</title>

Abstract
The oxidative [3+2+1] annulation reaction of aldehydes, 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles, and nitriles is achieved under the oxidation of I2/O2, affording various valuable pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidines in 27%&#8211;91% yields. The salient feature of this reaction is transition&#8208;metal free, operationally simple, broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and gram&#8208;scalable. Remarkably, the corresponding products exhibited intriguing photophysical properties such as Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and showed good potential to specifically light up lipid droplets (LDs) in living cells with bright fluorescence, low cytotoxicity, and good photostability.

Abstract
A synthesis of 1,4&#8208;diborylated benzenes was achieved by the Ru&#8208;catalyzed regioselective co&#8208;cyclotrimerization of alkynes with a commercially available ethynyl boronate. The reaction is applicable to a wide array of alkynes with metal&#8208;coordinating groups, providing synthetically useful diborylated benzenes in 23&#8211;68% isolated yields. DFT calculations shed light on the reaction course and the origin of its remarkable regioselectivity. Selected diborylated benzenes were converted into various products, such as quinones and hydroquinones, including three natural bioactive small molecules.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Construction of Fluorinated Chiral Alcohols via Sequential Substitution/Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Bromoarylketones and Fluoroalcohols</title>

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot synthesis of fluorinated chiral alcohols from &#945;&#8208;bromoarylketones and fluoroalcohols is described. The fluorinated ketone intermediates were formed from &#945;&#8208;bromoarylketones with fluoroalcohols as nucleophiles and solvents, which were reduced subsequentially by adding a chiral Ru catalyst and a mixture of formic acid and triethyl amines (FA: TEA=1.1:1) as hydrogen donor to give 27 examples of fluorinated chiral alcohols in 60&#8211;93% yields and 85&#8211;98% ee values. Notably, K3PO4 acts as a base in nucleophilic substitution and an additive in reductive step to enhance the reactivity and enantioselectivity, which is crucial for constructing compatible conditions for one&#8208;pot process. This one&#8208;pot process is also applicable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

         <title>Unexpected Stereoselective Access to 2&#8208;Aminooxazolines from Propargyl Ureas by Silver Salts under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Propargyl ureas can lead to a range of possible heterocyclic compounds, mainly depending on the employed catalyst. Silver salts are known to promote the N&#8208;5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization mode to imidazolidinone derivatives. Conversely, a versatile and stereoselective O&#8208;5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization of propargyl ureas to 2&#8208;aminooxazolines by Ag(I) catalysis is here disclosed. Good to excellent yields and complete stereoselectivity of the external double bond have been achieved under milder reaction conditions (50&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C). A one&#8208;pot protocol starting from the corresponding propargylic amines and isocyanates has been developed as well. N,N&#8217;&#8208;Dipropargyl ureas underwent a uncommon O&#8208;5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig/N&#8208;5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig double cyclization sequence. Finally, insights into the tautomeric equilibrium of 2&#8208;aminooxazoles and on their relative reactivity are provided.
