         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective olefinic C&#8211;H alkynylation of gem&#8208;diarylsubstituted ethylenes with propargylic alcohols was achieved to access diverse unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;enynes. The regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities were established through a 1,4&#8208;palladium migration from aryl to vinyl in the presence of 2&#8208;FC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OH additive. Mechanistic investigations have suggested that cleavage of the olefinic C&#8211;H bond might not be involved in the rate&#8208;determining step throughout the catalytic process.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to &#946;&#8208;Lactam Sulfonamides from Sulfamoyl Chlorides via Photoredox Catalyzed C&#8722;S Bond Formation</title>

Abstract
Sulfonyl chlorides are a synthetically attractive source of sulfonyl radicals in photoredox catalysis and are useful precursors in the synthesis of sulfones. Sulfamoyl chlorides, on the other hand, remain poorly represented despite their similar potential. In this study, N&#8208;chlorosulfonylated &#946;&#8208;lactams were prepared from readily available precursors and utilized in an atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction with a variety of olefins, producing &#946;&#8208;lactam sulfonamides in 49&#8211;95% yields. &#946;&#8208;Lactams fused to a dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;thiazine ring which closely resemble carbacephems, a widely used class of antibiotics, were also synthesized by an intra&#8208;molecular ATRA reaction. This methodology enables the preparation of &#946;&#8208;lactam sulfonamides, a class of compounds that are of great interest in pharmacology.

         <title>4&#8208;Aminobenzotriazole (ABTA) Directed Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Reaction for Synthesis of Benzofulvenes through C&#8208;H Bond Activation Involving Inner Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A route for the construction of benzofulvenes derivatives through 4&#8208;Aminobenzotriazole (ABTA) directed Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions of amides with inner alkynes was developed. This method afforded a diverse array of benzofulvene derivatives in yields ranging from 34% to 91%. The control experiments indicated that the substrate reacts with alkynes in tandem to synthesize 1,3&#8208;diene intermediates, and ultimately 1,3&#8208;diene underwent intramolecular cyclization to produce benzofulvene derivatives. Furthermore, the directing group can be removed.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric [3+3] Cycloaddition of N&#8208;Vinyl Oxindole Nitrones with 2&#8208;Indolylmethanols to Prepare Spirooxindole[1,2]oxazines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed asymmetric [3+3] cycloaddition of N&#8208;viny oxindole nitrones with 2&#8208;indolylmethanols to prepare various spirooxindole[1,2]oxazines in 43&#8208;93% yields and 88:12&#8208;97:3 enantiomeric ratios. Experimental results revealed that the addition of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) played important roles to help CPA control the reaction reactivity and enantioselectivity. The present method features the construction of tetrasubstituted chiral carbon stereocenter and the example of N&#8208;vinyl nitrones in asymmetric [3+3] cycloaddition.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic electrosynthesis has become a green, efficient and sustainable alternative to traditional organic transformation for the redox reactions. In this connection, indirect electrolysis employing redox mediators is attaining increasing significance as it offers a chance to improve reaction selectivity and avoids the over&#8208;oxidation/reduction issues encountered in direct electrolysis. Triarylamines and triarylimidazoles, as representative organic molecular mediators, have attracted widespread attention in recent years due to the advantages of well&#8208;defined easy structural modification and tunable redox ability. Hence, in this minireview, the recent growth of triarylamine and triarylimidazole derivatives mediated electrochemical oxidation reactions were presented, highlighting the structural optimization, electrochemical performance and reaction mechanism of these organic mediators. Moreover, the photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic cases with these molecular mediators were also highlighted. To conclude, the current challenges and future prospects of this field are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper and Photocatalytic Synergistic Strategies for Radical Cyclization Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid development of photo&#8208;synergistic transition metal catalytic systems has provided a green paradigm to complement thermal transition metal catalytic methods. However, the most commonly used iridium or ruthenium complexes involve expensive in nature, in contrast to the abundant copper elements in the earth's crust, which are highly valued for their unique electronic structure and light&#8208;absorbing properties. Recently, the application of copper and photocatalytic synergistic strategies in radical cyclization reactions has progressed considerably, leading to a renaissance in the synthesis of functional natural products, drugs and their analogues, but summary work addressing this aspect has not been reported. In this review, we briefly analyze the effect of ligand choice on copper complexes and some inorganic copper salts and even on light sources. We then summarize the copper and photocatalytic synergistic strategies in radical cyclization reactions and classify them into three categories, C, N and O radicals, according to the class of the central atom of the radical in each work, and in each category will be elaborated in turn from coordination cyclization via Cu catalysts, direct radical cyclization and other cyclization mode. For individual more complex reactions, the mechanisms are explored and briefly discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Emerging Advances of the Radical Pathway Glycosylation Enabled by Bench&#8208;Stable Glycosyl Donors: Glycosyl Sulfoxides, Glycosyl Sulfones, and Glycosyl Sulfinates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. In synthetic carbohydrate chemistry, the modification of glycosyl radicals pathway stands as a central area of focus. The radical&#8208;based reactions often demonstrate remarkable compatibility with various functional groups owing to the mild initiation conditions. In particular, the identification of novel glycosyl radical precursors, combined with advanced reaction techniques, has substantially broadened the scope of glycosyl compound synthesis. Despite the presence of versatile donors, the synthesis of noble donors is still addressed as a synthetic need and challenges associated with sugar chemistry. Currently, a new class of glycosyl radical precursors has been developed which enables the production of C&#8208;, S&#8208;, O&#8208;, and N&#8208;glycosides efficiently. In this light, we highlight strategies towards bench&#8208;stable glycosyl sulfoxides, sulphone, and sulfite donors that can enable the site&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective transformation of protected or naked sugar synthons in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry. Here, this review article covers the recent developments in the selective glycosyl radical diversification such as glycosyl alkylation, arylation, alkenylation, sulfuration, C&#8208;H activation, and DNA conjugation via the bench&#8208;stable donors along with mechanistic aspects, challenges, and future directions.		1.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Diastereoselective Cascade Cyclization to Construct Polycyclic Spiroindolines</title>

Abstract
We herein reported, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced K2S2O8 mediated cascade reaction of 3&#8208;(2&#8208;isocyanoethyl)indoles with &#945;&#8208;oxocarboxylic acids leading to diastereoselective synthesis of polycyclic spiroindolines bearing an N&#8208;formyl unit derivative utilising the alkali metal salt K2S2O8 as a mediator under mild reaction conditions. This study offers an illustration of &#945;&#8208;oxocarboxylic acids and 3&#8208;(2&#8208;isocyanoethyl)indoles&#8208;based reactions as it shows the involvement of glyoxolate ions without decarboxylation to access polycyclic spiroindolines bearing an N&#8208;formyl unit analogue. The batch process can be extended to a continuous flow system using a glass tube loaded with K2S2O8 placed between the PFA capillary reactor, which can greatly advance the reaction efficiency and can even be promoted to gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylative Transformation for the Synthesis of Tetracyclic Indoline Thioesters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed thioesterification of (aza)indole&#8208;tethered aryl iodides, Mo(CO)6, and sulfonyl chlorides is reported. A series of C2 thioester&#8208;group substituted indoline&#8208;fused ring compounds are constructed by an intramolecular Heck cyclization and carbonylation chemistry involving N&#8208;(2&#8208;iodobenzoyl)indole. The salient features of this three&#8208;component cascade sequence include the use of solid Mo(CO)6 as the carbon monoxide source and good functional group tolerance.

         <title>Electroreductive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling of Aromatic Carbonyl Compounds and Alkyl Bromides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Classical methods for the synthesis of tertiary alcohols mainly rely on the nucleophilic addition of organometallic reagents to carbonyl compounds. Here, we disclose a strategy for synthesizing tertiary alcohols via electroreductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of aromatic carbonyl compounds and alkyl bromides (allyl, propargyl, benzyl and cyclohexyl bromides). This procedure features good substrate tolerance and friendly conditions (undivided cell, cheap and reusable carbon electrodes, reaction in open air, room temperature, without any external transition metal/activating reagent). Using this method, 32 desired products can be obtained with moderate to good yields, and gram&#8208;scale synthesis is feasible, demonstrating the practicality of this approach.

Using this method, 32 desired products can be obtained with moderate to good yields, and gram-scale synthesis is feasible, demonstrating the practicality of this approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Developments in Selenylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkynes are simple yet important organic feedstocks. The selenylation of alkynes is able to produce complex selenium&#8208;containing compounds in a facile way. Although there are some reviews about the selenylation of alkynes, most of them focus on one specific reaction or what types of products that can be obtained. There is a lack of attention given to the various uses of different selenium reagents and their mechanisms. This review mainly focuses on recent advances (2013&#8208;2023) based on diverse selenium reagents. Mechanisms and how the added reagents work will be discussed. Different reaction types, including difunctionalization, Se&#8208;annulation, spiro&#8208;cyclization, C&#8208;Se coupling, click reaction will be recorded in this review. The regioselectivity can be achieved through various mechanisms, including radicals, seleniraniums or electrophilic cyclization. We hope it will do help for future research in this area.</dc:description>

         <title>A High&#8208;Throughput in vitro Assay System for the Detection of the Enzymatic Dihydroxylation of Aliphatic Olefins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rieske dioxygenase enzymes can perform the cis&#8208;dihydroxylation of aliphatic olefins, representing a potential green alternative to established methods of performing this important transformation. However, the activity of the natural enzymes in this context is low relative to their more well&#8208;known activity in the cis&#8208;dihydroxylation of aromatics. To enable the engineering of dioxygenase enzymes for improved activity in the dihydroxylation of aliphatic olefins, we have developed an assay system to detect the relevant diol metabolites produced from whole&#8208;cell fermentation cultures. Optimization studies were carried out to maximize the sensitivity of the assay system, and its utility in the in vitro screening of enzyme variant libraries was demonstrated. The assay system was utilized in screening studies that identified Rieske dioxygenase variants with significantly improved activity in the dihydroxylation of aliphatic olefins relative to the wild&#8208;type enzyme.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The aerobic ring&#8208;opening oxidation of cyclopropanols catalyzed by copper complexes was systematically investigated, with a focus on the effect of nitrogen ligands on the distribution of oxidation products. This study led to the development of a new synthesis of &#946;&#8208;aminoketones and &#946;&#8208;enaminones from cyclopropanols, where product specificity is tuned through ligand and solvent selection. &#946;&#8208;Aminoketones were prepared in 34&#8211;99% yields by copper(II) acetate&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation of cyclopropanols in the presence of nucleophilic secondary aliphatic amines. In contrast, bipyridine&#8208;ligated copper catalysts resulted in the generation of &#946;&#8208;enaminones in 36&#8211;86% yields, presumably via the Kornblum&#8208;DeLaMare rearrangement of intermediate 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes</dc:description>

Abstract
Pulsed ultrasonic irradiation with on&#8208;off modulation remarkably enhances asymmetric noncovalent organocatalysis &#8220;on water&#8221;, specifically for Michael addition and Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. This approach effectively addresses challenges associated with solid reactant dispersion encountered in &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221; reactions and mitigates overheating issues caused by continuous ultrasound exposure, thereby significantly augmenting reaction rates and stereoselectivities.

Abstract
An electrochemical method with high faradaic efficiency was developed for the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;regioselective aroylation of quinoline N&#8208;oxides under oxidant&#8208;free conditions by using aryl &#945;&#8208;ketoacids as the aroylation reagent. A series of 8&#8208;aroylquinoline N&#8208;oxides were effectively synthesized in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. Furthermore, the proposed method was successfully applied to the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a tubulin polymerization inhibitor. Additionally, a plausible reaction mechanism for the decarboxylation radical acylation was proposed on the basis of the results of cyclic voltammetry and control experiments. Overall, this method provides a novel solution for the C8&#8208;regioselective aroylation of quinoline N&#8208;oxides.

Abstract
Achieving &#945;&#8208;methylation of BODIPYs remains challenging due to the electron&#8208;deficient property of &#945;&#8208;position of BODIPYs. Herein, a H2O2/DMSO&#8208;promoted radical process was employed, providing an approach for the construction of a series of &#945;&#8208;methyl and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dimethyl BODIPYs in 57&#8211;68% yields. In addition, representative transformations and half&#8208;gram experiments as well as their photophysical properties were studied to examine the potential applications.

Abstract
Complexes [(bpy)2Ru(BL)](PF6)2 (Ru(BL), BL=N,N&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthrolinamine) have been investigated in the coupling reaction of aryl halides and sodium arylsulfinates under visible light irradiation. The position (3, 4 or 5) of the nickel&#8208;coordinating di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amine fragment in the 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline core has a strong influence on the activity of the catalytic system. The advantage of binding fragments of photocatalyst and metal complex into one molecule in the systems with bridging ligands N,N&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthrolin&#8208;3&#8208;amine (BL1) and N,N&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthrolin&#8208;4&#8208;amine (BL2), in comparison with mixed catalytic systems, is shown. With Ru(BL2) photocatalysts it is possible to reduce the loading to 0.1&#8197;mol%, instead of the commonly used 1&#8211;2&#8197;mol%, and to eliminate the use of the additional ligand for nickel. Under these conditions, more than 20 diarylsulfones of different structures were synthesized in 25&#8211;95% yields.

         <title>Imidazolidine&#8208;Pyrroloimidazolone Pyridine&#8208;Ni(acac)2 Complex Catalyzed Asymmetric Darzens Reaction of Isatins with Phenacyl Chlorides: A Chiral Amplification Effect</title>

Abstract
With phenacyl chlorides as simple nucleophilic species, the asymmetric Darzens reaction of isatins using Ni(acac)2 as the Lewis acid and imidazolidine&#8208;pyrroloimidazolone pyridine as the ligand is reported. In the presence of 1&#8197;mol% of the catalyst, diverse spiro&#8208;epoxyoxindoles with two new contiguous stereocenters were afforded in 82&#8211;99% yields, &gt;20:1 dr, with 91&#8211;99% ee. Chiral spiro&#8208;epoxyoxindoles could undergo ring&#8208;opening reactions in further transformations. The developed method was applied to the derivatization of complex molecules including indomethacin, gemfibrozil, and febuxostat&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;chloroketones. A strong positive nonlinear effect was observed, which was caused by the precipitation of a less&#8208;soluble racemic catalyst complex.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced method was developed to synthesize selenylated cyclic boronic esters through intermolecular oxyselenenylation. This method can be performed under additive&#8208;free and photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions and generates potentially pharmaceutically useful heterocycles. A plausible reaction mechanism was proposed based on several control experiments and previous reports.

Abstract
The combination of RLi&#8208;mediated organic transformations (under air and at room temperature) with a subsequent stereoselective biocatalytic reaction is for the first time presented. Most of the previous asymmetric chemoenzymatic routes have been limited to the concomitant or sequential combination of transition metals/organocatalysts with enzymes. However, the use of polar organometallic reagents (RLi) in the design of these stereoselective hybrid protocols has been totally neglected, as far as we are concerned. Thus, in this work, the combination of organolithium chemistry and asymmetric biocatalysis is described for the first time in a one&#8208;pot fashion. The chemoenzymatic approach converts a series of nitriles into chiral alcohols consisting of two steps, where the key item was the finding of suitable conditions to adapt the reactivities of organolithiums and alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) in the same recipient. The organolithium addition occurred with total chemoselectivity (no side reactions were observed) under neat conditions and room temperature leading to the corresponding imines, which were hydrolyzed using a buffer, and adjusting the pH for the subsequent ADH action. Commercial and made in house overexpressed ADHs allowed to produce chiral alcohols with excellent selectivities and good overall yields. The different behavior displayed for the reductive enzymes in the presence of diethyl ether clearly influenced in the decision to let the organolithium solvent evaporate under open&#8208;air conditions before developing the bioreduction step. Our results demonstrate the importance of the fine orchestration of the reaction conditions for the development of efficient hybrid chemoenzymatic cascades without the need of intermediate isolation/purification steps or compartmentalization of the different synthetic systems.

Abstract
Copper&#8208;catalyzed and visible&#8208;light catalytic difluoroalkylation reactions of N&#8208;cyanamide alkenes have been developed. Various &#945;&#8208;bromodifluoromethyl substituted esters, amides and heterocycles were employed as the CF2 source. Both protocols are characterized by medium to high yields, good functional group compatibility, and applicable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Comparable studies of copper catalysis and photoredox catalysis demonstrate minimal differences between the two protocols. Preliminary mechanism suggest that both transformations involve tandem radical cyclization process.

Trans&#8208;(8b,15a)&#8208;9a&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;11H,15H&#8208;dibenzo[f,h][1,3]oxazino[3,2&#8208;b]isoquinolin&#8208;15&#8208;ones and trans&#8208;(8b,15a)&#8208;9a&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;11H,15H&#8208;dibenzo[f,h][1,3] oxazino[3,2&#8208;b]isoquinolin&#8208;15&#8208;ones were obtained in 76&#8211;92% yields via a one&#8208;pot reaction. Alternatively, irradiation of 3&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;hydroxypropyl&#8208;pyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones in the presence of HCl aqueous solution (1&#8197;M) led to the formation of cis&#8208;(8b,15a)&#8208;9a&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;11H,15H&#8208;dibenzo[f,h][1,3]oxazino[3,2&#8208;b]isoquinolin&#8208;15&#8208;ones and cis&#8208;(8b,15a)&#8208;9a&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;11H,15H&#8208;dibenzo[f,h][1,3]oxazino[3,2&#8208;b]isoquinolin&#8208;15&#8208;ones by a one&#8208;pot reaction of photo 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization and addition cyclization. The construction of a partially dearomatized phenanthrene ring and quinolizidinone ring was achieved by a one&#8208;pot reaction, with controlled cis/trans stereochemistry.

Abstract
Indoline&#8208;fused polycycles are commonly found as a key structural component in numerous natural products and biologically active compounds. In recent times, the incorporation of sulfonyl fluoride groups has drawn significant attention in research due to their potential to enhance or confer new biological activities to molecules. In this study, we report the development of a modular approach for synthesizing FSO2&#8208;functionalized cyclobutane&#8208;fused indolines by employing an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between indoles and SuFExable ethenesulfonyl fluoride under triplet energy&#8208;transfer catalysis. This method features mild reaction conditions, metal&#8208;free photocatalysts, and excellent tolerance to various functional groups. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of further modifying the FSO2&#8208;functionalized indoline products via SuFEx click reactions, enabling their conjugation with other molecules.

Abstract
A photoinduced three&#8208;component reaction of thianthrenium salts, DABCO&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(SO2)2, and benzyl ether substituted alkenes is developed, affording &#948;&#8208;hydroxylsulfones with good functional group tolerance. This transformation proceeds through an anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrosulfonylation of alkenes under a mild reaction condition. Mechanism studies indicates that this reaction undergoes a radical pathway involving sulfur dioxide insertion and 1,5&#8208;hydrogen transfer processes.

Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced difunctionalization of alkenes is a powerful strategy for constructing complex molecules. Herein, we disclose a three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;alkylpyridylation of alkenes under mild and photosensitizers&#8208;free conditions. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopy studies and NMR titration experiments indicate that the formation of an EDA complex between 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;DHPs and 4&#8208;cyanopyridines. Primary, secondary, and tertiary C(sp3)&#8208;centered radicals were formed by homolytic cleavage of 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;DHPs. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage functionalization of medicinally relevant molecules showed the synthetic potential of our methodology.

Abstract
An electrochemical protocol for synthesizing tetra&#8208;substituted sulfonated pyrazoles is developed. The notable feature of this method is the electrocatalytic generation of an active iodine species, which enables the direct use of 1,3 dicarbonyls as the reactant and also eliminates the necessity for external electrolytes. A wide range of functionalities are compatible under the electrocatalytic condition, resulting good to excellent production of the desired pyrazole derivatives. Detailed synthetic and electrochemical studies enlighten the electrocatalytic pathway.

Abstract
A class of novel chiral&#8208;bridged biphenyl monophosphine ligands with a benzofuran moiety (He&#8208;phos) has been successfully synthesized and reported. These ligands exhibited good performance in the gold&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cycloaddition reaction of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones with nitrones, resulting in the successful preparation of a series of polyaryl&#8208;substituted heterocyclic compounds with high enantioselectivities (up to 99% yield, 98% ee).

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A class of novel chiral-bridged biphenyl monophosphine ligands with a benzofuran moiety (&lt;b&gt;He-phos&lt;/b&gt;) has been successfully synthesized and reported. These ligands exhibited good performance in the gold-catalyzed enantioselective cycloaddition reaction of 2-(1-alkynyl)-2-en-1-ones with nitrones, resulting in the successful preparation of a series of polyaryl-substituted heterocyclic compounds with high enantioselectivities (up to 99% yield, 98% ee). The wide substrate adaptability (53 examples) and mild reaction conditions demonstrate the practicability of &lt;b&gt;He-phos&lt;/b&gt; in this reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aldehyde&#8208;Mediated Open&#8208;Air Stereoselective &#946;&#8208;Glycosylation of Glycals: An Expeditious Route towards Glycosyl&#8208;Ester Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study introduces a method for achieving a selective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;glycosyl esters through the reaction of glycals with carboxylic acids. This process is characterized by stereoselectivity, operating under mild reaction conditions and in an open&#8208;air environment mediated by an aldehyde. Detailed investigations and control experiments indicate the significance of benzaldehyde in conjunction with atmospheric air in facilitating this transformation. The method's versatility is evident in its broad substrate scope, accommodating various carboxylic acid derivatives with electron&#8208;releasing and electron&#8208;neutral functional groups. The practical applicability of the protocol is demonstrated by successfully esterifying different drugs, including indomethacin, tolmetin, and stearic acid, resulting in the production of novel compounds with excellent yields. Mechanistic studies, supported by controlled experiments, highlight the formation of glycal epoxide as an intermediate in the reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8208;C Bond Formation by Dual Pyrrolidine and Nickel Catalysis: Allylation of Ketones by Allylic Alcohols.
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whilst catalytic ketone allylation using palladium(0) is well&#8211;precedented, nickel(0)&#8208;catalysed equivalents of such reactions remain scarce. We report here the first nickel&#8208;catalysed allylation of ketones which uses an easily handled and inexpensive bench&#8208;stable Ni(II) pre&#8208;catalyst. This method avoids generation of stoichiometric by&#8208;products via the use of readily available allyl alcohols, rather than the esters or related derivatives which are often used in such transformations. Under the optimised conditions, 25 monoallylated ketones were obtained in 16% to 98% yield and with high selectivity for the linear (E)&#8211;isomers.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds are key structures in natural compounds and pharmaceuticals, and they serve as essential building blocks of functional materials. Catalytic asymmetric cycloaddition reactions represent one of the most efficient synthetic strategies for constructing optically active heterocycles. Cyclic sulfamidate imines have recently come to be extensively studied and widely utilized in both organocatalytic and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions, where they have been shown to provide various N&#8208;fused&#8208;heterocycles and spiro&#8208;cycles exhibiting high efficiencies with excellent stereoselectivities. This review highlights recent advancements in catalytic asymmetric cycloadditions of cyclic sulfamidate imines for the stereoselective synthesis of biologically active sulfamidate&#8208;containing heterocycles since 2012 while focusing on the diverse reactivities of cyclic sulfamidate imines and the mechanisms of chiral induction in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A domino sequence consisting of a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed Doyle&#8208;Kirmse rearrangement followed by a Claisen&#8208;thioimidate rearrangement has been developed. This type of thio&#8208;Claisen rearrangement represents the first example reported in the homoallenylsulfenyl series. The sequence involves 2&#8208;propargylsulfenyl benzazoles and diazoesters, affording N&#8208;butadienyl substituted benzazole&#8208;2&#8208;thiones as a mixture of Z and E isomers, in yields ranging from 12% to quantitative (32 examples).

         <title>Rapid (Deuterio)difluoromethylation of Heteroatoms using R&#8208;22 Gas: A Demonstration of Flow Chemistry in Suppressing Intrinsic Reaction Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration and use of deuteriodifluoromethyl heteroatom groups (X&#8208;CF2D) has been limited by persistent challenges, including the unavailability of CF2D precursor reagents, as well as safety, scalability, and environmental concerns associated with conventional batch&#8208;mode syntheses.  In this study, we report the use of atom&#8208;efficient and cost&#8208;effective R&#8208;22 gas (ClCF2H) in continuous flow for the rapid installation of CF2H and CF2D groups on heteroatom centers.  However, the intrinsic nucleophilic substitution between heteroatom anions and ClCF2H decreases the deuterium incorporation levels.  Notably, a judiciously designed continuous flow system proves to suppress the previously unavoidable SN2 reaction and allows for the selective carbene coupling to generate X&#8208;CF2D products with high deuterium incorporation levels up to 96%.  Our continuous flow systems provide a broad scope of X&#8208;CF2H and X&#8208;CF2D products (X = S, O, N) within a short residence time of 5 minutes and scalability is also demonstrated.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of synthetic methods for the synthesis of organic azides is highly important, given their critical role in advancing click chemistry over the last twenty years. We report a reagent&#8208;economical, reliable, and scalable synthesis of alkyl azides from primary and secondary alcohols. This robust click method capitalizes on the synergistic interaction between Sulfur Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) reagents&#8212;specifically, benzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;disulfonyl fluoride (BDSF) or benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trisulfonyl fluoride (BTSF)&#8212;and trimethylsilyl azide (TMSN3). The method offers procedural ease, accommodates a wide array of substrates, and enables late&#8208;stage functionalization. Additionally, we demonstrate the protocol's adaptability by validating a straightforward one&#8208;pot deoxyazidation&#8208;CuAAC sequence for drug discovery applications.</dc:description>

Abstract
The enantioselective introduction of gem&#8208;difluorinated carbonyl (i.&#8201;e. &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro carbonyl) moieties into organic structures is a synthetically valuable but highly challenging approach. During the past decades, continuous efforts have been made for the developments of synthetic strategies for constructing C(sp3)&#8722;CF2COR chiral centers with high levels of enantioselectivities. This review summarizes and discusses the recent advance in the enantioselective construction of gem&#8208;difluorinated carbonyl moieties, which are organized according to the reaction categories.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Direct Hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Epoxy Ketones and &#945;&#8208;Ketoamides at Room Temperature</title>

Abstract
Chemoselective hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy ketones and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides is achieved at room temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C) using 2.0&#8197;bar H2 and a pincer&#8208;ligated Mn(I) catalyst that provides synthetically valuable &#945;&#8208;hydroxy epoxides and &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amides. This protocol applies to a wide range of alkyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy ketones, including terpenes (&#945;&#8208;ionone, nootkatone, and R&#8208;carvone)&#8208; and steroids (testosterone and progesterone)&#8208;derived epoxy ketones, and tolerates H2 sensitive functionalities, such as halides, acetyl, nitrile, nitro, epoxide, alkenyl and alkynyl groups. Additionally, &#945;&#8208;ketoamides bearing reducible functional groups, including acetyl and diazo benzene, were untouched under this protocol and selectively converted to &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amides. A preliminary mechanistic study highlighted the metal&#8208;ligand cooperative H2 activation process.

         <title>Application of Primary Phosphine Oxides in Domino&#8208;Phospha&#8208;Aldol Reactions of Diketones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An approach for the preparation and stabilization of primary phosphine oxides is presented complementing previous methods of in&#8197;situ generation. Specifically, RP(O)H2 where R=benzyl (Bn), cyclohexyl (Cy), 2&#8208;naphthyl (2&#8208;Naph), phenyl (Ph), tert&#8208;butyl (t&#8208;Bu) was prepared by controlled oxidation of the corresponding primary phosphine in presence of ferrocene as stabilizing reagent. The primary phosphine oxides were characterized using NMR and MS and studied in twofold hydrophosphorylation of diketones. The&#160;domino&#8208;phospha&#8208;aldol reaction catalysed with 5&#8197;mol% of sodium methoxide yielded five&#8208;, six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered heterocyclic tertiary phosphine oxides with a high degree of stereoselectivity, as confirmed by single X&#8208;ray diffraction.

Synthesis of new polysubstituted furans incorporating reactive phosphorus ylides or N&#8208;acyliminophosphoranes was achieved by the heterocyclization of flexible &#945;&#8208;acyl ketene dithioacetals. This one&#8208;pot tandem reaction was initiated by acyl&#8208;directed desulfurative Sonogashira coupling, followed by 1,6&#8208;addition of phosphine to the in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated enynone and subsequent 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization, as well as phosphoranation. The selectivity toward the two products, i.&#8201;e. &#945;&#8208;phosphorus ylides vs. &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acyliminophosphoranes&#8208;substituted furans, was determined by both electron&#8208;deficient acetylenes and copper salts.

Abstract
We herein describe a method in the synthesis of aryl ether derivatives from a cross&#8208;coupling reaction of vinylidenecyclopropane&#8208;diesters (VDCP&#8208;diesters) with commercially available phenolic compounds for the formation of C&#8722;O bond under palladium catalysis and assisted by Sc(OTf)3/Cs2CO3. This developed transformation proceeds through a nucleophilic addition at the 2&#8208;position of allenic moiety at 50&#8201;&#176;C for 4.0&#8197;h and is compatible with substituents such as bromine, iodine and borate on the phenolic substrates via a zwitterionic &#960;&#8208;propargyl palladium species, affording the desired products in 29% to 95% isolated yields. A plausible reaction mechanism has been also proposed on the basis of control, deuterium labeling experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Abstract
We report the addition reaction of lithium enol ethers to fluoroalkyl imines. A range of different fluoroalkyls and lithiated reagents are well tolerated. Diastereoselective addition of lithium vinyl ethers to fluoroalkyl N&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsulfinylimines is disclosed, providing enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;fluorinated amines in up to 98% yield. This general approach led to the diastereoselective formation of various amino alcohols and amino ethers, which are difficult to obtain by other methods.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Induced C&#8208;3 Carbamoylation of Quinoxalinones Assisted by EDA Complex</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted strategy for the decarboxylative C&#8208;3 carbamoylation of quinoxalinone scaffolds is developed. This approach initiates through the formation of an EDA complex between oxamic acid and quinoxalinone. Successive SET and decarboxylative carbamoylation construct the C&#8722;C bond. This method utilizes aerial oxygen as the green oxidant and eradicates the process from the use of external photocatalysts and transition metals. Detailed synthetic and photophysical studies enlighten the reaction pathway.

Abstract
Herein, we report a Pd&#8208;catalyzed aerobic lactamization of unactivated &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of aliphatic carboxylic acids and amino acids derivatives. The utilization of Pd(OAc)2 as a catalyst, along with catalytic AgNO2 as an electron transfer mediator, circumvents the need for stoichiometric oxidants and demonstrates significant practicality.

Abstract
Vicinal halohydrins are key building blocks to produce bioactive molecules and drugs, especially if they can be obtained in enantiomerically pure form. In this study, we present a bi&#8208;enzymatic sequence that allows to obtain vic&#8208;halohydrins through a photochemoenzymatic olefin hydroxy halogenation followed by a lipase catalysed kinetic resolution. The absolute configuration of the resulting products was determined using Mosher's method

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclohexenone(aryl)iodonium Salts and Their Application in Construction of Fused aza&#8208;Heterocyclic Skeletons</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A class of cyclohexenone(aryl)iodonium salts was readily prepared from 2&#8208;iodocyclohexenones and arenes under mild conditions. This novel series of hypervalent iodonium building blocks exhibits dual characteristics of hyperiodonium salts and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated cyclic ketones, enabling access to intricate aza&#8208;heterocycles. The reaction of these cyclohexenone(aryl)iodonium salts with arylamines and benzene sulfonamides affords 2&#8208;acylaziridines, while with 1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines leads to the formation of the 1H&#8208;imidazoimidazole&#8208;fused compounds. The transformation is postulated to proceed through an exclusive hyperiodonium&#8208;mediated N&#8208;Michael addition followed by N&#8208;annulation cascade.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances on Direct Phosphorothiolation Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organophosphorothioates are organic molecules containing sulfur and phosphorus, with significant biological activity and physicochemical properties, widely used in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, and the agrochemical industry. In particular, many phosphorothioates display a variety of biological activities, such as antifungal, antibacterial, anti&#8208;parasite, anticancer, and so on. Traditionally, the synthesis of phosphorothioates has mainly relied on indirect methods involving the construction of S&#8208;P bond. In recent years, direct phosphorothiolation has gained attention as a reliable and rapid method for introducing the &#8208;S&#8208;P(O)(OR)2 group into parent molecules. This article reviews the latest advances in direct phosphorothiolation reactions, categorized based on the different sources of the &#8208;S&#8208;P(O)(OR)2 group.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative photochemical cyclisations to access spiroketals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The spiroketal moiety is an important substructure within many biological natural products.  One method to access them is via the oxidative cyclisation of a pendant hydroxyl group on to a pre&#8208;formed pyran.  However applications of this methodology have been severely limited by requiring the use of toxic and powerful oxidants, such as lead (IV) tetraacetate or mercuric oxide.  Herein we report a novel and high yielding photochemical route to prepare complex spiroketals using a photochemical oxidative approach with mild and non&#8208;toxic reagents and demonstrate the methodology to the synthesis of a number of insect pheromones.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Oxaspirocyclohexadienones via Lewis&#8208;Acid Catalyzed [2+3]&#8208;Annulations of p&#8208;Quinone Methides and Iodonium Ylides</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a mild method for the synthesis of oxaspirocyclohexadienones by using a combination of Lewis acid&#8208;HFIP mediated [2+3]&#8208;annulation of p&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) and iodonium ylides. The proposed mechanism proceeds through a one&#8208;pot sequence of carbonyl activation/cyclopropyl formation/Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement to provide a broad range of oxaspirocyclohexadienones in moderate to high yields. Interestingly, the spiro&#8208;annulated products were further converted to tetrahydroxanthane derivatives via BF3.OEt2 mediated dienone&#8208;phenol rearrangement pathway. Moreover, the spiro&#8208;annulated derivatives also showed a moderate anti&#8208;tuberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra ATCC25177.

         <title>Deep Study of Thiocarbamoyl Fluorides: Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Thiocarbamoyl fluoride is an understudied fluorinated group, mainly due to the paucity of data on its properties. Herein, an in&#8208;depth study of the stability of thiocarbamoyl fluorides, especially under near&#8208;physiological conditions, is described. Since efficient and easy to implement syntheses of these compounds are still under&#8208;described, a new method, based on the use of a trifluoromethanesulfenamide, a well&#8208;described reagent, has also been developed. This trifluoromethanesulfenamide turned out to be able to generate in&#8197;situ difluorothiophosgene, which was able to react rapidly with amines to provide various thiocarbamoyl fluorides.

         <title>In Situ Triflation&#8208;Tandem Cross&#8208;Coupling Enables Synthesis and Photophysical Studies of Indenones and Benzofulvenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Indan&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones stand as versatile precursors to a plethora of complex molecules with wide applications; however, their direct cross&#8208;coupling methodologies remain largely unexplored. Herein, we unveil an in&#8197;situ triflation&#8208;tandem cross&#8208;coupling strategy to synthesize a diverse variety of indenones and benzofulvenes from indan&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones. The successful synthesis of a neolignan natural product and the key intermediate of Indatraline (antidepressant) showcased the synthetic utility of the methodology. The strategy enabled tuning the electronic characteristics of indenones and benzofulvenes, modulating the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps. The photophysical properties of these molecules were studied, and the experimental results were compared with the predictions obtained from the DFT studies.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8722;Catalyzed Synthesis of Cyclic Sulfamides via an Intramolecular Dehydrative Amination of Allylic Alcohols: A Strategy for 1,3&#8208;Diamine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular dehydrative amination method has been developed to synthesize diverse cyclic sulfamides efficiently. Reactions proceed smoothly at room temperature using a combination of (IPr)AuCl (5&#8197;mol%) and AgBF4 (5&#8197;mol%). This method showcases a broad substrate scope, encompassing challenging seven&#8208;membered ring structures, and exhibits functional group compatibility. Moreover, the reaction demonstrates high stereoselectivity, allowing the synthesis of enantiomerically enriched cyclic sulfamides from chiral secondary allylic alcohols. The synthesized cyclic sulfamides serve as valuable intermediates for generating 1,3&#8208;diamines. This approach provides an improved route for cyclic sulfamide synthesis and a strategic entry point for obtaining essential 1,3&#8208;diamine derivatives.

Abstract
The decarboxylative oxygenation of readily available carboxylic acids as well as the oxidation of alkenes and alkanes has been accomplished through visible light using g&#8208;C3N4 as a robust and recyclable catalyst. The scalable protocol furnishes an array of aldehydes and ketones under mild reaction conditions, requiring only molecular oxygen as an oxidant. Notably, no addition of stochiometric amounts of base is required, and furthermore, the reaction proceeds efficiently open to the air.

         <dc:description>The synthesis of substituted 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;b]indazoles from 3&#8208;aminoindazoles and ketones has been established. It involves one molecule of 3&#8208;aminoindazoles and two molecules of ketones via a [3+2+1] three&#8208;component annulation process. 3&#8208;Oxo&#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;b]indazoles exhibit strong yellow fluorescence in various solvents. A wide range of products have anti&#8208;oxidant activities. Cytotoxicity studies indicate that compounds 3a, 3aa and 3ab have obvious effects on both HCT116 and A549 cancer cell lines.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu&#8208;catalyzed Formal Addition of Aliphatic C(sp3)&#8211;H Bonds to Alkenes via Phenyl Radical Involved Intermolecular HAT</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A copper catalyzed aerobic formal addition of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds to alkenes via a phenyl radical mediated intermolecular HAT process is reported herein, in which the phenylhydrazine not only acts as a good HAT reagent precursor but also as an excellent hydrogen atom donor. This reaction affords an alternative method for the direct formal addition of the aliphatic C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds to alkenes utilizing air as the radical initiator without additional reductants at the ambient temperature. A variety of alkanes and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes are successfully incorporated, furnishing a series of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8211;H formal addition products in 20&#8208;93% yields. The preliminary mechanistic studies uncover that the 2&#8208;tetrahydrofuranyl and phenyl radical are formed in this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;free photocyclization/oxidation cascade constructing quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones and tetrahydrocarbazolones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reported a one&#8208;pot photocyclization/ oxidation cascade of N&#8208;aryl acrylamides to afford quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones. Thioxanthone was used as a bifunctional energy transfer agent to mediate both photocyclization and generation of singlet oxygen, the latter facilitates the dehydrogenation of dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;one intermediate. This cascade strategy also supports the 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization to synthesize tetrahydrocarbazolones from phenylamino cyclohexenones.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomative 1,2&#8208;(Deutero)Hydrotrifluoromethylation of Chromium&#8208;Bound Arenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dearomative trifluoromethylation of arenes provides an ideal method for constructing CF3&#8208;containing three&#8208;dimensional architectures which are of increasing interest in drug discovery. However, such transformation is rare and challenging because of the inherently low reactivity of arene &#960;&#8208;systems and selectivity issues. Herein, we disclose a general dearomative 1,2&#8208;hydrotrifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes utilizing activation by temporary &#960;&#8208;complexation to chromium, thus affording convenient access to 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes bearing the privileged CF3 group. The versatility of this strategy further enables a dearomative 1,2&#8208;deuterotrifluoromethylation with high deuterated ratios. The related dearomative 1,2&#8208;(deutero)hydroperfluoroethylation reactions were conducted well for a range of chromium&#8208;bound (hetero)arenes. Finally, a reasonable mechanism was proposed based on the intermediate capture and control experiments.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dearomative trifluoromethylation of arenes provides an ideal method for constructing CF3-containing three-dimensional architectures which are of increasing interest in drug discovery. However, such transformation is rare and challenging because of the inherently low reactivity of arene &#960;-systems and selectivity issues. Herein, we disclose a general dearomative 1,2-hydrotrifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes utilizing activation by temporary &#960;-complexation to chromium, thus affording convenient access to 1,3-cyclohexadienes bearing the privileged CF3 group. The versatility of this strategy further enables a dearomative 1,2-deuterotrifluoromethylation with high deuterated ratios. The related dearomative 1,2-(deutero)hydroperfluoroethylation reactions were conducted well for a range of chromium-bound (hetero)arenes. Finally, a reasonable mechanism was proposed based on the intermediate capture and control experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, silyl ethers of phenols and alcohols have been successfully prepared and tested as neutral carbon (silicon) centered radical precursors. The organocophotocatalyzed oxidation (by the Fukuzumi catalyst) of these ethers caused the cleavage of a C&#8208;Si (or a Si&#8208;Si) bond for the release of the desired radical to be used for the forging of C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) (or C(sp3)&#8208;Si) bonds via a Giese reaction.</dc:description>

Abstract
We are reporting the preparation and use in cross&#8208;coupling reactions of a newly developed, bench&#8208;stable (1&#8208;fluorocyclopropyl)metalloid reagent. The Stille cross&#8208;coupling reaction described for this &#945;&#8208;fluorinated stannane reagent is amenable to a wide range of aryl and alkenyl (pseudo)halides bearing a variety of functional groups. An enantioenriched cross&#8208;coupled product was also obtained from the corresponding 1&#8208;fluorocyclopropyltin reagent bearing an ester handle. Finally, the chemical stability of the 1&#8208;fluorocyclopropyl moiety was also demonstrated by performing several post&#8208;functionalizations.

         <title>Three Component Cascade Processes Involving Palladium Catalyzed Transformations/Dipolar Cycloadditions for the Synthesis of Angular Heterotriquinane Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Combining chemical reactivities of allenes and oximes created a methodology for the preparation of heterocyclic triquinane&#8208;type skeletons via a cascade process constructing four bonds in a single step. The initial reaction of allene moiety promoted by Pd&#8208;catalysis, affording &#960;&#8208;allyl Pd&#8208;species, was followed by two additional transformations &#8208; nucleophilic displacement and dipolar cycloaddition &#8208; to furnish the product highly stereoselectively in moderate to good yields. For the process to be efficient, it was necessary to use a dipolarophilic component as a solvent. Intriguingly, while the reaction with cyclopentanone derived oxime progressed through the whole cascade, with cyclohexanone analogue it stopped at the nitrone stage, requiring an additional step to yield similar type of products. Some aspects of the studied cascade were examined by DFT.

Abstract
Asymmetric decarboxylative Mannich addition of &#946;&#8208;keto acids or malonic acid half&#8208;esters to &#946;,&#947;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketimino esters catalyzed by cinchona alkaloid&#8208;derived squaramide has been developed. The reaction proceeded by forming a nucleophilic enolate after decarboxylation, followed by its addition to &#946;,&#947;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketimino esters facilitated by the bifunctional catalyst. A broad range of substrates with various substituents are tolerated in this reaction, yielding a series of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acid derivatives bearing alkynyl functional groups in high yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities. The practicality of this method was demonstrated by a gram&#8208;scale reaction and subsequent elaboration of the Mannich adducts.

Abstract
Herein, we report thiouracil&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;selective O&#8208;glycosylations employing easily accessible glycosyl trichloroacetimidate donors without using any co&#8208;catalyst or additive. A variety of alcohol nucleophiles including saccharides, and amino acids with different protecting groups containing glycosyl trichloroacetimidate donors were successfully &#945;&#8208;glycosylated using an operationally simple protocol. Moreover, mechanistic investigations suggest that thiouracil functions as Br&#248;nsted acid/base catalyst in this glycosylation process.

         <title>Oxidative Rearrangement Approach for the Ring Contraction of N&#8722;H Piperidines to Pyrrolidines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We have developed a method for ring contraction of N&#8722;H piperidines using oxidative rearrangement with PhI(OAc)2. The reaction forms iminium ion intermediates that are effectively trapped by nucleophiles (e.&#8201;g., NaBH4, H2O) yielding the corresponding pyrrolidine derivatives. Additionally, we propose an ionic mechanism supported by experiments and density&#8208;functional theory calculations.

Abstract
The development of an efficient alternative to the widely employed Balz&#8208;Schiemann deaminative fluorination method (i.&#8201;e. without using aryl diazonium tetrafluoroborate salt) is a challenging task. Herein, we report a convenient one&#8208;pot method for the FeCl3&#8208;nanocellullose mediated mechanochemical synthesis of fluoroarenes through the selective substitution of an aromatic amino group by fluorine group using pyrylium tetrafluoroborate (Pyry&#8208;BF4) and sodium fluoride (NaF) via in&#8197;situ formation of pyridinium salt intermediate. The scope of the present protocol includes synthesis of thirty&#8208;four organofluorine compounds with excellent yields via a selective substitution (SNAr) of an amino group by fluorine. The presented concise methodology opens a pathway to access new chemical spaces for the late&#8208;stage functionalization in pharmaceutical industries.

Abstract
Enantioselective reduction of cyclobutenones to optically active cyclobutanones has been achieved by using whole&#8208;cell overexpressing Seqenzym ene&#8208;reductases (EREDs). By using these enzymes, trans&#8208;cyclobutanones were isolated in good yields and with enantiomeric excesses up to 99%.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8208;)&#8208;Daphenylline by Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Dearomatization Reaction of Methoxynaphthalene</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Daphenylline, a structurally unique triterpenoid Daphniphyllum alkaloid, has attracted considerable attention from the synthetic community since its isolation. Herein, we delineate an enantioselective total synthesis of (&#8208;)&#8208;daphenylline, which is based on a gold&#8208;catalyzed dearomatization reaction of &#946;&#8208;methoxynaphthalene. Other features include installation of the initial chiral stereocenter via an enantioselective rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of an indene derivative; construction of the other vital stereocenter by organocatalytic asymmetric Mukaiyama&#8211;Michael reaction of a structurally complex benzofused cyclohexanone; and a tandem reductive amination/amidation double cyclization reaction to assemble the distinctive azapolycyclic cage&#8208;like architecture.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme Cascade with Four Enzymes in One Pot for the Synthesis of  L&#8208;Phosphinothricin</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The biocatalytic oxidative deamination&#8208; reductive amination process for the production of L&#8208;phosphinothricin (L&#8208;PPT) from D,L&#8208;phosphinothricin (D,L&#8208;PPT) is a green and environmentally friendly approach with significant development potential. In this study, the adopted technological route involves the oxidative deamination of the D&#8208;PPT component in D,L&#8208;PPT to 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)butanoic acid (PPO) by utilizing D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAAO), fol&#8208;lowed by the catalytic reductive amination of PPO to L&#8208;PPT using phosphinothricin dehydrogenase (PpDH). In order to enhance the catalytic rate and reduce the inhibitory effect of the intermediate product PPO on the catalytic process, optimization of both oxidative deamination and reductive amination phases was conducted through separate strategies of constant&#8208;pressure oxygen supply and substrate feeding, respectively. A "two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot" method was employed to link the optimized reactions, significantly shortening the production time. Furthermore, the "two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot" catalytic strategy was optimized, ultimately achieving a high 97.7% yield of L&#8208;PPT with ee of L&#8208;PPT &#65310;99.9% after 5.5 h of reaction under 800 mM D,L&#8208;PPT catalytic conditions,further enchanced the catalytic efficiency and product yield.The aforementioned results demonstrate that this proposed approach has great potential for industrial&#8208;scale production of L&#8208;PPT as well as significant competitive advantages in terms of economic feasibility.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The oxaspiro&#8208;phthalides ([n,5]&#8208;oxaspirobenzalactones) bearing a phthalide spirofused to a cyclic&#8208;ether of various sizes are frameworks found in bioactive natural products.

Our strategy may represent the first report on the construction of oxaspiro&#8208;phthalides using the alkynyl&#8208;Prins cyclization.	This approach exhibits broad substrate scope with respect to carbonyl compounds and 2&#8208;(alkynol)benzoates, with yields ranging between 71&#8208;98%. Isolation of intermediate, and further conversion of it to the end&#8208;product supported the proposed mechanistic pathway.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our study introduces a streamlined oxidative method for synthesizing 1,3&#8208;diarylphenanthro[9,10&#8208;c]thiophenes, and their subsequent oxidative cleavage to yield 9,10&#8208;diaroylphenanthrenes. Harnessing an optimized aerobic photochemical transformation, we showcase broad substrate scope and tolerance to various photosensitive functional groups. Our mechanistic investigations unveil the pivotal role of singlet oxygen, providing intriguing insights into the reaction pathway. The synthesized 9,10&#8208;diaroylphenanthrenes serve as versatile building blocks for nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, dibenzoannulated phthalazines, that are promising compounds with diverse functionalities. Offering mild conditions, and broad applicability, our synthetic strategy is useful for organic synthesis and chemical biology exploration.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Here we report a transition metal&#8211; and oxidant&#8211;free annulation cascade method for the synthesis of chromeno&#8211;isoxazoles. The annulation reaction involves easily accessible starting materials, 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2H&#8208;chromene and &#945;&#8208;chloro aldehyde, yielding the structurally intriguing framework, chromeno[3,4&#8208;c]isoxazoles employed by tripotassium phosphate as a base. The isoxazole ring construction over the 2H&#8211;chromene unit is believed to occur via a series of multiple reaction sequences. Here, the enolate generation/Michael addition/C&#8211;Cl bond cleavage/oxy&#8211;anionic addition to reactive tethered&#8208;aldehyde/deformylation via retro&#8211; C&#8211;C and N&#8211;O bond cleavages are the most possible sequences which furnish the desired end&#8211;product in good chemical yields. The multiple reaction sequences occur in one&#8208;pot at mild conditions, supported by experimental results and a few control experiments including DFT studies. This process exhibits a broad substrates scope illustrating good functional group compatibility towards both the nitrochromenes and aldehydes, and thus prove to be a general and efficient protocol for the synthesis of chromeno[3,4&#8211;c]isoxazoles. Overall, the use of nitrochromene as the limiting reagent, noteworthy functional group tolerance, scalability including great applications like chiral pool strategy towards the synthesis of enantioenriched chromeno&#8208;isoxazole are the additional features.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Naphthalenone Spiroindanediones or 4&#8208;Acyl&#8208;1&#8208;naphthols from Aryl Enaminones Featuring Reuse of Dimethylamine</title>

Abstract
Presented herein is a switchable synthesis of naphthalenone spiroindanediones or 4&#8208;acyl&#8208;1&#8208;naphthols via condition&#8208;controlled divergent cascade reactions of aryl enaminones with diazoindanediones. When the reaction was carried out in the presence of an oxidative additive, naphthalenone spiroindanedione was formed through C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation followed by simultaneous spiroannulation and elimination of dimethylamine. When the reaction was carried out in the presence of an acid additive, on the other hand, 4&#8208;acyl&#8208;1&#8208;naphthol was formed through ring opening of the spiroindanedione moiety attacked by the in&#8197;situ released dimethylamine. In addition, the reactions are suitable for gram&#8208;scale applications and compatible with a variety of substrates. Moreover, the naphthol products allow structural elaborations and hybridization with a drug, thus further enhancing the value of this developed method.

Abstract
An In(III)&#8208;catalyzed [2+3+1] annulation strategy is developed for the diastereoselective construction of diversely functionalized tetrahydroxanthones bearing chromone rings. This protocol is based on a three&#8208;component reaction involving various 3&#8208;formylchromones and &#945;&#8208;methylstyrenes via a carbonyl&#8208;ene and formal [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. Notable features of this reaction include its wide substrate scope, high tolerance towards functional groups, atom economy, and excellent diastereoselectivity. In addition, the synthesized tetrahydroxanthones are readily transformed into 2&#8208;hydroxybenzophenone products.

         <title>Selective Access to Sultams and Spirocyclic Sultams by the Divergent Annulations of (N&#8208;Aryl)&#8208;Alkynyl Sulphonamides</title>

Abstract
Herein, we present the first annulation reaction of (N&#8208;aryl)&#8208;alkynyl sulphonamides leading to sultams or spirocyclic sultams. The selective formation of aforesaid products is based on the variable reactivity, intramolecular ortho&#8208;cyclization or dearomative ipso&#8208;annulation, guided by the substituent on N&#8208;aryl group of the substrate. The ortho&#8208;annulation is mediated by electrophile, while the ipso&#8208;annulation is promoted by the radical, enabling the functionalization (selenyl or iodo) on sultams. The synthetic potential of this method is illustrated by modifications of the functional groups present in the products obtained.

Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate an Oxa&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 3&#8208;trifluoroacetyl&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;quinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one with aldehydes in the presence of a base to engineer the functionalized pyrano[3,4&#8208;c]quinolones. This reaction proceeds through an in&#8208;situ generated hetero dendralene intermediate and features perfect stereoselectivity on a wide range of substrates with excellent atom economy. The high electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of CF3&#8208;group is responsible for making the methyl group present in quinolone moiety more acidic to furnish the corresponding hetero dendralene intermediate.

The high electron-withdrawing nature of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-group is responsible for making the methyl group present in quinolone moiety more acidic to furnish the corresponding hetero dendralene intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A strategy to access fluorinated spiroindolenines has been developed, involving a selective functionalization of indoles with fluorinated moieties and subsequent catalytic dearomatization. Trifluomethylthio (SCF3), diethyl phosphono(difluoromethyl)thio (SCF2P(O)(OEt)2) and (phenylsulfonyl)difluoromethyl (CF2SO2Ph) groups were embedded at the C2 position of indole derivatives substituted with alkynes, allenes, and allyl carbonate moieties at the C3 position. A gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization gave access to five spiroindolenines, and an enantioselective palladium catalyzed cyclization provided 10 fluorinated spirocyclic products with up to 77% ee.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Oxazoles: Aminotrifluoromethylation of Alkynes/in&#8208;situ Cyclization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
We report the development of a four&#8208;component electrochemical method for the synthesis of CF3&#8208;oxazoles, utilizing alkynes and NaSO2CF3 in MeCN. The method leverages the simplicity and mildness of the reaction conditions, despite the inherent complexity of utilizing four distinct components through aminotrifluoromethylation of alkyne followed by in&#8208;situ cyclization. Notably, in addition to MeCN solvent, the presence of residual water in the reaction mixture also contributed as a coupling partner. The synthesis involves a sequence of four controlled oxidation steps under constant potential with graphite electrodes, facilitated by the mediator TMEDA, highlighting the precision achievable in electrochemistry.

Abstract
We report herein a general one&#8208;pot perfluoroalkylation/dehydrohalogenation protocol for the selective perfluoroalkenylation of silyl dienol ethers in their &#947; position. Importantly, this methodology is applicable to the synthesis of a wide range of &#947;&#8208;perfluoroalkenylated enals, enones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides. Various perfluoroalkenyl moieties could be efficiently introduced, with an important impact on the E/Z diatereoselectivity of the newly formed fluorinated double bond.

         <title>Cyclization Through Dual C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H functionalization methods have been widely employed in many organic transformations such as cyclization reactions, heterocycle synthesis, cross&#8208;coupling protocols, and photochemical transformations. Among these transformations, cyclization reaction through C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H functionalization offers a direct route to convert simple linear substrates to complex products. There are three modes of utilizing C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H bonds in cyclization reactions including single, double, and dual C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H functionalization. As the most challenging mode, dual C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H functionalization refers to converting two separate C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H bonds in one molecule into desired C&#8211;Z bonds which can be employed in cyclization reactions. Cyclization reaction &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; dual functionalization of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H can be classified based on the C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H reactivities. Therefore, these reactions can be categorized into three classes based on the types of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H bonds including activated&#8208;activated, activated&#8208;unactivated, and unactivated&#8208;unactivated C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H bonds. Most published reports for cyclization reactions &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; dual C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H functionalization involve activated&#8208;activated C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H bonds. However, the number of reported papers on the other two classes has been growing. This review focuses on the dual C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H functionalization protocols used for cyclization reactions and categorizes the published papers based on the types of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H bonds.</dc:description>

Moreover, oxidation of the desire sulfur-containing polycyclic products provides a strategy for the preparation of remote nitrogen-fused polycyclic substituted sulfoxide or sulfone-containing derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted chemodivergent phosphorylation&#8208;peroxidation and oxyphosphorylation of alkenes with phosphine oxides and HOOtBu was realized under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. Using the commercially available Eosin Y as a SET&#8208;photocatalyst, the &#946;&#8208;peroxy&#8208;phosphine oxides were selectively obtained with a catalytic amount of base, while the addition of acid led to the exclusive formation of &#42933;&#8208;keto&#8208;phosphine oxides. Control experiments showed that Eosin Y could also act as a HAT&#8208;catalyst to induce the O&#8208;O bond cleavage of peroxides under acidic conditions.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric &#945;&#8208;allylation of ketones is a particularly useful tool for constructing stereocenters via C&#8211;C bond formation. However, this type of reaction often necessitated the use of activated ketones or pre&#8208;prepared enol intermediates as substrates. In this study, we developed a nickel&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;allylation of unactivated cycloketones with allylic alcohols to synthesize chiral cycloketones with a &#945;&#8208;quaternary carbon center. The reaction affords the products with 42&#8211;97% yield, 72&#8211;86% ee, and no additive is needed, the only by&#8208;product is water.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Catalyzed Domino Isomerization/Oxidant&#8208;Free Dehydrogenative Annulation of Allylic Alcohols: Scope, Mechanism, and Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A domino reaction comprising four consecutive steps based on the strategy of isomerization of allylic alcohols was developed. This base&#8208;catalyzed protocol provided an approach for constructing polysubstituted quinolines without additional additives. A wide range of di&#8208; or trisubstituted &#947;&#8208;aminoaryl allylic alcohols bearing alkyl or (hetero)aryl substituents were transformed to the structurally diverse quinolines. The utility of this transformation was demonstrated by the application in the concise synthesis of several polysubstituted quinoline derivatives, including natural products and pharmacological agents. Preliminary mechanistic experiments suggested that the isomerization of &#947;&#8208;aminoaryl allylic alcohol underwent an intramolecular 1,3&#8208;hydrogen shift and the aromatization of the dihydroquinoline intermediate went through two possible pathways simultaneously exist, acceptorless dehydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing 2&#8208;(chalcogen)benzothiazoles via electrochemically mediated intermolecular cyclization of isocyanides with thiols or diselenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;(chalcogen)benzothiazoles are frequently used as core structures for the development of pharmaceutical agents. A mild strategy for the synthesis of 2&#8208;(chalcogen)benzothiazoles under electrooxidative conditions using isocyanides, thiols or diselenides as substrates was developed. This protocol allows access to structurally diverse 2&#8208;(chalcogen)benzothiazoles in good yields and with good functional group tolerance, which does not require heavy metal catalysts and exogenous oxidants. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale synthesis was performed to demonstrate the scale&#8208;up applicability of this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Difunctionalization of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons Employing the Same Functional Reagent</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The radical difunctionalization of unsaturated hydrocarbons serves as an efficient means to rapidly construct molecular skeletons and synthesize&#8208;highly valuable compounds. In this transformational process, diverse positions within unsaturated hydrocarbons are sequentially functionalized by a single radical precursor reagent, thereby achieving highly efficient and selective transformations that promote atom economy. Furthermore, this approach minimizes the generation of numerous byproducts stemming from cross&#8208;coupling reactions between reactants, owing to the   reduction of the number of participating components. Therefore, this review provides an in&#8208;depth analysis of the radical difunctionalization of unsaturated hydrocarbons utilizing a single functional reagent in recent decades. The discussion is based on eight different radical classes (carbon&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, phosphine&#8208;, oxygen&#8208;, sulfur&#8208;, selenium&#8208;, tellurium&#8208;, and chlorine&#8208;centered radicals), emphasizing the mechanism of specific radical difunctionalization. It also analyzes in detail the regulation of key factors such as regional selectivity, and provides unique insights into reaction transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Hydroxymethylation to 2&#8208;Pyridones and Isoquinolones via C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyridine&#8208;directed regioselective C&#8208;H hydroxymethylation to pyridones and isoquinolones using para&#8208;formaldehyde has been developed under manganese catalysis, offering a wide variety of hydroxymethylated products in 40&#8208;85% yields. This operationally simple methodology proceeds in one step using an earth&#8208;abundant first&#8208;row transition metal&#8208;catalyst without the generation of unwanted salt wastes. A mechanistic study revealed that the C&#8208;H metalation step is reversible but not the rate&#8208;determining step. The introduction of hydroxymethyl group in the biologically relevant scaffolds could be used as an intermediate for valuable synthetic transformations.</dc:description>

</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel strained spiro heterocycles (SSHs) as bioisosteres for aromatic or non&#8208;strained aliphatic rings is highly sought after for improving drug design. Their high molecular rigidity and predictable vectorization can enhance drug&#8208;likeness, target selectivity and clinical success. Towards this goal, 1&#8208;oxa&#8208;2,6&#8208;diazaspiro[3.3]heptane (ODASE) is reported as a novel potential SSH&#8208;bioisostere. We demonstrate through theoretical studies the potential of this strained spiro heterocycle to act as a bioisostere for piperazine. We have developed its synthesis from the highly strained azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl intermediate through a robust and mild flow technology&#8208;assisted two&#8208;step protocol. Its tolerance and stability towards medicinally relevant N&#8208;functionalisation protocols are studied, as well as its mild reduction to the C3&#8208;aminoalkylazetidinol motif found in anti&#8208;cancer drug cobimetinib.

         <dc:description>A copper&#8208;catalyzed annulation of enaminones with maleimides was developed to synthesize various pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;e] isoindoles. In this strategy, 2&#8208;aminopyridine served as a traceless directing group, and target products were obtained in 54&#8208;72% yields. Moreover, a plausible mechanism for this reaction  was proposed based on several control experiments, deuterium exchange experiments, and previous reports.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A mechanism&#8208;navigated enantioselective alkylation of an indole C2 C&#8211;H bond with an internal alkene was developed. Under the inharmonious ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal catalyst ratio, a moderate enantiomeric ratio (er) was achieved with our original ligand. We propose that chain&#8208;walking and bond formation are mechanistically independent, and suggest that hydridoiridium does not play a role in the chain&#8208;walking process.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction of Trifluoromethylated &#946;&#8208;Keto Diazos and Nitriles Proceeding via H2O Addition to Nitrile Ylides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed multi&#8208;component reaction of trifluoromethylated &#946;&#8208;amino ketones and nitriles using tert&#8208;butyl nitrite as a diazotization reagent has been developed. Under the optimized conditions, N&#8208;trifluoroalkyl amides were obtained with yields up to 87%. Control experiments and computational studies reveal that the reaction proceeds through the generation of diazo, in&#8197;situ formation of nitrile ylide, water addition and final enol tautomerism. This approach features mild reaction conditions, wide substrate tolerance, and scale&#8208;up applicability, which provides an efficient and practical strategy for amide synthesis.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Aerobic Dearomatization of Naphthylamines under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The dearomatization of aromatic substrates via photocatalytic methodologies has gained escalating prominence to access molecular complexity. Although much focus has been put on non&#8208;active arenes, naphthols and N&#8208;based heteroaromatics, arylamines have so far remained in the background. Herein, we report a photocatalytic strategy for the aerobic, dearomative hydroxylation of naphthylamines under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Our investigation highlights singlet oxygen generation as a viable mechanism for aromaticity disruption, mitigating selectivity issues deriving from the direct oxidation of targeted arylamines. Finally, we showcased the synthetic value of the obtained dearomatized products in a late&#8208;stage diversification campaign.

Abstract
A silver&#8208;catalyzed regioselective one&#8208;pot cyclization reaction of diazo reagents with fluoronitroalkenes was developed. This transformation presents a method for accessing a series of 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;fluoropyrazoles that are substituted with various groups such as trifluoromethyl, carboxylic ester, nitrile, and phosphonate ester. Further synthetic transformations offered the corresponding fluorinated and trifluoromethylated analogues of two fungicide compounds.

         <title>Ambiphilic Reactivity of SF5&#8208;Alkynes Applied to Regioselective and Stereodivergent Halogenation Reactions: An Experimental and Theoretical Case Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We explored the ambiphilic reactivity of SF5&#8208;alkynes, and we proved they can act as both nucleophiles and electrophiles. We selected halogenation reactions as benchmark reactions and developed highly selective stereodivergent hydrohalogenation (I, Br, Cl, F) reactions of SF5&#8208;alkynes. The stereochemistry is finely controlled thanks to the nature of the acids used (strong or soft) in the presence of halide source, while the high regioselectivity is governed by the strong polarization of SF5&#8208;alkynes. Mechanistic studies supported by DFT calculations shed light on two different reaction mechanisms responsible of the excellent stereocontrol. This stereoselectivity was quantitatively rationalized with the ASM and EDA methods. A few dihalogenation reactions are reported and DFT calculations rationalize this cis&#8208;stereoselectivity. Relative configuration of all the SF5&#8208;haloalkenes was unambiguously determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Noteworthy, several post&#8208;functionalization reactions such as cross&#8208;couplings, cyanation and reductions are described to strengthen the synthetic potential.

Abstract
We report here a mild process to access diversely functionalized enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluorinated (S)&#8208;alcohols by using biocatalytic reduction in &gt;99% yield and enantiomeric excesses ranging from 96% to &gt;99%. This novel approach involves enzymatic reduction of &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluorinated heterocyclic and carbocyclic ketone derivatives as well as an acyclic gem&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;ketosulfone and proceeds under mild conditions at 30&#8201;&#176;C under aqueous conditions to produce a range of high added value enantioenriched difluorinated alcohols including 3,3&#8208;difluorochromanol, 3,3&#8208;difluorothiochromanol, 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;dihydroquinolinol, and &#945;&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfone derivatives. A comparative study between enzymatic reduction and metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation was carried out as well.

Abstract
In this manuscript a general photocatalytic approach for the synthesis of alkyl&#8208;substituted gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes using readily available oxime esters and 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoroprop&#8208;2&#8208;ene (BDFP) has been established. This strategy involving a radical bromo elimination provides access to a large variety of value&#8208;added fluorinated molecules. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with many functional groups including complex natural products or drug molecules. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic investigations indicate that the efficiency of the process relies on the crucial role of imine radical, which is formed after photoexcitation via energy transfert (EnT) and decarboxylation of the oxime ester. Indeed, the imine radical would either behave as a bromine radical scavenger or an XAT promoter in this reaction.

         <title>TBHP&#8208;Mediated Hydroxyperfluoroalkylation of Alkenes with Perfluoroalkyl Iodides to Construct &#946;&#8208;Perfluoroalkyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A three&#8208;component strategy for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl allyl alcohols from 1,3&#8208;dienes is developed. A diverse range of synthetically valuable &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl allyl alcohols are obtained in moderate to high yields. Broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance are observed. This method is also applicable to mono&#8208;olefins and 1,3&#8208;enynes. The control experiment results demonstrate that the hydroxyl group OH in the product comes from TBHP. In addition, the practicality and mild reaction conditions make these synthetic transformations attractive and valuable for organic synthesis.

         <title>Synthesis of 4,6&#8208;Difluoro&#8208;Tryptophan as a Probe for Protein 19F NMR</title>

Abstract
A scalable procedure for the synthesis of 4,6&#8208;difluorotryptophan is reported based on a deaminative coupling of a 4,6&#8208;difluorogramine with 2&#8208;benzylthio&#8208;1,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;imidazolone as glycine equivalent. Thus prepared 4,6&#8208;difluorotryptophan was incorporated into the C&#8208;terminal domain of the HIV&#8208;1 capsid protein (CA&#8208;CTD), and 19F spectra of the 4,6&#8208;difluoro Trp CA CTD were recorded and compared to the singly fluorinated counterparts.

Abstract
We report herein a palladium&#8208;catalyzed, site&#8208;selective cyclative annulation of o&#8208;alkynyl arylamides with maleimide for the stereoselective construction of succinimide&#8208;fused benzoxazine derivatives. This operationally simple and modular protocol provides access to polycyclic frameworks. The other associated features are high functional group compatibility, gram&#8208;scale synthetic potential, and downstream transformations. Control and labeling experiments were conducted to get insights into the mechanism.

Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric dearomative arylation of 2&#8208;naphthols enabled by the unconventional reactivity of o&#8208;quinone diimides, i.&#8201;e. the 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition on quinone sp2 hybridized carbon, has been established. Under the catalysis of chiral phosphoric acid, various cyclohexaenones bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter have been prepared with excellent yields and enantioselectivities.

Abstract
The direct diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective Ru(II)&#8208; catalyzed cyclopropanation reaction of alkenes with ((2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoroethyl)sulfinyl)benzene was described. The desired enantioenriched PhSO2CF2&#8208;cyclopropanes were obtained in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities in the presence of a chiral ruthenium complex Ru(II)&#8208;Pheox (17&#8211;94% yields, &gt;20:1 d.r. and 83:17&#8211;98:2 e.r.). The robustness of the approach was showcased and This methodology gave access to chiral 1,2&#8208;trans difluoro&#8208;methylcyclopropanes.

         <title>Tetrafluoropyridinyl Thiolate as a Tool for Enabling Photoredox Alkylation of 1,2,4&#8208;Oxadiazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A method for the radical functionalization of 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazoles using alkyl halides as precursors of radicals is described. The reaction efficiency is determined by potassium tetrafluoropyridinyl thiolate additive, which plays dual role. First, the thiolate converts alkyl halides into more reactive fluorinated aryl sulfides, which undergo photoredox activation of the C&#8722;S bond. Second, the thiolate decreases the unproductive loss of alkyl radicals by converting them back to the sulfides.
