         <title>Photocatalytic C&#8722;I Bond Borylation and Phosphorylation of Diaryliodonium Salts with Excellent Atom&#8208;Economy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Highly atom&#8208;economic conversion of diaryliodonium salts represents an underdeveloped but highly desirable domain. Most reactions involving these species only utilize single aryl group of the diaryliodonium salts and produce an equivalent of aryl iodide as waste. Herein, by further transforming the side&#8208;product aryl iodide, we report an overall new two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot strategy that allows photocatalytic C&#8722;I bond borylation of diaryliodonium salts and ensures effective conversion of both aryl groups of the diaryliodonium into the relevant arylboronic esters. Mechanistic investigations suggest that electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor complex is formed between the photocatalyst phenothiazine and diaryliodonium salt substrate. Upon visible light irradiation, this complex produces aryl radical and aryl iodide. With addition of a base in the second step, the reducing ability of the photocatalyst is enhanced via proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process, thereby aryl iodide produced in the first step is reduced to yield aryl radical again. Both aryl radicals generated in the two steps react with B2(OR)4 to produce the corresponding monoarylation product in a quantitative yield. The strategy is also applicable for C&#8722;I bond phosphorylation of diaryliodonium salts, ensuring that both aryl moieties can be phosphorylated with high efficiency.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Enantioselective Intermolecular Allylation of Quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones</title>

Abstract
An enantioselective C&#8208;, O&#8208; and N&#8208; intermolecular allylic reaction of quinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones has been developed. The reaction between 3&#8208;hydroxy quinolone and Boc&#8208;protected MBH adducts with Pd&#8208;catalysis provided a series of 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diones in 20&#8211;95% yield accompanied by 69&#8211;96% enantioselectivity. In addition, the O&#8208;allylic alkylation could occur by varying the organo&#8208;catalyst and Boc&#8208;protected MBH adducts from benzaldehyde. Furthermore, the N&#8208;allylation of 3&#8208;O&#8208;protected quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones with allylic acetates was also realized (40&#8211;92% yield, 78&#8211;97% ee).

         <title>Regioselective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Protoboration of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A regioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed protoboration of alkynes has been developed, utilizing diboron as the borylation source for the efficient synthesis of alkenylborates. The reaction proceeds via cobalt&#8208;boryl intermediates, diverging from conventional Co&#8722;H chemistry. By fine&#8208;tuning the phosphine ligand side chains, we achieved excellent reactivity and regioselectivity across a wide range of internal and terminal alkynes. This Co&#8208;catalyzed method offers significant advantages in terms of both efficiency and environmental impact, making it an attractive approach for the synthesis of complex organic molecules.

         <title>Regiospecific Alkene Oxyamination via N&#8208;Alkylation&#8208; Hydroxylation&#8208;Transesterification Cascades</title>

Abstract
An unprecedented cascade reaction of simple inactive alkenes, azo compounds and H2O to produce valuable poly&#8208;substituted oxazolidinones is reported herein. The transformation possesses exclusive regioselectivity and features mild reaction conditions and a broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies indicated this transformation underwent a N&#8208;alkylation&#8208;hydroxylation&#8208;transesterification cascade process. This research not only pushes the boundaries of the essential difunctionalization of alkenes but also exploits a new chemistry for azo compounds.

         <title>From gem&#8208;Dichlorocyclobutenones to Cyclobutenols: Unveiling a Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Reduction&#8208;Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation Cascade</title>

Abstract
Cyclobutenones constitute an appealing class of substrates in catalytic asymmetric transformations leading to diversely substituted enantioenriched four&#8208;membered carbocycles, which are eliciting a growing interest in medicinal chemistry. Whilst several synthetically useful enantioselective conjugate addition reactions have been reported, the catalytic enantioselective reduction of the carbonyl group of simple cyclobutenones remains an elusive transformation. Herein, we disclose the discovery of a novel allylic reduction&#8208;asymmetric transfer hydrogenation cascade, catalyzed by a Noyori&#8208;Ikariya ruthenium complex, from readily available gem&#8208;dichlorocyclobutenones, leading to 2&#8208;chlorocyclobutenols with high optical purities, which can be engaged in postfunctionalization reactions enabling access to substituted four&#8208;membered rings.

Abstract
A synthetic method to prepare &#948;&#8211;&#954;&#8208;chloroketones, &#8208;esters and &#8208;amides that relies on the copper(I)&#8208;mediated chlorination at the unactivated tertiary &#948;&#8211;&#954;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of ketones, carboxylic esters, and amides by dichloramine&#8208;T is presented. By exploiting the ability of the N&#8208;chloramide to act as both the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and chlorination reagent, the reactions were shown to be site&#8208;selective with halogenation only occurring at the unactivated tertiary carbon center situated four to ten C&#8722;C bond distances away from the carbonyl functional group in the substrate. The site&#8208;selectivity of the chlorination protocol was further exemplified by the installing of the C&#8722;Cl bond at the distal position of one example containing two tertiary carbon centers and the late&#8208;stage functionalization of two drug molecules.

Abstract
Visible light&#8208;induced site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkylation and alkenylation of 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes with maleimides at room temperature via dual catalysis in an aqueous medium has been disclosed. This operationally simple and mild approach enables the selective formation of alkylation and alkenylation products up to 92% yield under silver&#8208;free conditions with excellent substrate scope. For the mechanistic examination, KIE, H/D labeling experiments, light on&#8208;off experiments, and quantum yield measurements were carried out. Moreover, the present approach for the alkylation and alkenylation of 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes is suitable for scalable synthesis.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a conceptually new, general, and efficient approach for the synthesis of valuable ortho&#8208;azido&#8208;1,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole and one&#8208;pot synthesis of ortho&#8208;triazoletetrazole derivatives mainly via PIDA mediated N&#8208;N cleavage of the azole ring of 2H&#8208;indazoles using TMSN3. This current methodology represents an array of unsymmetrical ortho&#8208;azidotetrazole and ortho&#8208;triazoletetrazole derivatives with wide functional group tolerance in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. The practical utility of this reaction was showcased through successful scale&#8208;up synthesis and a variety of subsequent derivatizations of ortho&#8208;azidotetrazole products. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the reaction proceeds through a radical pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Direct Synthesis of Alkyl&#8208;Substituted Phosphonodithioates from White Phosphorus (P4)</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The direct synthesis of organic phosphorus compounds from white phosphorus (P4) is a longstanding challenge in organic synthesis. Here, we present a novel visible light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component functionalization reaction that integrates P4, disulfide compounds, and N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) esters to produce alkyl&#8208;substituted phosphonodithioates in a one&#8208;pot process. Using 2,4,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) as a photocatalyst, blue LEDs (456&#8197;nm) as the light source, and N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) as the reducing agent in an acetone&#8208;toluene solvent system, this method achieves moderate to good yields of structurally diverse phosphonodithioates. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, ensures complete conversion of P4, avoids chlorination, and uses inexpensive, readily available starting materials, offering potential for large&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Dibenzoxasilepine Using Ring Expansion Reaction of a Pentacoordinate Silicon Intermediate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Dibenzoxasilepine is an important skeleton in both synthetic organic and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Phosphonamidates of Camphorsultam: Versatile Building Blocks for the Synthesis of P&#8208;Chiral Phosphorous(V) Compounds</title>

Abstract
Camphorsultam was utilized for the optical resolution of P&#8208;chiral phosphorous compounds. After chromatographic separation of diastereomeric RP&#8208; and SP&#8208;phosphonamidate intermediates, subsequent substitution reactions with phenol derivatives yielded P&#8208;chiral phosphonic acid aryl esters with excellent enantioselectivities. In these processes, chiral sulfonamide of camphorsultam demonstrated superior abilities as an optical&#8208;resolving agent and a good leaving group. This method was applied to the synthesis of P&#8208;chiral phosphinic esters, phosphonamidates, and thiophosphonate diesters.

This protocol employs more readily accessible aldehydes and NH4SCN as radical precursors under redox&#8208;neutral conditions. Moreover, high atom economy, simple and accessible starting materials, late&#8208;stage modification and wide substrate scope including primary, secondary alkyl aldehydes and aromatic aldehydes enable the potential application in the organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This work provides an in&#8208;depth analysis of the factors governing the different reaction pathways in the acid&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of gem&#8208;vinylsilyl alcohols with aldehydes. The study evaluates the impact of both the ligands attached to silicon and the choice of the Lewis acid on the reaction outcome. Additionally, computational studies offer valuable insights into the mechanism that control these distinct pathways. The process enables the chemo&#8208; and stereocontrolled formation of a variety of structural frameworks, offering significant potential for the generation of a broad range of molecular architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced metal&#8208;free hydrocarboxylation of allylamines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we disclose a new photochemical process to prepare &#947;&#8208;amino acids from allylamines and formic acid salts. The investigated redox&#8208;neutral hydrocarboxylation process produces high yields across a wide range of functionalized allylamine substrates with excellent regioselectivity. The developed operationally simple protocol can be readily scaled with low photocatalyst loading (from 1% up to 0.02 mol%) without the need for any precautions to exclude air or moisture. The mechanistic working model utilizes a thiol&#8208;catalyzed radical chain process, delivering the hydrogen atom and CO2 from formic acid salt across the alkene substrate through the carboxylate radical (CO2&#8226;&#8208;), a crucial reactive intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically Driven Site&#8208;Selective C(sp2)&#8722;H Bond Hydroxylation of N&#8208;Substituted Anilines</title>

Abstract
Organic synthesis has long been fascinated by phenolic compounds, especially their exploration of selectively hydroxylating arenes utilizing H2O as a hydroxyl source. However, phenols&#8242; low redox potential and strong reactivity frequently result in unwanted overoxidation byproducts. Here, we present an electrochemical strategy to overcome this difficulty by using electricity as an oxidant and facilitating the para&#8208;selective hydroxylation of N&#8208;protected anilines. This process exhibits excellent regio&#8208;selectivity, compatibility with diverse functional groups, and adaptability by handling an extensive range of substrates. Noteworthily, the technique provides a sustainable substitute for paracetamol synthesis and terminal acetylene&#8208;holding hydroxylated products, proving the suitability of this strategy for drug synthesis. Significantly, mechanistic investigations suggest the possible radical pathway and water as a hydroxyl source for this strategy.

Abstract
A variety of fluorinated 2H&#8208;chromenes and dihydroquinolines was synthesized by virtue of gem&#8208;difluoromethylene allenes as versatile coupling partners to participate in the transition metal&#8208;catalysed cascade C&#8722;H activation/[5+1] annulation of 2&#8208;alkenylphenols/anilines. This protocol features specific chemo&#8208;/regioselectivity, redox&#8208;neutral manner and good compatibility, providing a straightforward synthetic route to intriguing motifs with the equipment of attractive fluoroalkenyl moiety. The distinctive gem&#8208;difluorine effect induced an unexpected protonolysis of &#963; carbon&#8208;metal bond, thus accounting for the observed selectivity via sequential C&#8722;H activation/allene insertion/protonolysis/cyclization/&#946;&#8208;F elimination process.

A step&#8208;economic method for C2&#8208;arylated azoles via Pd&#8208;catalyzed denitrative arylation of nitroarenes and azoles is reported. This protocol employs synthetically upstream nitroarenes as arylating reagents and proceeds through the selective cleavage of the C&#8722;NO2 and C&#8722;H bonds. Various nitroarenes and nitroheteroarenes were coupled with oxazoles, benzoxazoles, and methylbenzimidazoles, achieving yields of up to 95%. The method's utility is exemplified by its application in the synthesis of Flunoxaprofen. This strategy reduces synthetic steps and minimizes pollution, offering substantial cost&#8208;effectiveness and environmental benefits. Furthermore, the relatively inert C&#8722;NO2 bond in nitroarenes enables late&#8208;stage functionalization or stepwise coupling reactions, providing a complementary method for C2&#8208;arylation of azoles.

         <title>Photoinduced Methylthio Radical Generation from Methylthiophosphonium Salt</title>

Abstract
The production of methylthio radical typically relies on gaseous methanethiol or dimethyl disulfide. Herein, we present a new and straightforward method for the photogeneration of methylthio radical from methylthiophosphonium salt, enabling the synthesis of methylthiophenanthridines via charge transfer complex strategy. In this approach, the methylthiophosphonium salt acts as the electron acceptor, while 2&#8208;isocyanobiaryls serve as the electron donors. This strategy is distinguished by its simplicity in both conditions and operation, and can be extended for the generation of various alkyl(aryl)thio radicals.

         <title>Borane&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Transformation of Levulinic Acid and Hydrazines into Hexahydropyridazines and Tetrahydropyridazin&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones Using Hydrosilane</title>

Abstract
Borane&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation of levulinic acid and other &#947;&#8208;keto acids with hydrazines for selective access to hexahydropyridazines and tetrahydropyridazin&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones has been developed. The combination of B(C6F5)3 and Et3SiH allows for synthesis of various hexahydropyridazines and tetrahydropyridazin&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones in 67&#8211;97% yields with tolerance towards various functional groups and easy scale&#8208;up. This reaction can be rendered enantioselective by using a chiral borane catalyst generated in&#8197;situ from HB(C6F5)2 and a binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral diene and PhMe2SiH, affording the target products in 70&#8211;92% yields with up to &gt;99% ee. The judicious choice of borane catalyst and hydrosilane reductant proves to be critical for catalysis. Mechanistic investigations elucidate the catalytic pathway.

The front cover, prepared by Ziwei Liu and Zeqing Chen and used with permission, highlights the relationship between massive scale agricultural products and biorenewable organic platform chemicals. Biorenewable organics will enable the synthesis of vital commodities such as medicines when affordable petrochemicals are no longer available. This must be managed carefully to ensure that productivity and benefit to society are maximized, and there is balance between food, water, commodities and the environment.

Abstract
The ever&#8208;increasing prevalence of diseases and inadequate resources on Earth are threats to society. Biomass is an abundant resource, and bioactive compounds produced from biomass are environmentally benign in contrast to conventional chemical synthesis methods, which frequently depend on non&#8208;renewable resources. In addition, the functionalized monomers from biomass allow the atom economical synthesis of bioactive molecules. This review aims to provide insight into the synthesis of bioactive molecules from the lignocellulose&#8208;derived platform chemicals. Existing methodology and catalytic systems are summarized for the synthesis of targeted bioactive molecules from cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin&#8208;derived platform chemicals. The biological activities of bioactive molecules obtained from biomass, such as antioxidant, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and anticancer properties, are discussed.

Abstract
This opinionated review underlines the increasing production of 1,3&#8208;propanediol (1,3&#8208;PDO) by whole cell biocatalytic fermentation of biomass and highlights how production has transitioned from petrochemicals to bio&#8208;renewables. Current uses of 1,3&#8208;PDO are listed. Some future prospects for evolving the current technology and expanding the chemical uses of 1,3&#8208;PDO are discussed, with emphasis on catalytic and atom efficient chemistries. Lessons from the success of biomass derived 1,3&#8208;PDO are noted that may be applied to other bio&#8208;based organic platform chemicals.

Abstract
Biomass has been identified as the ultimate sustainable resource for all carbon&#8208;based consumer products of the chemical industries in the future. Its catalytic conversion leads to the formation of various platform chemicals that could partially or even fully replace the fossil&#8208;based building blocks that have been currently used in synthetic chemical processes. Among these compounds, levulinic acid (LA) has been recognized as a member of the &#8220;Top Value Added Chemicals from Biomass&#8221; and has attracted significant attention since the seminal paper reported by Werpy and Petersen in 2004. This review summarizes the properties, recent advances, and developments in the chemistry of levulinic acid. The production of LA from both plant and animal&#8208;based carbohydrate feedstocks via 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural or furfuryl alcohol is discussed from a mechanistic perspective, highlighting intrinsic molecular&#8208;level limitations to LA formation. The efficiencies of recently developed catalytic systems are also summarized and compared. Furthermore, the conversion of LA into high&#8208;value&#8208;added downstream chemicals, including its role in the synthesis of complex molecular structures, is overviewed. This section discussed the reactions of LA in the points of view of its various transformations on carbonyl&#8208;, carboxy&#8208;, methyl&#8208;, and methylene functional groups. The reactions of these functionalities with C&#8722;, N&#8722;, O&#8722;, and S&#8208;nucleophiles, alcohols, amines, organometallic reagents, oxygen etc. were thematically summarized. Our review also outlooks to highlight the challenges and opportunities associated with the extensive research area of organic chemistry of levulinic acid.

Abstract
Molybdenum catalysts bearing ONO, ON(N)O, ON(O)N and ON(S)O ligands were studied for catalytic deoxydehydration of vicinal diols. The complex bearing N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethylbenzyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylethylenediamine ligand afforded full conversion and up to 97% selectivities towards alkenes, when aliphatic vicinal diols were subjected to the reaction at 5&#8197;mol% catalyst loading.

         <dc:description>Development of a mild approach for the highly efficient synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl azoles, which are typically synthesized using high temperature, ligands and preactivated substrates, is highly desirable. Here, we report a mild and efficient photo&#8208;induced Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H/C&#8211;H cross&#8208;coupling to obtain C2&#8208;functionalized azoles using aryl thianthrenium salt (Ar&#8208;TTs). The reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope and an excellent functional group compatibility and serves as an ideal strategy for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals. Additionally, this method enables the efficient synthesis of azole&#8208;based polycyclic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Decyanative arylation via radical coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arenes, especially heteroarenes, are crucial structural motifs in organic chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, and materials science. The introduction of (hetero)aryl groups using readily available feedstocks to modify organic chemicals is a significant topic. Nitriles are ubiquitous and versatile building blocks in organic synthesis. This article summarizes recent advances in decyanative arylation via radical cross&#8208;coupling reactions. In these transformations, (hetero)aromatic nitriles undergo one&#8208;electron reduction to form persistent radical anion intermediates. Simultaneously, transient carbon centered radicals are generated through cleavage of C&#8211;H, C&#8211;C, C&#8211;X (where X = B, N, Si, S, Br) bonds through single electron transfer or hydrogen atom transfer processes. Finally, a radical&#8208;radical coupling reaction followed by CN elimination leads to the formation of aromatized products.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chromium&#8208;catalysed Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama&#8208;Kishi (NHK) reaction is a very dependable technique for alcohol synthesis and is extensively used in the complete synthesis of natural compounds. The majority of these reactions occur via a reductive&#8208;radical&#8208;polar crossover (RRPCO) mechanism, which is crucial for the transformation of reactive radical intermediates. The production of radicals using photoinduced catalytic reactions is now among the most effective approaches. The photoinduced chromium&#8208;catalysed addition reaction to carbonyl compounds is an effective technique for alcohol synthesis that integrates the benefits of photocatalysis with chromium catalysis. Photocatalysis significantly enhances the diversity of radical production, hence broadening the substrate scope in the chromium&#8208;catalysed NHK reaction.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Dearomative [5+1] Spiroannulation and Formal [5+2] Cyclization of Indoles with Enynones: Divergent Synthesis of Spiro&#8208;Indolenines and Dihydrocyclohepta[b]Indolones</title>

Abstract
We developed a temperature&#8208;controlled intermolecular dearomative [5+1] spiroannulation and [5+2] cyclization of indoles with enynones, smoothly delivering a variety of spiroindolenines and dihydrocyclohepta[b]indolones under 40&#8201;&#176;C and 80&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. A three&#8208;step cascade reaction was also realized by using OTBS or NHBoc containing enynones in the reaction with the indole under the identical condition. And a novel valuable highly&#8208;oriented three&#8208;dimensional indole&#8208;based tetracyclic scaffold was produced in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities. Additionally, various spiroindolines and spirooxindoles were facilely produced through simple operations. This highly efficient domino&#8208;reaction represents an emblematic method for the preparation of indole&#8208;based polycycles through the intermolecular pathway.

Abstract
Conjugation of amino acids to bioactive molecules has emerged as a promising strategy for optimizing pharmacological profiles of lead candidates in drug discovery. This study describes a photocatalytic Minisci&#8208;type transfer reaction of N&#8208;acyl amino acids into various N&#8208;heterocycles. Notably, this protocol enables direct conjugation of amino acids into heterocyclic C&#8722;H bonds, eliminating the need for prefunctionalized substrates. A diverse array of N&#8208;heterocycles, amino acids, oligopeptides, and drugs were used to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach. In addition, the importance of this approach is demonstrated through its application in the DNA&#8208;encoded library chemistry. Various synthetic transformations and preliminary mechanistic investigations were also explored.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Aliphatic &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids by Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Hydroamination&#8208;Hydrodesulfurisation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) enzymes have been extensively exploited to produce differently substituted arylalanine analogues, but their use in the stereoselective synthesis of aliphatic fatty amino acids has never been addressed. In this work, a two&#8208;step hydroamination&#8208;hydrodesulfurisation process has been investigated for the production of aliphatic L&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids from thienylacrylic acids, easily accessible by condensation from the corresponding arylaldehyde. Wild&#8208;type PALs from Planctomyces brasiliensis and Streptomyces rimosus were selected as the most promising candidates and improved by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, thus unlocking the hydroamination of a broad panel of 10 different thienylacrylic acids bearing aliphatic and aromatic substituents. The subsequent hydrodesulfurisation step, accomplished by means of inexpensive Raney nickel in mild conditions and aqueous medium, afforded the corresponding aliphatic &#945;&#8208;amino acids in 10&#8208;63% overall isolated yield and perfect enantiopurity. This chemo&#8208;enzymatic process represents the first example of aliphatic amino acid production using PALs, circumventing a major limitation of those biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Palladaelectro&#8208;Catalyzed Chlorination of Arenes in an Undivided Cell</title>

Abstract
Chloroarenes constitute fundamental building blocks in organic synthesis and are widely applied in the synthesis of bioactive compounds, fine chemicals, materials, natural products and pharmaceuticals. Electrochemical chlorination has been recognized as a promising synthetic method for accessing chloroarenes, but it has proved challenging to achieve in practice as shown by the limited number of existing protocols. Herein, we report on a highly general electrocatalytic strategy for the regioselective chlorination of various substituted heteroaryl scaffolds in an undivided cell setup, using ethyl chloroformate as the chlorine source. This strategy offers several practical advantages over existing methodologies, including an operationally simple experimental setup, exceptional functional group tolerance, and the possibility to form either the mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;chlorinated products in high selectivity depending on the choice of catalyst loading, electric current and ethyl chloroformate equivalents. The practicality and selectivity of the protocol were demonstrated by the successful chlorination of an array of densely&#8208;substituted arene frameworks as well as by the synthesis of chlorinated bioactive molecules.

Electrochemical chlorination has been recognized as a promising synthetic method for accessing chloroarenes, but it has proved challenging to achieve in practice as shown by the limited number of existing protocols. Herein, we report on a highly general electrocatalytic strategy for the regioselective chlorination of various substituted heteroaryl scaffolds in an undivided cell setup, using ethyl chloroformate as the chlorine source. This strategy offers several practical advantages over existing methodologies, including an operationally simple experimental setup, exceptional functional group tolerance, and the possibility to form either the mono- or bis-chlorinated products in high selectivity depending on the choice of catalyst loading, electric current and ethyl chloroformate equivalents. The practicality and selectivity of the protocol were demonstrated by the successful chlorination of an array of densely-substituted arene frameworks as well as by the synthesis of chlorinated bioactive molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Enzymatic C&#8722;H&#8208;Oxyfunctionalization for the Efficient Synthesis of Grevillic Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
In this study, a selective C&#8722;H&#8208;oxyfunctionalization using an unspecific peroxygenase (UPO) enabled an efficient biosynthetic route for the synthesis of grevillic acid (GA), a natural antioxidant. The route commenced with the release of o&#8208;coumaric acid (oCA) from trans&#8208;2&#8208;coumaric acid glucoside (trans&#8208;CAG) using commercially available &#946;&#8208;glucosidase from almonds. In addition, a cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans photoisomerization of cis&#8208;CAG was implemented to increase the synthetic access of oCA. The key step, the para&#8208;hydroxylation relative to the existing hydroxyl group of oCA, was accomplished by an UPO with full conversion and 93% isolated yield. Despite its name, the UPO turned out to exhibit excellent regioselectivity in this C&#8722;H functionalization, requiring only H2O2 as a cosubstrate.

         <title>Bidentate NHC&#8208;Containing Ligands for Copper Catalysed Synthesis of Functionalised Diaryl Ethers</title>

Abstract
Diaryl and heteroaryl ethers are important and common motifs in drug discovery and agrochemicals. Here we present a catalytic system for the copper catalysed arylation of phenols with aryl halides. Bidentate N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands provide a well&#8208;defined catalytic system that enable low loading of copper in effective coupling reactions (0.5&#8197;mol% Cu or lower). The reaction scope of aryl iodides and aryl bromides is developed, that is tolerant of functional groups and a library of biaryl ethers with lead&#8208;like properties is prepared. The presence of excess ligand (in a 1:3 ratio) is shown to be optimal to prevent catalyst degradation, presumably by avoiding decomplexation of the ligand. This is also supported by the catalytic results obtained with pre&#8208;formed copper complexes. The kinetics of the reaction are examined and shown to be first order in copper, supportive of a well&#8208;defined catalyst species, first order in phenol and aryl iodide, and zero order in base under the developed conditions. Computational studies performed using Minnesota MN15&#8208;L parametrisation method support an oxidative addition&#8208;reductive elimination sequence with both steps having similar enegies and the reductive elimination occurring through an intimate ion pair intermediate.

         <title>Manganese Promoted Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Phosphine Chlorides with Disulfides for the Synthesis of Thiophosphanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we reported a manganese promoted reductive cross&#8208;coupling approach to construct P&#8210;S bond. This is a practical method for the synthesis of mono&#8208;thiophosphanes, bis&#8208;thiophosphanes and tri&#8208;thiophosphanes under mild conditions. The strategy featured a wide range of substrate scope including various disulfides and phosphine chlorides, constructing diverse sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds from inodorous and readily available starting materials. The employment of reductive conditions avoided the generation of phosphorothioates (PV) by&#8208;products. Ultimately, gram&#8208;scale synthesis and applications were explored. Extensive experiments indicated that the phosphine radical cascade process was involved in the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoconvergent Access to Z&#8208;Allylborons from E/Z&#8208;Mixed 1,3&#8208;Dienes via Cu&#8208;Guanidine Catalysis</title>

Abstract
Merging the stereoisomeric mixture of substrate into a single product through stereospecific transformation is a challenging but higher&#8208;order synthetic strategy, which perfectly meets the demand of cost control in the precise chemical production. In this work, the stereoconvergent synthesis of Z&#8208;allylic boronates was realized with protoborylation of E/Z&#8208;mixed 1,3&#8208;dienes catalyzed by a novel copper&#8208;guanidine complex. The reaction could proceed smoothly under very mild conditions with good functional group tolerance, and convert diverse aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes into the desired Z&#8208;1,4&#8208;addition products with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivities in minutes. Detailed mechanistic studies also helped to disclose the origin of stereoconvergency. Both E&#8208; and Z&#8208;diene were found directly undergoing a rapid borylation without E/Z isomerization of C=C bond, followed by a convergent formation of the same thermodynamically stable allylcopper intermediate before the slow protonation step occurred.

Abstract
A metal&#8208;free base&#8208;promoted [4+3] cycloaddition reaction of N&#8208;thioacyl imines in&#8197;situ generated from &#945;&#8208;amido sulfones with &#945;&#8208;chlorohydroxamates is described. The reaction allows the straightforward synthesis of 1,3,5&#8208;thiadiazepin&#8208;6(7H)&#8208;one derivatives in 44~90% yields. Moreover, a gram&#8208;scale reaction and a product transformation were conducted, which further increased the diversity of products.

Abstract
We describe a fluorinative ring&#8208;cleavage reaction that breaks C&#8722;C bonds in cyclic &#946;&#8208;diketones bearing an aryl moiety by using N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) in the presence of inorganic carbonates (Cs2CO3 or K2CO3) in methanol at room temperature within one hour. The generated fluorinated keto acid esters bearing ortho&#8208;nitro aryl groups were transformed into fluorinated dihydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indolones (DHPIs) via reductive cyclization using B2(OH)4 followed by amidation in the presence of K2CO3. This &#8220;cut&#8208;to&#8208;fuse&#8221; strategy enables the reconstructive synthesis of valuable fused heterocycles from relatively simple cyclohexadiones.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective One&#8208;pot Double Cascade Hybrid Formation/[3+3] Spirocyclization for the Synthesis of 3&#8208;Spiropiperidines Under Phase Transfer Conditions</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report an efficient approach to synthesizing hybrid 3&#8208;spiropiperidine heterocycles that incorporate both 3&#8208;isochromanone and 3&#8208;isoindolinone units through a one&#8208;pot, double cascade reaction facilitated by an economical K2CO3/TBAB catalytic system. By examining the nucleophilicity of the lactone 3&#8208;isochromanone, we developed a cascade reaction pathway that first generates a bi&#8208;nucleophilic hybrid intermediate, which then undergoes [3+3] spirocyclization with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The regioselectivity of the spirocyclization strongly depends on the substitution pattern of lactam ring.The process exhibits high diastereoselectivity, even with the formation of three or four stereocenters, including two contiguous tetra&#8208;substituted carbons. These sequential cascade reactions were successfully scaled up, and the subsequent reactivity was readily analyzed, enabling the transformation of existing functional groups into valuable new functionalities.

Abstract
An electrochemical cascade radical cyclization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl indoles with sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate as a coupling partner has been explored, which afforded the unexpected bis&#8208;trifluoromethylated indole[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines as products. Experimental results and DFT calculations disclose that this reaction involves trifluoromethylation&#8208;triggered cyclization and the second trifluoromethylation as the key steps. This strategy does not need any transition&#8208;metal catalysts or oxidants with a readily available trifluoromethylating reagent enabling facile synthesis of bis&#8208;trifluoromethylated indole&#8208;fused tricycles.

Abstract
The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring represents an attractive yet challenging synthetic targets in the field of organic synthesis, especially in a stereocontrolled fashion. Over the past two decades, organocatalysis has emerged as an enabling technology for the facile construction of enantioenriched molecules with remarkably increasing complexity and diversity, and a myriad of chiral architectures containing bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane units were elegantly assembled through organocatalytic asymmetric transformations. This review summarizes recent advancements on this topic (mainly from 2010&#8211;2023), emphasizing the reaction types such as desymmetrization and cascade reactions of different prochiral starting materials toward various chiral bicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes as well as their aza, oxa and thio derivatives. Meanwhile, the synthetic strategy, reaction mechanism, substrate scope and synthetic applications of these catalytic reactions are also discussed. We hope that this review will motivate further development and application of organocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane frameworks.

Abstract
Herein we present a method for base&#8208;mediated sequential annulation reaction of conjugated dienes. The method offers an efficient pathway for the effective construction of bicyclo[4.1.0]heptenes. Notable features of this approach include good yields, remarkable stereoselectivity, as well as a broad substrate scope and significant step efficiency. In addition, the reaction could be effectively scaled up to a gram scale under standard condition.

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Benzo[f]chromanes and Hydroxyalkyl Naphthols: Catalytic Coupling of Naphthols and Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Catalytic dearomatization of arenols is an uphill task that can serve as a powerful method to construct C&#8722;C bonds with unsaturated coupling partners. Herein, a simple and efficient strategy for coupling naphthols with allylic alcohols is reported. A single Ru(II) pincer catalyzed coupling of naphthols with primary allylic alcohols led to the formation of benzo(f)chromanes, whereas the use of secondary alcohols delivered the hydroxyalkyl naphthols. Broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance are demonstrated. Notably, a high diastereoselectivity is attained on chromanes. Hydroxyalkyl naphthols are synthetically transformed into spiroethers, and dearomative bromination is achieved on chromanes. Mechanistic studies revealed the involvement of tandem reactions, a formal O&#8722;H bond activation of allylic alcohols by an active catalyst via amine&#8208;amide metal&#8208;ligand cooperation provided &#945;&#8208;&#946;, unsaturated carbonyl intermediates, which further underwent 1,4 conjugate addition with dearomatized naphthols. One of the crucial intermediates, naphthyl radical, is elucidated by EPR studies and trapped using a radical scavenger. Liberated hydrogen and water molecules are the only byproducts in these transformations.

Abstract
Here, we present 3,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2,5,6&#8208;trifluorophenyl glycosides as bench&#8208;stable, and reactive electron&#8208;deficient fluoroarene based glycosyl donors that can be prepared in one&#8208;step and be activated with catalytic amounts of TMSOTf. The glycosylation reaction conditions show tolerance towards acid/base sensitive protecting groups and have a different substrate scope with 68&#8211;89% yields. The electron&#8208;deficient fluoroarene&#8208;containing glycosyl donor enables the construction of O&#8208; and C&#8208;glycosides using both free alcohols and silylated alcohols, as well as C&#8208; nucleophiles as acceptors.

         <title>Modular Chiral Bithiophene&#8208;2NO Ligands: Synthesis and Application in Asymmetric Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalysed Friedel&#8208;Crafts Alkylation</title>

Abstract
The development of privileged thiophene&#8208;type ligand remains highly desirable, owing to the high coordination ability of sulfur atom to most of the soft metals. Herein, a new class of C2&#8208;symmetric rigid chiral tertiary amine&#8208;derived dioxide ligands with a coordinating bithiophene bridge was developed in a convenient synthetic route with 25&#8211;62% overall yields. The bithiophene&#8208;2NO&#8208;palladium(II) catalyst system was generated in&#8197;situ and found to be highly capable catalyst in the asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of indoles. Excellent yields (up to 92%) and high enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99% ee) are obtained for a wide range of substrates under mild conditions. Control experiments and DFT calculations revealed the origins of the enantioselectivity. This represented the first example of chiral thiophene ligands coordinating with soft metal Pd(II) in the asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation. Experiments revealed that the counteranion is involved in the stereoselectivity&#8208;determining step in this soft palladium(II) catalysis, and the additional NO and thiophene in ligands can act as the second chelation site and thus reduce the amount of free metal ions for suppressing background reaction in the catalytic system.

Abstract
We describe a selective preparation of a variety of functionalized pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;c]tetrahydroquinolines and indolo[3,2&#8208;c]tetrahydroquinolines in 40&#8211;82% and 40&#8211;80% yields from alkynyl&#8208;tethered oximes with diaryliodonium triflates, respectively. The one&#8208;pot reaction underwent N&#8208;arylation, intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition, selective [1.3] or [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement of N&#8722;O bond in total three steps. Experimental studies revealed that EtOAc solvent and copper(II)&#8208;catalyst played crucial roles on the formation of these two tetrahydroquinoline scaffolds. Moreover, these two tetrahydroquinoline scaffolds could be converted into various tetrahydroquinoline building blocks by further transformations.

Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed methodology for regioselective cycloisomerization and tandem Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of 1,7&#8208;enynes has been described, enabling the synthesis of diverse polycyclic heterocycles with four stereocenters. This stereoselective protocol demonstrates compatibility with various substituted enynes and alkenes, yielding products in 46&#8211;90% yield while tolerating a wide range of functional groups, including esters, ketones, and halides. Notably, the reaction with naphthoquinones retains the moiety in the final product, which acts as essential core structures in various natural products and bioactive compounds.

Abstract
Quinoxaline is a chemical moiety known for its diverse physicochemical and biological properties, making it the focus of extensive research. Over the past few decades, quinoxaline scaffolds have been utilized in the design and development of various bioactive molecules, dyes, fluorescent materials, electroluminescent materials, organic sensitizers for solar cells, and polymeric optoelectronic materials. Herein, we present a metal&#8208;free and rapid protocol for the phosphorylation of quinoxalines and quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one. This method employs oxygen as an oxidant under ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, with experimental evidence indicating the absence of radical involvement. Our methodology provides range of phosphorylated quinoxalines and quinoxaline&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one in yields ranging from 47% to 99%.

Abstract
We present a novel and highly efficient method for synthesizing polyfunctionalized 1,2,4&#8208;triazoles. This approach leverages visible light and arylazo sulfones in combination with N&#8208;vinyl amides, in the environmentally friendly solvent ethyl acetate. Remarkably, the reaction proceeds without the need for (photo)catalysts, ensuring near&#8208;perfect atom economy and producing only water as a by&#8208;product. This method exhibits excellent functional group tolerance and can be scaled for both batch and continuous&#8208;flow processes.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Cascade Trifluoromethylation of Dienes and Enynes Using a Perylene Diimide (PDI) Organophotocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The perylene diimide (PDI) is an underexplored synthetic organic dye with significant potential in photoredox catalysis. We have developed a good chemo&#8208; and regioselective, atom&#8208;economical methodology for synthesizing trifluoroethylated saturated heterocyclic derivatives and trifluoroethyl&#8208;containing cyclobutane derivatives. This process involves the generation of trifluoromethyl radical from the Langlois (CF3SO2Na) reagent under photoredox conditions, which selectively reacts with the electron&#8208;rich terminal double/triple bonds in the diene/enyne framework. The resulting intermediate undergoes a cascade cyclization, yielding the desired compounds in a redox&#8208;neutral manner. Our methodology operates under very mild conditions, eliminating the need for transition metals and external oxidizing agents. It is broadly applicable across various substrates and is supported by comprehensive mechanistic insights from regular photophysical experiments.

         <title>Sulfur (VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) via Glass&#8211;Assisted Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An environmentally benign route for the synthesis of sulfonamides via Sulfur (VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) chemistry utilizing N&#8208;methylimidazole, that simultaneously act as a base, precatalyst, HF by&#8208;product scavenger, as well as solvent, is described. This one&#8208;step sulfonamide synthesis exhibits excellent reactivity toward highly electron&#8208;deficient and less nucleophilic anilines as well as aminopyridines while tolerating a wide range of functional groups. In addition to the desired sulfonamide target, we also isolated an ionic salt as the sole side product from the reaction mixture that has been identified as bis[1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;3&#8208;ium] hexafluorosilicate (IV). The glass surface of reaction vessel is acting as the source of silicon present in the isolated side product. Formation of hexafluorosilicate salt is also facilitating the consumption of sulfonyl fluoride for sulfonamide synthesis. Optimization of the reaction under various conditions, as well as the isolation of the bis[1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;3&#8208;ium] hexafluorosilicate (IV) salt, highlight the crucial role of N&#8208;methylimidazole and support the glass&#8208;assisted approach. Besides the first example of glass&#8211;assisted SuFEx catalyzed by benign organic bases, this reaction also offers an alternative route for accessing protic hexafluorosilicate&#8208;based molten salts without employing external HF. The synthetic utility of this SuFEx route for late&#8208;stage functionalization is also demonstrated.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed carbo&#8208;/protoboration of boryl enynes is disclosed, providing access to an array of penta&#8208; and hexasubstituted diboryl dienes in a chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner. All six positions of the dienes can be manipulated using this methodology. The hexasubstituted diene boronates adopt a skew conformation. An iterative Suzuki coupling of the products provided highly conjugated trienes and tetraenes.

Abstract
We have developed a synthesis for tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines involving cascade sigmatropic rearrangements. The substrates were conveniently prepared from parent anilines via a [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement and cyanomethylation. Silver&#8208;mediated decyanation afforded the corresponding iminium cation, which underwent a cascade consisting of an aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement, an aza&#8208;oxa&#8208;Cope rearrangement, an aromatization, and a Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction, and tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines were obtained as the single product. The reaction involved seven bond scissions and four bond formations and was triggered by a single reagent.

Abstract
Herein, an electroreductive aryl radical enabled 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization of N&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;halobenzamides is presented, providing a convenient route for the synthesis of a variety of 3&#8208;iminoisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones in 30&#8211;75% yields. Simply by employing zinc plate instead of graphite rod anode, the products of the electrosynthesis are switched to diverse 3&#8208;aminoisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones through aryl&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization and subsequent reductive hydrogenation. Furthermore, this anode material determined divergent 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization features mild electrochemical conditions, excellent substrate scopes, and good functional group tolerance.

         <title>Construction of &#945;&#8208;Ketoamides via Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8722;H Insertion of Amines by Sulfoxonium Ylides</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report the development of photoredox&#8208;catalyzed N&#8722;H insertion of sulfoxonium ylides with amines via oxidative single&#8208;electron transfer (SET). These reactions exhibit broad substrate scope (32 examples) and offer operationally simple, scalable procedures for accessing &#945;&#8208;ketoamides in a single step. Mechanistic studies and control experiments confirm the participation of a photogenerated carbon radical in facilitating the oxidative single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) from the sulfoxonium ylides to initiate the reaction.

         <title>Selective 1,2&#8208;Carboimination of Isothiocyanates to Access S&#8208;Substituted Isothioureas via Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we introduce a novel method for the synthesis of S&#8208;substituted isothiourea compounds via the selective 1,2&#8208;carboimination between oxime esters as bifunctional reagents and the C=S bond of isothiocyanates under visible&#8208;light catalysis. This approach deviates from conventional methods by precisely modulating the substrate electronics to selectively functionalize the C=S bond of isothiocyanates over the C=N bond, eliminating the need for strong bases and high temperatures and bypassing the formation of thiourea intermediates. Consequently, this protocol enables the efficient one&#8208;step synthesis of S&#8208;alkyl isothioureas, with featuring mild reaction conditions, operational simplicity and broad substrate scope.

Abstract
Benzylidene imidazolones with an ortho&#8208;sec&#8208;amino group undergo chemodivergent photochemical transformations, based on the wavelength of irradiation. Irradiation at 525&#8197;nm causes dimerization and the formation of cyclobutanes with two spiroatoms, related to dictazoles in 87&#8211;98% yield. In turn, irradiation at 365&#8197;nm provides access to spirocyclic indolines in 67&#8211;92% yield. Each of the processes proceeds with exclusive atom economy and chemoselectivity.

Abstract
A concise and practical sustainable strategy for modular access to isoquinoline&#8208;fused benzo[f][1,3]oxazepine derivatives through a formal [4+3] annulation of commercially available salicyaldehydes with isoquinolinium salts has been developed. The reactions proceeded through the formation of two new bonds (C=C and C&#8722;O) and a seven&#8208;membered heterocyclic ring in one pot. Remarkably, use of simple NaHCO3 as a mild base, open atmosphere, nonhazardous reagents, nice functional group tolerance, and easily scale up are added characteristics to this approach. A wide range of substrates are compatible with this mild reaction system, thereby proving a facile and reliable protocol for constructing a benzo[f][1,3]oxazepine skeletons.

Abstract
Photochemical C&#8722;C coupling reactions can be tailored to industrial chemical processes and preparations of pharmaceuticals. Recent approaches in this area are limited to using precious transition metal coordination complexes that facilitate light absorption and redox processes with benchtop chemicals. Herein, we propose a paradigm that involves all&#8208;in&#8208;one organo&#8208;photo&#8208;auxiliaries, thio&#8208;heteroarenes, which exhibit unique photophysical properties. These thio&#8208;heteroarenes were employed to prepare several all&#8208;in&#8208;one ionic photo&#8208;salts from commercially available alkyl/benzyl and heterocyclic halides via aromaticity&#8208;mediated nucleophilic substitution reactions. From the library of &gt;30 salts, we performed on&#8208;demand photochemical C&#8722;C coupling reactions to isolate numerous symmetrical and unsymmetrical diary/alkyl&#8208;ethanes with yields up to 84% and mass balance as high as 96%. We also investigated the influence of structural features/properties on the outcomes of the photochemical C&#8722;C coupling reactions. The current photochemical C&#8722;C method was successful in the isolation of &gt;30 photoproducts, including the natural product Brittonin A, a precursor of Imipramine, and derivatives of the bioactive Honokiol Analogues. Furthermore, transient absorption spectroscopy and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations were used to decipher the nature of light&#8208;promoted electronic transitions.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Initiated Uranyl&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation and Hydrosulfonylation of Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
This study investigates the visible&#8208;light&#8208;initiated uranyl(VI)&#8208;catalyzed activation of Si&#8722;H bonds through direct hydrogen atom transfer, which facilitates the formation of silyl radicals from silanes. The silyl radical can abstract a chlorine atom from the sulfonyl chloride, leading to the generation of sulfonyl radicals. These silyl radicals and sulfonyl radicals could react with alkenes and alkynes, achieving the first example of uranyl&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation and hydrosulfonylation of unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds. This method features mild reaction conditions and a broad substrate scope, and exhibits exceptional functional&#8208;group tolerance. Consequently, it is suitable for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug derivatives.

         <title>Dual NHC/HAT&#8208;Promoted Esterification to Access &#945;&#8208;Aryl Glycines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Aryl glycines are among the most important carbonyl compounds, particularly as nonproteinogenic &#945;&#8208;amino acids present in many pharmacophores. As such, many strategies have been developed to access this motif, but direct carboxylation methods remain underdeveloped. Herein, we employ a dual NHC/HAT catalysis strategy to access 2&#8208;azaallyl radicals, which subsequently couple with in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated ester azolium radical intermediates. Base&#8208;mediated collapse of the ensuing tetrahedral intermediate liberates the NHC catalyst and benzophenone&#8208;protected aryl glycine. This methodology was employed to esterify a variety of aryl&#8208;substituted glycine derivatives, as well as allylic and benzylic sites. Mechanistic studies reveal that this radical process operates under both oxidative and reductive quenching cycles, while preliminary experiments employing a chiral NHC and Lewis acid additive demonstrate modest enantioselectivity.

Abstract
An efficient Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation/cyclization of 2&#8208;arylbenzimidazoles with CF3&#8208;imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides has been achieved, yielding diverse CF3&#8722; and amino&#8208;disubstituted 5,6&#8208;dihydrobenzoimidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines, which could undergo a deaminative hydroxylation to access CF3&#8722; and hydroxy&#8208;disubstituted 5,6&#8208;dihydrobenzoimidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines catalyzed by Sc(OTf)3. This developed strategy features easily available starting materials, broad substrate scope, good scalability and high efficiency. Moreover, the antitumor activities of selected products against some human cancer cell lines were also investigated, and the results indicated that several products show antiproliferative activities.

Abstract
The asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of 3&#8208;substituted 2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazines with an azeotropic mixture of HCO2H/NEt3 (5/2) using tethered Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;diamine catalysis has been realized. This process allows access to a broad range of chiral 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazines in high yields with up to 99% ee, and tolerates a variety of functional groups. The enantiocontrol is achieved by the judicious choice of catalyst and hydrogen source. This reaction proceeds with unexpected reversal of enantioselectivity, which is attributed to the acidic reaction conditions and the hydrogen bond between the N&#8722;H of the rhodium species and the O atom in the substrate.

Abstract
The C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization via intramolecular hydride transfer initiated cascade annulation for the synthesis of spiro&#8208;fused succinimide&#8208;containing tetrahydroquinolines induced by iminium intermediates is described. A series of diastereoselective 2,7&#8208;diazaspiro[4.5]decanes&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones were achieved using ortho&#8208;amino&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;succinimide using Lewis acid catalysis. This scandium triflate Sc(OTf)3 catalysed, oxidant&#8208;free protocol leads to the diastereoselective synthesis of a class of 2,7&#8208;diazaspiro[4.5]decanes&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones derivatives with 48&#8211;98% yield in a single step.

A series of diastereoselective 2,7-diazaspiro[4.5]decanes-1,3-diones were achieved using &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-amino-benzylidene-succinimide using Lewis acid catalysis. This scandium triflate Sc(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalysed, oxidant-free protocol leads to the diastereoselective synthesis of a class of 2,7-diazaspiro[4.5]decanes-1,3-diones derivatives with 48&#8211;98% yield in a single step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Generation of Sulfamoyl Radicals via Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Fixation of Sulfur Dioxide for the Synthesis of Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Herein, we report a new approach for the light&#8208;mediated generation of sulfamoyl radicals using sulfur dioxide as key building block and the direct application of these radicals in the synthesis of sulfonamides. In the presence of different photoredox catalysts, sulfamoyl radicals can be generated directly from SO2 or the SO2 surrogate DABSO (1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane&#8901;bis (sulfur dioxide) adduct) and N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts as nitrogen radical precursors. Trapping of the in&#8197;situ generated sulfamoyl radicals with selected electron&#8208;rich olefins affords different sulfonamides in up to 86% yield in a three&#8208;component procedure. This transformation provides a complementary approach for the in&#8197;situ generation of sulfamoyl radicals as synthetic intermediates for the assembly of the sulfonamide functionality, a privileged motif in active pharmaceutical ingredients.

         <title>Methodology to Control the Regioselective Installation of a Carboxylic Acid for the Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Diarylpropionic Acids</title>

Abstract
A stepwise copper&#8208;catalyzed boracarboxylation then palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling methodology was developed to access 2,3&#8208;diarylpropionic acid derivatives regioselectively by pre&#8208;setting the position of the carboxylic acid in the boracarboxylation reaction. This method provides access to a wide range of aryl and heteroaryl products in up to 80% isolated yield. Pharmaceutical potential was demonstrated by synthesizing a glucagon receptor antagonist drug in three steps (31% overall yield) from commercially available 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylstyrene.

         <title>Unsupported Nanoporous Copper Catalyzed Insertion of Carbenes from &#945;&#8208;Diazo Compounds into Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The insertion of diazo carbene into Si&#8722;H bonds with unsupported nanoporous copper (CuNPore) catalyst has been developed. &#945;&#8208;Aryl diazoesters, diazophosphonates, and unstable aryl diazoalkyls can be used as carbene precursors to exquisitely insert into the Si&#8722;H bond of silanes. A variety of &#945;&#8208;silylesters, silylphosphonate, and functionalized arylsilane were obtained in 35&#8211;82% yields. The reusability feature of the CuNPore catalyst for this insertion reaction demonstrated its high heterogeneous catalytic activity and practicality. Further, mechanistic studies revealed that the insertion of carbene from diazo compounds into the Si&#8722;H bond may include a three&#8208;center concerted transition state on CuNPore.

         <title>Trifluoroacetic Acid Promotes Umpolung of 2&#8208;Methylindole to Achieve C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An umpolung strategy for the C(sp3)&#8722;H aminomethylation of 2&#8208;methylindole has been developed using trifluoroacetic acid to induce the transformation, with aminals serving as precursors of iminium ion. Mechanistic studies have clearly shown that trifluoroacetic acid may play a pivotal role in this strategy. The utilization of readily available starting materials, mild reaction conditions, tolerance to complex functional groups, combine with yields of up to 98% and potential biological applications render this protocol applicable and useful for organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A series of 4&#8208;sulfoximinocyclopent&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones was prepared in 35 to 99% yield through a calcium(II)&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;Piancatelli reaction, including in enantioenriched form. Depending on their substitution pattern, diverse diastereoselective chemical transformations can be applied to these scaffolds, allowing access to cyclopentane derivatives. This study opens synthetic routes to cyclopentane&#8208;based scaffolds and also paves the way for the exploration of the associated chemical space in drug discovery.

         <title>Dual Lewis Acid Promoted/Visible Light Driven Preparation of Aryl Diazenyl Oxazoles from Isocyanoacetamides and Arylazo Sulfones</title>

Abstract
While arylazo sulfones have been widely applied as arylating agents, their exploitation for diazenylation reactions has been previously limited to electron&#8208;rich alkenes such as styrenes and silyl enol ethers. Herein we optimized a synthetic one&#8208;pot protocol to access oxazolyl azo compounds via a selective domino ring&#8208;closing/aryldiazenylation sequence by starting from arylazo sulfones and isocyanoacetamides in the presence of Sm(OTf)3 as the Lewis acid. The substrate scope, along with scale&#8208;up reaction both in batch and under continuous flow conditions provide a valuable approach to such a class of heteroaryl azo compounds.

         <dc:description>The copper powder&#8208;mediated tandem hydroamination cyclization&#8208;hydrocyanation of alkyne&#8208;tethered ketoximes is described by using TMSCN as the commercially available cyanating reagent. This methodology provides an alternative strategy for the synthesis of a series of structurally important cyano&#8208;substituted cyclic nitrones. The hydrocyanation process exhibits distinct regioselectivity depending on the substituent pattern of the alkyne moiety. Moreover, the synthesized products were shown to be capable of undergoing various derivatization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>PTC in the polyenolate&#8208;mediated [10+2]&#8208;cycloaddition for the synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acid precursors</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. The manuscript describes a formal [10+2] higher&#8208;order cycloaddition between 2&#8208;benzylideneindan&#8208;1&#8208;ones and &#945;&#8208;alkilidene azlactones as higherene precursors and  higherenofiles respectively. The reaction is realized under Br&#248;nsted&#8208;base catalysis utilizing the phase transfer catalysis approach. The key intermediate is an isobenzofulvene&#8208;derived polyenolate which acts as a 10&#8208;electron component in the higher&#8208;order cycloaddition. By using this strategy, a series of structurally diverse compounds containing a polycyclic hydrocarbon scaffold was prepared in 79&#8208;99% yields. In addition, the potential of the obtained [10+2]&#8208;cycloadducts has been confirmed by transformations, including the synthesis of a highly&#8208;valuable alpha,alpha&#8208;disubstituted N&#8208;protected alpha&#8208;aminoester.</dc:description>
