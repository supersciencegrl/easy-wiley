      <title>Recent Developments in Photo&#8208;Catalyzed/Promoted Synthesis of Indoles and Their Functionalization: Reactions and Mechanisms</title>
      <dc:description>The use of clean and renewable light sources is increasingly common in organic synthesis due to its safety, practicality and economy. Recently, photoredox catalysis has shown great application values in organic transformations because of its advantages of environmentally friendly and abundant resources. Indoles and their derivatives (indolines, oxindoles and isatins) are the core skeletons of some important organic compounds and widely&#8208;present in various natural products and pharmaceuticals with different biological activities. Therefore, the research on the synthesis and modification of indoles is particularly important for chemists and pharmacologists. This review summarizes the effects of photocatalysis on indoles synthesis and modification in recent decades. These transformations are	accomplished by using metal photocatalysts (i.e., Ir, Ru, Ni, Cu, Fe, Au, Rh, TiO2, etc.) or non&#8208;metallic photocatalysts (i.e., Rose Bengal, Eosin Y, quinones, naphthols, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, carbazoles, pyrylium salts, etc.), or without the need of photocatalysts. The detailed mechanisms of these photo&#8208;catalyzed/promoted organic reactions are also highlighted deeply. And we hope this review will be helpful to researchers interested in this promising field of photocatalyzed transformations.</dc:description>

      <title>Organocatalytic Remote Asymmetric Inverse&#8208;Electron&#8208;Demand Oxa&#8208;Diels&#8722;Alder Reaction of Allyl Ketones with Isatin&#8208;Derived Unsaturated Keto Esters</title>
      <dc:description>A remote cascade asymmetric inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand oxa&#8208;Diels&#8722;Alder reaction of allyl ketones with isatin&#8208;derived &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;keto esters has been developed in the presence of a chiral bifunctional squaramide catalyst. Taking advantage of the secondary amide activating group, a series of enantioenriched 3,4&#8217;&#8208;pyranyl spirooxindole derivatives bearing three contiguous chiral centers were attained in high yields (84 to &gt;99%) with excellent enantioselectivity (96&#8722;99% ee). Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and the construction of 1&#8208;benzazepine scaffold by the product were also demonstrated.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A remote cascade asymmetric inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand oxa&#8208;Diels&#8722;Alder reaction of allyl ketones with isatin&#8208;derived &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;keto esters has been developed in the presence of a chiral bifunctional squaramide catalyst. Taking advantage of the secondary amide activating group, a series of enantioenriched 3,4&#8217;&#8208;pyranyl spirooxindole derivatives bearing three contiguous chiral centers were attained in high yields (84 to &amp;gt;99%) with excellent enantioselectivity (96&#8722;99% ee). Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and the construction of 1&#8208;benzazepine scaffold by the product were also demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>For the first time, an &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221; protocol has been developed for the synthesis of combretastatin A&#8208;4 (CA&#8208;4) analogues by cyclization of polarized triaryldivinyl ketones using hydrochloric acid as a promoter in 45&#8208;95% yields. The reaction time was reduced by about 30 times due to ultrasonic irradiation at ambient temperature. The other advantages of this new method are operational simplicity, easy workup, no column purification and applicability on a gram&#8208;scale.

      <title>Recent Advances in Asymmetric Organomulticatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Asymmetric multi&#8208;catalysis, designed to mimic catalytic processes in nature, is a powerful instrument to fulfil fascinating transformations. As a result, this area of research has attracted considerable interests within chemistry communities. Although there are numerous reviews involving multi&#8208;catalysis, reviews describing asymmetric organomulticatalysis remain rare. Taking into consideration that organocatalysts possess the superiorities of effortless availability, inexpensiveness, hypotoxicity, facile handling and hyposensitivity to moisture and oxygen, they have definite advantage in their own distinct modes of activation when utilized in multi&#8208;catalytic reactions. Organomulticatalysis refers to the synthetic strategies of modular combination of organo&#8208;catalyzed reactions into one synthetic operation with minimum workup or change in conditions. It is apparent that a variety reports utilizing the concept of enantioselective organomulticatalysis have substantially surfaced in the past few years. Hence, it is indispensable to succinctly present all such reports by means of disclosing the mechanistic analysis, as well as the challenges and issues associated in the development of the asymmetric catalytic system. Additionally, this review will introduce some of the unsettled conundrums and possible innovations in this field.</dc:description>

As a result, this area of research has attracted considerable interests within chemistry communities. Although there are numerous reviews involving multi&#8208;catalysis, reviews describing asymmetric organomulticatalysis remain rare. Taking into consideration that organocatalysts possess the superiorities of effortless availability, inexpensiveness, hypotoxicity, facile handling and hyposensitivity to moisture and oxygen, they have definite advantage in their own distinct modes of activation when utilized in multi&#8208;catalytic reactions. Organomulticatalysis refers to the synthetic strategies of modular combination of organo&#8208;catalyzed reactions into one synthetic operation with minimum workup or change in conditions. It is apparent that a variety reports utilizing the concept of enantioselective organomulticatalysis have substantially surfaced in the past few years. Hence, it is indispensable to succinctly present all such reports by means of disclosing the mechanistic analysis, as well as the challenges and issues associated in the development of the asymmetric catalytic system. Additionally, this review will introduce some of the unsettled conundrums and possible innovations in this field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Kinetic Resolution of &#945;&#8208;Silyl&#8208;Substituted Allylboronate Esters via Chemo&#8208; and Stereoselective Allylboration of Aldehydes</title>
      <dc:description>We describe kinetic resolution of &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;allylboronate esters via chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed highly chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective allylboration of aldehydes.

We propose that the reaction proceeds via a closed chair&#8208;like transition state with the silane moiety occupying the pseudo&#8208;axial position, thus readily resolving &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;allylboronate esters.

      <title>Methyl Radical Initiated Kharasch and Related Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>An improved procedure to run halogen atom and related chalcogen group transfer radical additions is reported. The procedure relies on the thermal decomposition of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylhyponitrite (DTBHN), a safer alternative to the explosive diacetyl peroxide, to produce highly reactive methyl radicals that can initiate the chain process. This mode of initiation generates byproducts that are either gaseous (N2) or volatile (acetone and methyl halide) thereby facilitating greatly product purification by either flash column chromatography or distillation. In addition, remarkably simple and mild reaction conditions (refluxing EtOAc during 30 minutes under normal atmosphere) and a low excess of the radical precursor reagent (2.0 equivalents) make this protocol particularly attractive for preparative synthetic applications. This initiation procedure has been demonstrated with a broad scope since it works efficiently to add a range of electrophilic radicals generated from iodides, bromides, selenides and xanthates over a range of unactivated terminal alkenes. A diverse set of radical trap substrates exemplifies a broad functional group tolerance. Finally, di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxyoxalate (DTBPO) is also demonstrated as alternative source of tert&#8208;butoxyl radicals to initiate these reactions under identical conditions which gives gaseous byproducts (CO2).</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An efficient novel transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free photo&#8208;induced cascade sulfonylation/addition/cyclization of 3&#8208;arylethynyl&#8208;[1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;carbonitriles with Na2S2O5 and aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates for the construction of 4&#8208;sulfonated cyclopenta[gh]phenanthridines is develo&#8208;ped. This reaction involves a radical pathway and goes through a sequence of phenyl radical formation, sulfur dioxide insertion, sulfonyl radical addition, iminyl radical formation, and cyclization. The methodology displays mild conditions, a broad substrate scope and does not require any external oxidants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Application of Conjugated Carbonyls in the Synthesis of Heterocycles via Oxidative Cycloaddition and Cyclization Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Synthesis of pharmaceutically active heterocycles is always appealing as the majority of the widely used drugs contain heterocyclic moieties as their core structure. So, the straightforward construction of heterocycles from readily available/accessible reagents is one of the prime targets of the synthetic chemists. In this context, C&#8208;H functionalization has emerged as an effective tool for the designing and synthesis of various heterocyclic moieties as it offers a straight&#8208;forward and step&#8208;economic pathway.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synthesis of pharmaceutically active heterocycles is always appealing as the majority of the widely used drugs contain heterocyclic moieties as their core structure. So, the straightforward construction of heterocycles from readily available/accessible reagents is one of the prime targets of the synthetic chemists. In this context, C&#8208;H functionalization has emerged as an effective tool for the designing and synthesis of various heterocyclic moieties as it offers a straight&#8208;forward and step&#8208;economic pathway. On the other hand, the readily available/accessible conjugated carbonyls are well&#8208;known reagents for the construction of carbocycles and heterocycles over the years. However, the employment of C&#8208;H functionalization of the two C&#8208;H bond of the conjugated alkene in carbocycle/heterocycle synthesis was not so explored. In the last decade, much focus has been paid 	on the synthesis of various pharmaceutically active heterocycles through C&#8208;H bond functionalization of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes/ketones.

      <title>Benzylpalladium Intermediates: Unique and Versatile Reactive Intermediates for Aromatic Functionalization</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract: Aromatic functionalizations are of current interest and importance in organic chemistry, recent transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reactions can transform inert C&#8211;H bond into C&#8211;X (X = C, O, N, etc.) bonds, greatly enriching aromatic chemistry and related fields. Some well known palladium&#8211;containing intermediates such as palladacycles and allylpalladium intermediates play an important role in organic conversions. Similar with allyl group, benzyl group also possesses the capability of stabilizing palladium through &#951;3&#8208;binding. In the process of the formation of benzyl palladium intermediate, there is a transition state of dearomatization. Therefore, it is a challenging and meaningful research topic to seize these aromatic destruction intermediates, realize selective functionalization reaction on 	aromatic ring via them, and inhibit the formation of traditional benzylated products. Herein, we summarized the recent efforts on expanding the synthetic utility, as well as exploring the mechanism in aromatic functionalization via reactive benzyl palladium intermediates. We envision that the transformation via benzyl palladium intermediates will help promote the development in the &#64257;eld of palladium&#8211;catalyzed aromatic regioselective functionalization.</dc:description>

      <title>A3 Coupling Reaction in the Synthesis of Heterocyclic Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>In recent years, the transition&#8208;metal catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of an aldehyde, an alkyne and an amine, commonly called A3 coupling have become a powerful tool in organic synthesis. The aim of this review is to give a general overview of A3 coupling utility in synthesis of heterocycles, highlighting the variety of compounds that can be directly accessed from single reactions. The diverse A3 coupling based methodologies that have been developed for the synthesis of N,O,S&#8208;heterocycles are presented, emphasizing the influence of the reaction conditions and the use of additional reagents in the outcome of the transformations.</dc:description>

      <title>Asymmetric Fluorination Reactions Promoted by Chiral Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Based Organocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Fluorinated compounds can exhibit interesting biological properties. The importance of these species has made that the chemistry of fluorine has experienced a great development. On this review, the recent advances on asymmetric fluorination reactions promoted by chiral hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;based organocatalysts are discussed. Hence, examples using phosphoric acid, carboxylic acid, (thio)urea and squaramide derivatives are illustrated. The growth of this field is amazing. We have only considered pivotal works in which direct fluorination takes place using a fluorinating agent, leaving aside the reactions where a fluorine atom is incorporated from the beginning as part of other reactants.
Herein, the scarce existing examples on this field of research have been compiled</dc:description>

      <title>Propargylic Alcohols as Coupling Partners in Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Arene C&#8208;H Activation</title>
      <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed site selective arene C&#8208;H bond activation concomitant functionalization with various coupling partners gain magnificent attraction in synthetic organic chemistry as complementary to traditional transformations. Mechanistically, these C&#8208;H functionalization approaches involve directing group assisted concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation (CMD), migratory insertion, and reductive elimination sequences. In this realm, diverse categories of coupling partners were employed as C&#8208;H functionalization buddies. Particularly alkynes gain enormous  attention as annulating agents. These units coordinates with metalcycle through &#7467;&#8208;interaction produce annulation outcomes in a straightforward manner.
Very recently, propargylic alcohols were appointed as valuable archetypes in arene C&#8208;H activation armoury, as they have shown regio&#8208; and chemoselective migratory insertion into primary metalcycle species via hydroxy chelation. The influential regioselectivity was drawn by dual coordination of metal complexes with the pendent directing group and a propargylic hydroxyl group. In this review, we focused on annulations and functionalization of arenes and propargylic alcohols, which afford intricate cycles as well as complex acyclic motifs in a trouble&#8208;free manner. We categorized these transformations based on number of atoms  of propargylic alcohols involved in annulation along with some addition reactions. We anticipate to pave a way towards enhanced endeavours for discovering novel reaction avenues.</dc:description>

      <title>Stereospecific Synthesis of Glycoside Mimics Through Migita&#8211;Kosugi&#8211;Stille Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of Chemically and Configurationally Stable 1&#8208;C&#8208;Tributylstannyl Iminosugars</title>
      <dc:description>A process for the de novo synthesis of imino&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides is described. The methodology is based on the reaction of 1&#8208;C&#8208;stannylated iminosugars with various electrophiles under the conditions of Migita&#8211;Kosugi&#8211;Stille cross&#8208;couplings, which gives 1&#8208;C&#8208;substituted iminosugar derivatives in a stereoretentive process. The required iminoglycosyl stannanes are obtained by way of the highly stereoselective addition of tributylstannyllithium to (SR)&#8208; or (SS)&#8208;N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl glycosylamines, followed by an activation cyclization sequence.	Most interestingly, the methodology is tunable: the configuration of the tin adduct is controlled exclusively by the tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl auxiliary, thus giving access after ring formation to &#8216;&#945;&#8217;&#8208;configured or &#8216;&#946;&#8217;&#8208;configured iminoglycosyl stannanes.
