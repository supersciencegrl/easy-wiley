         <title>Oxidative Cyclization of Aryl Ynones with NaNO2 for the Divergent Synthesis of NO2&#8208;Containing Spiro[5.5]trienones, Indenones and Thioflavones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A K2S2O8&#8208;promoted nitration/spirocyclization of biaryl ynones using inexpensive NaNO2 as nitro source has been described. This cascade reaction is triggered by nitration of alkyne and followed by 6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig spirocyclization, dearomatization, forming the NO2&#8208;containing spiro[5.5]trienones in 63&#8211;85% yields. The present reaction also provides a practical method for the synthesis of nitrated indenones and thioflavones with 58&#8211;85% yields.

Abstract
Lewis base and Br&#248;nsted base controlled chemodivergent annulations of &#945;&#8208;methyl substituted allenyl imide and o&#8208;aminotrifluoroacetophenones are realized to afford highly valuable furo[3,2&#8208;b]indol&#8208;2&#8208;ones and dihydroquinolines bearing a CF3&#8208;substituted quaternary stereogenic center. The possible reaction mechanisms are proposed through deuterium labelling experiments. This work demonstrates the unprecedented dual reactivities of &#945;&#8208;methyl substituted allenyl imide with electrophilic&#8722;nucleophilic compounds in annulation reactions, and features chemodivergence in transforming allenyl imide through &#946;&#8217;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization via phosphine catalysis and &#946;/&#947;&#8208;bisfunctionalization via Br&#248;nsted base catalysis.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Oxyarylation/Hydroxylation of N&#8208;Alkoxypropiolamides for Chemoselective Synthesis of 4&#8208;Aryl&#8208;3&#8208;(2H)&#8208;isoxazolones</title>

Abstract
3&#8208;(2H)&#8208;isoxazolone is an important skeletal structure in medicinal and agricultural chemistry. However, its synthetic methodology has limited substrate scope and requires unconventional substrate synthesis. Meanwhile, gold&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular oxidative cross&#8208;coupling involving the 5/6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of substrates bearing an ynone structure has not been reported because of an undesirable protonation as a side&#8208;reaction. Thus, we hypothesized that the reactivity of cyclic N&#8208;alkoxypropiolamides would suppress protonation and allow dual functionalization. As a result, sequential gold&#8208;catalyzed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization, oxidative cross&#8208;coupling, and hydroxylation of N&#8208;alkoxypropiolamides was developed to synthesize 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;(2H)&#8208;isoxazolones with a hydroxy group. In an optimization study, dimethylformamide (DMF) and H2O were effective solvents for the sequential reaction. This method enabled 3&#8208;(2H)&#8208;isoxazolone backbone synthesis with the introduction of an aryl and hydroxy group in a single procedure. Moreover, a tolerance toward reactive functional groups, such as ketocarbonyl groups, was observed. Some chemical transformations of the synthesized 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;(2H)&#8208;isoxazolone were conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of functional group interconversion, C&#8722;C bond formation, and additional heterocycle synthesis. Notably, a fluorescent tetracyclic heterocycle was obtained by intramolecular oxidative cross&#8208;coupling. Control experiments indicated that the reactivity for protonation was suppressed by an alkoxyamide moiety. Therefore, the chemoselectivity of oxyarylation was improved. Finally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to estimate the reaction pathway, which suggested that ring&#8208;opening involving solvents (H2O or DMF) is important for these sequential reactions.

Abstract
Benzannulation and N&#8208;annulation of &#946;&#8208;ketoenamines by the in&#8208;situ generated methyl(methylene)sulfonium ion from the reaction of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane (DBE) was achieved. The &#946;&#8208;ketoenamines underwent N&#8208;annulation to pyridine derivatives, while the N&#8208;alkylated enamines were benzannulated to afford substituted anilines. The utility of the intermediate methyl(methylene)sulfonium ion was further extended for synthesizing methylene&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Oxygen Transfer to Alkynylsulfones: A Diazo&#8208;Free Route to 4&#8208;Sulfonyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;Oxazoles</title>

Abstract
The gold&#8208;catalyzed annulation of alkynylsulfones, involving pyridine N&#8208;oxides (as O&#8208;atom transfer reagents) and nitriles (as C=N synthons), comprises a diazo&#8208;free route to valuable 4&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazoles. This reaction operates under relatively mild conditions (IPrAuNTf2 5&#8197;mol&#8201;%, rt or 60&#8201;&#176;C), and a number of functionalities was compatible (35 examples; 14&#8211;95%). In most cases, the SO2 fragment, which is typically expulsed in the previously reported Au&#8208;catalyzed O&#8208;transfers to alkynylsulfones, retains in the heterocyclic products. The postulated reaction mechanism suggests a key role of reactive gold &#945;&#8208;oxo carbene intermediates formed via the O&#8208;atom transfer.

         <title>Filling the Gaps in the Challenging Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Exocyclic Benzofused Alkenes with Ir&#8722;P,N Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Herein, we report a chiral phosphine&#8208;triazole ligand for the Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of exocyclic benzofused alkenes. Overcoming previous limitations, the catalytic system is able to successfully hydrogenate exocyclic olefins bearing a benzofused five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered ring motif (ee's between 92 to 99%). The catalyst tolerates well the presence of several substituents and substitution patterns at both aromatic rings. The absence of a competing isomerization process together with the perfect fit of the olefins in the catalyst chiral pocket are key to surpass the previous limitations in the hydrogenation of both 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered ring benzofused exocyclic olefins.

         <title>Strecker Reactions of Formaldehyde with TMSCN, Catalyzed by TBAF and Formic Acid: N&#8208;Monocyanomethylation of Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A set of conditions for the Strecker reaction of formaldehyde, amines, and TMSCN that affords three&#8208;component coupling adducts as the major products is reported. HCOOH and TBAF are used as cocatalysts and the TMSCN functions as both cyanide source and protecting reagent for amines. As a result, the side reactions were suppressed efficiently and a broad range of aromatic and aliphatic amines were mono&#8208;cyanomethylated in 52&#8211;99% yield. Furthermore, this protocol was successfully applied toward the synthesis of meta&#8208;diamide insecticides.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrohydrazonemethylation of Styrenes: Access to Chiral Hydrazones, Hydrazides, Hydrazines and Amines.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates the variety of products accessible through the newly developed asymmetric hydrohydrazonemethylation (HHM). The devised hydroformylation/condensation sequence leads to stable and versatile &#947;&#8208;chiral N&#8217;&#8208;substituted aceto&#8208;hydrazones. They can be reduced in one&#8208;pot to the corresponding &#947;&#8208;chiral N&#8217;&#8208;substituted acetohydrazides, and after deprotection, to &#946;&#8208;chiral hydrazines. They can be also reduced and hydrogenolysed to the &#946;&#8208;chiral primary amines or serve as substrates for diastereoselective C&#8208;C coupling. The high enantioselectivity reached for all product types makes the molecular peacock proud of its pluridecorated tail. Details can be found in the communication by Franci&#242; and co&#8208;workers (M. N. Kliemann, S. Teeuwen, C. Weike, G. Franci&#242;, W. Leitner, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2022, 364, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202200804)

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Tricycle&#8208;Fused Dispirooxindoles via Organocatalyzed Three&#8208;Component Cascade Reactions of 2&#8208;Pyrones and Trifluoroethylisatin Ketimines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An asymmetric synthesis of a series of tricycle&#8208;fused dispirooxindoles frameworks assembled in different rings was disclosed via multicomponent cascade 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyrones and trifluoroethylisatin ketimines under the catalysis of hydroquinine or (DHQD)2PHAL with 61&#8208;&gt;99% ee and &gt;19:1 dr. Meanwhile, these potentially biologically important dispirooxindoles fused pyrrolidinyl/tetrahydropyranone/pyrrolidinyl frameworks bear eight contiguous stereocenters and functionalized pharmacophores which could further transfer to liner dispirooxindoles and spirooxindoles bearing epoxyethyl moiety with retentive enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction followed by dual annulation has been achieved for the synthesis of various triazolo/pyrrolo fused benzofuro&#8208;quinolines from readily available starting materials. This newly developed reaction proceeds through palladium&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling, benzannulation followed by C&#8208;H activation triggered second annulation reaction cascades in a single pot. In particular, the polycyclic compound formed by this method consists of three different heterocyclic structures: benzofuran, quinoline, and triazole/pyrrole. The method provides simple access to obtain the range of fused benzofurotriazalo/pyrrolo&#8208;quinolines in good to moderate yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Mn&#8208;Catalyzed Ring&#8208;Opening Peroxidation of Cyclobutanols: A Method for the Synthesis of 4&#8208;Oxo Peroxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A manganese&#8208;catalyzed regioselective ring&#8208;opening peroxidation of cyclobutanols has been disclosed. With this protocol, the C(sp3)&#8722;OOBu&#8208;t bond could be efficiently constructed via the radical&#8208;mediated C&#8722;C bond cleavage/coupling, allowing the facile access to a variety of 4&#8208;oxo peroxides. Besides, the obtained peroxidation products could be readily transformed into other synthetically attractive skeletons.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Bidirectional Access to Planar Heptacyclic Benzobispyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indoles and Benzobispyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]Quinolines for Materials Science</title>

Abstract
Our recently developed gold&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinolines was successfully expanded towards bidirectional approaches, enabling access to two heptacyclic structural motifs. In the case of benzobispyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indoles, previously inaccessible modifications of the only known representative were made possible. In addition, the synthesis of a new class of nitrogen&#8208;containing heptacycles &#8211; namely benzobispyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinolines &#8211; was achieved by applying alkynylated benzodipyrrole derivatives as starting materials. All new compounds alongside with their corresponding precursors were fully characterized and their properties were investigated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, photophysical measurements and computational methods. The study revealed important structure&#8208;effect relationships between the solid&#8208;state structures and the observed photophysical properties, e.&#8201;g. aggregation&#8208;induced emission and solid&#8208;state fluorescence.

         <title>Synthesis of Benzofurans from Sulfur Ylides and ortho&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;Functionalized Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The synthesis of benzofurans from readily accessible sulfur ylides and ortho&#8208;hydroxy aryl alkynes is reported. The transformation proceeds through an isomerization/nucleophilic addition/cyclization/aromatization cascade. The substrate scope is very general with respect to both reactants and the products are afforded in 43&#8211;94% yield under conditions which are catalyst&#8208;free and additive&#8208;free.

Abstract
We report herein a catalytic synthetic method for enantioenriched N&#8208;substituted pyridones. By employing chiral iridium catalyst generated from the Carreira [P/olefin] ligand, intermolecular asymmetric allylic amination of allyl alcohols with pyridones proceeded smoothly with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities (&gt;19:1 N/O, &gt;19:1 b/l and &#8805;89% ee). The reaction was a kinetic resolution process under mild conditions and displayed a broad substrate scope for both pyridones and allylic alcohols. The potential of this method was demonstrated by a gram&#8208;scale reaction with only 0.6&#8197;mol% catalyst loading and diverse transformations of the amination products to useful skeletons.

         <title>Dual Photoredox and Nickel Catalysed Reductive Coupling of Alkynes and Aldehydes</title>

Abstract
A regioselective vinylation of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes promoted by the merging of photoredox and nickel catalysis is here reported. A comprehensive investigation on the reaction conditions allowed the disclosure of a valid and reproducible protocol based on a nickel&#8208;mediated reductive coupling approach under visible light irradiation. The employment of 3CzClIPN (2,4,6&#8208;tris(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;5&#8208;chloro&#8208;isophthalonitrile) as the photocatalyst and Hantzsch's ester as the sacrificial organic reductant replace the use of boron&#8208;, silicon&#8208; or zinc&#8208;based reducing agents, making this method a worthy alternative to the already known protocols. The developed mild reaction conditions allow the access to a wide range of substituents decorating both the aldehyde and the alkyne. Moreover, careful photophysical investigations shed light on the mechanism of the reaction.

The employment of 3CzClIPN (2,4,6-tris(carbazol-9-yl)-5-chloro-isophthalonitrile) as the photocatalyst and Hantzsch's ester as the sacrificial organic reductant replace the use of boron-, silicon- or zinc-based reducing agents, making this method a worthy alternative to the already known protocols. The developed mild reaction conditions allow the access to a wide range of substituents decorating both the aldehyde and the alkyne. Moreover, careful photophysical investigations shed light on the mechanism of the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
A transition metal&#8208;free method for the cycloisomerization of propargylic amides to oxazoles was developed. The reaction utilizes in&#8197;situ generated hydrogen chloride in hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). With the aid of Design of Experiments optimization a wide range of substrates was transformed into the desired oxazoles. The method allows product formation without side reactions eliminating the need for extensive work&#8208;up and purification.

Abstract
A continuous&#8208;flow procedure for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters has been developed through Roskamp reaction between aldehydes and diazoesters in the presence of a Sn&#8208;MCM&#8208;41 catalyst. The viability of this methodology was confirmed with a range of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes with diazoesters and provided good to excellent yields. Catalyst activity was tested over three days (84&#8197;hours) of operation, and the yield of the desired &#946;&#8208;ketoester was maintained between 73 to 89%. The prepared &#946;&#8208;ketoesters were smoothly transformed into coumarin derivatives and 5&#8208;pyrazolone through condensation reactions in a sequential flow.

Abstract
The asymmetric cross&#8208;aldol reaction of two different aldehydes is a synthetically relevant reaction. Diarylprolinol catalyst with trifluoromethyl substituents and sulfonamide catalyst derived from diphenylprolinol are organocatalysts for the cross&#8208;aldol reaction. The reactivity and stereoselectivity of these two catalysts were compared in the asymmetric cross&#8208;aldol reactions of propanal and acetaldehyde as nucleophilic aldehydes and several electrophilic aldehydes. Depending on the electrophilic aldehydes, the preferable catalyst differs. By the proper selection of these two catalysts, potentially synthetically useful chiral building blocks can be synthesized with diastereoselectivities of anti:syn=2.6:1&#8764;&gt;20:1 and enantioselectivities of 60&#8764;&gt;98% ee.

Abstract
We have developed a method for constructing tricyclic [1,2&#8208;a]indoles via nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular imine&#8208;alkene coupling reactions. This method enables syntheses of 6&#8208;5&#8208;5 and 6&#8208;5&#8208;6 tricyclic [1,2&#8208;a]indoles. The use of NIXantphos or DPPPent as a ligand and 4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid as a co&#8208;catalyst is crucial for the reaction. The synthetic utility of the method was demonstrated by converting the product into useful indole amines.

Abstract
A diastereospecific enantiodivergent allylation of pyrazolones is reported which is catalyzed by a planar chiral pentaphenylferrocene based palladacycle. With the same catalyst batch both product enantiomers were selectively available. The method is applicable to structurally diverse substrates and gave products with enantiomeric excesses between 85 and 94%. In addition, we could show that pyrazolones are transformable into &#946;&#8208;aminoamides.

         <title>Witnessing the Birth of Directed Evolution of Stereoselective Enzymes as Catalysts in Organic Chemistry</title>

Abstract
This invited essay outlines how the idea of directed evolution of stereoselective enzymes was born and implemented experimentally at the Max&#8208;Planck&#8208;Institut f&#252;r Kohlenforschung in M&#252;lheim/Germany during the period 1994&#8211;1998, a time when Andreas Pfaltz was present in the Institute. As the new and sole director of the MPI, I initiated new research projects, and also started to restructure the Institute with the establishment of five departments, all dedicated to some form of catalysis and to be led by five independent directors. Andreas Pfaltz was the first director whom I hired, heading the Department of Homogeneous Catalysis. During his stay in M&#252;lheim until 1998, the Pfaltz group invented effective chiral ligands for a number of particularly challenging enantioselective transformations. During this period, Andreas Pfaltz witnessed the birth and development of directed evolution of stereoselective enzymes as a new research direction in the Reetz group. Indeed, he was one of the very few organic chemists who realized at the time that a door to a novel research area had been opened. The widespread application of enzymes was hampered for decades due to limited enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and regioselectivity, which was the reason why organic chemists were not interested in biocatalysis. This attitude slowly changed with the advent of directed evolution of stereoselective enzymes in 1997, in a publication from the Reetz group. Methodology development with emphasis on stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity as well as activity followed, the techniques and strategies becoming more and more rational. Today, semi&#8208;rational approaches and so&#8208;called rational enzyme design have merged, as evidenced, inter alia, by the development of focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis (FRISM). The toolbox of organic chemists now includes enzymes, primarily because the possibility of controlling stereoselectivity by protein engineering has ensured reliability when facing synthetic challenges.

         <title>Rhodium(CAAC)&#8208;Catalyzed Arene Hydrogenation of Benzo&#8208;Fused N&#8208;Heterocycles to Saturated Building Blocks with an all&#8208;cis Configuration</title>

Abstract
Saturated carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic building blocks can be readily obtained by the hydrogenation of aromatic carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. Although a variety of methods have been established to accomplish this transformation for simple arenes, the hydrogenation of aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles is less explored. We herein report a diastereoselective arene hydrogenation which was applied to an array of benzo&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocycles. A total of 48 saturated heterocycles was obtained by hydrogenation in the presence of the rhodium complex Cy(CAAC)Rh(cod)Cl in yields of 72&#8211;98% with moderate to high diastereoselectivities exhibiting the hydrogen atoms in an all&#8208;cis arrangement. The high tolerance towards functional groups enables the formation of valuable saturated products, which offer a starting point for further derivatization.

Abstract
A scalable approach to (2R)&#8208;hydroxyoctadec&#8208;3&#8208;enoic acid ((&#8722;)&#8208;2) is reported, which is the fatty acid constituent of numerous sphingolipids of biological significance. Key to success was the chemoselective trans&#8208;hydrogenation of a functionalized propargylic alcohol precursor with [Cp*RuCl]4 as the catalyst, followed by lipase&#8208;catalyzed resolution of the racemic product. (&#8722;)&#8208;2 then served the shortest total synthesis of the marine natural product symbioramide known to date.

Abstract
Saturated N&#8208;heterocycles are prominent motifs found in various natural products and pharmaceuticals. Despite the increasing interest in this class of compounds, the synthesis of saturated bicyclic azacycles requires tedious multi&#8208;step syntheses. Herein, we present a one&#8208;pot protocol for the synthesis of octahydroindoles, decahydroquinolines, and octahydroindolizines through a cascade reaction.

         <title>Ylide&#8208;Functionalized Diisopropyl Phosphine (prYPhos): A Ligand for Selective Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Couplings of Aryl Chlorides</title>

Abstract
The ylide&#8208;functionalized diisopropyl phosphine (prYPhos) promotes Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings of aryl chlorides and bromides with arylboronic acids. Using Pd2(dba)3/prYPhos as the catalyst and K2CO3 as the base, various (hetero)biaryls were synthesized in 45&#8211;98% yields at mild reaction conditions, tolerating sensitive functional groups and steric hindrance. The electron rich, sterically demanding ligand induces a high selectivity for halides versus triflate. Chloroaryl triflates were selectively coupled at the chloride, leaving inherently more reactive triflate groups in place.

         <title>Cooperative NHC/Photoredox Catalysis: Three Component Radical Coupling of Aroyl Fluorides, Styrenes and Alcohols</title>

Abstract
Cooperative NHC/photoredox catalysis has emerged as an important research field in recent years. Herein, the use of tertiary alcohols as alkyl radical precursors to perform three component radical coupling with styrenes and aroyl fluorides for the preparation of &#945;&#8208;arylated alkyl aryl ketones is described. Reaction of an aroyl fluoride with the NHC catalyst provides an acyl azolium ion that can be reduced by the photoredox catalyst to the corresponding ketyl radical anion. Oxidatively generated C&#8208;radicals derived from the alcohol add to the styrene derivative and subsequent cross coupling of the adduct radical with the ketyl radical delivers after NHC fragmentation the targeted ketone.

         <title>Switchable Synthesis of Aldehydes and Carboxylic Acids from Alcohols by Platinum&#8208;Catalysed Hydrogen Peroxide Oxidation Using Flow Reactors</title>

Abstract
Switchable synthesis of aldehydes and carboxylic acids from alcohols by Pt&#8208;catalysed H2O2 oxidation is performed for the first time using flow reactors. The use of an optimised amount of zero&#8208;valent Pt black diluted with SiO2 catalyst demonstrates controlled H2O2 oxidation of allylic alcohols, benzyl alcohols, and aliphatic alcohols. From a probe reaction, Pt catalytic activity to produce a carboxylic acid from the corresponding alcohol improves depending on the temperature increasing from 40 to 90&#8201;&#176;C. The set of reaction conditions about the combination of temperature and flow rate as a simple trigger works sensitively to divide the formation of aldehydes and carboxylic acids without tuning by additives.

Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic moieties are abundant among pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, but a challenge for metalorganic and organocatalytic transformations. We present tripeptides of the type H&#8208;Pro&#8208;Pro&#8208;Xaa as catalysts for stereoselective conjugate addition reactions between N&#8208;heterocyclic substituted aldehydes and electrophiles. Alkyl substituents at the N&#8208;terminal proline, the reactive site, were crucial for high chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Different N&#8208;heterocyclic moieties, even at both reaction partners, were readily tolerated and products were obtained in yields of 61&#8211;95% and enantioselectivities of up to 98% ee.

Abstract
Photostability is an essential design aspect for the overall performance of photocatalysts, particularly as groups introduced to adjust redox properties often constitute sites of potential reactivity. Herein, we describe a modular and flexible synthetic approach to incorporate diarylamino moieties with increased photostability that allow to efficiently tune the redox behavior of a new generation of organic acridinium photocatalysts. A series of cross&#8208;coupling reactions gave access to precursors for halogen metal exchange reactions combined with directed ortho&#8208;metalations to provide reagents that allow the formation of acridinium salts with adjustable redox properties and enhanced photostability in good yields.

         <title>Linear&#8208;Selective Allylation of Aldehydes with Simple Alkenes Mediated by Quadruple Hybrid Catalysis</title>

Abstract
In this study, we developed a linear&#8208;selective allylation reaction of aldehydes using simple alkenes as starting materials by using a quadruple hybrid catalyst system. The reaction proceeded under mild conditions such as room temperature under visible light irradiation and was applicable to asymmetric reactions. The key for this reaction is the addition of Ni(BF4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O catalyst to the previously reported ternary catalyst system, accelerating the allylic transfer process from branch products to thermodynamically stable linear products by increasing the Br&#248;nsted acidity of thiophosphoric imide (TPI) catalyst.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Coupling of Potassium Vinyltrifluoroborate with Arenes: A Direct Access to Functionalized Styrene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed direct alkenylation of arenes with readily available vinyltrifluoroborate to direct access to functionalized styrenes. This method tolerates a wide range of functional groups in 33 examples with excellent site&#8208; and regioselectivity under mild conditions. The synthetic utility was demonstrated through the further transformation of thus&#8208;obtained functionalized styrenes. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that the reaction probably proceeds through an Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation/Suzuki coupling pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Pincer&#8208;Ruthenium Catalyzed Oxygen Mediated Dehydrative Etherification of Alcohols and Ortho&#8208;Alkylation of Phenols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the current report, a dehydration strategy has been formulated for the selective etherification of secondary alcohols catalyzed by NNN pincer&#8208;ruthenium(II) carbonyl complexes based on bis(imino)pyridine ligands in the presence of molecular oxygen under solvent&#8208;free and base&#8208;free conditions at 140 &#176;C. Under these conditions, very high yields (up to 92%, ca. 6133 TON) of the corresponding ethers are obtained at a very low catalyst loading (ca. 0.015 mol%). Mechanistic studies provide key evidence for the various events that occur during the catalytic cycle. While iodometric titration gives quantitative proof for the liberation of hydrogen peroxide in catalytic amounts and hence confirms the role of oxygen as a co&#8208;catalyst, DFT, HRMS, IR and 13C NMR analysis are indicative of the non&#8208;labile nature of the ancillary CO ligand. On the other hand, DFT, NMR and HRMS studies reveal the hemi&#8208;labile nature of the pincer&#8208;ligand in the presence of oxygen. 
EPR analysis provide conclusive evidence for generation of Ru(III) species via single electron transfer (SET) from O2. Apparently the Ru(III) species (Ph2NN)RuCl2(CO)(OH) is the resting&#8208;state of the etherification reaction and several of its derivatives have been detected by HRMS analysis. The pincer&#8208;ruthenium catalyzed etherification of 1&#8208;phenyl ethanol has been successfully extended not only to various aromatic secondary alcohols but also to the cross&#8208;etherification and/or o&#8208;alkylation of 1&#8208;phenyl ethanols with a variety of phenols. Readily available oxygen and tiny amounts (0.015 mol%) of pincer&#8208;Ru catalyst are the only requirement for this atom&#8208;economical and environmentally benign dehydrative etherification reaction which apparently has not been reported thus far.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several cobalt(II) complexes supported by tetradentate aminobenzimidazole (N4) ligands and a tridentate nitrogen (N3) ligand have been prepared and characterized. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis indicates that the cobalt complex of BPMB (BPMB = 1,2&#8208;bis((S)&#8208;2&#8208;(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) pyrrolidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane) ligand shows a distorted octahedral configuration. These cobalt(II) complexes can  catalyze the transfer hydrogenation reaction of simple olefins with ammonia borane as a hydrogen source, and a variety of terminal olefins can be reduced to corresponding alkanes in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. Note that Co&#8208;N3 complex provides an inferior outcome than those of Co&#8208;N4 complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress of Electron&#8208;Withdrawing&#8208;Group&#8208;Tethered Arenes Involved Asymmetric Nucleophilic Aromatic Functionalizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWG) have emerged as a powerful tool for the activation of various arenes to promote nucleophilic dearomative additions for the construction of complicated chiral cyclic structures under asymmetric catalytic systems. Nitro&#8208;indoles, nitro&#8208;benzofurans/benzothiophenes, and related nitro&#8208;heteroarenes are widely applied in the reaction with various nucleophiles to construct various enantio&#8208;enriched polycyclic skeletons via the asymmetric dearomatization process. Meanwhile, the electron&#8208;deficient azo&#8208;group and nitroso&#8208;group are an alternative powerful tool for the activation of arenes, which enable formal nucleophilic aromatic arylations with various electrophilic aromatics to construct novel chiral biaryl atropisomers. Besides, azo&#8208;naphthanenes are served as dipolar surrogates in the reaction with nucleophilic dipolarophiles to proceed asymmetric cycloadditions to construct chiral polycyclic skeletons. The EWG&#8208;tethered arene has proven to be a versatile protocol for the construction of structurally diversified chiral backbones. This review summarizes the latest progress of the EWG&#8208;tethered arenes involved asymmetric transformations under organo&#8208; or transition metal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging Gold(I) Catalysis with Amine Transaminases in Cascade Catalysis: Chemoenzymatic Transformation of Propargylic Alcohols into Enantioenriched Allylic Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The compatibility between gold(I) catalysts and amine transaminases has been explored to transform racemic propargylic alcohols into enantioenriched allylic amines in a straightforward and selective manner. The synthetic approach consists of a gold(I)&#8208;catalysed Meyer&#8208;Schuster rearrangement of a series of 2&#8208;arylpent&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;2&#8208;ols and a subsequent stereoselective enzyme&#8208;catalysed transamination of the resulting &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated prochiral ketones. The design of cascade processes involving sequential or concurrent approaches has been studied in our search for ideal reaction conditions to produce the desired amines. Thus, the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complex [1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene]&#8208;[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)&#8208;imide]gold(I) ([Au(IPr)(NTf2)] (A) in aqueous medium was found to be an ideal catalyst, while selective, made&#8208;in&#8208;house and commercial amine transaminases permitted the asymmetric synthesis of both (E)&#8208;4&#8208;arylpent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;amine enantiomers in good isolated yields (53&#8208;84%) and excellent stereoselectivities (97 to &gt;99% enantiomeric excess).</dc:description>

         <title>ortho&#8208;Acylation of Aryl Iodides Enabled with Imides via Palladium/Norbornene/CuI Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Herein, a three component Catellani&#8208;type reaction catalyzed by the Palladium/Norbornene/CuI (Pd/NBE/CuI) cooperative system by using N&#8208;acylph&#8208;thalimides as acyl electrophiles is reported, which gives access to a series of aromatic ketones. The transformation is performable in the presence of water, albeit with decreased reaction yield. The additive CuI was crucial to facilitate the cleavage of C(O)&#8722;N bond of imide. This protocol showed broad substrate scope: both alkyl and aryl acyl groups could be installed at the ortho&#8208;position of aryl iodides; alkenes and boronic acids can be used as termination reagents.

         <title>RuH&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Diaryl Ketones via Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aromatic Enones with Aromatic Aldehydes and Mechanistic Insights</title>

Abstract
RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of alkenyl ketones with aldehydes has been extended to the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;diaryl 1,3&#8208;diketones. The reaction has been successfully applied to the synthesis of PPT (propyl pyrazole triol), a selective estrogen receptor modulator compound. A study of the stoichiometric reaction of phenyl vinyl ketone with RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 has revealed that the &#946;&#8208;ruthenium ketone PhCOCH2CH2RuCl(CO)(PPh3)2, a five&#8208;membered ruthenacycle is formed with liberation of one molecule of PPh3. The observed catalytic activity of this ruthenacycle in the presence of PPh3 suggests that it serves as a resting state, in equilibrium with an oxa&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl ruthenium species, which is the key coupling partner with aldehyde substrates.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Total Synthesis of the Neuritogenic Echinoderm Ganglioside LLG&#8208;5 and Related Analogues</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
LLG&#8208;5 1 is a Neu5Gc8Me&#8208;containing echinoderm ganglioside (EG) isolated from starfish Linckia laevigata. It showed neuritogenic activity toward the rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line PC&#8208;12. The first chemoenzymatic total synthesis of the trisialoganglioside LLG&#8208;5 1 has been accomplished by utilizing a convergent [2+3] coupling between a Neu5Gc8Me&#945;(2&#8594;5)Neu5Gc&#8208;linked disialoside and a C5&#8208;amino GM3 ceramide, Neu5NH2(2&#8594;3)Gal&#946;(1&#8594;4)Glc&#946;&#8208;Cer. A photoactivatable lactosyl phytosphingosine bearing a sulphonate moiety was developed to permit aqueous buffer solubility of the hydrophobic glycolipid acceptor for enzymatic &#945;(2,3) sialylation. In addition, the synthetic route is flexible, allowing non&#8208;natural LLG&#8208;5 analogues in native lengths with or without modification at C8 of the terminal Neu5Gc and/or N&#8208;acyl component, further expanding the diversity of LLG&#8208;5 structures that could be achieved. The developed synthetic strategy may enable access to other EGs.

Abstract
Presented herein is the Br&#248;nsted acid (MsOH) mediated electrophilic sulfenylacyloxylation of o&#8208;alkynylbenzoates via alkyne activation by in&#8208;situ formed sulfonium cations from bench&#8208;stable N&#8208;thioaryl/alkyl&#8208;succinimides followed by the intramolecular regioselective cyclization. The transformation provides access to structurally diverse 4&#8208;sulfenylisocoumarins in 77&#8211;98% yields with broad functional group compatibility. The reaction scalability and reusability of phthalimide protecting group make this protocol synthetically viable.

The front cover picture is a metaphor of mechanochemistry. A pair of robotic arms is playing dominoes with the mechanism of Ni&#8208;catalyzed domino&#8208;cyclisation&#8208;arylation of o&#8208;hydroxyarylenaminones, elucidated by the experimental and computational investigations in our group. Meanwhile, another set of mechanical contraptions working at 30&#8197;Hz is about to ground the domino tiles as they fall to obtain isoflavones under mechanochemical conditions. This is the first example where the mechanic energy is used in the synthesis of isoflavones following a domino cyclisation. Details can be found in the Research Article by Iaroshenko and co&#8208;workers (S. Mkrtchyan, M. Jakubczyk, S. Lanka, M. Yar, T. Mahmood, K. Ayub, M. Sillanp&#228;&#228;, C. M. Thomas, V. O.

         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free hydrogenation of quinoxalines and indoles with Me3N&#183;BH3 and TFA in water at room temperature is reported. The protocol is featured with the usage of environmentally friendly water as the solvent, no need of metal catalyst and broad substrate scope. Sensitive functional groups such as OH&#8208;, NH2&#8208;, Cl&#8208;, Br&#8208;, especially &#8208;CN and &#8208;CO2Me were well tolerated. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested that TFA and Me3N&#183;BH3 provided the proton and hydride sources for the product, respectively.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of organolithium chemistry with gold catalysis has enabled the development of a synthetic strategy for accessing polysubstituted indoles and carbazoles from readily available starting materials. This method is based on a &#8220;back&#8208;to&#8208;front&#8221; approach from ketopyrroles, generated by intramolecular carbolithiation of N,N&#8208;bis&#8208;(2&#8208;lithioallyl)amines that evolve into 3,4&#8208;bis(lithiomethyl)dihydropyrrole intermediates capable of reacting with carboxylic esters and Weinreb amides. These ketopyrroles have demonstrated to be excellent precursors of mono or bis(alkynols)pyrroles that, under gold&#8208;catalysis, experience a benzannulation reaction providing access to regioselectively substituted indoles or carbazoles.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Organocatalyzed Functionalization of Tetramic and Tetronic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organocatalyzed Michael addition of N&#8208;substituted tetramic acids to nitroalkene acceptors followed by O&#8208;alkylation gave polyfunctionalized tetramic acid (31 examples, 59&#8208;94% ee). The enantioselectivity of the product was influenced by the N&#8208;substituent of the substrate. Quantum chemical methods provided the mechanistic insights of the studied transformation. The preferred reaction pathway follows the model proposed by P&#225;pai et al. Single crystal structure confirmed the absolute configuration, which was in line with the ECD measured and calculated structure. Additionally, a comparative study of the alkylation of a selected tetramic and tetronic acid with trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene is disclosed. Follow&#8208;up amidations demonstrated the applicability of this class of compounds for the incorporation into both dipeptide and depsipeptide sequences.</dc:description>

Abstract
We have developed a synthetic strategy for Et3N&#8208;promoted [5+3] cycloaddition reactions between acetoxypyranones and azomethine imines to access functionalized azabicyclo[3.3.1]alkenones with three tertiary stereocenters (31 examples, 36% to 87% yield, 5.5:1 to &gt;20:1 dr). The method was scalable, and the products could be transformed to various eight&#8208;membered&#8208;ring bridged heterocyclic molecules.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed Atroposelective Interannular C&#8722;H Arylation of Biaryl Aldehydes with Aryl Iodides Enabled by a Transient Directing Group Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A concise synthesis of axially chiral biaryl aldehydes through Pd/amino acid&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective interannular C&#8722;H arylation of biaryl aldehydes with aryl iodides is developed. This reaction proceeds smoothly involving excellent enantiocontrol and accomplishes with good tolerance of functional groups. Moreover, the readily accessible scale&#8208;up synthesis and further transformation of products has highlighted the potential utility of this asymmetric catalytic protocol.

Abstract
Abstract. In this paper, the application of organocatalysis in the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrolizines is demonstrated. &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated aldehydes and pyrrole&#8208;based hydrazone readily participated in the formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition that was realized according to aminocatalytic iminium ion activation. Products were obtained in high chemical yields, with excellent stereocontrol. The developed method was utilized in the first organocatalytic synthesis of ketorolac, a non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug.

Abstract
Fe&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component strategy have been developed for the synthesis of 2,3&#8242;&#8208;biquinolines from readily available 2&#8208;methyl quinolines, anthranils and N, N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMA), This annulation procedure undergoes C(sp3)&#8722;H activation, amination, nucleophilic addition, dehydration and oxydehydrogenation steps. DMA acts not only as a solvent but also as a one carbon donor in the reaction.

Abstract
A Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed ortho C&#8722;H functionalization of N&#8208;nitrosoanilines with &#945;&#8208;sulfonylcarbenes had been developed. The reaction was carried out under mild conditions and the products were obtained with good to excellent yields. The diverse transformations of the products to ortho&#8208;functionalized anilines and nitrogen heterocycles were achieved. Furthermore, a cascade reaction of N&#8208;nitrosoanilines and &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazo&#8208;ketones provided 3&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;indoles efficiently.

         <title>Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Cyclization of 2&#8208;Alkynyl Diaryl Sulfides for the Selective Synthesis of Sulfur&#8208;Containing Polycyclic Compounds.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inside cover picture illustrates that starting from 2&#8208;alkynyl diaryl sulfides, intramolecular cyclization realized selective construction of sulfur&#8208;containing five to seven&#8208;membered systems by the choice of reaction temperature and aryl group using the same iridium catalysis. When 2&#8208;alkynylphenyl &#8220;naphthyl&#8221; sulfides were used, triaryl&#8208;fused thiepines possessing a 7&#8208;membered ring were obtained at 100&#8201;&#176;C. The reaction of 2&#8208;alkynyl diaryl sulfides at 120&#8201;&#176;C gave 9&#8208;arylidene&#8208;9H&#8208;thioxanthenes with 6&#8208;membered system. The reaction of 2&#8208;alkynylphenyl &#8220;naphthyl&#8221; sulfides at 160&#8201;&#176;C afforded diaryl&#8208;substituted benzothiophene with 5&#8208;membered system. Details can be found in the communication by Takanori Shibata and co&#8208;workers (T. Shibata, T. Iwaki, M. Ito, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2022, 364, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202200565)

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote &#948;&#8208;C&#8722;H Selenylation of Arylethylamide and Alkenylethylamide Derivatives</title>

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed remote &#948;&#8208;C&#8722;H selenylation of arylethylamide derivatives with readily available diselenides has been reported. This protocol relies on the use of a removable picolinamide directing group to access unsymmetrical diaryl selenides in 45&#8211;98% yields. Furthermore, the inactivated &#948;&#8208;C(alkenyl)&#8722;H bond was also compatible in this reaction and afforded the thermo&#8208;dynamically unfavorable Z&#8208;selective&#8208;alkenyl selenides with complete control of site&#8208; and stereoselectivity.

Abstract
The diastereodivergent synthesis of syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;9&#8208;hydroxyhomoisoflavanone from various chromones and carbaldehydes is described. The synthetic approaches involving the reductive aldol reaction or the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction followed by syn&#8208;selective 1,4&#8208;reduction provide both diastereomers of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy chroman&#8208;4&#8208;ones in 51&#8211;98% yield with anti (2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8211;16&#8201;:&#8201;1 anti/syn) or 22&#8211;80% yield with syn (5&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8211;48&#8201;:&#8201;1 syn/anti) diastereoselectivity. The ambiguity surrounding the stereochemistry of two 9&#8208;hydroxyhomoisoflavanones, homoferrugenone and portulacanone F was elucidated via the first total syntheses.

         <title>Efforts Towards Control of Regioselectivity in the Gold(I) Catalyzed Hydration of Internal Alkynes. Effects of Solvent, Temperature and Substrate on Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Internal alkyne hydration using gold(I) catalysts often shows &lt;5:1 regioselectivity. To explore factors that control selectivity, [(IPr)Au]+ paired with the weakly coordinating anion [IMP&#8208;H] was employed in additive free hydration reactions. Solvent influences the anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity of alkylarylacetylene hydration. Although temperature does not impact selectivity, [(IPr)Au(NCMe)][IMP&#8208;H] (C1) is an effective precatalyst for alkyl/alkyl and alkyl/aryl acetylenes at ambient temperature. Overall kinetic behavior of C1 resembles that of other Au hydrofunctionalization reactions of [(IPr)Au]+, where nucleophilic attack and/or proton transfer are turnover limiting. Prospects for improving regioselectivity are discussed.

Abstract
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of N&#8208;aryl thiocarbamoyl fluorides and water has been developed, providing access to 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;benzothiazolones in 48&#8211;83% yields. This protocol for 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;benzothiazolones precludes bad&#8208;smell and toxic reagents. Mechanistic studies suggest that the transformation proceeds through hydrolysis followed by dehydrogenative coupling to form C&#8722;S bond involving a radical process.

         <title>Indenone Synthesis via Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed annulation reactions to synthesize indenones are reviewed, beginning with the Larock indenone synthesis and focusing on the most recent advances in technology. Proposed reaction mechanisms, and the evidence supporting them, are highlighted throughout this review. Current limitations in these reactions are described in detail. Obtaining high regioselectivity remains challenging with several different classes of alkyne. In particular, high&#8208;yielding and regioselective reactions with alkyl&#8208;substituted alkynes remain elusive, as do reactions with terminal alkynes. In the final section, the case is made that indanone synthesis reactions employing alkenes should be further explored.

         <title>Controllable Access to Furans and Dihydrofurans through Cyclization/Coupling of Internal Acetylenic &#946;&#8208;Ketoesters with Aryl Bromides</title>

Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed tandem cyclization/coupling of internal &#946;&#8208;propargylic&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters with (hetero)aryl bromides is described. Two protocols are established which selectively lead to 2&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;dihydrofurans, when isomerization is inhibited under mild conditions (temp. &#8804;40&#8201;&#176;C and weak base &#8211; K2CO3), or to 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;furans when base&#8208;induced aromatization is enabled. A catalytic cycle involving oxidative addition, substitution of bromide with alkyne, rate limiting anti&#8208;selective 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig oxocyclization followed by fast deprotonation of the oxonium intermediate, and reductive elimination is proposed based on detailed experimental and theoretical studies.

         <title>Gold Catalysis: 2,3&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;Addition to Butadiynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the past, numerous impressive methodologies have been developed in homogeneous gold catalysis, typically using alkynes, allenes, or different non&#8208;conjugated diyne systems as starting materials. While there are applications catalyzed by other transition metals, the use of 1,3&#8208;butadiyne derivatives has been largely neglected in gold catalysis. In this work we present an efficient gold&#8208;catalyzed method focusing on the functionalization of this specific type of diynes. The starting materials can be synthesized via simple Glaser Coupling, starting from cheap, highly variable, terminal alkynes. These homocoupling products, which are often observed as undesirable side&#8208;products in Sonogashira reactions, can be converted into the versatile 1,3&#8208;butadiene derivatives in alcohol as a solvent and nucleophile under mild conditions. The possible field of application of the 1,3&#8208;butadiene derivatives known from the literature is very broad and ranges from a use as transistor or OLED material to a use as an enzyme inhibitor. The approach presented here offers an attractive and highly effective way to versatile functionalized 1,3&#8208;butadiene derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Tri&#8208; and Difluoromethylated Bis(carbazolyl)methanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A general, efficient and regioselective protocol has been developed for the synthesis of trifluoromethylated bis(carbazolyl)methanes. This metal&#8208;free transformation proceeds smoothly under air atmosphere and features broad scope for both reaction partners. This method could also be extended to the synthesis of difluoromethylated and chlorodifluoromethylated bis(carbazolyl)methanes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general, efficient and regioselective protocol has been developed for the synthesis of trifluoromethylated bis(carbazolyl)methanes. This metal-free transformation proceeds smoothly under air atmosphere and features broad scope for both reaction partners. This method could also be extended to the synthesis of difluoromethylated and chlorodifluoromethylated bis(carbazolyl)methanes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
A promoter&#8208;free chalcogenophosphorylation reaction between diverse P(O)&#8722;H reagents and chalcogenosulfonates has been developed. In the absence of metal or any other additives, these transformations proceed through a spontaneous process at room temperature, which provide a convenient and compatible approach to a broad range of selenophosphates and thiophosphates.

Abstract
A metal&#8208;free and external&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free electrosynthesis of &#946;&#8208;acyloxy&#8208;&#947;&#8208;selenyl amines was developed. The cascade reaction is triggered by anodic oxidative generation of electrophilic selenium cation, followed by electrophilic addition to the unactivated alkene, and successive water promoted intramolecular acyl migration. The reactions gave the products in up to 98% yield with controllable regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. Different chemoselectivity towards cyclization products was also viable with N&#8208;Boc and N&#8208;Cbz substrates. Both batch chemistry and flow chemistry were available for scale&#8208;up synthesis with up to 91% yield.

Abstract
Sodium sulfinate addition to (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;chlorovinyl ketones followed by the aerobic cycloisomerization of alkenyl sulfone intermediates has been established for the synthesis of 3&#8208;sulfonyl furans. The optimal cycloisomerization catalyst system was identified to be Cu(OTf)2, where molecular oxygen acts as a terminal oxidant. With three points of structural variation in both &#946;&#8208;chlorovinyl ketones and sodium sulfinates, the current aerobic cycloisomerization strategy allows the synthesis of highly functionalized and substituted furan derivatives.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrohydrazonemethylation of Styrenes: Access to Chiral Hydrazones, Hydrazides, Hydrazines and Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric hydroformylation of styrenes was combined with condensation of the resulting aldehydes with acetohydrazide as nucleophile leading to &#947;&#8208;chiral N&#8217;&#8208;substituted aceto&#8208;hydrazones. This cascade reaction is called hydrohydrazonemethylation (HHM) in analogy to similar hydroformylation/condensation sequences. The catalyst was formed in&#8197;situ from the commercially available chiral phosphine&#8208;ligand (R,R)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE and [Rh(acac)(CO)2] and used at a loading of 0.2&#8197;mol%. The stable condensation products are not prone to tautomerization providing versatile chiral intermediates. Their one&#8208;pot reduction with DMAB/TsOH resulted in the corresponding &#947;&#8208;chiral N&#8217;&#8208;substituted acetohydrazides (14 examples) with yields ranging from 73% to 91% and enantioselectivities from 77% to 97% ee. Deprotection of the acetohydrazides led to the corresponding &#946;&#8208;chiral hydrazines. Reduction and hydrogenolysis of the hydrazones over Raney&#8208;Ni yielded the corresponding &#946;&#8208;chiral primary amines with 95% ee. Diastereoselective functionalization of the C=N bond of the hydrazones is a further synthetic option, as demonstrated by allylation with (allyl)SiCl3.

Abstract
A photoinduced multicomponent reaction of arylamines, enaminones and difluorobromoacetates for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;difunctionalized quinolines is reported. This strategy features broad functional groups tolerance and wide substrate scopes that enables further synthetic applications of the obtained products. Mechanistic studies reveal that intermolecular [3+3] cyclization between in&#8208;situ generated 1,3&#8208;vinylimine ions and arylamines is the key step in this transformation.

Abstract
2&#8208;MeTHF (2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran) promotes the zincate&#8208;mediated remote functionalisation of p&#8208;iodobenzyl derivatives through metallotropy with a broad scope. This biosourced solvent remarkably impacted all the key elementary steps involved in the tandem reaction. The method tolerates a wide range of sensitive functionalities within the substrates as well as enolisable and activated or deactivated aromatic aldehydes as reaction partners. A challenging benzyl naphthalene derivative was even reacted through an original dearomatisation/rearomatisation/metallotropy chain.

         <title>Synthesis of Perdeuterated Linoleic Acid&#8208;d31 and Chain Deuterated 1&#8208;Palmitoyl&#8208;2&#8208;linoleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine&#8208;d62</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a gram&#8208;scale synthesis of perdeuterated linoleic acid&#8208;d31. The starting materials for the synthesis are two saturated fatty acids, azelaic acid&#8208;d14 and pentanoic acid&#8208;d9, which can be obtained by metal catalysed hydrothermal hydrogen&#8208;deuterium exchange. The synthesis utilises the fatty acids directly via decarboxylative coupling. Copper catalysed coupling of a terminal alkyne intermediate with a propargyl bromide derivative affords a skipped diyne, which can be reduced using P&#8208;2 nickel to obtain the desired cis,cis&#8208;diene geometry. The subsequent synthesis of the tail&#8208;deuterated phospholipid, 1&#8208;palmitoyl&#8208;2&#8208;linoleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine&#8208;d62 (PLPC&#8208;d62) is also described. Optimised reaction conditions were developed to access this phospholipid and its regioisomeric purity was characterised by two complementary mass spectrometry techniques.

         <title>Mechanochemical Ni&#8208;Catalysed Arylation of ortho&#8208;Hydroxyarylenaminones: Synthesis of Isoflavones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
This work describes two new synthetic methods for the preparation of isoflavones following the Ni&#8208;catalysed domino arylation reactions of the vast range of ortho&#8208;hydroxyarylenaminones utilising aromatic bromides as well as carboxylic acids. The presented protocols tolerated significant variation of all coupling partners and enabled synthesis of isoflavone library of twenty&#8208;three representatives. This is the first communicated precedent where the mechanic energy was utilised in the synthesis of isoflavones following the domino cyclisation mode.

         <title>Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Cyclization of 2&#8208;Alkynyl Diaryl Sulfides for the Selective Synthesis of Sulfur&#8208;Containing Polycyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We describe an Ir&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular reaction of 2&#8208;alkynyl diaryl sulfides, which gives 9&#8208;arylidene&#8208;9H&#8208;thioxanthene derivatives via 6&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization. When 2&#8208;alkynylphenyl naphthyl sulfides are used, divergent synthesis of triaryl&#8208;fused thiepines and diaryl&#8208;substituted benzothiophenes can be achieved by simply choosing the reaction temperature.

Abstract
A strategy for the synthesis of quinazolines via elemental sulfur&#8208;mediated oxidative condensation of nitriles and 2&#8208;(aminomethyl)anilines was developed. The reaction was carried out under metal&#8208;/solvent&#8208;free conditions, tolerates a wide range of functional groups to provide the corresponding products in 56%&#8208;91% yield, and can be performed on a gram&#8208;scale. The UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectra of several product derivatives were measured to study their photophysical properties.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Carboamination of Maleimides with Amines and &#945;&#8208;Bromo Carboxylates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative carboamination of maleimides with alkyl amines and &#945;&#8208;bromo carboxylates is described. These multicomponent reactions show good functional group compatibility and are suitable for the late&#8208;stage modification of a series of neuroprotective agents, providing a direct path for the library synthesis of 3&#8208;carbo&#8208;4&#8208;amino maleimides. The initial copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative amination of maleimides with amines to form enamines intermediate, followed by copper&#8208;catalyzed radical alkylation with &#945;&#8208;bromo carboxylate compounds, triggers a relayed catalytic reaction to achieve the carboamination process.

Abstract
A ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of allenoates with arylamines has been developed. This strategy provides an approach to synthesize E&#8208;allylic amines in good yields with high atom&#8208;economy and high levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and E&#8208;selectivities with a broad substrate scope.
