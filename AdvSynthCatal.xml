         <title>C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8208;H Functionalization Using Chlorine Radicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Converting any desired C&#8208;H bond to the intended C&#8208;Z bond in a given organic molecule could be the final peak of the C&#8208;H functionalization methodology. Among the three types of C&#8208;H bonds, the functionalization of the ubiquitous C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8208;H bond has gained special attention, especially in the last two decades. There are different ways to transform a C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8208;H bonds to desired C&#8208;Z bonds and using chlorine radicals is one of them with a bright future. The literature review shows different sources have been used for chlorine including chloride anion (from HCl or salts), coordinated chlorine (from transition metal complex), and organic chlorides (from organochlorine compounds), although, HCl and FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; have gained the most attention among them. There are three major ways to convert chlorine from these sources to chlorine radicals: 1) the oxidation of hydrogen chloride or chloride salts, 2) the photolysis of metal chloride, and 3) the transition metal insertion into C&#8208;Cl bonds. This review aims to summarise published research papers about using chlorine radicals for C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8208;H bonds functionalization and do not participate in the products as the substitutions for hydrogens. Therefore, the chlorination reaction of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8208;H bonds and the reactions in which chlorine radicals do not play a direct role in C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8208;H bond breaking are not the subject of this review.</dc:description>

         <title>Endogenous group&#8208;directed late&#8208;stage C&#8208;H functionalization of peptides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptides are diverse in terms of their functional groups and side&#8208;chain functionalities, and late&#8208;stage C&#8208;H functionalization plays a crucial role in their design. Approaches for such synthesis require pre&#8208;installation and post&#8208;removal of the directing group (DG). In recent times, chemical methods have been developed, focusing on the external DG&#8208;free C&#8208;H functionalization of peptides. These approaches utilize the inherent native functionality of peptides as DG to simplify synthetic routes, reducing synthetic steps, waste generation, enhancing sustainability, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and operational flexibility. Such approaches facilitate late&#8208;stage C&#8208;H functionalization of both natural and unnatural amino acid&#8208;containing peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Benzyl Oxindoles via Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex Photoactivation Using Thianthrenium Salts and Potassium Carbonate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A photochemical synthesis of biologically relevant benzyl oxindoles is presented via electron&#8208;donor acceptor (EDA) complex strategy. This exogenous photocatalyst&#8208;free method describes the formation of a new electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex based on potassium carbonate and thianthrenium salts for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation. This transition&#8208;metal free reaction allows a rapid increase in oxindoles molecular complexity chemical space, tolerating different functional groups as well as sophisticated biomolecules. The scalability and sustainability of this method is highlighted by an important waste recovery protocol. Mechanistic investigations support the formation of an EDA complex that induces a radical chain, and the applicability of this method is showcased by straightforward derivatization reactions.

Abstract
This study reports the copper&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;indolmethylation of 2&#8208;pyridylacetates with 3&#8208;indoleacetic acids. This reaction offers an approach to generating alkylideneindolenine electrophiles via the oxidative decarboxylation of 3&#8208;indoleacetic acids. The developed reaction system demonstrates good versatility, extending beyond the indolmethylation of 2&#8208;pyridylacetates to include activated esters and nitroalkanes. Moreover, a biological evaluation revealed that several products exhibited antiproliferative activity against different cancer cell lines.

Abstract
A Mn&#8208;electrocatalytic ring&#8208;opening azidation of tert&#8208;cyclobutanols has been developed. The regioselective method is applicable for the azidation of a diverse array of cyclobutanols to provide practical &#947;&#8208;azido ketones in 23&#8211;91% yields under chemical oxidants&#8208;free reaction conditions. Detailed mechanistic studies suggest the process of Mn&#8208;mediated alkoxy radical generation followed by &#946;&#8208;scission to form carbon&#8208;centered radical species is possibly involved in this transformation.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalysed C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation and Hydrogen Isotope Exchange via Nitrogen&#8208;Based Carbonyl Directing Groups</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Growing interest in improved structural diversity within the pharmaceutical industry has led to a focus on more sp3&#8208;rich drug frameworks. Meanwhile, spiralling pharmaceutical research and development costs continue to require expedited adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity studies, which are heavily reliant on the use of molecules incorporating deuterium and tritium. Herein, we report an iridium catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H activation and hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) methodology capable of utilizing pharmaceutically ubiquitous nitrogen&#8208;based carbonyl directing groups. High levels of deuterium incorporation (&gt;80% in 37 of the examples) are demonstrated across a range of substrates (5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;membered lactams, cyclic carbamates and ureas, acyclic amides), with tolerance of a range of common functional groups (aryl, alkoxy, halogen, ester, alcohol, sulfonamide) and predictable regioselectivity. The applicability of this methodology was demonstrated with up to 98% deuterium incorporation observed in a range of challenging bioactive molecules such as Nefiracetam, Praziquantel, and Unifiram. Density functional theory has provided mechanistic insight into the C&#8722;H activation and HIE at both the expected site of incorporation and an unexpected aryl labelling via a 7&#8208;membered metallocyclic intermediate.

The applicability of this methodology was demonstrated with up to 98% deuterium incorporation observed in a range of challenging bioactive molecules such as Nefiracetam, Praziquantel, and Unifiram. Density functional theory has provided mechanistic insight into the C&#8722;H activation and HIE at both the expected site of incorporation and an unexpected aryl labelling via a 7-membered metallocyclic intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A method for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuro[3,2&#8208;c]quinolines via TfOH or TMSOTf mediated condensation of 2&#8208;aminoaryl cyclopropyl ketones with aldehydes has been developed. The reaction proceeds under transition metal or halogen free conditions, giving access to the target molecules in 27&#8211;90% isolated yields. Mechanistic study indicates that the reaction sequence involves imine formation, intramolecular Mannich condensation, Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement, and auto&#8208;oxidation.

         <title>Enantioselective Si&#8722;H Insertion of Arylvinyldiazoesters Promoted by Rhodium(I)/Diene Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An enantioselective Si&#8722;H insertion between &#945;&#8208;arylvinyldiazoesters and silanes has been developed by employing rhodium(I)/chiral diene complex as the catalyst. This protocol offers a catalytic asymmetric approach to various chiral silanes containing &#945;&#8208;arylvinyl functionality at room temperature with good enantiocontrol (89&#8211;99% ee). Transformation of the resulting enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;arylvinyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silyl esters led to a variety of other valuable building blocks. The deuterium kinetic isotope effect experiments revealed a rhodium(I)&#8208;mediated concerted Si&#8722;H insertion mechanism.

         <title>Stereoselective Access to &#946;&#8208;gem&#8208;Difluorinated Alcohols Through Enzymatic Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We report here a mild process to access diversely functionalized enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluorinated (S)&#8208;alcohols by using biocatalytic reduction in &gt;99% yield and enantiomeric excesses ranging from 96% to &gt;99%. This novel approach involves enzymatic reduction of &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluorinated heterocyclic and carbocyclic ketone derivatives as well as an acyclic gem&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;ketosulfone and proceeds under mild conditions at 30&#8201;&#176;C under aqueous conditions to produce a range of high added value enantioenriched difluorinated alcohols including 3,3&#8208;difluorochromanol, 3,3&#8208;difluorothiochromanol, 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;dihydroquinolinol, and &#945;&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfone derivatives. A comparative study between enzymatic reduction and metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation was carried out as well.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed two&#8208;fold annulation reaction of 2,6&#8208;dihalogenobiphenyls with o&#8208;chloroaromatic carboxylic acids has been developed. This method enables the synthesis of various dibenzo[fg,op]tetracenes and azadibenzo[fg,op]tetracenes. Preliminary investigations indicate that the resulting product, dimethyl 5,6,12,13&#8208;tetrakis(hexyloxy)dibenzo[fg,op]tetracene&#8208;2,9&#8208;dicarboxylate, demonstrates favorable liquid&#8208;crystalline properties.

Abstract
Hydrocarboxylation of methyl 2&#8208;octynoate, a chemical commercially available at a low cost, with N&#8208;protected amino acids was developed with a gold&#8208;zinc cooperative catalyst constructed with a 5&#8208;[(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridin)&#8208;5&#8208;yl]imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene to prepare &#945;&#8208;methoxycarbonyl enol esters as acylating reagents. The &#945;&#8208;methoxycarbonyl enol esters were isolable through silica&#8208;gel column chromatography and storable without precautions regarding moisture. Acylation of free amines with the &#945;&#8208;methoxycarbonyl enol esters proceeded without epimerization of the stereogenic center derived from the enol esters, affording analytically pure dipeptide compounds through filtration and hexane&#8208;washing.

         <title>Synthesis of 1,2'&#8208;Spirobi[indene]&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones by Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Activation and Alkynes Annulation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An intermolecular annulation reaction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;indandions with alkynes was reported using Pd(OAc)2 to access spirobi[indene]&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones. Under palladium catalysis, the substrates form a homocoupling dimer intermediate through a catalytic dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling process. The palladium(II) species could come from dimer or 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;indandion. Notably, this pathway is not typically observed in enol&#8208;directed formal sp3 C&#8208;H functionalization/oxidative annulation palladium chemistry. This transformation provides a route to access a class of functionalized spiro carbocyclic indenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Aerobic Dearomatization of Naphthylamines under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dearomatization of aromatic substrates via photocatalytic methodologies has gained escalating prominence to access molecular complexity. Although much focus has been put on non&#8208;active arenes, naphthols and N&#8208;based heteroaromatics, arylamines have so far remained in the background. Herein, we report a photocatalytic strategy for the aerobic, dearomative hydroxylation of naphthylamines under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Our investigation highlights singlet oxygen generation as a viable mechanism for aromaticity disruption, mitigating selectivity issues deriving from the direct oxidation of targeted arylamines. Finally, we showcased the synthetic value of the obtained dearomatized products in a late&#8208;stage diversification campaign.</dc:description>

Abstract
An iodine/DMSO&#8208;promoted approach has been developed for the synthesis of indoloquinolines via a sequential sp3 C&#8722;H oxidation/intramolecular cyclization using 2&#8208;(1H&#8208;indol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)anilines and aryl methyl ketones. A wide range of aryl methyl ketones, including drugs and complex bioactive molecule&#8208;derived substrates were compatible in the present reaction with yields in the range of 30&#8211;96%. This protocol proceeds through sp3 C&#8722;H oxidation of aryl methyl ketones to phenylglyoxals, subsequent imine formation, and cyclization to furnish the indoloquinolines. Further, the reaction is applicable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis and is operationally simple.

         <title>Diradical Polar Reactivity Induced by Electricity&#8208;Mediated Ground State Triplet Nitrenium Species</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is extremely rare for reactive intermediates to possess a ground state triplet character. Excited state triplet intermediates are generally accessed by means of photon transfer from a tunable light source or by using any triplet sensitizers. N&#8208;acyl N&#8208;alkoxy nitreniums are an important class of reactive intermediates in the synthetic organic community due to their prolonged lifetime and ground&#8208;state singlet character. Herein, we report an external oxidant and toxic catalyst&#8208;free mild electrochemical protocol to access nitrenium reactive intermediate. Experimental findings of the mechanistic pathway suggested a theoretically predicted triplet reactive intermediate that is energetically favorable to the singlet pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Regio&#8208; and Enantiocomplementary Synthesis of Chiral Aryloxazolidinones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
We described the protein engineering of the halohydrin dehalogenase HheG to enhance its R enantioselectivity for the synthesis of chiral 4&#8208;aryloxazolidinones via &#945;&#8208;regioselective ring&#8208;opening of aryl epoxides with cyanate. Additionally, we achieved the inversion of its regioselectivity and enantioselectivity, resulting in a HheG variant tailored for the synthesis of chiral 5&#8208;aryloxazolidinones via &#946;&#8208;regioselective and S&#8208;enantioselective ring&#8208;opening of aryl epoxides with cyanate. Leveraging these engineered mutants, we developed a biocatalytic platform capable of synthesis of both chiral 4&#8208;aryloxazolidinones (up to 47% yield, 98% ee, and 99% regioselectivity) and chiral 5&#8208;aryloxazolidinones (up to 46% yield, &gt;99% ee, and 98% regioselectivity). Furthermore, a collaborative approach utilizing two regio&#8208; and enantioselective HheG mutants has been demonstrated to enable the simultaneous synthesis of chiral 4&#8208;aryloxazolidinones and chiral 5&#8208;aryloxazolidinones.

         <title>Organocatalyzed, Three&#8208;Component Construction of Cyanopyrazoles Using Diazoacetonitrile</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An organocatalyzed three&#8208;component protocol using diazoacetonitrile to access a wide range of cyanopyrazole derivatives is reported here. This strategy, which proceeds through a piperidine&#8208;catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation/formal [3+2] cycloaddition/dehydrocyanation sequence, provides an efficient route to construct dicyanopyrazoles from aldehydes, malononitrile, and diazoacetonitrile regioselectively. Interestingly, by engaging cyanoacetate and cyanoacetamide in this protocol, we could achieve cyanopyrazole esters and carboxamides.

         <dc:description>The cascade reaction of ynamides with propargyl thiols by Au(I) catalysis involving regioselective hydrothiolation, thio&#8208;Claisen rearrangement, and cycloisomerization to generate 2&#8208;aminothiophenes in a one&#8208;pot manner is described. In this reaction, the selection of reaction temperature is crucial, with the initial step, namely hydrothiolation, conducted at a low temperature (40&#176;C), followed by the subsequent reaction requiring an increase in temperature (&gt;110&#176;C). Furthermore, it was revealed that multi&#8208;substituted anilines could be synthesized efficiently from the resulting 2&#8208;aminothiophenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing SuFExable Cyclobutane&#8208;Fused Indolines via Photocatalytic Intermolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition of Indoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indoline&#8208;fused polycycles are commonly found as a key structural component in numerous natural products and biologically active compounds. In recent times, the incorporation of sulfonyl fluoride groups has drawn significant attention in research due to their potential to enhance or confer new biological activities to molecules. In this study, we report the development of a novel and modular approach for synthesizing FSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;functionalized cyclobutane&#8208;fused indolines by employing an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between indoles and SuFExable ethenesulfonyl fluoride under triplet energy&#8208;transfer catalysis. This method features mild reaction conditions, metal&#8208;free photocatalysts, and excellent tolerance to various functional groups. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of further modifying the FSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;functionalized indoline products via SuFEx click reactions, enabling their conjugation with other molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible light induced halogen bond assisted Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction of indole and chalcones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. The use of halogen bonding interactions as an alternative to acid and metal catalysts for substrate activation has gained popularity in recent years. In this work we demonstrate a halogen bond assisted activation of chalcones under visible light irradiation for the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction with indole to yield &#946;&#8208;indolylketones. The simple and scalable protocol uses the readily available CBr4 as halogen bond catalyst. The targets are produced in 31&#8208;94% of yield with excellent functional group tolerance. The proposed mechanism of the reaction is supported by UV&#8208;vis, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopic studies. Further it is demonstrated that the &#946;&#8208;indolylketones can be oxidised to indole substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones by DDQ or cyclized to thieno[2,3&#8208;b]indoles in the presence of elemental sulfur and base.</dc:description>

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Markovnikov Hydroarylation of Arylcyclobutene: A Route to gem&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;Substituted Cyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A regioselective Markovnikov hydroarylation of arylcyclobutene has been developed using Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis through a protonation/Friedel&#8208;Crafts sequence. The metal&#8208;free catalytic reaction is operationally simple and feasible compared to previous reports that utilized elaborate arylcyclobutene and specific polyfluorinated reagents, affording a variety of gem&#8208;diaryl&#8208; substituted arylcyclobutene in good to excellent yields. The possible mechanism of the reaction has been explored through step&#8208;by&#8208;step control experiments. This protocol involving indole in gem&#8208;diaryl&#8208;substituted cyclobutene scaffolds not only enriches the applications of Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed hydroarylation, but also paves the way for a more extensive access to potential bioactive cyclobutanes structures.</dc:description>

Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed conditions for diazidation or acetoxy/hydroxylation of N&#8208;allyl sulfonamides by using Pd(OAc)2 as the catalyst combined with Mn(OAc)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O have been developed. The 1,2&#8208;diazidation reaction of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond occurs in mild conditions (i.&#8201;e. NaN3 as azide source in THF at room temperature), whereas the 1,2&#8208;acetoxy/hydroxylation requires an excess of Mn(OAc)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O. The well&#8208;known ability of this reagent to act through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) makes plausible a radical mechanism involving high valent palladium complexes.

         <title>Complexes of Borane and 1,3,5&#8208;Triazinane&#8208;Derived Carbenes</title>

Abstract
Complexes of borane with six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes derived from readily accessible 1,3,5&#8208;triazinium salts are described. Similar to the widely used imidazolium&#8208;type borane complex, the obtained complexes behave as agents for the hydrogen atom transfer in the Giese reaction and as sources of the boryl radicals in addition to imines. The amine nitrogen of these complexes does not undergo alkylation, but it can bind with another borane molecule.

         <title>Synthesis of Alkynylsilanes: A Review of the State of the Art</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
This contribution offers a comprehensive overview of methods for forging sp C&#8722;Si bonds. Over time, alkynylsilanes (silylacetylenes), once considered mere byproducts of hydrosilylation processes, have become essential building blocks in organic synthesis. This literature review traces the evolution of their synthesis, from traditional methodologies relying on organolithium and organomagnesium compounds to more advanced cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving hydro&#8208; and carbosilanes. Focused primarily on the past 25&#8197;years (2000&#8211;2024), it also extensively references significant historical breakthroughs. By analyzing synthetic methodologies, the review not only offers a comprehensive survey of the current state of knowledge but also identifies areas for improvement. Furthermore, to emphasize the importance of 1&#8208;alkynylsilanes (1&#8208;silyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkynes), selected applications of these compounds are highlighted, confirming their significant potential in organic synthesis.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation of Benzimidates or NH&#8208;Benzaldimines with Ynamides: Synthesis of 1&#8208;Alkoxy&#8208; and 1&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;3&#8208;Aminoisoquinolines</title>

Abstract
Inexpensive cobalt&#8208;catalyzed, pivalic acid&#8208;assisted oxidative C&#8722;H functionalization of benzimidates or NH&#8208;benzaldimines with ynamides is presented, providing an access to 3&#8208;aminoisoquinoline derivatives. The procedure is compatible with various substrates featuring alkyl, alkoxy, acyl or halogen as substituents, heteroaryl structures, and diverse ynamides. The reaction has been scaled up, with subsequent transformation of the yielded products. Control experiments and mechanistic investigations corroborate the regioselectivity of this conversion, positioning the amine group proximal to the nitrogen atom in isoquinolines.

Abstract
We have developed an approach for the construction of naphthofuran&#8208;2&#8208;carboxaldehyde derivatives utilizing the synergy of electrochemical oxidation and organo&#8208;selenium catalysis at room temperature. The compatibility of various functional groups and scalability of this protocol demonstrate the practicality of the electrochemical strategy. The synthetic utility of this strategy is furthermore demonstrated by synthesizing diversified molecules through downstream transformations.

Abstract
n&#8208;Bu4NI/K2S2O8 mediated transformylation from p&#8208;anisaldehyde to primary amides is reported. The mechanistic studies suggest the reaction occurs via a single electron transfer pathway. Based on the DFT electronic structure calculations of various reaction pathways, the most plausible mechanism involves the formation of a phenyl radical cation and an arenium ion as the key intermediates. It represents the first example where p&#8208;anisaldehyde is employed as a formyl source via a non&#8208;metal mediated Csp2&#8722;Csp2 bond cleavage.

Abstract
Two N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin&#8208;phosphines (NHOP), and the corresponding ruthenium complexes were synthesized and structurally characterized. One of the cationic complexes [(BzIM)(NHOP)Ru(p&#8208;cymene)Cl2]I was employed as a catalyst in N&#8208;benzylbenzamides/alkyne coupling reactions. With this catalytic protocol a variety of substituted isoquinolones were synthesized through ortho&#8208;selective double C&#8722;H bond functionalization involving oxidative annulation followed by olefination reactions. All these products were achieved in one&#8208;pot manner without the use of additives.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Formation of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes Using Oxime Esters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
In this manuscript a general photocatalytic approach for the synthesis of alkyl&#8208;substituted gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes using readily available oxime esters and 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoroprop&#8208;2&#8208;ene (BDFP) has been established. This strategy involving a radical bromo elimination provides access to a large variety of value&#8208;added fluorinated molecules. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with many functional groups including complex natural products or drug molecules. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic investigations indicate that the efficiency of the process relies on the crucial role of imine radical, which is formed after photoexcitation via energy transfert (EnT) and decarboxylation of the oxime ester. Indeed, the imine radical would either behave as a bromine radical scavenger or an XAT promoter in this reaction.

         <title>Insights into the Enantioselective Au(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions between 2&#8208;Alkynyl Ketones and Naphthols using the TCDC Approach</title>

Abstract
The CPAPhosAuCl bifunctional complexes catalyse the enantioselective tandem cycloisomerization&#8208;nucleophilic addition reactions between 2&#8208;alkynylenones and naphthols, where naphthols behave mainly as O&#8208;nucleophiles. The inherent acidity of the catalysts induces then the isomerization of the O&#8208;addition&#8208; into the C&#8208;addition products with concomitant decrease of their enantiomeric excesses. In depth mechanistic studies have provided insights into these processes. Subsequently, the undesired racemization pathways could be suppressed by using substituted naphthols as nucleophiles, which delivered a large series of chiral bicyclic furanes in high enantioselectivities.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Promoted Domino Processes for the Synthesis of Homoallylic Amines, Quinolines and Tetrahydroquinolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, the synthesis of homoallylic amines, quinolines, and tetrahydroquinolines has been demonstrated. The domino one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component approach has been accomplished using Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed conditions. A useful scaffold construction strategy can be achieved by controlling the electronic effect of aniline rather than relying on reaction conditions. The described method applies to a wide variety of substrates embedded with diverse functional groups and can be extended toward the synthesis of natural products. Suitable control experiments, real&#8208;time NMR studies, and DFT calculations have validated the reported process. The protocol outlines a strategy for synthesizing homoallylic amines and quinolines, controlled by the electronic properties of anilines.

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Selective Synthesis of Alkynyl Sulfides via C&#8722;S Bond Cleavage of Alkynyl Sulfonium Salts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An effective one&#8208;pot approach has been devised for the selective synthesis of alkynyl sulfides through the cleavage of C&#8722;S bonds in alkynyl sulfonium salts. This method involves a base&#8208;promoted nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening and desulfurization pathway, enabling the efficient preparation of diverse alkynyl sulfide compounds. The reaction demonstrates excellent tolerance to various functional groups and proves applicable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules and pharmaceuticals. Moreover, the practicality of this method has been underscored through scale&#8208;up reaction and modification of alkynyl sulfide products.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Peptidols via Reductive Cleavage Through a Benzotriazole Linker</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Peptidols were prepared through the reductive cleavage of benzotriazole intermediates obtained from the on&#8208;bead activation of 3,4&#8208;diaminobenzoyl linkers. Remarkably, this method used commercially available amino acid residues and resins without further modification. Pure peptidols were collected with only filtration in 49%&#8211;87% yield. Only the derivatives with aspartic acid as the first C&#8208;terminal residue required sophisticated chromatography purification. Esters and carboxylic acids were identified as side products and were suppressed by additional reduction or reduction in DMF. Remarkably, the reduction of peptides with the first aspartic acid residue at the C&#8208;terminal afforded a C&#8208;terminal lactone, which could be reduced by deprotection at 0&#8201;&#176;C. For the synthesis of branched peptidols, the bulky wedge structures of the branched peptides resulted in low total yields, which were improved to 23%&#8211;28% by using peripheral Boc groups and SPPS on the Tental gel resin. In addition, this method gave two peptaibols, SPF&#8208;5506&#8208;A4 and Ac&#8208;Gramicidin A, in 11% and 46% yields, respectively.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peptidols were prepared through the reductive cleavage of benzotriazole intermediates obtained from the on-bead activation of 3,4-diaminobenzoyl linkers. Remarkably, this method used commercially available amino acid residues and resins without further modification. Pure peptidols were collected with only filtration in 49%&#8211;87% yield. Only the derivatives with aspartic acid as the first C-terminal residue required sophisticated chromatography purification. Esters and carboxylic acids were identified as side products and were suppressed by additional reduction or reduction in DMF. Remarkably, the reduction of peptides with the first aspartic acid residue at the C-terminal afforded a C-terminal lactone, which could be reduced by deprotection at 0&#8201;&#176;C. For the synthesis of branched peptidols, the bulky wedge structures of the branched peptides resulted in low total yields, which were improved to 23%&#8211;28% by using peripheral Boc groups and SPPS on the Tental gel resin. In addition, this method gave two peptaibols, SPF-5506-A4 and Ac-Gramicidin A, in 11% and 46% yields, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A three&#8208;component strategy for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl allyl alcohols from 1,3&#8208;dienes is developed. A diverse range of synthetically valuable &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl allyl alcohols are obtained in moderate to high yields. Broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance are observed. This method is also applicable to mono&#8208;olefins and 1,3&#8208;enynes. The control experiment results demonstrate that the hydroxyl group OH in the product comes from TBHP. In addition, the practicality and mild reaction conditions make these synthetic transformations attractive and valuable for organic synthesis.

The front cover picture illustrates the cooperative action of carboxylic acids in ruthenium&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H oxygenation. Dicarboxylic acids, such as maleic acid, dramatically increase the basicity and electrophilicity of metal(oxo) intermediates through intramolecular electrostatic interactions. The ruthenium catalyst system, which incorporates the cooperative action of carboxylic acids, has become a powerful C&#8722;H oxidation method that offers both reactivity and site&#8208;selectivity. It progresses with site&#8208; and chemo&#8208;selectivity in the C&#8722;H oxidation using hydrogen peroxide as a terminal oxidant, even in multifunctionalized complex natural products.

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of Chiral Heterocycles via Asymmetric Carbon&#8208;Heteroatom Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral heterocyclic compounds play a crucial role in the pharmaceutical science, materials science, and agrochemical industries. The critical step for synthesizing chiral heterocycles is the formation of asymmetric carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds, which can be achieved in a chiral environment under thermal or photochemical conditions. However, photochemical asymmetric transformation has become an area of immense growth in the past 15 years. In the drug discovery and development era, chiral photochemical transformations have drawn the attention of researchers to develop new synthetic strategies for chiral heterocycles via asymmetric carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond formation. Chiral photochemistry in the pathway of asymmetric synthesis requires a chirality source which is transferred to the products. A catalytic chiral metal complexing agent or a chiral photosensitizer that generally follows a single electron transfer (SET) or oxidative and reductive quenching cycle has been widely exploited to achieve this goal. In this review, we have demonstrated the recent development of photochemical synthesis of chiral heterocycles via asymmetric carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond formation by using a chiral metal catalyst, asymmetric organocatalyst, or dual catalytic system based on their plausible mechanism.</dc:description>

Abstract
A Ruthenium(II) catalyzed additive&#8208;free oxidative, dehydrogenative annulation of different malemides on 3,4&#8208;disubstituted isoquinolone to afford fused and spiro&#8208;cyclized isoquinolo&#8208;isoquinolone and isoindolo&#8208;isoquinolone derivatives is reported here. By simply changing solvent and oxidizing agents, under two different conditions, this methodology produced two different poly&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclized products. Isoquinolone&#8208;NH was strategically used as the internal directing group in the ortho C&#8722;H activation using Ru(II) catalyst. Mechanistically dehydrogenative, oxidative C&#8722;C followed by C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling and aza&#8208;michael reaction pathway led to the corresponding fused and spiro&#8208;products respectively. A diversified library of eighty&#8208;one (81) such two products were synthesized by employing this methodology. The fused and the spirocyclized polyheterocyclic compounds absorbed at &#955;max 240&#8211;270&#8197;nm range, however only spiro&#8208;compounds produced blue fluorescence at &#955;em 391&#8211;450&#8197;nm range.

Abstract
Herein, we present an approach for catalytic orthogonal glycosylation utilizing earth&#8208;abundant copper carbenes. This method operates under mild conditions and employs readily accessible starting materials, including benchtop stable enynal&#8208;derived glycosyl donors, synthesized at the gram scale. The reaction accommodates a variety of glycosyl acceptors, including primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols. The enynal&#8208;derived copper carbenes exhibit remarkable reactivity and selectivity, allowing for the formation of glycosidic linkages with different protecting groups and stereochemical patterns. This approach provides access to both 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208; and &#8208;trans&#8208;glycosidic linkages. The product stereoselectivity is independent of the anomeric configuration of the glycosyl donor, which also has orthogonal reactivity to widely used alkynes and thioglycoside donors. An iterative synthesis of a trisaccharide further demonstrates the application of this orthogonal reactivity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we present an approach for catalytic orthogonal glycosylation utilizing earth-abundant copper carbenes. This method operates under mild conditions and employs readily accessible starting materials, including benchtop stable enynal-derived glycosyl donors, synthesized at the gram scale. The reaction accommodates a variety of glycosyl acceptors, including primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols. The enynal-derived copper carbenes exhibit remarkable reactivity and selectivity, allowing for the formation of glycosidic linkages with different protecting groups and stereochemical patterns. This approach provides access to both 1,2-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;- and -&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-glycosidic linkages. The product stereoselectivity is independent of the anomeric configuration of the glycosyl donor, which also has orthogonal reactivity to widely used alkynes and thioglycoside donors. An iterative synthesis of a trisaccharide further demonstrates the application of this orthogonal reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Herein, we report a photocatalytic method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;quinolones under mild conditions by employing &#945;&#8208;diazo acetamide as substrates. The use of Eosin Y as a photocatalyst allows an economical and environmentally benign synthetic method. The process involves the generation of radicals from diazo compounds promoted by a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism. The method demonstrates a broad substrate scope to provide various aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;quinolones. To support the proposed mechanism, a series of mechanistic experiments were conducted.

Abstract
Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed and solvent&#8208;switched [3+2]&#8208;spiroannulation and [4+n] (n=1, 2, 3) annulations of 2&#8208;aryl quinazolinone or 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophthalazine&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones with ynones or alkynyl alcohol or 1,3&#8208;diynes under mild reaction conditions have been analyzed. These reactions take place in the presence of the appropriate solvent and features a redox&#8208;neutral pathway. Ynone serves as an &#8216;atypical one&#8208;carbon unit&#8217; in [4+1] annulation and generates a tetrasubstituted carbon center bearing diverse heterocycles through [3+2] and [4+1] annulation strategies. Post transformations of the synthesized spiro&#8208;products augments the potential of the developed methodology.

Abstract
Dehydrogenative coupling (DC) is an attractive approach to constructing new C&#8722;N bonds using alcohols as electrophiles. In &#8216;hydrogen&#8208;borrowing&#8217; variants of DC, the H2 liberated can be used to re&#8208;hydrogenate unsaturated intermediates to produce saturated products. Here, we show how so&#8208;generated H2 can also be used to replace fluorine atoms with hydrogens in CF3 groups in a tandem dehydrogenative coupling/hydrodefluorination process.

Abstract
Vanillin is a key organoleptic component in vanilla, one of the most important natural flavors in the industry. The limited supply of natural vanilla, extracted from cured vanilla beans, elevates the commercial value of &#8216;natural&#8217;&#8208;labeled vanillin, producible by microbial conversion of natural precursors such as ferulic acid, eugenol, isoeugenol, lignin, and glucose. However, cellular toxicity and undesirable overoxidation of vanillin remain challenges to the microbial methods. Here, we developed a one&#8208;pot enzymatic conversion of capsaicinoids to vanillin by retracing the biosynthetic pathway found in Capsicum plants. The enzyme cascade consists of the hydrolysis of capsaicinoids by immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB) and the oxidative deamination of the resulting vanillylamine by &#969;&#8208;transaminase from Paracoccus denitrificans (PDTA). Process optimization of individual enzyme reactions was conducted on an analytical scale, enabling&gt;95% reaction yield of vanillin from capsaicinoids in the one&#8208;pot cascade reaction without undesirable accumulation of the oxidation byproduct and the inhibitory reaction intermediate, i.&#8201;e., vanillic acid and vanillylamine, respectively. To verify practical applicability, we performed a preparative&#8208;scale reaction starting with 1.75&#8197;g capsaicinoids and 2.75&#8197;g sodium pyruvate at 10&#8197;mg/mL CALB and 3&#8197;&#956;M PDTA, leading to an 81% reaction yield and a 57% isolation yield. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of one&#8208;pot production of vanillin from capsaicinoids, which might pave the way for cost&#8208;effective and sustainable access to natural&#8208;labeled vanillin from a renewable feedstock readily available from Capsicum fruits.

Abstract
Herein, we report a chemo&#8208; and regioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed redox C7&#8208;spiroannulation reaction of N&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole indolines with maleimides, resulting in a series of N&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole indoline fused azaspirocycles in up to 92% yield. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by the synthesis of highly functionalized nitrogen&#8208;containing spiropolycyclic skeletons. The annulation reaction could also be performed with maleic esters and acrylates. The products were purified by simple filtration. The Rh catalyst can be recycled, and the reaction could be performed at gram&#8208;scale using 0.5&#8197;mol% of catalyst, which makes this protocol potentially applicable in industry. Moreover, the efficient post&#8208;modification of pharmaceutical molecules demonstrates its practicability.

Abstract
An intermolecular addition reaction involving an unconventional combination of a diarylmethyl anion and an electrophile, which is mediated by the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis, was developed. Diarylmethyl anions having a benzofuran moiety were generated through the rearrangement with the aid of a catalytic amount of phosphazene base P2&#8208;tBu. The resulting carbanion intermediates were trapped by various electrophiles, such as &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, aryl aldehydes, &#945;&#8208;ketoesters, and N&#8208;Boc imines, providing the corresponding diarylalkane derivatives in good yields.

Abstract
A visible light&#8208;mediated strategy for the preparation of aromatic stannanes from aryl halides (mostly aryl bromides) is presented herein. The reaction proceeds under metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions and exhibits a broad substrate scope. The products obtained have been employed in the C&#8722;C bond formation via Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Mechanistic investigation evidenced the key role of both aryl radical and trimethylstannyl radical in Ar&#8722;Sn bond formation.

Abstract
Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkenylation and arylation of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines with alkenyl and aryl carboxylic acids under microwave assistance have been realized. Using [Rh(CO)2(acac)] as the catalyst and Piv2O as the acid activator, 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines undergo C8&#8208;selective decarbonylative C&#8722;H alkenylation with a wide range of alkenyl and aryl carboxylic acids, affording the C8&#8208;alkenylated or arylated 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines. This method enables the synthesis of C8&#8208;alkenylated 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines that would otherwise be difficult to access by means of conventional C&#8722;H alkenylation protocols. Moreover, this catalytic system also works well in C8&#8208;selective decarbonylative C&#8722;H arylation of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines with aryl carboxylic acids. The catalytic activity strongly depends on the choice of the N&#8208;directing group, with the readily installable and removable N&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrimidyl) group being optimal. The catalytic pathway is elucidated by mechanistic experiments.

Abstract
Enantioselective access to polycyclic tetrahydroxanthone compounds was achieved through an organocatalyzed cascade reaction of alkene&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;diketones and alkenyloxindoles, using quinine&#8208;derived squaramide as an efficient catalyst. It afforded a variety of optically active spirooxindole&#8208;based tetrahydroxanthones with 18&#8211;94% yields, &gt;19:1 dr, and 86&#8211;99% ee.

Abstract
Herein, we report a photochemical synthesis of 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl containing quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones through consecutive photoredox catalysed reactions.

Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroacylation of unsaturated substrates with aldehydes involving the formyl C(sp2)&#8722;H bond activation provides an expedient and efficient access to the carbonyl compounds such as ketones and esters, which are a class of important scaffolds in natural products and in drug development. Recently, extensive attention has been paid to the hydroacylation reactions of the components containing an alkenyl moiety that can trigger a regioselective transformation in the presence of a transition metal catalyst. In this review, we summarize the constructive endeavors in rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed (formal) hydroacylation reactions from 2018, and the plausible pathway is also dissected to offer some insights into the reaction mechanism.

Abstract
The Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction stands as a powerful synthetic tool for C&#8722;H functionalization of aromatic feedstocks, which is conventionally realized through electrophilic alkylation and acylation. The burgeoning interests in axially chiral compounds across diverse fields have spurred extensive exploration of this classic transformation for catalytic atroposelective synthesis. Consequently, the past decade has witnessed the rapid expansion of various non&#8208;canonical Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions, including electrophilic arylation, alkenylation, halogenation, sulfenylation, and amination of aryl C&#8722;H bonds, thereby delving into new chemical spaces. A range of catalytic atroposelective synthetic methods have been devised for these significant arene C&#8722;H functionalization. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the cutting&#8208;edge catalytic synthesis of atropoisomers through non&#8208;canonical Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions, categorized into three parts based on the type of bond formation on the aromatics: C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formations, C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) bond formations and C(sp2)&#8722;heteroatom bond formations. The richness of electrophiles and the modulation of atroposelectivity by diverse chiral organocatalysts, particularly chiral Br&#248;nsted acids, are elucidated. We anticipate that the repertoire of asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction will continue to flourish and to be demonstrated in not only scientific researches but also industrial organic synthesis.

Abstract
Aryl halides are one of the most important chemical feedstocks in pharmaceuticals due to its easy accessibility, inexpensiveness, and widely utilized as aryl radical precursors in organic synthetic chemistry. Conventionally, the stoichiometric reagents such as AIBN/n&#8208;Bu3SnH were used for generation of aryl radical from aryl halides, and suffered from requirement of toxic radical initiators, high temperature and thus, the development of simple, mild strategies for the generation of aryl radical from aryl halides are highly desirable. Recently, visible light mediated strategies received considerable attention, allowing the generation of aryl radical from aryl halides under mild reaction conditions. The present review described the recent breakthroughs and advancements in visible light mediated photocatalyst&#8208;free C&#8722;B/C/O/P/Se/S bond formation of aryl halides.

         <title>A Solely Fe&#8208;Catalyzed Sonogashira&#8208;Type Coupling of non&#8208;Activated Secondary Alkyl Iodides with Terminal Alkynes</title>

Abstract
An iron&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling of non&#8208;activated secondary alkyl iodides with terminal alkynes is described. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions in N&#8208;MethylPyrrolidone without auxiliary ligand or co&#8208;catalyst. This procedure allowed the obtention of 28 coupling products. Moreover, slow addition of LiHMDS base allows to achieve up to 89% yields. This method enables the conversion of non&#8208;activated alkyl iodides in a Fe&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling, which was so far not achievable with iron catalysts. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest the implication of a key single electron transfer in the catalytic process.

Abstract
In this work, we reported a method for construction of difluorocyclopropanes through visible light&#8208;promoted [1+2] cycloaddition reaction of aryl diazo esters with gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, encompasses a wide range of substrates (36 examples), exhibits good tolerance to various substituents, and demonstrates a diastereoselectivity of &gt;20:1. Additionally, antifungal activity evaluation revealed that these derivatives exhibited certain activity, the EC50 values for the products towards Botrytis cinerea and Rhizoctonia solani were measured to be 1.51 and 1.36&#8197;&#956;M, respectively, which are significantly lower than those of commercial fungicides Hymexazol and Azoxystrobin. This work not only provides an efficient method for the synthesis of difluorocyclopropanyl derivatives, but reveals their potential applications in fungicide creation.

Abstract
The transmetalation triggered rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation and tandem annulation of 2&#8208;biphenylboronic acids with sulfoxonium ylides or iodonium ylides has been developed. Various products of phenanthrenes were constructed under redox&#8208;neutral conditions in 34&#8211;86% yields. Several mechanism exploration experiments and derivatization reactions were conducted in sequence to gain a deeper understanding of the process and the potential of this transformation. It offers an alternative approach for the synthesis of phenanthrene derivatives.

Abstract
The direct conversion of specific C&#8722;H bonds to C&#8722;Si bonds in alkanes or aromatics via catalytic methods has attracted growing research interest. Herein, we report the preparation of a new iridium catalyst supported on a naphthyridine&#8208;based porous organic polymer and its successful application in the dehydrogenative silylation of 2&#8208;arylphenols or alcohol and hydrosilanes to access ring&#8208;fused oxasilacycles. The synthetic method exhibits broad substrate scope and good functional group compatibility while avoiding the use of hydrogen acceptors. In addition, this organic polymer supported iridium catalyst could be easily recovered from the reaction system and reused for at least seven times without apparent deactivation. This research provides new insights for the further design of heterogeneous nanocatalysts and contributes to the synthesis of silicon&#8208;substituted functional molecules.

Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free dearomative aza&#8208;spirocyclization reaction of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles is established by using molecular iodine under basic conditions. The required substrates were prepared via sequential Fisher indole synthesis and sulfonylation. This dearomatization reaction is amenable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and provides access to various spiroindolenine derivatives from indole sulfonamide precursors.

Abstract
Dinucleoside 5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;polyphosphates (NpnNs) play essential roles in various biological processes. Access to these high value&#8208;added compounds, while avoiding the many drawbacks of solution phase synthesis, is a challenge that has been overcome thanks to mechanochemistry. A straightforward solid&#8208;state synthesis based on activation of phosphate or pyrophosphate sodium salts to their diimidazolides, followed by coupling with commercially available nucleotides, under air conditions, gave symmetrical NpnNs. The scope ranged from Np3Ns to highly challenging Np6Ns. The methodology has also been implemented using medronic acid and imidodiphosphate to obtain NpnNs analogues, some of which are unprecedented.

Abstract
Dihydroquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones, recognized for their bioactive properties, feature a six&#8208;membered structure with nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. A method has been developed for synthesizing enantioenriched 3,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives. This approach utilizes an asymmetric [4+2]&#8208;cyclization process, combining 2&#8208;amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes with azlactones, and is facilitated by a bifunctional squaramide&#8208;based organocatalyst.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dihydroquinolin-2-ones, recognized for their bioactive properties, feature a six-membered structure with nitrogen-containing heterocycles. A method has been developed for synthesizing enantioenriched 3,4-dihydroquinoline-2-one derivatives. This approach utilizes an asymmetric [4+2]-cyclization process, combining 2-amino-&#946;-nitrostyrenes with azlactones, and is facilitated by a bifunctional squaramide-based organocatalyst. This process has enabled the creation of chiral 3,4-dihydroquinoline-2-ones with complex structures, including chiral tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenters, delivering corresponding products in 26&#8211;95% yield with a diastereomeric ratio of 1.2:1&#8211;19:1 and 52&#8211;97 ee.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
We report herein an enantioselective [3+3] annulation of indoline&#8208;2&#8208;thiones with yne&#8211;enones by chiral dinuclear zinc catalysts via a Br&#248;nsted base and Lewis acid cooperative activation model. This transformation proceeded through sequential conjugate addition, allenyl ketone formation and intramolecular sulfa&#8208;Michael 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization. A range of enantioenriched tetrahydrothiopyrano[2,3&#8208;b]indole derivatives bearing an exocyclic double bond were obtained in moderate yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 20 : 1 dr, 20:1 Z/E ratio and 95% ee). Late&#8208;stage functionalization, large&#8208;scale experiment and further derivatizations were also explored.

         <title>Engineering Styrene Oxide Isomerase Towards Enhanced Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;Flurbiprofen</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conventional synthesis of (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;flurbiprofen, a valuable non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID), involves inefficient chiral resolution with low&#8208;yielding multiple reaction steps, or asymmetric synthesis with low enantioselectivity and/or regioselectivity. Here, we developed high&#8208;yielding, enantioselective, and sustainable synthesis of (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;flurbiprofen via two chemoenzymatic approaches from a simple alkene: (A) enzymatic epoxidation&#8208;isomerization&#8208;oxidation cascade and Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation; and (B) chemical epoxidation, enzymatic isomerization&#8208;oxidation cascade, and Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation. Styrene oxide isomerase (SOI)&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;retentive Meinwald rearrangement was the key step in the two pathways, but SOI suffers from low activity. SOI was engineered via two rounds of iterative saturation mutagenesis and screening with a three&#8208;enzyme cascade assay, generating a double&#8208;mutant SOI&lt;sub&gt;DM&lt;/sub&gt; (N99A/D95A) with 5.5&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic efficiency (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;). In Pathway A, cascade biotransformation of 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylstyrene with engineered &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; strain expressing SOI&lt;sub&gt;DM&lt;/sub&gt;, styrene monooxygenase (SMO) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), and subsequent Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation afforded (S)&#8208;flurbiprofen in 98% yield and 91% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;. In Pathway B, chemical epoxidation (Sharpless dihydroxylation and ring&#8208;closing), cascade conversion using an engineered &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; strain expressing SOI&lt;sub&gt;DM&lt;/sub&gt;, ALDH and NADH oxidase (NOX), and Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation produced (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;flurbiprofen in 83% yield and 98% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;. Compared to conventional synthesis, the developed methods reduced reaction steps, minimized waste generation and improved enantioselectivity or overall yield.</dc:description>

Abstract
Under the catalysis of Rh2(OAc)4 (10&#8197;mol%) and (&#177;)&#8208;Me&#8208;Pybox (20&#8197;mol%) in 1,2&#8208;DCE at 80&#8201;&#176;C, the homocoupling/[4+1] cycloaddition cascade of diazobarbiturates with diazopyrazolones proceeded readily and provided spirobarbiturates in 32&#8211;88% chemical yields. The chemical structure of the obtained spirobarbiturates was identified by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <dc:description>An iron&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the synthesis of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole heterocyclic structures is disclosed employing isatins and non&#8208;nucleophilic N&#8208;methoxybenzamides. This reaction class is associated with broad scope and tolerates numerous functionalities, such as fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo, trifluoromethyl, nitrile, ester, ether, and alkenyl, including heteroaryl &#8208; thiophene, benzothiophene, carbazolyl, indolyl, eugenol, and polycyclic cholesterol moieties. Detailed mechanistic investigations reveal that the reaction proceeds via iron&#8208;catalyzed N&#8210;O bond cleavage in N&#8208;methoxybenzamides, generating formaldehyde and benzamide, and through the intermediacy of isatin&#8208;ketimines and N&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)benzamides.

Abstract
The chiral P,N,N&#8208;ligands represented a new type of tridentate ligand developed in recent years and displayed wide utilities in asymmetric catalysis. In the past decades, numerous chiral P,N,N&#8208;ligands with ferrocene, phenethylamine and spiro backbones were synthesized by addition of an aminopyridine, imidazole or diamines coordinating group. These chiral tridentate P,N,N&#8208;ligands showed excellent performance in the ruthenium, iridium, manganese, or cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenations. A wide range of substrates, including simple ketones, &#945;&#8208;halogenated ketones, &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones, &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;amino keto&#8208; ones, &#945;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, or &#948;&#8208;keto acids, &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;keto amides, &#946;&#8208; or &#948;&#8208;keto esters, &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;enones, olefins, imines, quinolines and indoles, could be hydrogenated to afford the corresponding chiral products with high yields and enantioselectivities. In this review, progress on the asymmetric hydrogenation of C=O, C=N, C=C bonds with chiral tridentate P,N,N&#8208;ligands was summarized.

         <title>Photochemical and Electrochemical Synthesis of Oxazoles and Isoxazoles: An Update</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
This review presents an outline of current advancements in the photochemical and electrochemical synthesis of oxazoles and isoxazoles. Oxazole and isoxazole are important building blocks for a variety of medicinally useful compounds. Therefore, the synthesis of these heterocycles via sustainable technologies is worth demanding. Photochemical and electrochemical are two among the few sustainable technologies. This review covers a brief discussion on reaction parameters like catalysts, substrates scope, reaction temperature, solvents, electrodes, electrolytes (in case of electrochemical process), light source (in case of photochemical process) for individual reaction. Detailed discussion on mechanistic insight for each reaction is also presented. Finally, summary, and future direction toward the development of effective electrochemical and photochemical methods for the reaction of oxazoles and isoxazoles is also presented.

         <title>Recent Advances in Radical Transformations of Propargylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Propargylic alcohols are regarded as a class of readily available and versatile synthons in organic synthesis. Due to their unique bifunctional character, the transformation of propargylic alcohols has been widely utilized as a powerful strategy for the construction of various functionalized frameworks over the past few decades. Recently, the radical transformation of propargylic alcohols has attracted considerable attention in synthetic chemistry. This review summarizes recent progress in the radical transformation of propargylic alcohols. Based on the different mechanisms of radical formation underlying these transformations, this review has been divided into four parts: (1) transition&#8208;metal catalyzed radical transformation; (2) photo&#8208;induced radical transformation; (3) electro&#8208;induced radical transformation; and (4) metal&#8208;free or oxidant&#8208;mediated radical transformation of propargylic alcohols.

Abstract
We describe a catalyst, oxidant, and coupling&#8208;reagent free strategy to access 4&#8208;membered heterocycles, representing a unique example of visible&#8208;light triggered intramolecular cyclization of propargylic alcohols and amines to access oxetanones and azetidinones respectively. Despite the direct 4&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization from these starting materials has proven to be unfavorable, the formation of key p&#8208;quinone methide intermediacy allows an efficient bypass for regioselective 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization, resulting in the formation of the desired 4&#8208;membered heterocycles. This mild and operationally simple protocol facilitates the synthesis of products with distinct substitution patterns such as quaternary &#945;&#8208;carbons, and enables late&#8208;stage functionalization.

Abstract
A process for the synthesis of aryl thioglycosides from the aryl thianthrenium salts and 1&#8208;thiosugars is achieved by copper(I)&#8208;mediated, photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reactions. The desired products could be obtained in 32% to 78% yield after irradiation with 34&#8197;W blue light at room temperature. Various functional groups, especially including halogen groups, were well tolerated under standard reaction conditions. This strategy differs conceptually from all previous S&#8208;glycosylations in that thiosugar functionality could be incorporated into complex natural products or drugs at a late stage site&#8208;selectively, which has not been shown via aryl halides and aryldiazonium salts.

Abstract
The domino annulation reactions of o&#8208;aminotrifluoroacetophenone derivatives and MBH carbonates enabled by PPh3 have been reported, which provide a series of tetrahydrofuro[3,2&#8208;b]indolines containing a CF3&#8208;substituted tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenters in yields of 74 to 95% and &gt;20:1 dr. In this process, MBH carbonates were used as C1/C3 synthons. The MTT assay shows that the products exhibit the activity of inhibitory effect on proliferation on Hela cancer cell line.

Abstract
While the emergence of electrophotochemistry provides opportunities, such a chemistry at this stage suffers from limited reaction types and high photocatalyst loadings. A self&#8208;catalyzed electrophotosynthesis as well as one with a low photocatalyst loading is presented. These external&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free cyclizations are enabling and applicable to a range of activated alkenes, affording a diverse array of thiocyanato heterocycles including 4&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones, isoquinoline&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones, indolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolin&#8208;6(5H)&#8208;ones, benzoimidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolin&#8208;6(5H)&#8208;ones and indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones, and the protocols are amenable to the late&#8208;stage diversification of complex molecular architectures as well as gram&#8208;scale syntheses. Sunlight could serve as the light source, and the reaction could be conducted in an all&#8208;solar&#8208;driven mode using a commercially available photovoltaic panel to produce electricity.

         <title>N&#8208;Tosylhydrazones as [N,N] Synthons in Heterocyclic Chemistry: Synthesis of 3,5&#8208;Disubstituted N&#8208;Alkenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazoles</title>

Abstract
A new mode of reactivity of N&#8208;sulfonylhydrazones towards alkynes is described: ketone&#8208;derived N&#8208;tosylhydrazones (NTHs) bearing &#945;&#8208;H atoms behave as [NN] synthons in their reactions with alkoxy alkynyl Fischer carbene complexes (FCCs) and only the two N atoms are incorporated into the newly formed pyrazole ring. The scope of the reaction, leading to 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;N&#8208;alkenyl pyrazoles, proved to be wide regarding both partners; thus, a variety of aryl and primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl substituents are tolerated within the FCC, while aryl alkyl NTHs, symmetric and asymmetric dialkyl NTHs and NTHs derived of cyclic ketones can be also employed. In addition, the reaction can be performed at large scale and applied for late&#8208;stage diversification of natural products. A reasonable reaction mechanism is also proposed, which is supported by deuteration experiments and DFT calculations.

         <title>Ambiphilic Reactivity of SF5&#8208;Alkynes Applied to Regioselective and Stereodivergent Halogenation Reactions: An Experimental and Theoretical Case Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We explored the ambiphilic reactivity of SF5&#8208;alkynes, and we proved they can act as both nucleophiles and electrophiles. We selected halogenation reactions as benchmark reactions and developed highly selective stereodivergent hydrohalogenation (I, Br, Cl, F) reactions of SF5&#8208;alkynes. The stereochemistry is finely controlled thanks to the nature of the acids used (strong or soft) in the presence of halide source, while the high regioselectivity is governed by the strong polarization of SF5&#8208;alkynes. Mechanistic studies supported by DFT calculations shed light on two different reaction mechanisms responsible of the excellent stereocontrol.
This stereoselectivity was quantitatively rationalized with the ASM and EDA methods. A few dihalogenation reactions are reported and DFT calculations rationalize this cis&#8208;stereoselectivity. Relative configuration of all the SF5&#8208;haloalkenes was unambiguously determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Noteworthy, several post&#8208;functionalization reactions such as cross&#8208;couplings, cyanation and reductions are described to strengthen the synthetic potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectivity Switch in Non&#8208;Directed Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Olefination of Chlorobenzene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8208;H olefination of chlorobenzene derivatives, which favored the  functionalization at the ortho&#8208;to&#8208;chlorine position, was reported. The catalytic system employed a commercially available quinoline ligand to access a wide panel of olefinated aryl chlorides in moderate to high yields from feedstock chemicals (42 examples, 28 to 93% yields). The synthetic utility of the method was further demonstrated by the coupling of various bio&#8208;relevant acrylate partners offering straightforward access to structurally diverse complex molecules. A computational study of the reaction allowed us to confirm that the C&#8208;H activation step, occurring through a concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation mechanism, determined the site&#8208;selectivity of the transformation. The regioselectivity was controlled by the pKa of the C&#8208;H bond (more acidic position) and the lower distortion of chlorobenzene in the key transition structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Hydrosilylation and Hydroboration of Allenes Catalyzed by Cobalt&#8208;Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Achieving precise control over regioselectivity and stereoselectivity in the hydroelementation of terminal allenes presents a formidable challenge. Despite the existence of various catalytic methods for their functionalization, this entire class of reactions remains significantly underdeveloped and demands extensive research. Here, we report a method for the hydroelementation of allenes using inexpensive PN5P pincer cobalt complexes built on a triazine backbone. Depending on the substituent at the ring, the method enables the selective synthesis of E&#8208;alkenylsilane or Z&#8208;allylborane derivatives. In the presented approach, silanes and pinacoloboranes play a dualistic role of simultaneous activator and substrate excluding the need for the addition of external bases. Finally, the application potential of the obtained compounds was demonstrated by performing further functionalizations of the obtained compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Hydrazines by Electrocatalytic Addition of Hydrazines to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy for the synthesis of N,N&#8208;disubstituted hydrazines via the electrocatalytic addition of hydrazine to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds is reported. The reaction was carried out under constant current electrolytic conditions in an undivided cell. Using this methodology, various N,N&#8208;disubstituted hydrazines are prepared with 57&#8208;94% yields in 40 min. By adding cyclohexanone and acetic acid to the reaction mixture of N,N&#8208;disubstituted hydrazines and heating for 2 h, a "one&#8208;pot" synthesis of N&#8208;substituted indoles has also been developed. Furthermore, based on cyclic voltammetry and controlled experiments, a plausible mechanism involving the radical pathway is proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent Heteroarylphosphorothiolation of Alkenes for Accessing &#946;&#8208;Phosphorothiolated Quinoxalinones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a (NH4)2S2O8 mediated difunctionalization reaction of aryl alkenes with quinoxalinones and P(O)SH compounds. This method enables the synthesis of various phosphorothioate&#8208;containing quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives (46 examples) in 37&#8208;79% yields. The reaction is compatible with a range of functional groups and is easily adaptable to large&#8208;scale synthesis. Preliminary studies suggest the involvement of phosphorothioate radicals in these transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Phospholanes via twofold C&#8208;H&#8208;addition to phospholes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. A synthetic route towards phospholanes via twofold C&#8208;H&#8208;addition of a DMSO molecule to &#946;&#8208;H substituted phospholes is described. The resulting fused phospholane oxothiolane system in case of symmetric &#945;&#8208;substitution possesses four stereogenic centers or rather six in case of asymmetric &#945;&#8208;substitution. The reaction conditions are shown to be applicable for a variety of phospholes with different P&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;substituents always leading to stereoselective formation of the fused heterocyclic ring system. All phospholane derivatives with one exception are sufficiently air stable for purification with column chromatography and are fully characterized by NMR and elemental analysis and mass spectrometry. With the help of X&#8208;ray crystallography, the different configurations of the isomers could be demonstrated. For one model system derivatization reactions are presented. When oxidizing or reducing the sulfoxide group only a single diastereomer is observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura/Allylic Substitution: A Regioselective Synthesis of (2&#8208;Arylallyl) Aryl Sulfones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A one&#8208;pot Pd&#8208;catalyzed tandem process to prepare (2&#8208;arylallyl) aryl sulfones has been developed. This strategy is based on the modular assembly of a boronic acid, a sodium sulfinate and 2&#8208;bromoallyl acetate. The reaction is completely regioselective towards the terminal alkene, yielding (2&#8208;arylallyl) aryl (or alkyl) sulfones with yields ranging from 56 to 93%. Control experiments together with DFT calculations allowed to propose a plausible reaction mechanism of the tandem reaction.
The usefulness of this methodology has been demonstrated with the formal synthesis of the marketed drug Apremilast and of several natural products by asymmetric hydrogenation. Using the commercially available UbaPHOX iridium complex, chiral &#946;&#8208;methyl sulfones with up to 98% ee were obtained</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective C6&#8208;Arylation of Thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazole Heterocycles with Aryl Iodides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient and regioselective C6&#8208;arylation of thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazoles with aryl iodides as coupling partners has been developed. This strategy was performed in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 as catalyst in combination with AgOTf as an oxidant and TFA in dimethylacetamide. In all experiments, only the C6&#8208;arylated thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazole was isolated since its C5&#8208;regioisomer was not observed, indicating the high regioselectivity of this approach.
The catalytic system used is compatible with a variety of 3&#8208;functionalized thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazoles and iodoaryl electrophiles, providing access to novel 3,6&#8208;disubstituted thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazoles in moderate to good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Nitrocyclopropanes Bearing a Thioester Group and Three Stereogenic Centers</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A two&#8208;stage protocol was developed for accessing nitrocyclopropanes that bear a thioester group and three stereogenic centers. This protocol achieves practical overall yields ranging from 54% to 75%, along with high levels of stereoselectivity (single diastereomer with up to 98% ee). Brominated monothiomalonate (Br&#8208;MTM) is used as an &#945;&#8208;bromo thioacetate equivalent, which reacts efficiently with nitroolefins in the presence of a low catalyst loading (0.5 mol%) of cinchona alkaloid squaramide under both "on water" and organic homogeneous conditions. The obtained &#945;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitrothioesters undergo an anti&#8208;selective decarboxylation and intramolecular SN2 cyclization process, leading to the formation of desired cyclopropanes. Control experiments were conducted alongside computational studies in order to gain insights into the observed stereoselectivities.</dc:description>

Control experiments were conducted alongside computational studies in order to gain insights into the observed stereoselectivities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetrafluoroethylation of Electron&#8208;Rich Alkenyl Iodides Enabled by &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; Generation of Solvent&#8208;Stabilized &#8220;Ligandless&#8221; CuCF2CF2H</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we have developed a metal&#8208;mediated synthetic method for incorporating the 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl (CF2CF2H) motif into unactivated, electron&#8208;rich alkenyl iodides using cross&#8208;coupling reactions. We discovered that the stable Cu(CF2CF2H)(PPh2Me)3 complex, while unreactive with these substrates, serves as a valuable P&#8208;ligated reservoir for the formation of solvent&#8208;stabilized "ligandless" and reactive CuCF2CF2H species. This transformation occurs upon addition of CuBr, which partially scavenges the P&#8208;ligand in the form of CuBr(PPh2Me)3. The resulting in situ generated solvent stabilized "ligandless" system significantly enhances the reactivity of the complex, particularly towards challenging electron&#8208;rich substrates. This advancement enables the synthesis of HCF2CF2&#8208;glycals, as well as nucleosides/nucleobases and arenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Boracarboxylation of Styrenes Using Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The boracarboxylation reaction has potential for production of natural products and drug candidates, but the development of an asymmetric version of this transformation is challenging. We report an enantioselective boracarboxylation of styrenes, enabled by a copper catalyst containing chiral phosphines. Our experimental conditions provide yields between 31&#8208;76% and enantiomeric ratios from 80:20 up to 98:2 for electron&#8208;rich styrenes. Oxidation of a boracarboxylation product provide (S)&#8208;tropic acid, an intermediate towards several tropane alkaloids. A computational analysis of the mechanistic details shows a complex pattern of competing reaction pathways, explaining challenges encountered when developing asymmetric reactions using CO2.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A formal atom transfer radical [3+2] annulation (ATRAn) reaction between different homoallyl radical precursors and 1,1&#8208;diborylethene was developed. It provides a rapid access to polysubstituted cyclopentanes containing a gem&#8208;diboronic ester moiety. The synthetic utility of theses uniquely functionalized 5&#8208;membered rings is highlighted by their easy conversion to attractive borylated building blocks such as 1&#8208;borylated bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes. The ATRAn reaction was extended to homopropagylic radicals giving access to unique allylic gem&#8208;diboronic esters that could be used in allylboration of aldehydes. Furthermore, this work highlights that 1,1&#8208;diborylethene represents a synthetic equivalent to ketene, a so far elusive radical trap due to its daunting reactivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An efficient and straightforward Cu&#8208;catalyzed vinylation method for alkenyl ethers has been developed. This method demonstrates outstanding performance, delivering high yields and remarkable stereoselectivities for both cyclic and chain alkenyl ether substrates. Furthermore, we have successfully applied this method to directly vinylate the C&#8208;2 position of protected glucals, offering a valuable tool for their functionalization. Moreover, through the utilization of alkenyl alcohols as substrates, we accomplished a 1,2&#8208;alkenyloxylation of alkenyl double bond, enabling the synthesis of functionalized cyclic ether compounds with five or six&#8208;membered rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;light mediated Ugi&#8208;type reaction for the synthesis of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted phthalides
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of diverse phthalides containing quaternary carbon centers remains poorly exploited, requiring stepwise reactions with toxic reagents under high temperatures. Herein, we describe a visible&#8208;light promoted, photo&#8208; and metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free protocol for the modular synthesis of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted phthalides with water as the sole by&#8208;product. This process featured an open&#8208;flask operation of a three&#8208;component reaction involving an isocoumarin as the self&#8208;photosensitizer for aerobic ring contracting rearrangements, allowing the convenient preparation of 3&#8208;(1&#8242;&#8208;indolyl)&#8208;phthalides in moderate to good yields. The mechanistic investigations suggested that singlet oxygen (1O2) was generated through an energy&#8208;transfer pathway.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium catalyst system based on PdCl2(PPh3)2 or PdCl2(dppf) is reported for Suzuki&#8208;type coupling of both N&#8208;aryl and alkyl benzotriazinones with aryl/alkenyl boronic acids to afford a series of ortho&#8208;aryl/alkenyl benzamides in yields up to 99%, showing improvements on catalytic efficiency, substrate scope and practicality. Scope and limitations of the improved protocol have been demonstrated with more than 40 examples, including a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of activated o&#8208;biphenyl amide. Large electronic and steric effects from the boronic acid counterpart have been observed, implying the transmetallation from boron to palladium should be involved in the rate&#8208;determining step in catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

Abstract
In this manuscript we report the synthesis of 3&#8208;amido&#8208;benzo[b]silines thanks to a 2&#8208;step strategy involving a 3&#8208;component silylformylation of ynamides followed by a Friedel&#8208;Crafts cyclization/isomerizing dehydration domino sequence. This reaction is tolerant to various structural variations and has allowed us to synthesize a library of diversely substituted silacycles with yields from 33 to 85%. We also studied the fluorescence properties of these compounds which show structural similarities with recognized probes such as Si&#8208;Rhodamine for example.

The front cover picture, made by painter Monika Tomanov&#225; and reproduced with permission, illustrates that nitrobenzenesulfonamides prepared from 2&#8208;aminobenzyl cyanide and alkylated with various agents can be converted to N&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;nitroarylindoles. The reaction proceeds via base&#8208;catalyzed Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement leading to metal&#8208;free intramolecular C&#947;&#8208;arylation followed by spontaneous cyclization. The process is as simple as developing a black and white photo in a darkroom chamber. Details can be found in Research Article by Miroslav Soural and co&#8208;workers (K. Zakova, P. Kralova, M.

It portrays the 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#8208;selective cyclization of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;ynones. The smiling panda under the tree captures the synthesized 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones, which reflect the isolation of the intermediates. The illustration suggests the synthetic utility of the 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones for syntheses of spiropseudoindoxyl and pyranoindole derivatives, and implies the opening of avenues toward the discovery of new bioactive materials.

Abstract
A scalable procedure for the synthesis of 4,6&#8208;difluorotryptophan is reported based on a deaminative coupling of a 4,6&#8208;difluorogramine with 2&#8208;benzylthio&#8208;1,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;imidazolone as glycine equivalent. Thus prepared 4,6&#8208;difluorotryptophan was incorporated into the C&#8208;terminal domain of the HIV&#8208;1 capsid protein (CA&#8208;CTD), and 19F spectra of the 4,6&#8208;difluoro Trp CA CTD were recorded and compared to the singly fluorinated counterparts.

         <title>Synthesizing Silyl Arylsulfonyl Hydrazones as Silyldiazomethane Precursors and Their Use in Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A method for synthesizing silyl arylsulfonyl hydrazones as silyldiazomethane precursors has been developed. Although silyldiazomethanes are an important class of diazo compounds, their use in intramolecular cyclization reactions has not been fully explored despite the rich chemistry of diazo compounds, particularly metal carbenoid chemistry. The fundamental challenge underlying the absence of such studies is the lack of a method for synthesizing silyldiazomethanes with functional groups that can react with metal carbenoids. The method reported here provides access to variety of silyl arylsulfonyl hydrazones with functional groups such as ethers, carbamates, and alkynes, which can serve as reaction sites for metal carbenoids. A one&#8208;pot hydrazone formation using unstable formylsilane formed in&#8197;situ is key to a successful synthesis. The use of 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzenesulfonohydrazide contributed toward achieving broad generality in hydrazone formation.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A method for synthesizing silyl arylsulfonyl hydrazones as silyldiazomethane precursors has been developed. Although silyldiazomethanes are an important class of diazo compounds, their use in intramolecular cyclization reactions has not been fully explored despite the rich chemistry of diazo compounds, particularly metal carbenoid chemistry. The fundamental challenge underlying the absence of such studies is the lack of a method for synthesizing silyldiazomethanes with functional groups that can react with metal carbenoids. The method reported here provides access to variety of silyl arylsulfonyl hydrazones with functional groups such as ethers, carbamates, and alkynes, which can serve as reaction sites for metal carbenoids. A one-pot hydrazone formation using unstable formylsilane formed &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; is key to a successful synthesis. The use of 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonohydrazide contributed toward achieving broad generality in hydrazone formation. The synthetic potential of this method was demonstrated through the generation of silyldiazomethane and its transformation to several silacycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Herein, a visible light&#8208;mediated defluorination reaction to access 1,1&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes is described. Compared with previous studies, this protocol employs more readily accessible acids as a radical precursor under redox&#8208;neutral conditions. Moreover, the reaction exhibits high compatibility with diverse primary, secondary and tertiary acids, especially natural amino acids and drug&#8208;derived acids. Preliminary mechanistic investigations reveal that a radical pathway is involved in the catalytic cycle.

Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed difunctionalization of olefins has attracted considerable attention as a method to construct carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;hetero bonds. Herein, the copper&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component radical cross&#8208;coupling of oxime esters, styrenes and AgSCF3 through a visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted iminyl radical&#8208;mediated carbon&#8208;carbon bond cleavage strategy has been described. Utilizing low&#8208;cost copper salt as both photosensitizers and cross&#8208;couplers, this protocol delivers diverse target products, providing a supplementary approach for cyanoalkylation and trifluoromethylthiolation of drug molecules.

Abstract
Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H oxidation of unprotected aniline derivatives under aerobic conditions, which enables the preparation of phenanthridine compounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the pioneering reaction of dehydrogenative C(sp3)&#8722;N bond formation from unprotected anilines under a Cu/O2 system. Notably, various anilines possessing alkyl, methoxy, halogen (fluoride, chloride, bromide, and iodide), trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, cyano, ester, and acetal groups can also participate in the reaction.

Abstract
We report a class of isolable bis&#8208;cyclometallated iridium precatalysts (ImIr) and their use in regioselective ortho&#8722;C&#8722;H borylation of aromatic, heteroaromatic, acrylic, and aliphatic systems. The catalysts consist of two imine ligands and an acetate coordinated to an iridium (III) center. The isolable character of ImIr warrants its compatibility with high&#8208;throughput experimentation, a prerequisite for applications in late&#8208;stage functionalization (LSF) of complex substrates. Initial mechanistic studies point towards an inner&#8208;sphere mechanism involving bis&#8208;cyclometallated species shedding light on the general mechanistic understanding of ortho&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylations.

Abstract
An easily scalable and highly diastereoselective synthesis of challenging 1,2,5,6,11,11b&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;3H&#8208;imidazo[1&#8242;,2&#8242;:1,2]pyrido[3,4&#8208;b]indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones is accomplished through divergent transformation of Ugi 4&#8208;CR products. The trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf) mediated intramolecular condensation of a series of Ugi 4&#8208;CR adducts generates a N&#8208;acylimidinium intermediate which undergoes ring closure to selectively afford the target title compounds in good to high yields.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Five to Eight&#8208;Membered P&#8208;Stereogenic Benzo&#8208;Fused Heterocycles via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>

Abstract
P&#8208;stereogenic benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles is a privileged skeleton due to their outstanding catalytic properties and bioactivities. However, their enantioselective synthesis is still underdeveloped. Here we demonstrate the use of easily accessible racemic H&#8722;P(O) compounds as starting materials and commercial chiral N1, N2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diphenylethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine ligand in combination with Cu(I) catalysts to enable an attractive dynamic kinetic C(sp2)&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reaction. This protocol not only exhibits a broad substrate scope but also provides general access to a diverse range of useful P&#8208;stereogenic five&#8208;, six&#8208;, seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered benzo&#8208;fused O, P&#8208; containing heterocycles with good to high yields and enantioselectivities.

Here we demonstrate the use of easily accessible racemic H&#8722;P(O) compounds as starting materials and commercial chiral &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;

Abstract
A range of densely functionalized ullazines have been synthesized by a one&#8208;pot Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed twofold C&#8722;H activation/oxidative annulation of N&#8208;arylpyrroles with alkynes. Electrophilic bromination at 5&#8208; or 5,7&#8208; positions of the EWG&#8208;substituted ullazine core offers an interesting single or double entry for further extended functionalization. Mechanistic considerations suggest two complementary paths, EWG&#8208;assisted and SEAr, for the C&#8722;H activations. All ullazines exhibit strong fluorescence emissions. Ullazines bearing thiophene and triarylamine units at 5&#8208; and 5,7&#8208; positions show a significant bathochromic shift in their emission spectra, attributed to the more extended electronic circuits present.

         <title>Cationic [1,5]&#8208;Aryl Migrations of Propargyl Benzyl Ethers &#8211; A Stereospecific Approach to E&#8208; and Z&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Olefins</title>

Abstract
Herein we report the discovery and development of the first example of a cationic [1,5]&#8208;aryl migration reaction, through an unprecedented phenonium ions. This reaction does not require any acid, base, transition metal&#8208;based catalyst or promoter, instead promoted by the water activated NXS reagents. It provides a highly diastereoselective and rapid access to the medicinally and biologically important tetra&#8208;substituted olefins (allyl alcohols). The involvement of an ipso&#8208;carbon, as well as the phenonium ion during this novel, cationic [1,5]&#8208;aryl migration was strongly supported by the isolation of 2&#8208;oxaspiro[5.5]undecane&#8208;9&#8208;ones. This methodology is highly tolerable for a wide range of propargyl&#8208;benzyl ethers, resulting in a selective construction of structurally divergent library of mono&#8208;halo&#8208;tricarbon&#8208;substituted alkenes. Synthetic application has also been demonstrated by converting two isomeric&#8208;iodo&#8208;olefins to respective E&#8208; and Z&#8208;isomers of tamoxifen in a stereospecific manner.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Di&#8208; and Mono&#8208;Alkylated Indoles via Tunable Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroarylation of Styrenes</title>

Abstract
We report an iron&#8208;catalyzed divergent synthesis of alkylated indoles based on precise control of the activation sites on indoles through the selection of catalysts. Using indoles and styrenes as starting materials, 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;alkylated indoles could be prepared selectively and directly for the first time by treating with a catalytic amount of Fe(OTf)3 and 3&#8208;alkylated indoles were achieved exclusively by adding a catalytic amount of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin as the cocatalyst with Fe(OTf)3. This simple method was demonstrated with 52 examples with high yields and broad functional group compatibilities.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A Mitsunobu process performed under neat grinding conditions, using a mixer mill, is reported. It proceeds in the absence of reaction solvent and in short reactions times (10&#8211;20&#8197;min). A broad substrate scope encompassing primary and secondary alcohols, as well as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon&#8208;centered nucleophiles is demonstrated. Application to the functionalization of a selection of APIs is shown, also. The developed process is amenable to scale up on a planetary ball&#8208;mill, yielding over 2 grams of product. Finally, a representative alcohol is inverted with excellent stereoselectivity.

Abstract
We report herein a palladium&#8208;catalyzed, site&#8208;selective cyclative annulation of o&#8208;alkynyl arylamides with maleimide for the stereoselective construction of succinimide&#8208;fused benzoxazine derivatives. This operationally simple and modular protocol provides access to polycyclic frameworks. The other associated features are high functional group compatibility, gram&#8208;scale synthetic potential, and downstream transformations. Control and labeling experiments were conducted to get insights into the mechanism.

Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic compounds, in particular, quinolines and quinazolines are frequently used in medicinal chemistry. Therefore, the direct and clean synthesis of these valuable scaffolds has been a great interest for many years. 2&#8208;Aminobenzyl alcohols as an alternative reactant instead of unstable and expensive 2&#8208;aminobenzaldehydes can be used in the construction of N&#8208;fused heterocycles including quinolines, quinazolines, oxazines, thiazines, selenazines, imidazoles, diazepines, etc. In this review article, we have discussed recent developments in the use of 2&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohols in the synthesis of diverse heterocycles.

         <title>Access to 3&#8208;Azetidines via Halogenation of Titanacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Azetidines are valuable nitrogenous heterocycles. Herein, we disclose a strategy for the modular assembly of 3&#8208;azetidines and related spirocyclic congeners featuring all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers. This approach leverages titanacyclobutanes generated from ketones or alkenes. Halogenation of these organotitanium species gives rise to functionalized alkyl dihalides that can be subsequently captured by amines to afford azetidine building blocks. This strategy facilitated the synthesis of a small molecule anti&#8208;tuberculosis drug. It also enabled access to carbon&#8208;13 isotopologs of diazaspiro[3.3]heptane fragments that are challenging to prepare by any other means.

Abstract
A direct catalytic stereoselective synthesis of C4&#8217; functionalized furanoside and nucleoside derivatives with a tetrasubstituted stereocenter is disclosed. The amine&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective &#945;&#8208;aminomethylation reactions on furanoside&#8208;derived aldehyde derivatives gave the corresponding C4&#8217; functionalized D&#8208; or L&#8208;ribose derivatives in good to excellent yields (67&#8722;94%) with up to &gt;20:1 dr.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Ring&#8208;Opening Reactions of 2H&#8208;Indazoles with Alcohols to Obtain Ortho&#8208;alkoxycarbonylated Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A strategy for synthesis of azo&#8208;derived compounds by electrochemical oxidative ring&#8208;opening reactions of 2H&#8208;indazoles with alcohols is reported. The reactions are carried out under galvanostatic electrolysis conditions in an undivided cell without the use of transition metal catalysts. On the basis of cyclic voltammetry and control experiments, a plausible mechanism for this ring&#8208;opening reaction involving the radical pathway is proposed. Furthermore, various 2H&#8208;indazoles and alcohols are suitable in this system, giving the desired ortho&#8208;alkoxycarbonylated azobenzenes in 9&#8211;84% yields.

Abstract
A synthetic protocol was developed to synthesize highly functionalized 3&#8208;furylmethyl chromones from enynones and o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl enaminones via silver&#8208;catalyzed cascade bis&#8208;heteroannulation reaction. This strategy features broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance. Furthermore, the 3&#8208;furylmethyl chromone skeleton shows the potential synthetic application value through further gram&#8208;scale synthesis and derivatization.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;arylindoles and their Fused Analogues via Intramolecular C&#8208;Arylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
2&#8208;Aminobenzyl cyanide was reacted with nitrobenzenesulfonyl chlorides and alkylated under Mitsunobu or Fukuyama conditions. The resulting intermediates were exposed to basic conditions, which triggered a Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement, leading to intramolecular C&#8208;arylation. This reaction was followed by spontaneous cycloaddition, which yielded 2&#8208;aminoindole derivatives. The developed synthetic route represents a metal&#8208;free approach for accessing 1&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;arylindoles. Furthermore, pyrimido[1,2&#8208;a]indoles and 7,8dihydrobenzo[6,7][1,3]diazepino[4,5&#8208;b]indoles were synthesized through the use of functionalized alcohols.

         <title>Recent Progress in Haloalkene Synthesis by Hydrohalogenation (HX=HCl, HBr, HI) of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Hydrohalogenation of alkynes is one of the fundamental reactions in organic chemistry, as described in textbooks that begins from old time as Reppe's chemistry. This method, which directly affords haloalkenes in a single step, is attractive from both industrial and academic viewpoints. Despite the long history of this reaction, novel efficient catalysts and regioselective and/or stereoselective controlled reactions are still a challenging topic. This review addresses the recent (past decade) advances in this field of organic chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;Hydrohalogenation of alkynes is one of the fundamental reactions in organic chemistry, as described in textbooks that begins from old time as Reppe's chemistry. This method, which directly affords haloalkenes in a single step, is attractive from both industrial and academic viewpoints. Despite the long history of this reaction, novel efficient catalysts and regioselective and/or stereoselective controlled reactions are still a challenging topic. This review addresses the recent (past decade) advances in this field of organic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Creating an expedient method for synthesizing biologically significant functionally rich octahydroquinoline is a highly sought&#8208;after yet challenging endeavour. In this report, we document an unprecedented approach to the construction of novel spirooctahydroquinoline oxindole architectures. The reaction proceeds through Pd (II) catalyzed cycloisomerisation and quinine catalyzed [4+2]&#8208;addition sequence to afford the desired adduct in moderate to excellent yield (up to 89%) in a single diastereomer with three contiguous stereocenters including one spirocenter. An overwhelming number of libraries were generated (35 examples) reflecting the synthetic versatility and functional groups/substituents tolerance. Further, the adduct is transformed into medicinally important fluoro&#8208;decahydroepoxyethanoquinoline spirooxindole scaffold with five contiguous stereocenters in excellent yield and selectivity (95% yield and &gt;99:1 dr) through a three steps sequence which signifies the synthetic utility of the developed methodology.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Arylations of Ketimines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Arylation of ketimines is the most straightforward strategy for constructing chiral &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines, important structural motifs found in natural products and biologically active compounds. This comprehensive review highlights the achievements in the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed and organocatalyzed asymmetric arylations of ketimines from the seminal report published in 2010 till November 2023. The review is divided into three chapters: (1) Arylation of diaryl ketimines, (2) Arylation of aryl&#8208;alkyl and aryl&#8208;acyl ketimines, and (3) Arylation of acyl&#8208;alkyl and dialkyl ketimines. Each chapter is further divided into transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions (grouped by individual metals) and organocatalyzed reactions. The covered literature includes emphasis on the advantages of the reported methodology, its scope and limitations, and the description of the transition state (where applicable).

         <title>An iron&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component radical cascade cyclization to access cyanoalkylsulfonyl quinolino&#8208;quinazolinones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction, involving cyanoalkylsulfonylation and cyclization, has been devised to enable the synthesis of functionalized sulfonylated quinolino&#8208;quinazolinone alkyl nitriles. This three&#8208;component radical transformation exhibits excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity while functioning without the need for external oxidizing or reducing agents. The cost&#8208;effectiveness of this catalytic system, together with its broad substrate application, which includes drug molecule derivatives, make this approach efficient and adaptable.</dc:description>
