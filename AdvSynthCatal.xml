         <title>A Mild and Efficient Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Method for Aldimine Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, efficient, and broadly applicable iridium&#8208;catalyzed method for aldimine hydrogenation, facilitating access to an array of corresponding amine products in high isolated yields is reported. The developed methodology employs a bidentate iridium&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphine complex for use at low catalyst loadings, and proceeds under an atmospheric pressure of hydrogen gas, offering a scalable and sustainable route to valuble amine compounds.

A mild and applicable protocol for aldimine hydrogenation has been developed using a bidentate iridium&#8208;N&#8208;hetrocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphine catalyst. Through a series of optimization studies, twenty&#8208;nine aldimine substrates have been successfully reduced to their corresponding amines in high isolated yields up to 99%. The developed methodology employs a low catalyst loading of just 1 mol% and proceeds under mild conditions, including under an atmospheric pressure of hydrogen gas. The process benefits from a broad solvent applicability, including notable green solvents, and tolerates aldimine substrates of varying solubility. Alongside, N&#8208;aryl&#8208;based aldimine substrates, the general protocol also accomodates more challenging N&#8208;alkyl species without the requirement of any further additive. From a mechanistic perspective, density functional theory calculations have been utilized to examine the formation, and subsequent reaction, of a crucial iridacycle intermediate, while also revealing that the C&#63743;H activation step is key for successful imine reduction. This mechanistic insight is then used to significantly elevate the performance of two poorer performing substrates.

         <title>Halogen Atom Transfer Enabled Radical Fluoroalkyl&#8208;Thiolation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an aryl radical&#8208;induced three&#8208;component fluoroalkyl&#8208;thiolation of unactivated olefins is reported through halogen atom transfer process, enabling rapid simultaneous construction of C(sp3)&#63743;Rf and C(sp3)&#63743;S bonds with high regioselectivity. Similarly, direct thiolation of fluoroalkyl iodides in the absence of alkenes affords the fluoroalkylthioethers.

A halogen atom transfer&#8208;enabled radical fluoroalkyl&#8208;thiolation of unactivated alkenes is developed employing fluoroalkyl iodides, TMEDA&#8208;ligated zinc thiolates. Notably, the aryldiazonium salts are utilized as the promoter in the three&#8208;component reaction, providing a powerful tool for simultaneous construction of C&#63743;Rf and C&#63743;S bonds across the C&#63742;C bond. Moreover, direct thiolation of fluoroalkyl iodides without alkene gives the two&#8208;component reaction products. Mechanistic studies support that the interaction between diazonium salt and zinc thiolate plays a crucial role in the transformations.

         <dc:description>
A catalyst&#8208; and transition metal&#8208;free strategy enabling the photoinduced coupling between N&#8208;tosylhydrazones and (thio)phenols under mild conditions has been developed. This methodology demonstrates broad substrate scope and features rapid reaction kinetics. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale synthesis and the generation of pharmaceutical intermediates highlight its practical utility. 

The formation of the C&#63743;O/S bonds is of great importance in the synthesis of biologically active molecules and functional materials. Herein, a catalyst&#8208; and transition metal&#8208;free approach enabling the coupling between N&#8208;tosylhydrazones and (thio)phenols under photoinduced conditions is presented. This strategy exhibits a broad scope of substrates including various N&#8208;tosylhydrazones and (thio)phenols, thus demonstrating the feasibility of this concept for C&#63743;O/S bond formation. Unlike the traditional metal&#8208;catalyzed version, the present reaction offers&#160;the advantages of high reaction speed, permitting the preparation of products within just one hour at room temperature.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review surveys dioxazolones as key nitrogen radical precursors for photocatalytic C&#63743;N bond formation. It highlights their application in nitrene transfer reactions toward amide synthesis and mechanistic insights, aiming to guide the development of green heteroatom&#8208;bond&#8208;forming strategies and foster their application in pharmaceutical and materials science.

As efficient nitrogen radical precursors, dioxazolones have emerged as key intermediates in photocatalytic C&#63743;N bond construction due to their mild reaction conditions, and generation of only CO2 as a byproduct. This review summarizes recent advances in the application of dioxazolones in photocatalytic nitrene transfer reactions, with a focus on synthetic methodologies for diverse amides and their derivatives and the mechanistic insights into different catalytic systems. The aim is to provide guidance for developing green and efficient C&#63743;N, S&#63743;N, P&#63742;N, and S&#63742;N bond formation strategies and to promote the application of photocatalytic nitrene transfer reactions in pharmaceutical and materials science.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Confined Pd Nanocatalysts: Tailoring Adsorption Geometry for Enhanced Selectivity in Sustainable Alkylphenol Synthesis via Ketone Hydrodeoxygenation</title>

         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;confined Pd/C&#8208;DMA nanocatalyst enables sustainable synthesis of alkylphenols via selective ketone hydrodeoxygenation. Its polymer layer creates a confinement effect, enforcing a specific end&#8208;on adsorption geometry. This suppresses side reactions and achieves outstanding selectivity (&gt;96%) under mild conditions.

The development of sustainable synthetic routes to access valuable alkylphenols is hampered by the poor selectivity, harsh conditions, and waste associated with traditional methods. Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of readily available aromatic ketones offers a potentially greener alternative, but achieving high chemoselectivity under mild conditions remains challenging. Herein, a simple yet effective strategy is reported employing a polymer&#8208;modified palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst, functionalized with dimethylamine (DMA) polymer chains (Pd/C&#8208;DMA), for the highly efficient and selective HDO of aromatic ketones. This catalyst achieves outstanding selectivity (up to 96.6%) toward alkylphenols with complete conversion under remarkably mild conditions (80 &#176;C, 5&#8201;bar H2), significantly surpassing unmodified Pd/C and representing a substantial improvement in process greenness. Mechanistic insights reveal that the DMA polymer layer creates a confined microenvironment on the catalyst surface. This confinement effect, through steric constraints and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, enforces a specific end&#8208;on adsorption geometry for the ketone substrate, suppressing undesired side reactions like arene ring hydrogenation. The Pd/C&#8208;DMA catalyst demonstrates broad substrate compatibility (&gt;95% yields for diverse ketones) and facilitates the scalable synthesis of valuable intermediates, offering a robust and sustainable platform for alkylphenol production.

         <title>Cleaner Production of Acetals/Ketals Using a Phosphorus&#8208;Doped Biomass&#8208;Based Carbon Catalyst via Acetalization Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of novel phosphorus&#8208;doped carbon catalysts is carried out for the acetalization of aldehydes and ketones toward acetals and ketals under mild conditions (60 &#176;C, atmospheric pressure). This catalyst, showing high conversion (87.1%) and selectivity (&gt;99.9%), offers an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional methods. The work highlights the crucial role of P&#8208;doping in modulating the acid properties of the catalyst for enhanced performance.

The transformation of aldehydes and ketones into acetals and ketals has garnered significant attention due to their wide applications as fragrances, bio&#8208;oil additives, and organic synthetic intermediates. Conventional acetalization methods, however, often rely on corrosive acids or stoichiometric additives, necessitating harsh conditions and increasing production costs. Here, the development of a phosphorus&#8208;doped carbon catalyst is presented, that enables the acetalization of aldehydes and ketones into acetals and ketals under mild conditions (e.g., 60 &#176;C, atmospheric pressure). This catalyst achieves a high yield of 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (87.1%) from benzaldehyde and exhibits exceptional stability, operating continuously for 120&#8201;h in a continuous fixed&#8208;bed reactor. In the continuous reaction, the yield of 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane remains over 96% in the first 18&#8201;h and slightly decreases to 86% after 120&#8201; h of continuous operation. Comprehensive physicochemical characterizations reveal that phosphorus acts as a Lewis acid sites and plays a critical role in modulating the Lewis acid sites of the PC catalysts. This work highlights the significance of optimizing acid properties for the efficient acetalization reaction, offering a promising approach to sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Electrochemical Decarboxylative Functionalizations through Carbocation Intermediates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbocations generated through electrochemical Hofer&#8208;Moest pathways can be trapped by diverse nucleophiles or undergo elimination to form alkenes, significantly expanding synthetic versatility. This review systematically surveys advances in electrochemical Hofer&#8208;Moest reactions since 2019, categorizing transformations by bond&#8208;forming events. The review concludes by highlighting key challenges and proposing strategic research directions in this rapidly evolving field.

In contrast to radical&#8208;mediated electrochemical decarboxylative couplings, electrochemical decarboxylative functionalizations proceeding through carbocation intermediates (Hofer&#8208;Moest pathway) unlock unique reactivity and selectivity. These in&#8201;situ&#8208;generated carbocations can be trapped by diverse nucleophiles or undergo elimination to form alkenes, significantly expanding synthetic versatility. This review systematically surveys advances in electrochemical Hofer&#8208;Moest&#8208;type reactions since 2019, categorizing transformations by bond&#8208;forming events (C&#63743;N, C&#63743;O, C&#63743;P, C&#63743;F, C&#63743;C, and C&#63742;C). Beyond summarizing key breakthroughs, it also provide balanced evaluation of current limitations to delineate the scope and applicability of these methods. Finally, persistent challenges are outlined and future research directions in this emerging field is proposed.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Controlled C&#8211;H Cyanation or Thiocyanation of Indolizines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced method for the C&#8211;H cyanation/thiocyanation of indolizine derivatives has been developed by using NH4SCN as the cyano or thiocyano source.

An efficient and controlled approach for C&#8211;H cyanation/thiocyanation of indolizines is reported under visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced conditions. NH4SCN is used as the cyano or thiocyano source and the presence or absence of H2O2 are found to be the key factor in the selective construction of C&#8208;3 cyano or thiocyano indolizines. A set of control experiments, such as radical trapping experiments and fluorescence quenching studies are conducted to assess mechanistic insights of the reaction.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Azide&#8208;Selenoalkyne Cycloadditions: A Combined Synthetic&#8211;Computational Study into Reaction Scope, Mechanism, and Origins of Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (RuAAC) reaction is reported for the synthesis of selenium&#8208;substituted triazole products. Reaction regioselectivity is dependent on the identity of the non&#8208;selenium substituent of the alkyne, which challenges the perceived understanding of RuAAC regioselectivity. Computational modeling has accurately reproduced the experimental results and provided insights into the origins of regioselectivity.

A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (RuAAC) reaction involving selenoalkynes is reported for the synthesis of selenium&#8208;substituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazole products (26 examples, up to 89% yield). The reaction works well with a wide range of alkyl and aryl azides bearing both electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing groups. This contrasts RuAAC reactions using regular terminal and internal alkynes, where aryl azides bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups are not generally tolerated. The regioselectivity of the cycloaddition is highly dependent on the identity of the non&#8208;selenium substituent of the alkyne. This challenges earlier reports on RuAAC reactions involving thioalkynes and questions the perceived understanding of the regioselectivity of these reactions. Computational modeling of the reaction profiles for four alkyne substrates that provided contrasting regioselectivities accurately reproduces the experimental results. The observed regioselectivity is primarily attributed to the relative nucleophilicity of the alkyne carbons upon coordination to ruthenium and an approach is proposed in which reaction regioselectivity may be predicted.

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation on an NHC&#8208;Catalyzed [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] Annulation of 2&#8208;Bromoenals with &#946;&#8208;Oxodithioester: Mechanism, Origins of Stereoselectivity</title>

         <dc:description>
The mechanism and origin of selectivities of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] annulation reaction have been systematically investigated using density functional theory method. The key roles of Lewis acid are also elucidated through the solvent&#8211;solute interaction model.

An increasing number of studies have demonstrated the cooperative use of chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and Lewis acid to enhance catalytic efficiency in stereoselective annulation reactions. Herein, molecular&#8208;level insights into the NHC&#8208;catalyzed [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] annulation of 2&#8208;bromoenals with &#946;&#8208;oxodithioester are elucidated through density functional theory calculations. The reaction proceeds via multiple key steps: formation of the Breslow intermediate, C&#63743;Br bond cleavage, &#945;&#8208;protonation generating &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acylazolium, stereoselective Si&#8208;face addition between the acylazolium and LiCl&#8208;coordinated &#946;&#8208;oxodithioester, intramolecular proton transfer, and catalyst regeneration. The stereoselectivity&#8208;determining C&#63743;C bond formation step exhibits enhanced facial control through cooperative effects. Noncovalent interaction (NCI) and atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules analyses reveal that hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, LP&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;, and O&#183;&#183;&#183;S interactions preferentially stabilize the RS&#8208;configured isomer. Notably, LiCl plays dual roles: (1) it amplifies stereocontrol by facilitating multiple NCIs during the C&#63743;C bond formation, and (2) reduces transition&#8208;state polarity through solvent&#8211;solute interactions, thereby lowering the activation barrier. The work deepens the understanding of how Lewis acid additive modulate both electronic and steric landscapes in NHC catalysis, offering valuable insights for stereocontrolled annulation reactions.

Substituted internal alkynes are one of the most important functional groups in organic chemistry, with broad applications ranging from biochemistry to material science, medicinal chemistry, and pharmaceutical research. Much effort has been made to explore efficient methodologies to introduce an alkyne moiety into molecules. Among alkynylation reagents, terminal alkynes are considered to be the ideal reagent compared to other substrates like halogenated alkynes and alkynyl hypervalent iodine since it avoids multistep synthesis of these substrates from terminal alkynes to meet the atom&#8208;economy criteria. In this review, we summarized recent achievements in the application of terminal alkynes for the alkynylation to afford substituted internal alkynes and alkynylation&#8208;triggered tandem reactions to yield carbo&#8208; and heterocycles, which exist abundantly in the nature as synthetic drugs, biologically active natural and non&#8208;natural products.

         <title>Recent Advances in Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Thiolation and Sulfonylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advancements in transition metal catalysis have enabled efficient strategies for constructing C&#8211;S bonds via olefin functionalization. This review summarizes recent developments in hydrothiolation, carbothiolation, and related sulfonylative transformations, with an emphasis on chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selective synthesis of complex sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Mechanistic insights, current challenges, and future research directions are also discussed. 

The development of efficient and selective strategies for constructing C&#63743;S bonds has garnered significant attention in organic and medicinal chemistry, owing to the widespread presence of this linkage in biologically active molecules, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional materials. Among the various approaches, alkene thiolation and sulfonylation stand out as one of the most straightforward methods for organosulfur synthesis, enabling the direct introduction of sulfur&#8208;containing functionalities into unsaturated hydrocarbons. This review provides a comprehensive summary of recent advances (2013&#8211;present) in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;S bond formation via alkene thiolation and sulfonylation. We systematically discuss the synthetic methodologies, including transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrothiolation, carbothiolation, hydrosulfonylation, and carbosulfonylation, highlighting their respective substrate scope, chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, enantioselectivity, and reaction mechanisms. By consolidating the latest developments and critical perspectives, this review aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers, encouraging further exploration and innovation in this dynamic field. The continued evolution of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;S bond formation is expected to unlock new opportunities in drug discovery, materials science, and synthetic methodology.

         <title>Monofluorinated C1 Synthon Strategy for the Construction of Fluoromethylene&#8208;Linked Bicyclo[1.1.1]Pentane Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An additive&#8208;free photochemical atom&#8208;transfer radical addition of fluoroiodomethyl sulfoxide to [1.1.1]propellane provides fluoromethyl&#8208;bicyclopentane sulfonium reagents, enabling nucleophilic substitution under mild conditions.

Fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) have emerged as an attractive scaffold in drug discovery. Herein, the modular construction of fluoromethyl&#8208;linked BCPs is reported. Fluoroiodomethyl phenyl sulfoxide is found to be a synthetic equivalent of a formal fluoromethylene radical cation synthon, which, under metal&#8208;free conditions and violet light irradiation (400&#8201;nm), enables an atom&#8208;transfer radical addition reaction to [1.1.1]propellane. This straightforward approach provides access to novel bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;substituted fluoromethyl sulfonium reagents. The electrophilic properties of these sulfonium salts allow nucleophilic displacement under mild conditions, enabling the introduction of the fluoromethyl bicyclopentyl group into diverse natural products and drug molecules with good functional group tolerance.

         <title>Installation of Trifluoromethylated Quaternary Carbon Stereocenters via Asymmetric Epoxidation of Tetrasubstituted Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic enantioselective epoxidation of acyclic tetrasubstituted alkenes, bearing a trifluoromethyl group, is reported. In the presence of Takemoto's thiourea organocatalyst and tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide, epoxides are obtained with excellent yield and good to high enantioselectivity. Computational studies provide insights into the reaction mechanism and stereocontrol. Densely functionalized trifluoromethylated compounds, bearing two vicinal quaternary stereocenters, are obtainable via epoxide derivatization.

The construction of vicinal quaternary carbon centers via epoxidation of tetrasubstituted alkenes remains a formidable challenge in asymmetric synthesis. Herein, a first catalytic enantioselective epoxidation of acyclic tetrasubstituted alkenes is reported, prepared through the Knoevenagel condensation of trifluoromethyl ketones with malononitrile. (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;configured epoxides are obtained in generally excellent yields (up to 98%) and with good to high enantioselectivities (up to 89% ee), employing a commercially available system, comprising Takemoto's catalysts and tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP). Highly reactive new tetrasubtituted alkenes allow the first successful use of Takemoto's catalyst under oxidative conditions. Interestingly, density functional theory studies show that TBHP is exclusively activated by the amino thiourea, with halogen&#8208;bonding interactions playing a critical role in affecting the stereochemical outcome of the epoxidation. Derivatizations provide access to densely functionalized trifluoromethylated compounds, featuring one or two vicinal carbon quaternary stereocenters, with the second center being introduced in a highly stereoselective manner.

A P4S10&#8208;promoted [5+1] spiroannulation of 2&#8208;(2&#8208; nitrophenyl) indoles with cyclic ketones for the preparation of spirocyclic tetrahydrocarbolines is developed. This transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free approach provides an efficient and practical pathway toward structurally valuable spirocyclic tetrahydrocarbolines.

An NH4I&#8208;promoted three&#8208;component cascade cyclization reaction for the modular synthesis of maleimide&#8208;fused benzocarbazoles and maleimide&#8208;fused indoles has been developed. The present approach starts from readily available indoles/pyrroles, cyclohexanones, and maleimides, affording variety of maleimide&#8208;fused benzocarbazoles and maleimide&#8208;fused indoles in 40&#8211;83% yields under metal&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Recent Advances in Synthesis of Covalent Triazine Frameworks: Methods, Mechanism, and Crystallization Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Common manufacturing methods and synthesis mechanisms of covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are introduced, as well as the ways to improve the crystallinity of CTFs. Additionally, prospects for the future development of synthetic CTFs are discussed and are anticipated to offer a viable research direction for CTFs.

Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are a class of nitrogen&#8208;heterocyclic covalent organic framework materials based on the triazine ring. They show promising applications in catalysis, gas adsorption, and energy storage thanks to their high specific surface area, designable pore structure, and excellent physicochemical properties. Although a series of synthetic methods have been proposed, the complexity of their synthetic pathways, the challenge of regulating crystallinity, and the ambiguity of the reaction mechanism limit the precise design and performance optimization of these materials. A comprehensive understanding of the numerous synthesis methodologies is pivotal for rational modulation of its structure and performance, as well as for understanding the synthesis mechanism and crystallization effects. Herein, the common manufacturing methods of CTFs are systematically outlined. Additionally, the synthesis mechanisms and ways to improve the crystallinity of CTFs are also covered. Finally, some prospects for the future development of synthetic CTF materials are discussed. This critical review is anticipated to offer a viable research direction for CTFs.

         <title>Photoinduced Sequential Hydrogen and Halogen Atom Transfer for Direct C&#8211;H Functionalization of Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with Alkyl Iodides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and halogen atom transfer cascade, propelled by in situ&#8208;produced boryl radicals from amine&#8211;borane adducts, facilitates chemoselective C(sp2)&#8211;H alkylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. Utilizing easily accessible alkyl iodides and ambient air as an oxidizing agent, this metal&#8208;free approach offers extensive substrate generality, elevated regioselectivity, and functional group tolerance for the late&#8208;stage diversification of heterocycles.

The chemoselective activation of alkyl halides under mild and sustainable conditions continues to pose an ongoing issue in C&#8211;H functionalization chemistry. A metal&#8208;free, photoinduced sequential hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and halogen atom transfer (XAT) method that utilizes transient boryl radicals produced in situ from stable amine&#8208;borane adducts is presented. This platform facilitates effective C(sp2)&#8211;H alkylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones through a synergistic HAT/XAT cascade, utilizing easily accessible alkyl iodides and ambient air as the terminal oxidant.

&lt;p&gt;A photoinduced hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and halogen atom transfer cascade, propelled by in situ-produced boryl radicals from amine&#8211;borane adducts, facilitates chemoselective C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H alkylation of quinoxalin-2(1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-ones. Utilizing easily accessible alkyl iodides and ambient air as an oxidizing agent, this metal-free approach offers extensive substrate generality, elevated regioselectivity, and functional group tolerance for the late-stage diversification of heterocycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemoselective activation of alkyl halides under mild and sustainable conditions continues to pose an ongoing issue in C&#8211;H functionalization chemistry. A metal-free, photoinduced sequential hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and halogen atom transfer (XAT) method that utilizes transient boryl radicals produced in situ from stable amine-borane adducts is presented. This platform facilitates effective C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H alkylation of quinoxalin-2(1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-ones through a synergistic HAT/XAT cascade, utilizing easily accessible alkyl iodides and ambient air as the terminal oxidant. The approach demonstrates broad substrate generality, elevated regioselectivity, and favorable functional group compatibility, enabling late-stage diversification of pharmaceutically significant heterocycles under operationally simple conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed protocol for a hydrocarbamoylation of allamines with readily accessible 4&#8208;carboxyamido Hantzsch esters under metal&#8208;free and mild conditions is reported.

Herein, a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed protocol for allylamine hydrocarbamoylation under metal&#8208;free and mild conditions is reported. The proposed method utilizes readily accessible 4&#8208;carboxyamido Hantzsch esters as convenient substrates that deliver carbamoyl radicals upon a visible light&#8208;mediated SET process. Their addition to various allylamines proceeds with good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent efficiency and with high levels of regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity to provide the corresponding &#947;&#8208;amino acid amides.

         <title>Cooperative Photocatalysis of 9,10&#8208;Phenanthrenequinone and Sn(OTf)2 for Direct Mannich Reaction of Ethers via Hydrogen Atom Transfer Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual photocatalytic system of o&#8208;PQ and Sn(OTf)2 enables visible light&#8208;induced Mannich&#8208;type addition of ethers to nitrones via Csp&#179;&#8211;H activation. This oxidant&#8208;free method offers broad scope and good yields. Mechanistic studies suggest that a photoexcited o&#8208;PQ&#8211;Sn(II) complex mediates hydrogen atom transfer to form &#945;&#8208;oxy radicals for nitrone addition.

A dual photocatalytic system combining 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinone (o&#8208;PQ) and Sn(OTf)2 enabled the visible light&#8208;induced Mannich&#8208;type addition of ethers to nitrones via direct Csp3&#8211;H activation. This oxidant&#8208; and reductant&#8208;free method featured broad substrate scope, good yields, and excellent functional group tolerance. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and downstream transformations (Suzuki, Sonogashira, Heck) demonstrated its synthetic utility. Mechanistic studies suggested a cooperative cycle where a photoexcited o&#8208;PQ&#8208;Sn(II) complex mediated hydrogen atom transfer, generating &#945;&#8208;oxy radicals that reacted with Sn(II)&#8208;activated nitrones.

         <title>Photo&#8208;/Electrochemically Radical Cation&#8208;/Anion&#8208;Mediated Defluorinative Functionalization of Organofluorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers the recent progress in photo&#8208;/electrochemically enabled radical cation&#8208;/anion&#8208;mediated defluorinative functionalization of organofluorides, including capabilities of photocatalysts, the synthetic strategies, plausible mechanisms, and future research outlook.

Radical cation&#8208; or anion&#8208;based defluorinative functionalization has rapidly emerged as a highly effective method for enhancing molecular complexity, with widespread applications in medicinal chemistry and materials science. Photo&#8208;/electrochemistry, as green and sustainable approaches, enable diverse chemical transformations. Remarkable achievements in photo(electro)chemical defluorinative functionalization of radical cations or anions is reported. The generation of radicals via defluorination of organofluorides occurs through three main mechanistic pathways: single&#8208;electron reduction, spin center shift, and single&#8208;electron oxidation. This review comprehensively summarizes recent advances in reactions involving photochemically, electrochemically, or photoelectrochemically initiated radical cation or anion C&#63743;F functionalization of organofluorides to forge a C&#63743;C or C&#63743;X (X&#8201;=&#8201;N, B, O, S, or Se) bond. This review highlights challenges and identifies potential areas for improvement. Additionally, the full spectrum of photocatalysts applied in this strategy, including metal&#8208;based and organic photoredox catalysts, is reviewed in detail.

         <title>Advancements and Challenges in Reductive Methylation of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dioxide, a renewable and eco&#8208;friendly carbon source, has garnered significant research interest in recent years for its application as a methyl source in synthesizing bioactive methylated compounds. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in reductive methylation of various nucleophiles with carbon dioxide as a C1 synthon for constructing carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8208;nitrogen bonds through various catalytic systems.

Methylation reactions have extraordinary value in organic chemistry, ranging from the assembly of structurally diverse organic functional chemicals to the introduction of methyl groups into pharmaceutical and agrochemical intermediates. In the context of sustainable chemistry, carbon dioxide (CO2) has emerged as an idea and alternative greener C1 source. As a result, reductive methylation strategies utilizing CO2 as a methylating agent have garnered substantial research interest in recent decades, particularly for synthesizing methylated derivatives, compounds with broad applications in drug discovery and agrochemical development. In this review, reductive methylations using CO2 as C1 synthon have been summarized and discussed in detail with focus on metal&#8208;catalyzed C/N&#8208;methylation reactions, base catalyzed C/N&#8208;methylation reactions, ionic liquids catalyzed C/N&#8208;methylation reactions, and catalyst&#8208;free C/N&#8208;methylation reactions based on various reductants. We also elucidate substrate compatibility in these reductive methylations, competing side reactions, and representative reaction mechanisms. Furthermore, conclusions and future trends are depicted finally in this review.

         <dc:description>
Cheap copper (I) catalyzed difunctionalization of electron&#8208;withdrawing alkenes using germanium hydride and S&#8208;phosphorothiol to produce the germylphosphorothiolated product. This three&#8208;component reaction shows excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity and can also be used for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.

A copper&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component radical relay protocol is demonstrated for difunctionalization of electron&#8208;withdrawing alkenes using germanium hydride and S&#8208;phosphorothiol to afford the germylphosphorothiolated product. This transformation reveals excellent tolerance for functional groups and occurs under mild reaction conditions, exhibiting a high level of regioselectivity. Control experiments suggest the involvement of germyl radicals in these transformations.

Organocatalytic Remote&#8208;Controlled Enantioselective 1,10&#8208;Additions of In Situ Generated Alkynyl 2,4&#8242;&#8208;Biphenyl Quinone Methides</title>

An organocatalytic remotely controlled enantioselective 1,10&#8208;additions of in situ&#8208;generated alkynyl 2,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl quinone methides from &#945;&#8208;[4&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)phenyl]propargyl alcohols with 3&#8208;arylindoles and indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates has been established, affording a broad scope of enantioenriched 3H&#8208;pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles and axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes, respectively. Breaking new ground, this work demonstrates the first involvement of these intermediates in stereoselective 1,10&#8208;additions, a transformation previously less reported.

The strategic incorporation of auxiliary groups has recently established &#945;&#8208;functionalized alcohols as versatile electrophilic alkylation reagents, enabling remotely controlled conjugate additions. Strikingly, while quinone methide chemistry has been extensively developed, their extended analogues&#8212;featuring spatially separated carbonyl and methide units across biphenyl systems&#8212;remain unexplored. Building on the prior work with alkynyl 4,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl quinone methides, an organocatalytic remotely controlled enantioselective 1,10&#8208;additions of in &#8201;situ&#8208;generated alkynyl 2,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl quinone methides from &#945;&#8208;[4&#8208;(2&#8208; hydroxyphenyl)phenyl]propargyl alcohols with 3&#8208;arylindoles and indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates is reported, affording a broad scope of enantioenriched 3H&#8208;pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles and axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes, respectively. Combined with control experiments, density functional theory calculations elucidate the reaction mechanism, revealing that the dehydration of &#945;&#8208;functionalized alcohols to generate 2,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl quinone methides constitutes the rate&#8208;limiting step, while enantioselectivity arises from the nucleophilic addition of alkynyl biphenyl quinone methides. Notably, beyond proving 2,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl quinone methides as competent intermediates, this work breaks new ground by demonstrating their participation in previously unreported stereoselective 1,10&#8208;additions.

         <title>Photoredox/Nickel Dual Catalytic C(sp2)&#63743;S Cross&#8208;coupling of Bromoanilines Enabled by Mineral Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mineral acids promote nickel&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#63743;S cross&#8208;coupling of bromoanilines and related amine&#8208;containing electrophiles with thiols by protonating free amines, thereby facilitating oxidative addition. Acid additives also suppress polythiolate formation, enhance the accessibility of nickel catalysts, and reduce inner filter effects during photocatalysis, eliminating the need for protection&#8211;deprotection steps.

Cross&#8208;coupling reactions are essential tools in modern organic synthesis, enabling the formation of carbon&#63743;heteroatom (C&#63743;X) bonds. Despite significant advancements in method development, particularly with palladium, copper, and nickel catalysis, including recent progress in photoredox catalysis, their efficiency is often limited when sensitive functional groups, such as thiols and amines, are present in the nucleophile or electrophile, and typically requires extensive protection&#8211;deprotection strategies. Herein, a practical synthetic approach is reported that employs mineral acids as unconventional reagents to facilitate C(sp2)&#63743;S cross&#8208;coupling between bromoanilines (or other electrophiles bearing free primary amines as functional groups) and thiols, thereby eliminating the need for protecting group manipulations. Additionally, protonation alters the electronic influence of the aniline moiety, transforming it from an electron&#8208;donating to an electron&#8208;withdrawing group, which promotes oxidative addition, and the acidic medium suppresses polythiolate formation, enhancing nickel catalysts&#8217; accessibility and reducing inner filter effects in photocatalysis. This strategy enables efficient and high&#8208;yielding synthesis of amino thioethers across a broad substrate scope, underscoring the value of acid&#8208;assisted cross&#8208;coupling as a streamlined and robust photoredox methodology for C(sp2)&#63743;S bond formation.

A one&#8208;pot, sequence&#8208;controlled di&#8208;functionalization enables diverse sulfonamide synthesis under mild conditions using DABCO&#8226;(SO2)2 (1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane&#8208;(SO2)2) as a sulfur dioxide surrogate. Two amines, potassium iodide as reductant, and isoamyl nitrite under nitrogen in acetonitrile produce symmetrical or unsymmetrical sulfonamides. This scalable method delivers high yields, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance with operational simplicity.

A streamlined one&#8208;pot, sequence&#8208;controlled di&#8208;functionalization strategy has been developed for the synthesis of structurally diverse sulfonamides under mild conditions. The reaction utilizes DABCO&#8226;(SO2)2 as an SO2&#8208;surrogate and engages two amines&#8212;either identical or different&#8212;in a stepwise manner. Potassium iodide (KI) acts as a stoichiometric reductant, while isoamyl nitrite facilitates the in situ generation of reactive intermediates under a nitrogen atmosphere in acetonitrile at room temperature. The transformation proceeds via a sulfinamide intermediate, enabling the efficient construction of sulfonamides with broad substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and excellent yields. The method features clean reaction profiles, operational simplicity, and scalability, making it a practical and mechanistically informed approach to sulfonamide synthesis.

         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free approach for the synthesis of quinazolinone&#8208;containing alkenes is reported under organophotoredox conditions. In this approach, spiro&#8208;dihydroquinazolinones undergo aromaticity&#8208;driven deconstructive functionalization with Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hilman adducts in a chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective manner.

An organophotoredox&#8208;catalyzed, chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective C&#8211;C bond formation between spiro&#8208;dihydroquinazolinones and Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hilman adducts has been reported. This transformation proceeds via an aromatization driven deconstructive formation of an alkyl radical and its subsequent selective addition at SN2&#8242; position of MBH acetates, resulting in alkene&#8208; containing quinazolinones. Mild reaction conditions, good substrate&#8208;scope and further modification of resultant products are the noteworthy accomplishments of this methodology.

The oxidative acylation of dehydroalanine units with aldehydes toward the access to unnatural &#947;&#8208;carbonyl &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives is described. The use of mono N&#8208;protected amino esters ushers in the synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds in a predictable (Z) stereoselective fashion. Density functional theory studies provide insights into the stereodetermining step of the iron&#8208;catalyzed radical reaction pathway.

An iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidative acylation of acylamido acrylates with abundant aldehydes has been developed. The use of mono N&#8208;protected amino acids results in the unusual assembly of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds in a predictable (Z)&#8208;stereoselective fashion, thereby offering a complementary tool toward the synthesis of unnatural &#947;&#8208;carbonyl &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives. Density functional theory&#160;studies provide insights into the stereodetermining step of the radical reaction pathway.

A powerful platform for the efficient synthesis of 2,4&#8208;disubstituted thiophenes and 2,5&#8208;disubstituted thiophenes via acid&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component cyclization of 2&#8208;methylquinoline, elemental sulfur, and chromone&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehyde or cinnamaldehyde under metal&#8208;free conditions is disclosed. This approach stands out due to its readily available starting materials, broad substrate scopes, simple operation, and the efficient formation of multibonds in one&#8208;pot.

Bisheteroaryls and its derivatives, as a privileged motifs, are commonly found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, ligands, and other bioactive molecules. Herein, a novel and efficient method for the divergent synthesis of functional 2&#8208;quinolinyl&#8208;bearing thiophenes via acid&#8208;mediated three&#8208;component cyclization of 2&#8208;methylquinolines, S powder, and chromone&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehydes or enals is reported. This approach stands out due to its metal&#8208;free conditions, readily available starting materials, broad substrate scopes, simple operation, and the efficient formation of multibonds in one&#8208;pot. The Gram scale reaction and useful derivatizations are performed to showcase the potential synthetic utility of this strategy. This acid&#8208;promoted cyclic strategy provides a straightforward pathway toward diversely valuable thiophenes, which possibly exhibit good applications in medicinal chemistry and materials science.

         <title>CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Cyclic Carbonate Transformation at Ambient Pressure Using a Mechanochemically Prepared Ti(III) Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 18, September 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ti(III) complex synthesized mechanochemically catalyzes the cycloaddition of CO2 (1&#8201;bar) with terminal, internal, and trisubstituted epoxides. Mechanistic studies by density functional theory calculations reveal that the superior activity of Ti(III) compared to Ti(IV) arises from its lower oxophilicity, facilitating CO2 insertion into Ti&#8211;O bonds, as supported by EPR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography.

A readily accessible Ti(III) complex, [Li(thf)4][Ti(MesPDA)2] (4) (MesPDA = N, N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;o&#8208;phenylenediamide), has been synthesized mechanochemically, offering a sustainable route to Ti(III) species. Complex 4, combined with [NBu4I] (TBAI), efficiently catalyzes the cycloaddition of CO2 (1 bar) with terminal and internal epoxides, bio&#8208;resourced diepoxides, and the tri&#8208;substituted limonene oxide. This work represents the first example of a Ti(III)&#8208;based catalyst capable of efficiently synthesizing cyclic carbonates from CO2 and epoxides under atmospheric pressure, and demonstrates the superior catalytic activity of Ti(III) compared to its Ti(IV) analog [Ti(MesPDA)2] (3). A detailed mechanistic study is conducted through density functional theory analysis to explore the catalytic pathways mediated by Ti(III) and Ti(IV). Key steps include epoxide coordination to Ti, iodide&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening to form a Ti&#8208;alkoxide species, and CO2 insertion into the Ti&#8211;O bond. The superior performance of Ti(III) arises from its lower oxophilicity, which weakens Ti&#8211;O interactions, enhancing CO2 insertion. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy confirms epoxide coordination and supports the formation of a Ti(III)&#8208;alkoxide intermediate. Further evidence for the latter species comes from X&#8208;ray crystallography of the Ti(IV)&#8208;alkoxide analog [Li(4&#8208;crown&#8208;12)2][Ti(MesPDA)2(OiPr)] (17), providing indirect structural evidence. These findings advance the development of Ti(III) systems in CO2 valorization and highlight the key role of oxidation state in catalytic efficiency.

1,2&#8208;Diketone intermediate generated in visible light via a metal&#8208;free, photooxidative activation of 2&#8208;alkynylarylnitriles with pyrylium salt, demonstrates base&#8208;assisted orthogonality toward cyclization, furnishing 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyisoquinoline&#8208;1,3&#8208;(2H,4H)&#8208;dione and 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroazanaphthoquinone derivatives in good yields.

A metal&#8208;free, photooxidative activation of 2&#8208;alkynylarylnitriles in presence of pyrylium salt as a photocatalyst is reported. The 1,2&#8208;diketone intermediate generated in visible light demonstrates base&#8208;assisted orthogonality toward cyclization, furnishing 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyisoquinoline&#8208;1,3&#8208;(2H,4H)&#8208;dione and 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroazanaphthoquinone derivatives. The reaction has a wide substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, uses an organic photocatalyst, and takes place at room temperature. Preliminary biological screening of synthesized molecules reveals their potential as anticancer agents.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative C&#63743;H o&#8208;Arylation of s&#8208;Aryltetrazines with Aryl Boronic Acids: One&#8208;Step Selective Access to T&#8208;Shaped and Z&#8208;Shaped Polyaromatics</title>

A one&#8208;step regioselective access to T&#8208;Shaped and Z&#8208;Shaped polyaromatics s&#8208;tetrazines by a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#63743;H o&#8208;functionalization is reported. Electron&#8208;rich aryl coupling partners display a higher reactivity than electron&#8208;poor aryl, and allow the formation of poly(hetero)aromatic derivatives while avoiding 1,4&#8208;azaphilic addition of the organometallic reagents that may occur with organometallic nucleophiles such as aryl cuprates.

The N&#8208;directed rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H bond arylation of s&#8208;aryltetrazine is reported using arylboronic acids as coupling partners. Convenient synthetic conditions are identified that avoid the 1,4&#8208;azaphilic addition of the organometallic reagents on the tetrazine core, that may occur with organometallic nucleophiles, such as aryl cuprates. Thus, using [RhCl2Cp*]2 and Cu(OAc)2 in trifluoromethylbenzene favors the C&#63743;H activation and direct arylation of the s&#8208;tetrazine. This setup tolerates both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the (hetero)aryl boronic acids. Electron&#8208;rich aryl coupling partners display a higher reactivity, and allow the formation of polyaromatic derivatives. This methodology provides a facile and straightforward route to diversely structured polyaromatics incorporating the valuable s&#8208;tetrazine core, with so&#8208;called T&#8208;shaped and Z&#8208;shaped architectures.

A series of polycyclic oxazolinium compounds is synthesized from various aryloxazolines with silyl&#8208;substituted alkynes and internal alkynes via dual photoredox/gold catalysis and Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H bond functionalization, and affords silyl&#8208;substituted polycyclic oxazoliniums and polycyclic oxazoliniums, respectively.

A series of polycyclic oxazolinium compounds is synthesized from various aryloxazolines with silyl&#8208;substituted alkynes and internal alkynes via two synthetic pathways. By using dual photoredox/gold catalysis, the coupling of 2&#8208;aryloxazoline diazonium compounds with silyl&#8208;substituted alkynes affords silyl&#8208;substituted polycyclic oxazoliniums in 20%&#8211;36% yield. The coupling of 2&#8208;aryloxazolines with internal alkynes affords polycyclic oxazoliniums with up to 81% yield by Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H bond functionalization. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and circular dichroism reveal the successful coupling of chiral (R)&#8208;2&#8208;aryloxazolines with internal alkynes and affording the corresponding chiral (R)&#8208;oxazoliniums. Cytotoxicity analysis of the polycyclic oxazolinium compounds reveals cytotoxic activity on cancerous HeLa cells in micromolar dosage, with the lowest IC50 of 6.4&#8201;&#956;M.

A divergent enantioselective synthesis of chiral &#947;&#8208;substituted alkylidene oxindoles and 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles from 3&#8208;alkylidene oxindoles and racemic Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates has been achieved using chiral Lewis base catalysts.

A substrate&#8208;dependent, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;controlled asymmetric allylic alkylation of 3&#8208;alkylidene oxindoles and racemic Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates has been achieved using chiral cinchona alkaloid&#8208;derived catalysts. This present methodology enables the divergent synthesis of chiral &#947;&#8208;substituted alkylidene oxindoles and 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles in a highly selective manner. Plausible catalytic pathways for the formation of these biologically interesting compounds are proposed. Density functional theory calculations have clarified the high diastereoselectivity of allylic alkylation of 1a with 2a and have confirmed that the chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles 6 are from an asymmetric allylic alkylation/Cope rearrangement sequence.

         <title>Bifunctional Organocatalysts and Br&#248;nsted Bases in Cooperative Catalysis for the Asymmetric [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] Cycloaddition of In Situ&#8208;Generated Dienes from Isochromane&#8208;3,4&#8208;Diones with Nitroalkenes</title>

Herein, the first asymmetric [4+2] cycloaddition is reported, utilizing in&#8201;situ&#8208;generated dienes from isochromane&#8208;3,4&#8208;diones and nitroalkenes, catalyzed by a bifunctional thiourea organocatalyst and Br&#248;nsted base cocatalysts, yielding highly enantioselective bridged and spiro lactones, with further investigations into novel reactivity and product formation, offering a new approach to natural product synthesis.

Herein, the first asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reaction involving in&#8201;situ&#8208;generated dienes from readily available isochromane&#8208;3,4&#8208;diones is reported, using nitroalkenes as dienophilic counterparts. The reaction is catalyzed by a bifunctional thiourea&#8208;epi&#8208;quinine organocatalyst, cooperatively assisted by readily available Br&#248;nsted base cocatalysts. This strategy enables highly enantio&#8208; and exo&#8208;diastereo&#8208;selective [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition with a wide range of nitroalkenes, leading to the formation of valuable bridged lactones, a motif found in many natural products. The method applies not only to &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes, but also to aliphatic nitroalkenes such as (nitromethylene)cyclohexane, leading to an unusual bridged spiro lactone. The reaction proceeds with complete regioselectivity, furnishing the products in high yields and achieving enantiomeric ratios (e.r.) ranging from 90:10 to 98:2. The use of Br&#248;nsted base as a cocatalyst not only enhances the turnover and promotes diene formation by vinylogous dienolization, leading to a higher yield in shorter reaction times, but also improves the enantioselectivity. In addition, follow&#8208;up reactivity is investigated, furnishing interesting novel bridged amino ester and tetraline motifs.

This study explores how electric fields influence Diels&#8208;Alder reaction regioselectivity using a zwitterionic iminium ion as both dienophile and electric field source. Head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dipolar orientation is favored in less&#8208;polar solvents and higher temperatures where internal electric fields are preserved. Computational studies validate experimental findings through transition dipole moment, reactant complexation, and transition energy analyses.

The effect of an electric field on the regioselectivity of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction is explored using a zwitterionic iminium ion species as both the dienophile and the source of the electric field. The head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dipolar orientation of the substrates becomes favored in less&#8208;polar solvents and at higher temperatures where the internal electric field is conserved. Computational studies validate the electric field effect on the experimental regioisomeric preferences, in terms of the transition dipole moment, reactant complexation, and transition energy. This work offers deeper insight into the effects of electrostatic fields on chemical reactions, suggesting new directions for controlling reaction selectivity.

GA: Strained small motifs and SuFEx hubs are of increasing importance in drug discovery to enable efficient late&#8208;stage functionalization. Here, the synthesis of bench&#8208;stable azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl&#8208;substituted sulfonimidoyl fluoride as an electrophilic hub with dual activation mode is reported. Incorporation of complex drug motifs is enabled through either selective ABB strain&#8208;release reaction to access substituted azetidines, or selective SuFEx activation.

The development of electrophilic strained small motifs is of increasing importance for chemical biology and drug discovery, enabling precise, late&#8208;stage functionalization and targeted covalent inhibition. In this work, we report the efficient synthesis of a novel azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl&#8208;substituted sulfonimidoyl fluoride, a bench&#8208;stable electrophilic hub combining strain&#8208;release reactivity and SuFEx chemistry. The dual reactivity of this motif was demonstrated through selective ABB ring&#8208;opening reactions, and SuFEx&#8208;mediated ligations with diverse nucleophiles, including pharmaceutically relevant derivatives. Further derivatization of the resulting sulfonimidates and sulfonimidamides showcased the synthetic versatility of this system. These findings open avenues for the development of modular, multifunctional platforms in drug discovery.

         <title>Pd/BINAP/Peroxide&#8208;Enabled Relay Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 18, September 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a Pd/BINAP/peroxide&#8208;enabled multicomponent reaction (MCR) from readily accessible substrates to indole derivatives with aza&#8208;quaternary carbons. The protocol achieves a concise 4&#8208;step synthesis of a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist. Through mechanistic experiments, we believe the addition of H2O2 effectively decreases the initial concentration of [Pd0(BINAP)] species, avoiding the formation of indole N&#8208;allylation by&#8208;products.

In recent years, multicomponent reactions have attracted considerable attention due to their efficiency in constructing complex molecules from simple starting materials. Herein, we report a BINAP/peroxide&#8208;controlled Pd&#8208;catalyzed multicomponent reaction involving readily accessible indoles, diazo compounds, and allylic electrophiles, enabling the efficient synthesis of structurally diverse N&#8208;functionalized indoles bearing aza&#8208;quaternary carbon centers, which are prevalent in bioactive molecules and pharmaceuticals. This approach exhibits broad functional group tolerance and excellent regioselectivity for N&#8211;H sites, especially applicable to unsubstituted indoles. We have further demonstrated the synthetic utility of the resulting products through various derivatizations, including a concise four&#8208;step synthesis of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist to treat aldosterone&#8208;mediated diseases. Mechanistic experiments indicated that this reaction was enabled by a relay catalysis based on PdII/PdII non&#8208;redox and Pd0/PdII redox catalytic cycles, which was found to facilitate the activation of carbene and allylic substrates, respectively. The addition of peroxide was found to suppress the premature formation of [Pd0(BINAP)] species and keep palladium in the [PdII(BINAP)(OAc)2] form at the beginning of the reaction, thereby avoiding the formation of undesired indole allylation by&#8208;products and significantly increasing the overall yields of the target products.

         <title>Direct Photoinitiated Bromosulfonylation of Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 18, September 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct bromosulfonylation of alkynes and alkenes with sulfonyl bromides photoinitiated by 400 nm LED light proceeds under mild conditions, without transition metals and photocatalysts. The reaction is scalable, has good tolerance to functional groups and high yields of products. The use of bisimine additive allows to significantly increase the stereoselectivity of the alkyne bromosulfonylation reaction.

The reaction of direct photoinitiated bromosulfonylation of alkynes and alkenes with p&#8208;tolylsulfonyl bromide is reported. Low&#8208;power radiation with a maximum wavelength of 400&#8201;nm is used for the reaction. The reaction proceeds at room temperature under metal&#8208;free conditions. A photocatalytic bisimine additive is proposed that significantly increases the stereoselectivity of the alkyne bromosulfonylation reaction and increases the yield of products. The reaction scope is demonstrated with 49 examples. Methods for the subsequent functionalization of &#946;&#8208;bromovinylsulfones to obtain valuable products are proposed.

The use of bisimine additive allows to significantly increase the stereoselectivity of the alkyne bromosulfonylation reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction of direct photoinitiated bromosulfonylation of alkynes and alkenes with p-tolylsulfonyl bromide is reported. Low-power radiation with a maximum wavelength of 400&#8201;nm is used for the reaction. The reaction proceeds at room temperature under metal-free conditions. A photocatalytic bisimine additive is proposed that significantly increases the stereoselectivity of the alkyne bromosulfonylation reaction and increases the yield of products. The reaction scope is demonstrated with 49 examples. Methods for the subsequent functionalization of &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-bromovinylsulfones to obtain valuable products are proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;C&#8211;H Alkenylation of Alkylamines with Alkynes Followed by Alkene Isomerization Into Enamines</title>

The iridium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular &#945;&#8208;C&#8211;H addition to alkynes gives enamines. The intramolecular cyclization also proceeds to give cyclic enamines, which can be converted into cyclic ketones by hydrolysis.

The iridium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular &#945;&#8208;C&#8211;H alkenylation of N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;aminopyridine derivatives proceeds via alkene isomerization to give the corresponding enamines. The reaction is efficiently catalyzed by a cationic iridium catalyst under mild reaction conditions. The same catalytic system can also be applied to the intramolecular C&#8211;H addition to alkynes to give cyclic ketones after hydrolysis of the corresponding enamines.

         <title>Biobased Ligands Enable Catalysis with Base Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 18, September 29, 2025. </description>

Biobased ligands unlock versatile catalytic transformations, including Cu&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of olefins and borylation of alkyl halides, Fe&#8208;catalyzed ketone hydrogenation, and Ni&#8208;catalyzed terminal alkyne dimerization.

First&#8208;row transition metal catalysis has already reshaped organic synthesis, offering more abundant and cost&#8208;effective alternatives to precious metals. However, the design of sustainable alternatives for the ligands that dictate metal reactivity remains an unresolved issue. In this work, we demonstrate that phosphines and phosphinites assembled from renewable building blocks can enable catalytic transformations mediated by base metals such as Cu, Ni, and Fe. Hydroboration of olefins, borylation of alkyl halides, hydrogenation of ketones, and dimerization of terminal alkynes are now achievable using homogeneous catalysts based on 3d metals and biobased ligands. The mild reaction conditions established in this study facilitate, among other applications, the late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals, such as bexarotene, estrone, and nabumetone.

Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;thiocarboxylic acids featuring C&#8211;S chirality are valuable targets in organic synthesis. This review outlines recent progress in their asymmetric synthesis, including chiral pool approaches, metal&#8208; /organo&#8208;catalysis, and emerging biocatalytic strategies.

Enantiomerically pure &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;thiocarboxylic acids bearing a stereocentre at the C&#8211;S bond represent a class of compounds of notable significance in organic and medicinal chemistry. The chirality at the C&#8211;S bond presents both challenges and opportunities in synthetic chemistry. Traditionally, the enantioselective synthesis of these &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;thiocarboxylic acids has relied on chiral pool strategies using naturally derived precursors such as amino acids and hydroxycarboxylic acids. In recent years, the expansion of organo&#8208; and metal&#8208;catalysed methodologies, employing catalysts such as cinchona alkaloids, copper, and rhodium complexes, has led to strategies with improved efficiency and stereocontrol. Additionally, advances in biocatalysis have enabled more sustainable routes toward s these valuable compounds, using enzymes such as hydrolases and nitrilases. Given the growing academic and industrial interest in these compounds, this review provides an overview of the methods developed and the progresses made over the past two decades in the asymmetric synthesis of thiocarboxylic acids bearing a stereocentre at C&#8211;S bond.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Dehydrogenative Lactonization of Benzylic Alcohols: A Sustainable Access to Phthalides via N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide Mediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, scalable electrocatalytic method for direct lactonization of benzylic alcohols to phthalides using N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide as a redox mediator is reported. This metal&#8208;free process proceeds via a phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer mechanism, shows broad scope with good to excellent yields, and enables late&#8208;stage functionalizations, including syntheses of talopram and a Y5 receptor antagonist intermediate.

A sustainable and efficient electrochemical method for the direct oxidative lactonization of benzylic alcohols, enabling rapid access to isobenzofuran&#8208;1(3H)&#8208;ones (phthalides) is presented. This electrocatalytic transformation leverages N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide as a redox mediator under mild, metal&#8208;free conditions, offering an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional oxidation protocols. The method demonstrates broad substrate scope and delivers phthalide derivatives consistently in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies, combining cyclic voltammetry and density functional theory calculations, support a radical&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer mechanism driven by phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl radicals. Importantly, the utility of the protocol extends beyond model substrates: it is successfully applied to the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant compounds, including talopram and a key intermediate for a neuropeptide Y5 receptor antagonist. Overall, this work underscores the power of electrosynthesis in modern organic chemistry, merging green chemistry principles with synthetic efficiency.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Conia&#8208;Ene Reaction of Malonate Derivatives Bearing An Alkyne Moiety by Using a Phosphine&#8211;Borane Ligand</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphine&#8211;borane gold complex can catalyze the cycloisomerization of malonates bearing an alkyne moiety. In the case of 2&#8208;(4&#8208;pentynyl)malonate, a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#8208;mode cyclization occurs, while 2&#8208;(3&#8208;butynyl)malonate gives cyclopentenes via a 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig mode cyclization.

A gold&#8208;catalyzed Conia&#8208;ene reaction of malonate derivatives is developed by using a phosphine&#8211;borane ligand. This catalyst system can be applicable not only for 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#8208;mode cyclization reactions but also for 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig&#8208;mode cyclizations. A variety of 2&#8208;(4&#8208;pentynyl)malonates and 2&#8208;(3&#8208;butynyl)malonates afford the corresponding cyclic compounds in moderate to high yields. The boryl enolate might be formed in situ and attacks intramolecularly an alkyne moiety, activated by a gold catalyst, is considered.

         <title>N&#8208;Containing Carbon Materials in Metal&#8208;Free and Non&#8208;Noble Metal Liquid Phase Heterogenous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over 100 examples of non&#8208;noble metal supported on N&#8208;containing and metal&#8208;free N&#8208;containing carbon catalysts are discussed. Particular emphasis is put on how different N&#8208;functionalities influence catalyst performance and stability. Preparation procedures are also examined, with a strong focus on how the heat treatment temperature influences N&#8208;functionalities distribution.

Non&#8208;noble metal and metal&#8208;free catalysts can be of great benefit for the development of economically and environmentally sustainable chemical processes. In this context, N&#8208;containing carbon materials serve both as effective catalyst supports and standalone catalysts, offering enhanced stability by mitigating deactivation mechanisms such as metal leaching and sintering. The review is primarily organized by non&#8208;noble metal, systematically covering each case in which their use as an active phase on N&#8208;containing carbon materials has been reported in literature. In parallel, cross&#8208;cutting aspects are examined throughout, including the role of different N&#8208;functionalities (graphitic, pyridinic, pyrrolic, and pyridinic&#8208;N&#8208;oxide) in active&#8208;phase stabilization mechanisms. Structurally diverse carbon materials&#8212;such as amorphous carbon, carbon nanotubes, carbon spheres, carbon nanofibers, and graphene&#8212;are also considered. Furthermore, the influence of preparation methods, including template&#8208;free, hard&#8208;templating and soft&#8208;templating techniques, is analyzed with emphasis on their role in tuning textural properties. Despite significant progress, uncertainties remain regarding the precise stabilization mechanisms and the relative contributions of different N&#8208;functionalities to catalytic activity and surface acid&#8211;base properties. Addressing these knowledge gaps will be essential for optimization of N&#8208;containing carbon materials and to drive the transition towards greener and more sustainable catalytic technologies.

The cascade reaction of cyclic 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diketones and diarylamines was efficiently developed, enabling straightforward access to a series of 2&#8208;aminocyclopentenones in good to excellent yields (71&#8211;90%).

The procedure is proposed to go through a sequence of Wolff rearrangement via initial ketene formation, nucleophilic addition/keto&#8208;enol tautomerization, and Rh2(OAc)4&#8208;catalyzed decarbonylative amination followed by an oxidation process.

         <title>Light Mediated Sulfonylation/C&#8211;H Activation/Annulation of Benzimidazoles Derivatives Catalyzed by Diarylmethylium Tetrafluoroborate Salts: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the exploiting of visible&#8208;light, a key photoactive complex, and an acid&#8208;catalyzed proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, polycyclic sulfonylated benzimidazoles are obtained through a domino process including sulfonylation, C&#8211;H activation, and annulation. Diarylmethylium tetrafluoroborates are employed as inexpensive organocatalyst capable of forming a photoactive complex with sulfinates. Its interaction with light triggers the formation of the essential sulfonyl radical, which initiates the domino process.

In this article, diarylmethylium tetrafluoroborates are exploited as catalysts in a visible light promoted domino sulfonylation/C&#8211;H activation/annulation of N&#8208;alkynylbenzimidazoles producing polycyclic sulfonyl&#8208;benzimidazoles. Annulated benzimidazoles are important structures in pharmaceutical research and drug discovery known for their biological and medicinal properties. More than 20 polycyclic sulfonyl&#8208;benzimidazoles, including azepines, are obtained in good to excellent yields, in mild and metal free conditions. A mechanism proposal, based on both experimental and computational studies, establishes the role of the photoactive ion couple formed between the cation catalyst and the sulfinate in producing the key sulfonyl radical. The latter adds to the triple bond thus promoting a domino process in which the acid additive has a fundamental role in the hydrogen transfer. In addition, an acid&#8208;catalyzed proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer closes the catalytic cycle regenerating the diarylcarbenium salt thus yielding the desired product.

         <title>Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Annulative C&#63743;H Activation of &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl Phosphoniums with CF3&#8208;Imidoyl Sulfoxonium Ylides: Synthesis of 3&#8208;Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Isoquinolones</title>

A ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed annulative C&#63743;H activation of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl phosphoniums with CF3&#8208;imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides is reported, affording 3&#8208;CF3&#8208;isoquinolones in 44&#8211;98% yields. The reaction proceeds via a cascade of ruthenium(II)&#8208;carbenoid formation, migratory insertion, and aza&#8208;cyclization, exhibiting broad substrate scope and functional group tolerance.

Herein, ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H activation/annulation of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl phosphoniums with CF3&#8208;imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides is carried out to generate a series of 3&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;isoquinolones in 44&#8211;98% yields. A plausible mechanism involving a cascade C&#63743;H activation of arenes, formation of ruthenium(II) carbenoid, migratory insertion of the Ru&#8722;aryl bond, and intramolecular aza&#8208;cyclization is proposed. In addition, the reaction procedure features simple synthesis, wide substrate scope, and excellent functional group compatibility. Furthermore, the application potential of the developed protocol is demonstrated through successful scale&#8208;up experiments and subsequent transformations.

         <title>Thiazolium Salts: From Thiamine to Cutting&#8208;Edge Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) in organocatalytic reactions is of paramount interest and has been the subject of numerous studies over the years. Indeed, this hot and vast topic has been covered and often updated in many excellent articles. In this review, this subject is approached by highlighting thiazolium salts from an evolutionary perspective over time. Indeed, the idea is to retrace the origins of thiazolium&#8208;based NHC by featuring the crucial role played by thiazolium salts as precatalysts: In other words, to provide an account from the umpolung&#8208;concept beginnings through thiamine biocatalytic crucial transformations to cutting&#8208;edge thiazolylidene organocatalysts.

In this comprehensive review, the history of thiazolium salts as N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes (NHC) in organocatalytic reactions is intended to be presented. Although the subject (i.e., NHC in organocatalysis) has been covered in several reviews in past years, the idea here stands on the exclusive use of thiazolium salts in such transformations. Indeed, thiazoliums and their related NHCs are the first identified as efficient mediators for the C&#63743;C bond formation through its peculiar ability to reverse the classical reactivity (umpolung) of carbonyl groups. However, they are relatively quickly overtaken by other classes of NHCs generated from imidazolium and triazolium salts. Even though, thiazolylidenes are still better catalysts in some particular reactions affording outstanding results in terms of conversion and selectivity. Owing to the remarkably high number of reactions that are made possible thanks to the very characteristic properties of such NHCs, the aim of this review is to provide a full account on the discovery and evolution of thiazolium salts and thiazolylidenes in NHC organocatalysis. Information is&#160;first&#160;provided on their synthesis, structural evolution, physicochemical and electronic properties, and then reactivity and application in various organocatalytic methodologies.

Cyclic ethers are prevalent structural motifs in natural products and pharmaceuticals, and their efficient synthesis has attracted significant attention in organic chemistry. An approach for the functionalization of cyclic ethers via gold&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization and rearrangement is developed. This transformation enabled the synthesis of C&#8208;glycoside derivatives from alkynyl compounds bearing O&#8208;glycosides.

An electro&#8208;oxidative protocol for the alkoxylation&#8208;thiolation of vinyl ethers is developed, employing nonvolatile diaryl disulfides as atom&#8208;economical arylthio sources under oxidant&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free conditions. 4&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)pyridine is used as a base additive to suppress side reactions and improve the yield. A wide range of substrates with diverse structures and functional groups are compatible with this protocol. Mechanism experiments show that the reaction involves a mechanism in which an arylthio radical is generated at the anode as the key intermediate.

         <title>Photoinduced Ligated Boryl Radical&#8208;Mediated Functionalization of Organic Halides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents the latest advancements in ligated boryl radical&#8208;mediated XAT chemistry, emphasizing the diversity of achievable reactions, the fundamental reaction pathways, and the valuable mechanistic insights uncovered.

Halogen atom transfers (XATs) represent a valuable class of reactions that facilitate the functionalization of C&#63743;X bonds in alkyl and aryl halides. Historically, these transformations relied on tin&#8208; or silicon&#8208;based reagents, which are plagued by several drawbacks, including toxicity, complex synthesis, and high costs. In response to these limitations, ligated boranes have recently emerged as a greener alternative, functioning as efficient halogen abstractors through the generation of reactive boryl radical species.

&lt;p&gt;This review presents the latest advancements in ligated boryl radical-mediated XAT chemistry, emphasizing the diversity of achievable reactions, the fundamental reaction pathways, and the valuable mechanistic insights uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halogen atom transfers (XATs) represent a valuable class of reactions that facilitate the functionalization of C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;X bonds in alkyl and aryl halides. Historically, these transformations relied on tin- or silicon-based reagents, which are plagued by several drawbacks, including toxicity, complex synthesis, and high costs. In response to these limitations, ligated boranes have recently emerged as a greener alternative, functioning as efficient halogen abstractors through the generation of reactive boryl radical species. This approach enables the selective and straightforward formation of alkyl and aryl radicals from their halide precursors, opening the door to a wide range of chemical transformations. This review highlights the most recent progress in ligated boryl radical-mediated XAT chemistry, focusing on the variety of accessible reactions, the underlying mechanisms, and the mechanistic insights gained. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review dedicated to boryl radical-mediated XAT processes.

Construction of meta&#8208;Disubstituted Triaryls via Iodine&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Aromatization Coupling of Cycloalkenes with Indoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxidative aromatization coupling strategy has been developed for the construction of meta&#8208;substituted unsymmetric triaryls using various substituted cyclohexenes and indoles. It is expected that this protocol may be of broad interest in chemistry community and constitutes a practical alternative to the synthesis of natural products, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials.

meta&#8208;Disubstituted triaryls are privileged scaffolds in bioactive molecules and functional materials, but their efficient synthesis remains challenging, due to limitations in regioselectivity and reliance on prefunctionalized substrates or transition metals. Herein, an iodine&#8208;catalyzed oxidative aromatization strategy is reported for the construction of meta&#8208;triaryls via direct coupling of readily available cycloalkenes with indoles. This protocol enables regioselective C&#63743;C bond formation at the indole C3&#8208;position and a subsequent dehydrogenative desaturation of the cycloalkene component to form the meta&#8208;substituted arene motif. The method features broad substrate scope, accommodating diverse substituted cycloalkenes and indoles. Key advantages include economical catalyst (HI as iodine source), avoidance of precious metals, and operational simplicity. Additionally, the products can undergo an array of synthetic transformations, including heterocycle skeleton editing to quinolines, halogenations, and photoredox functionalizations, which highlight the potential applications of this strategy.

Cu+&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly engineering narrows the bandgap of ZIF&#8208;67 while extending the light absorption range of CoCu&#8208;ZIF. The staggered energy levels in the resulting CoCu&#8208;ZIF/Cu3P&#8208;GDY composite generate a strong driving force. The formation of an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction between GDY and CoCu&#8208;ZIF. Cu3P acts as an electron bridge to promote the directional transfer of photogenerated carriers driven by interfacial electric fields.

Rational design of interfacial electric fields in nanostructures for accelerated photogenerated carrier transfer and separation. First, Cu+&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly engineering narrows the bandgap of ZIF&#8208;67 while extending the light absorption range of CoCu&#8208;ZIF. Furthermore, hierarchical architecture is constructed to incorporate the cocatalyst Cu3P&#8208;GDY. The staggered energy levels in the resulting CoCu&#8208;ZIF/Cu3P&#8208;GDY composite generate a strong driving force. Comprehensive characterization, including density functional theory calculations and Mott&#8211;Schottky analysis, confirm the formation of an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction between GDY and CoCu&#8208;ZIF. Cu3P acts as an electron bridge to promote the directional transfer of photogenerated carriers driven by interfacial electric fields. Differential surface photovoltage signals demonstrate that the robust interfacial electric field enables efficient carrier separation in the CoCu&#8208;ZIF/Cu3P&#8208;GDY composite. This work establishes a new paradigm for enhancing catalytic performance through broadened light absorption and rationally engineered interfacial electric fields.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in the cyclization chemistry of N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts and their derivatives, with a particular focus on transition&#8208;metal catalyzed, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free systems and visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced transformations. The scope, limitations, and synthetic applications of various cyclization strategies are critically discussed, aiming to reveal the innovative potential of N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts as nitrogen&#8208;based precursors in synthetic chemistry.

N&#8208;Aminopyridinium salts are readily available and bench&#8208;stable nitrogen&#8208;containing precursors that have demonstrated broad synthetic utility in diverse cyclization reactions. As practical 1,3&#8208;dipoles, N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts can engage with dipolarophiles in cycloaddition reactions to construct nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. Moreover, as a class of novel aminating or bifunctional aminating reagents, they are capable of generating nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals under visible&#8208;light irradiation, which can initiate amination&#8208;cyclization processes. In recent years, cyclization strategies involving N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts have made remarkable progress and garnered significant attention.

A highly efficient gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cycloisomerization of readily available 1,6&#8208;oxygenated enynes, enabling direct access to valuable 3&#8208;oxabicyclo[4.1.0]hept&#8208;4&#8208;ene scaffolds with excellent enantiomeric excesses (up to &gt;99% ee, 35 derivatives), in the presence of a chiral cationic Au(I) catalyst ((S)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;MeOBIPHEP(AuCl)2 /AgOTf system) in toluene is described. The resulting chiral bicyclic ethers serve as versatile intermediates for the synthesis of novel hedonic derivatives.

A highly efficient gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cycloisomerization of readily available 1,6&#8208;oxygenated enynes is reported, enabling direct access to valuable 3&#8208;oxabicyclo[4.1.0]hept&#8208;4&#8208;ene scaffolds with excellent enantiomeric excesses (up to&#8201;&gt;99% ee, 35 derivatives), in the presence of a chiral cationic Au(I) catalyst ((S)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;MeOBIPHEP(AuCl)2 /AgOTf system) in toluene. This methodology uniquely combines high stereoselectivity with good to excellent yields for volatile substrates that have been challenging derivatives in the asymmetric cycloisomerization community. Notably, the resulting chiral bicyclic ethers serve as versatile intermediates for the synthesis of novel hedonic derivatives. A systematic investigation of their odor profiles reveals remarkable differences between enantiomers, demonstrating the profound impact of molecular chirality on olfactory perception.

         <title>A Versatile Route to 3,3&#8208;Disubstituded Phthalides Via Arylogous Michael Addition Catalyzed by Organic Base</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the 3,3&#8208;disubstituted phthalide synthesis. This phthalide expansion toolkit involves a mild and organocatalytic Michael addition protocol to couple 3&#8208;arylphthalides with Michael acceptors, demonstrating broad functional group tolerance, gram&#8208;scale feasibility, and utility for the preparation of spiro&#8208;phthalide scaffold. 

The 3,3&#8208;disubstituted phthalide scaffold, a privileged structure in medicinal chemistry and natural product synthesis, serves as a key motif in many bioactive compounds. Leveraging the solvent&#8208;dependent pKa modulation of organic bases, this study introduces a mild, organocatalytic Michael addition protocol for coupling diverse 3&#8208;arylphthalides with Michael acceptors. The method demonstrates broad functional group tolerance, accommodating electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents. The versatility of this methodology is highlighted by mild reaction conditions, short reaction times, and gram&#8208;scale feasibility. Finally, the approach may open the gate to asymmetric catalysis, offering access to enantiomerically enriched phthalides.

Chemodivergent Higher&#8208;Order Annulation of Azaheptafulvenes with Enals through N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis.

A base&#8208;directed, chemodivergent, higher&#8208;order annulation between azaheptafulvenes and enals has been developed through N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis. In the presence of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene organocatalyst, DBU promotes an [8&#8201;+&#8201;3] annulation with excellent chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivities, whereas the reaction proceeds via an [8&#8201;+&#8201;2] annulation when potassium carbonate is used as the base. In addition, the reaction can be carried out on a gram scale, and the products are efficiently converted into bicyclic derivatives.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalyzed Selective Synthesis of 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;Dithianes From Thietanes: An Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although this article formally presents a regioselective photochemical ring enlargement of thietanes into 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;dithianes, time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations have revealed that 1,3&#8208;dithianes are in fact formed thought photoinduced hydrogen atom transfers from 1,2&#8208;dithianes initially resulting from the ring enlargement using thioaldehyde substrates.

Unlike other sulfur&#8208;containing heterocycles, the potential applications of functionalized dithianes have been less explored to date due to their challenging synthesis. To address this issue, we herein leverage the straightforward access to functionalized thietanes and describe a selective photochemical ring enlargement of the latter to 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;dithianes using thiocarbonyl substrates, which are in&#8201;situ generated via a Norrish&#8208;type II fragmentation reaction. The library of dithianes obtained by this photocatalyzed domino sequence between diversely substituted thietanes and various thiocarbonyls revealed regioselectivity rules: excited thioketones lead exclusively to 1,2&#8208;dithianes, while excited thioaldehydes selectively yield 1,3&#8208;dithianes, where 1,2&#8208;dithianes serve as precursors to their regioisomers. The ring expansion reaction leading to 1,2&#8208;dithianes was also integrated into a triple photochemical cascade, where the thietane intermediates were obtained via a thia&#8208;Patern&#242;_B&#252;chi reaction between Norrish&#8208;II thiocarbonyl products and various alkene partners. These experimental results were complemented with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations, which support the complex chemical pathway, rationalize the observed regioselectivity, and further substantiate mechanistic proposals related to the photolysis of disulfide bridges in peptides.

         <title>Recent Advances in Ene Reactions with Carbon Enophiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the classical intra&#8208; and intermolecular ene nexus with carbon enophiles (alkenes, alkynes, arynes, and allenes) show a considerable increase in structural complexity and an enormous potential for functional applications in polymer science.

Ene reactions are inter&#8208; or intramolecular addition reactions between a four&#8208;electron "ene" component and a two&#8208;electron enophile functionality, in which two &#960;&#8208;bonds and a C&#8211;H (or metal&#8211;C) &#963;&#8208;bond are rearranged into one &#960;&#8208;bond and two &#963;&#8208;bonds. One of the newly formed &#963;&#8208;bonds is a carbon&#8211;carbon bond, while the other is the rearranged a C&#8211;H (or metal&#8211;C) bond. This transformation enables the formation of structurally and functionally complex ene products in a single step. Originally, ene reactions were discovered as concerted and stepwise pericyclic elementary processes. However, increasing mechanistic insight&#8212;gained through both experimental and computational studies&#8212;along with extensive empirical methodological work, has paved the way to a plethora of ene&#8208;type reactions involving carbon enophiles. Since 2012, the already well&#8208;established transition metal&#8208;catalyzed variants of ene reactions have significantly expanded. Moreover, highly reactive aryne intermediates&#8212;generated in&#8201;situ either by fluoride induced elimination from ortho&#8208;silyl aryltriflates at room temperature, or by hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of a 1,3&#8208;diyne with an alkyne (both inter&#8208; and intramolecularly)&#8212;find increasing application in novel ene&#8208;type sequences. Propargyl ene reactions also gain traction, particularly because the resulting ene&#8208;allenes serve as highly valuable intermediates in the design of domino sequences that lead to complex polycyclic fused structures. Finally, the implementation of ene reactions in polymer chemistry for the synthesis of functionalized polymers and renewable unsaturated raw materials has emerged as a promising alternative to the use of purely petrochemistry based substrates.

         <title>Active&#8208;Site Microenvironments Design of Hydrogenation Catalysts for Enhanced Hydrocracking of Heavy Oil</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the regulation strategies of hydrogenation catalysts from the molecular scale to atomic scale for slurry phase hydrocracking (SPHC), proposes the design principles of active&#8208;site microenvironment for hydrogenation catalysts to enhance SPHC, and prospects the opportunities and challenges of hydrogenation catalysts for SPHC.

Slurry phase hydrocracking (SPHC) is one of the effective ways to achieve efficient conversion of low&#8208;quality heavy oil. The active&#8208;site structural design of catalysts is crucial to improve the performance but is still challenging. However, up to now, few reviews on the active&#8208;site microenvironments design of catalyst for enhancing SPHC performance have been reported. Herein, this review summarizes the research progress on the active&#8208;site microenvironments regulation strategies of hydrogenation catalysts at the molecular scale for SPHC systematically. Then, based on the problem of low hydrogenation efficiency due to the easy aggregation and low atomic utilization of molecular catalysts, the design strategies for catalysts on the atomic scale are proposed systematically. Subsequently, the design principles of active&#8208;site microenvironment for hydrogenation catalysts to enhance the SPHC are revealed. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of atomically dispersed catalyst for SPHC are prospected. This review provides an important reference for the design and development of high&#8208;performance hydrogenation catalysts for SPHC of heavy oil.

         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the application of dioxazolones in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroamidation are studied.

In recent years, research on transition metal&#8208;catalyzed amide synthesis has increasingly emerged as a significant focus. Among the efficient amidation reagents, dioxazolones have demonstrated excellent utility in hydroamidation reactions, enabling the rapid conversion of substrates such as alkenes, alkynes, and enynes into enamine or aliphatic amine derivatives. This review summarizes recent advances in dioxazolone&#8208;enabled hydroamidation, with a detailed discussion of diverse substrate types, including various alkenes, alkynes, and enynes as starting materials. Furthermore, the performance and mechanisms of various transition metal catalysts in these processes have been explored. The synthetic strategies, reaction mechanisms, substrate scope, and practical applications of these transformations are comprehensively analyzed, highlighting the versatility and adaptability of dioxazolones in hydroamidation. We anticipate that this review will provide readers with a clearer understanding of this field, inspire further exploratory research, and advance the development and application of hydroamidations.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrative Decarboxylation of Nitroarenes with Alkynyl Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed denitrative decarboxylation protocol is developed, which couples nitroarenes with terminal alkynyl carboxylic acids bearing silyl, aliphatic, and aryl substituents. 48 aryl alkynes can be directly constructed from readily available nitro precursors and the yield is up to 85%. Significantly, the cost&#8208;effective and ecofriendly protocol permits efficient regiochemical synthesis of 3&#8208;substituted benzofuran or isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives.

A general approach for the decarboxylation of alkynyl carboxylic acids with nitroarenes via denitrative coupling is reported for the first time. The methodology demonstrates broad substrate generality, accommodating diverse nitroaromatics, including electron&#8208;deficient heteroarenes, to deliver aryl alkynes with high efficiency. Notably, this methodology enables the use of nitroarenes and aryl&#8208;substituted carboxylic acids to access diarylacetylene products. Furthermore, this protocol permits efficient synthesis of 3&#8208;substituted benzofuran or isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives, which is a challenging regiochemical outcome unattainable through conventional coupling strategies.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Photocatalyzed Decarboxylative Giese&#8208;Type Reaction of &#945;&#8208;N, O or S Carboxylic Acids: Insight into the Mechanism of the Radical Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;deficient alkenes can be functionalized with &#945;&#8208;amino, &#945;&#8208;alkoxy and &#945;&#8208;alkylthio radicals formed by Fe&#8208;photocatalyzed decarboxylation of the corresponding carboxylic acids. The reactions proceed under smooth ligandless conditions with inexpensive base and in the absence of oxidant. A mechanistic computational TD&#8208;DFT study supports the occurrence of homolytic Fe&#63743;O cleavage upon excitation of Fe(III)&#8208;carboxylate complexes by visible light.

Very simple conditions are described for the Fe&#8208;photocatalyzedaddition of &#945;&#8208;amino, &#945;&#8208;alkoxy, and &#945;&#8208;alkylthio radicals to electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. The reactions proceed under smooth ligandless conditions with inexpensive base and in the absence of oxidant. A mechanistic computational TD&#8208;DFT study on the formation and evolution of the electronic excited states supports for the first time that, after Fe(III)&#8208;carboxylate excitation by visible light, homolytic cleavage of the Fe&#63743;O actually takes place, leading to a carboxyl radical.

         <title>Photoinduced EDA Complex&#8208;Enabled Radical Alkylation/Cyclization Reaction of N&#8208;Arylacrylamides with Katritzky Salts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated radical alkylation/cyclization reaction is reported between N&#8208;Arylacrylamides and Katritzky salts for the efficient construction of phenanthridines under mild conditions. Triggered by photoexcitation of electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes formed between salts and N, N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine, this strategy circumvents the requirement for photocatalysts and transition&#8208;metal catalysts.

As important structural motifs among N&#8208;heterocycles, phenanthridines are ubiquitous in significant functional compounds. Herein, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated radical alkylation/cyclization reaction between N&#8208;Arylacrylamides and Katritzky salts for the efficient construction of phenanthridines under mild conditions is reported.

Copper(II) Complex Dispersed in Imidazolium&#8208;Based Ionic Liquid: Recyclable Catalyst System for Regioselective and Chemoselective Hydrobromination and Hydrochlorination of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu(II)/4,7&#8208;(MeO)2phen complex dispersed in an [EMIM]&#8208;based ionic liquid as a catalyst system for the hydrohalogenation of alkynes is reported. Using bromotrimethylsilane or TMSCl as the halide source, the reaction provides access to alkenyl halides, showing good regioselectivity and stereoselectivity across a range of functionalized alkynes. Remarkably, the reaction exhibits unprecedented chemoselectivity for the alkyne over the alkene in polyenynes.

A recyclable catalyst system combining Cu(II)O and 4,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline in a 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid for the hydrohalogenation of alkynes is reported. The reaction efficiently yields alkenyl bromides and chlorides with good functional group tolerance and regioselectivity across a range of functionalized alkynes. Remarkably, the reaction exhibits unprecedented chemoselectivity for alkyne over alkenes in polyenynes and enables late&#8208;stage modifications to rapidly synthesize brominated polyenes. The catalyst system can be recycled for up to six runs without significant reduction of the reaction yield.

&lt;p&gt;A recyclable catalyst system combining Cu(II)O and 4,7-dimethoxy-1,10-phenanthroline in a 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium-based ionic liquid for the hydrohalogenation of alkynes is reported. The reaction efficiently yields alkenyl bromides and chlorides with good functional group tolerance and regioselectivity across a range of functionalized alkynes. Remarkably, the reaction exhibits unprecedented chemoselectivity for alkyne over alkenes in polyenynes and enables late-stage modifications to rapidly synthesize brominated polyenes. The catalyst system can be recycled for up to six runs without significant reduction of the reaction yield.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An efficient base&#8208;mediated approach to access spiro(pyrroloquinolines&#8208;cyclohexadienone) frameworks bearing two stereocenters, and a quaternary spiro center from enone&#8208;tethered indoles and p&#8208;quinone methides via (4 + 2) dearomative ipso&#8208;cyclization under mild conditions is reported, offering broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance. Operational simplicity, high atom economy, large&#8208;scale synthesis, and postsynthetic modifications are additional key features.

An unprecedented base&#8208;mediated formal (4&#8201;+&#8201;2) ipso&#8208;cyclization of para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) with enone&#8208;tethered indoles to provide an extensive array of spiro(pyrroloquinolines&#8208;cyclohexadienones) in good to excellent yield and highly diastereoselective manner bearing two stereocenters, and a quaternary spiro center is described. The tetracyclic 1,7&#8208;fuzed indoles are effectively produced from easily accessible starting materials under mild conditions. The settled protocols feature operational simplicity, high atom economy, gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and postsynthetic modifications.

         <dc:description>
A photoredox strategy enables regioselective synthesis of fluoroalkyl 2&#8208;pyrazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ones via radical addition and cyclization. This mild, metal&#8208;free method shows a broad substrate scope, operates in batch and flow systems, and offers a sustainable approach to fluorinated heterocycles with potential applications in medicinal chemistry.

A photoredox&#8208;enabled strategy is developed for the regioselective synthesis of fluoroalkyl 2&#8208;pyrazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ones via radical addition&#8211;cyclization cascades. This metal&#8208;free approach enables the efficient incorporation of perfluoroalkyl and difluoromethylene groups into methacryloyl hydrazide under mild conditions. The protocol demonstrates broad substrate scope, functions in both batch and continuous flow systems, and proceeds through a photo&#8208;oxidative quenching mechanism. This method provides a sustainable and versatile route to fluorinated heterocycles with promising applications in medicinal chemistry.

         <dc:description>The hitherto few explored &#945;&#8208;halomethyl amidine motif has been assembled through the addition of a lithiated (di)&#8208;halomethane (i.e. carbenoid) to easily accessible N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl substituted carbodiimides. Despite the inherent low electrophilicity of these heterocumulenes &#8211; as quantitatively determined in Mayr&#8217;s previous studies &#8211; their sp&#8208;hybridized carbon atom acts as a competent site of attack for these tamed nucleophiles. The overall high&#8208;yielding transformation featuring a genuine chemoselective profile &#8211; as documented by employing variously functionalized materials &#8211; is adaptable to the addition of dihalogenated carbenoids. Reaction products could be advantageously employed in nucleophilic substitution sequences, as well as, in further functionalization of the nitrogen atoms due to the constitutive heteroallyl&#8208;type skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>eAmidation: An Electrochemical Amidation of Aldehydes via the Oxidation of N&#8208;Aryl Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the use of electrochemistry has emerged as a powerful yet sustainable means of enabling key transformations. Amidation is one of the most frequently executed transformations in synthetic chemistry, and using an electrochemical approach, the current study has demonstrated the synthesis of amides from aldehydes and amines. Mechanistic work indicates that the reaction proceeds via the oxidation of an intermediate hydrazone to generate an acyl diazene as the acylating species. The protocol developed has enabled the synthesis of a broad range of amides, including access to pharmaceutically relevant products, directly from aldehydes without recourse for hazardous chemical oxidants and activating agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand controlled regio&#8208;divergent [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of alkynes by merging electrochemistry and nickel catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions between three alkynes, a diyne and an alkyne, or a triyne offer a straightforward and typical protocol toward all kinds of polysubstituted benzens. Herein, the synthesis of polysubstituted aromatics through electrochemical nickel catalyzed cyclotrimerization of alkynes is developed. The regio&#8208;divergent cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes was achieved by judicious choice of ligands. And tributylphosphine, sterically hindered bipyridine or &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands delivered 1,2,4&#8208; and 1,3,5&#8208;substituted aromatics with high regioselectivities respectively. Besides, the semi&#8208;intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between	diynes and alkynes are also amenable under this catalytic system. This approach operates without metal reductant, exhibits wide functional groups tolerance, ease of scalability and furnishes 75 examples with moderate to good yields, including some biorelevant compounds. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculation revealed the catalytic pathways of 1,3,5&#8208; and 1,2,4&#8208;cyclotrimerizations, and the origin of the ligand controlled regioselectivity.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;carboalkoxy&#8208;3&#8208;substituted&#8208;cyclohexenones are powerful building blocks for the synthesis of a variety of bioactive target molecules. Their preparations requires multi&#8208;steps sequence involving the use of stoichiometric quantities of various reagents, while the catalytic approaches are limitited to trisubstituted cyclohexenones. We describe here an efficient catalytic approach based on gold(I)&#8208;catalysis starting from unsymmetrical diynyl mono&#8208;ester or symmetrical diynyl di&#8208;ester substrates. The carbon chain linking the two alkyne functions can bear two or one substituent, or even be unsubstituted. Regardless of the nature of the substrates and independently of its substitution, the cyclohexenone derivatives are cleanly produced.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(II) complex dispersed in imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid: Recyclable catalyst system for regioselective and chemoselective hydrobromination and hydrochlorination of alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a recyclable catalyst system combining Cu(II)O and 4,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline in a 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid for the hydrohalogenation of alkynes. The reaction efficiently yields alkenyl bromides and chlorides with good functional group tolerance and regioselectivity across a range of functionalized alkynes. Remarkably, the reaction exhibits unprecedented chemoselectivity for alkyne over alkenes in polyenynes and enables late&#8208;stage modifications to rapidly synthesize brominated polyenes. The catalyst system could be recycled for up to six runs without significant reduction of the reaction yield.</dc:description>

         <title>SuFEx reactions when shaken not stirred
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Click reactions display many of the goals desired for more sustainable chemical
conversions.  Yet, the solvent used is an often overlooked aspect in determining the
environmental impact of reactions. In the current paper we develop the first
mechanochemical method for the efficient and solvent&#8208;free SuFEx reaction of sulfonyl
fluorides with a wide range of phenols.  After outlining the optimization process, which
yields an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use and robust method, we provide indications of the very wide
scope of this approach, and demonstrate this potential via the application to a range of
natural phenols that also display other functionalities, and several gram&#8208;scale
syntheses.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A convenient and efficient metal&#8208;free protocol has been reported for formylation of various amines with carbon dioxide. This reaction could proceed under ambient conditions and show a broad substrate scope, encompassing primary amines, secondary amines, chiral amino acid esters and bioactive molecules. Furthermore, this method offers several advantages, including the preservation of substrate chirality, ease of separation and purification and the suitability of formic acid and formate salts as reactants in this reaction.</dc:description>
