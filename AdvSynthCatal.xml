      <title>Benzyne&#8208;Induced Ring Opening Reactions of DABCO: Synthesis of 1,4&#8208;Disubstituted Piperazines and Piperidines</title>
      <dc:description>The 2&#8208;(4&#8208;phenylpiperazin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;amine scaffold is a structurally important motif that occurs frequently in medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry. Despite the significance of this moiety, general strategies for its synthesis to date have required multistep methods and have been very limited, such as the use of SNAr&#8208;type reactions. Herein, we describe a synthetic methodology employing benzynes, 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane (DABCO), and nitrogen nucleophiles to access these privileged organic compounds. The established protocol proved to be a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, mild reaction that proceeded via a quaternary ammonium salt formed from the benzyne and DABCO.</dc:description>

      <title>Facile Synthesis of 2&#8208;(Arylthio)indolenines via Chemoselective Arylation of Thio&#8208;oxindoles with Arynes</title>
      <dc:description>A chemoselective S&#8208;arylation reaction of thio&#8208;oxindoles with arynes is presented. The reaction was performed under mild conditions and provided a straightforward synthesis of 2&#8208;(arylthio)indolenines in good to excellent yields. Besides, this simple operational protocol is not only scalable but also tolerable with good functional group compatibilities and substrate scope. Thus, our protocol should allow for the expansion of chemical space via developing new scaffolds of thioimidates that are difficult to synthesize otherwise.</dc:description>

      <title>Iodine/Manganese Catalyzed Sulfenylation of Indole via Dehydrogenative Oxidative Coupling in Anisole</title>
      <dc:description>This protocol describes an iodine/manganese catalytic system for dehydrogenative oxidative coupling reaction of indoles with thiols in anisole. Particularly, the dual roles of anisole have been first demonstrated as a solvent and as a promoter via the formation of an oxonium ion intermediate to accelerate the generation of products. A series of sulfenylindoles are readily constructed under aerobic mild reaction conditions. In addition, the achievement for preparing anticancer and anti&#8208;AIDS drugs testifies the practicability of this approach. The mechanism studies disclose probable alternative pathways and a single&#8208;electron transfer process are involved in this transformation.</dc:description>

      <title>Insights into the Substrate Promiscuity of Novel Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases</title>
      <dc:description>Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSDHs) are valuable biocatalysts for the regio&#8208; and stereoselective modification of steroids, bile acids and other steroid derivatives. In this work, we investigated the substrate promiscuity of this highly selective class of enzymes. In order to reach this goal, a preliminary search of HSDH homologues in in&#8208;house or public available (meta)genomes was carried out. Eight novel NAD(H)&#8208;dependent HSDHs, showing either 7&#945;&#8208;, 7&#946;&#8208;, or 12&#945;&#8208;HSDH activity, and including, for the first time, enzymes from extremophilic microorganisms, were identified, recombinantly produced, and characterized. Among the novel HSDHs, four highly active (up to 92 U mg&#8208;1) NAD(H)&#8208;dependent 7&#946;&#8208;HSDHs showing negligible similarity towards previously described 7&#946;&#8208;HSDHs, were discovered. 
These enzymes, along with previously characterized HSDHs, were tested as biocatalysts for the stereoselective reduction of a panel of substrates including two &#945;&#8208;ketoesters of pharmaceutical interest and selected ketones that partially resemble the structural features of steroids. All the reactions were coupled with a suitable cofactor regeneration system. Regarding the &#945;&#8208;ketoesters, nearly all of the tested HSDHs showed a good activity toward the selected substrates, yielding the reduced &#945;&#8208;hydroxyester with up to 99% conversions and enantiomeric excesses. On the other hand, only the 7&#946;&#8208;HSDHs from Collinsella aerofaciens and Clostridium absonum showed appreciable activity toward more complex ketones, i.e., (&#177;)&#8208;trans&#8208;1&#8208;decalone, but with interesting as well as different selectivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Ru&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylative Murai Reaction: Directed C3&#8208;Acylation of Biomass&#8208;Derived 2&#8208;Formyl Heteroaromatics</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. The Murai reaction is a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed transformation leading to alkylated arenes through the C&#8211;C bond formation between an alkene and an arene bearing a directing group.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Abstract. The Murai reaction is a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed transformation leading to alkylated arenes through the C&#8211;C bond formation between an alkene and an arene bearing a directing group. Discovered in the nineties, this useful C&#8211;H activation based coupling has been the object of intense study since its discovery. After having studied the Murai reaction on 2&#8208;formylfurans of biomass derivation, we describe here the carbonylative version applied to 2&#8208;formylfurans, 2&#8208;formylpyrrols and 2&#8208;formylthiophenes. This acylation reaction takes place regioselectively at C3 position of the heterocyclopentadienes thanks to the installation of removable imine directing groups.	The transformation can be achieved by treating the two reaction partners with a catalytic amount of Ru3(CO)12, in toluene at 120&#8208;150 &#176;C, after CO bubbling, at atmospheric pressure. DFT computations of the full catalytic cycle help in deciphering the mechanism of this transformation, and to rationalize the different behaviors depending on the nature of imine directing groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The front cover picture, provided by M. Mar D&#237;az&#8208;Requejo, Pedro J. P&#233;rez and co&#8208;workers, shows the capabilities of copper as catalyst for the selective functionalization of the Csp2&#8722;H bond of 1H&#8208;pyrroles by carbene insertion from diazo compounds. The N&#8722;H and C&#8722;H bonds are represented by chains, from which only the latter can be cleaved in this catalytic transformation, despite the lower bond dissociation energy and higher polarity of the N&#8211;H bond. The authors thank Dr. Ivan Rivilla for artwork design. Details of the work reported can be found in the full paper on pages XXXX&#8211;YYYY (A. M. Rodr&#237;guez, F. Molina, M. M.

      <dc:description>A double C&#8208;H functionalization of cyclopentenedione with benzamidine hydrochloride catalyzed by iodine has been disclosed for synthesizing fused imidazole derivatives. This methodology leads to a variety of fused imidazole derivatives and requires a sub&#8208;stoichiometric amount of iodine as a catalyst and aqueous tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as an oxidant. This reaction involves a double&#8208;cross dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) of 1,3&#8208;cyclopentenedione and benzamidine hydrochloride to form two C&#8208;N bonds in a consecutive manner within a short reaction time. A plausible mechanism has been proposed based on the mass spectrometric analysis.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>An electrochemical direct ortho&#8208;hydroxylation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;4H&#8208;benzo[e][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones was developed with Pd(OAc)2 as catalyst, oxazine ring as a directing group and Oxone as the hydroxylation reagent. A series of hydroxylation products were obtained under mild conditions, and the yields were from medium to good. This method is characterized by good functional group tolerance and a wide range of substrates. More importantly, use anodic oxidation to avoid the use of potentially toxic and polluting oxidants. A gram&#8208;scale direct electrochemical hydroxylation of 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;4H&#8208;benzo[e][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one  was performed, and the hydroxylation product was applied to synthesize the drug deferasirox. In addition, the single crystal of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;4H&#8208;benzo[e][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one was obtained and determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Finally, the reaction mechanism was proposed and verified by cyclic voltammetry (CV). This protocol also provides an alternative electrochemical hydroxylation methodology for the functionalization of molecules.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An electrochemical direct ortho&#8208;hydroxylation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;4H&#8208;benzo[e][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones was developed with Pd(OAc)2 as catalyst, oxazine ring as a directing group and Oxone as the hydroxylation reagent. A series of hydroxylation products were obtained under mild conditions, and the yields were from medium to good. This method is characterized by good functional group tolerance and a wide range of substrates. More importantly, use anodic oxidation to avoid the use of potentially toxic and polluting oxidants. A gram&#8208;scale direct electrochemical hydroxylation of 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;4H&#8208;benzo[e][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one  was performed, and the hydroxylation product was applied to synthesize the drug deferasirox. In addition, the single crystal of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;4H&#8208;benzo[e][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one was obtained and determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Finally, the reaction mechanism was proposed and verified by cyclic voltammetry (CV). This protocol also provides an alternative electrochemical hydroxylation methodology for the functionalization of molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Recent Progress in the Construction of C&#8722;N Bonds via Metal&#8208;Free Radical C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds widely exist in pharmaceuticals and multifunctional materials. Thus, the development of C&#8722;N bond formation reactions is of great importance in synthetic chemistry. Since 2014, obvious progress has been made in the construction of C&#8722;N bonds via metal&#8208;free radical C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization, which is one of the major protocols due to its high reaction activity and mild conditions. To the best of our knowledge, there are still no exclusive reviews about the formation of C&#8722;N bonds through metal&#8208;free radical C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. This review aims to highlight the recent advances in this area since 2014, according to the type of the nitrogen source (amines, amides, sulfonamides, azoles, azides and other nitrogen sources). The paper is focused on discussions about the reaction mechanisms and selected examples of substrates have also been listed.

      <title>Phosphoramidates as Transient Precursors of Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Radical Under Visible Light Irradiation</title>
      <dc:description>
Phosphoramidates and especially phosphonohydrazones were, for the first time, used as efficient N&#8208;Centered Radical (NCR) precursors under visible light irradiation. Mechanistic investigations confirmed the formation of an N&#8208;radical from these brand new derivatives, which was able to be engaged in an intramolecular 6&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization to provide phthalazines. Compared to previous pre&#8208;activated moieties, the phosphoramidate group is self&#8208;immolative, thus enhancing its attractiveness for the C&#8722;N bond formation. Details of this work can be found in the full paper on pages XXXX&#8211;XXXX (M. De Abreu, M. Selkti, P. Belmont, E. Brachet, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2020, 362, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202000018).

      <dc:description>A ligandless and solvent&#8208;free copper&#8208;catalyzed method for the regioselective C&#8211;H bond arylation of indoles and related heteroarenes is reported. The use of CuCl efficiently catalyzes the direct coupling of diverse heteroarenes with aryl iodides via chelation&#8208;assistance. This reaction could tolerate sensitive and structurally diverse functionalities, including halides, ethers, thioethers, amines, indolyl, pyrrolyl and carbazolyl groups. The directing group, 2&#8208;pyridinyl can be smoothly removed to generate C&#8208;2 arylated free&#8208;NH indoles, and the arylated indoles can further be functionalized into Tryptamine derivatives.

      <dc:description>








Abstract
The enantioselective synthesis of chiral azaarenes by rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of organoboronic acids to carbonyl&#8208;activated alkenyl azaarenes was reported. Diverse chiral azaarenes were produced in up to 99% yield and with up to 99% ee (&gt;60 examples). Catalytic asymmetric syntheses of dexchlorpheniramine and dexbrompheniramine were realized by using the developed method.

      <title>Diastereodivergent Formal 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of 5&#8208;alkenyl thiazolones to Access Stereochemically Diverse Pyrrolidinyl Spirooxindoles</title>
      <dc:description>









Abstract
We report here a stereoselective [3+2] cyclization of 5&#8208;alkenyl thiazolones and ketimines that allows the assembly of three diastereoisomers through the combination of stereodivergent organocatalysis and the following diastereoselective transformation of products. A broad spectrum of pyrrolidinyl spirooxindoles featuring stereochemical diversity has been synthesized through organocatalytic formal 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions with up to 98% yield, &gt;20:1&#8197;dr and 99:1&#8197;er.

      <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Carbonyl Acridanes as Highly Potent Inhibitors of Tubulin Polymerization via One&#8208;Pot Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dual Arylation of Nitriles with Cyclic Diphenyl Iodoniums</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
A novel Copper&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction between six&#8208;membered cyclic diaryliodonium salts and nitriles is reported for the facile access to a variety of N&#8208;carbonyl acridanes in good to excellent yields (up to 82%). The reaction is efficient and atom&#8208;economical with a broad substrate scope (e.&#8201;g. both aryl / alkyl nitriles and substituted / unsubstituted cyclic diaryliodonium salts compatible in the system). This method is particularly useful for the synthesis of substituted N&#8208;carbonyl acridanes which are present in many pharmaceutically important compounds, but are not easy to obtain in conventional approaches. Furthermore, one of the newly synthesized acridanes displayed high antiproliferative activity against MB&#8208;468 cancer cells (IC50=26&#8197;nM, comparable to paclitaxel and colchicine) by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Together, these findings might grant a rapid access to a novel molecular scaffold with potential anticancer utilities.

      <title>Intermolecular Electrophilic Bromoesterification and Bromoetherification of Unactivated Cyclopropanes</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
1,3&#8208;difunctionalization of cyclopropane is an useful organic transformation. The corresponding 1,3&#8208;difunctionalized products are synthetic synthons and building blocks in many organic syntheses. Many existing ring&#8208;opening difunctionalization methodologies rely primarily on the use of donor&#8722;acceptor cyclopropanes, while the difunctionalization of unactivated cyclopropanes is less exploited. In this research, 1,3&#8208;bromoesterification and 1,3&#8208;bromoetherification of unactivated cyclopropanes were successfully achieved using N&#8208;bromosuccinimide as the brominating agent with high yields and regioselectivity.

      <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Cyanoalkylative Aziridination of N&#8208;Sulfonyl Allylamines</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Reaction of N&#8208;arylsulfonyl allylamines with alkyl nitriles in the presence of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide (DTBP) and a catalytic amount of copper salt afforded homologated aziridines in 43&#8211;86% yield. A sequence involving addition of the in&#8197;situ generated cyanomethyl radical to the double bond followed by a copper&#8208;mediated intramolecular C&#8722;N bond formation accounted for the reaction outcome. 2,3&#8208;Disubstituted allylamines were converted to trisubstituted aziridines in a stereoselective manner. Starting from enantioenriched allylamines, chiral aziridines were obtained diastereoselectively.

      <title>1,2&#8208;Diamine&#8208;derived (thio)phosphoramide organocatalysts in asymmetric Michael additions</title>
      <dc:description>Phosphoramides and thiophosphoramides were prepared from optically pure C2&#8208;symmetric 1,2&#8208;diamines and were used as chiral organocatalysts in the asymmetric Michael additions of aldehydes and ketones to N&#8208;substituted maleimides. The 1,2&#8208;diphenylethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine derived thiophosphoramide, which could be prepared in good yield in a one&#8208;step procedure, was found to be more active and selective catalyst in the addition of aldehydes to various maleimide derivatives, when compared to sulfonamides having the same backbone. Products resulted in reactions of ketones with maleimides were also obtained in high yields and enantioselectivities.
The thiophosphoramide derivative was also efficient in the asymmetric conjugate addition of carbonyl compounds to &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene and in the reaction of nitromethane with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones.
Based on results obtained with (thio)phosphoramides in asymmetric additions to maleimides it was suggested that a weaker, more flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonding of the rigid electrophile to the catalyst is responsible for the improved performance of these bifunctional organocatalysts, as compared with sulfonamides.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>








Abstract
We reported herein an efficient alternative for asymmetric synthesis of structurally complicated chiral bispiro&#8208;cyclopropane&#8208;pyrazolones via dipeptide&#8208;based phosphonium salt catalyzed [2+1] cyclization of 2,3&#8208;dioxopyrrolidines and halogenated pyrazolones. With this catalytic asymmetric protocol, a broad range of bispiro heterocyclic compounds bearing a pyrazolone unit were prepared in high yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enatioselectivities. Of note, this transformation proceeds in a really short time under mild reaction conditions.

Abstract
An efficient stereoselective syntheses of a series of functionalized optically active &#947;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones is achieved by enzymatic asymmetric reduction of the corresponding sterically demanding &#947;&#8208;keto esters employing wild&#8208;type and recombinant alcohol dehydrogenases. The best stereoselectivities for the reduction via hydrogen transfer was obtained with two short chain dehydrogenases (SDRs) of complementary stereospecificity from Aromatoleum aromaticum, namely the Prelog&#8208;specific NADH&#8208;dependent (S)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol dehydrogenase [(S)&#8208;PED] and the anti&#8208;Prelog&#8208;specific (R)&#8208;1&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;ethanol dehydrogenase [(R)&#8208;HPED], respectively.	Biotransformations catalyzed by both enzymes, followed by TFA&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of the resulting &#947;&#8208;hydroxy esters, furnished the respective (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;configured products with exquisite optical purity (up to &gt;99% ee). The synthetic value was demonstrated on preparative scale for the asymmetric bioreduction of the model compound, methyl 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutanoate, affording optically pure (S)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;phenyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (&gt;99%&#8197;ee) in 67&#8211;74% isolated yield at 89&#8211;95% conversion depending on the applied scale.

      <title>Hydrosilylation of Aldehydes and Ketones Catalyzed by Bis(phosphinite) Pincer Platinum Hydride Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Bis(phosphinite) pincer platinum hydride complexes, [2,6&#8208;(R2PO)2C6H3]PtH (R = tBu, 1; iPr, 2), were synthesized, characterized and applied to the hydrosilylation of aldehydes and ketones. NMR study and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicated that the hydrides in these two platinum complexes are comparatively less hydridic: down&#8208;field 1H NMR resonances (0.71 and 0.98 ppm) and weak Pt&#8208;H interactions were observed. Both the platinum complexes were found to be good catalysts for the hydrosilylation of aldehydes and ketones with phenylsilane. The corresponding alcohols were isolated in good to excellent yields following basic hydrolysis of the resultant hydrosilylation products and turnover frequencies (TOFs) up to 3200 h&#8208;1 were achieved at 60&#730;C in toluene, which are much higher than those of the hydrosilylation catalysed by the corresponding nickel pincer hydride complexes.

      <title>Radical C&#8722;C Bond Formation using Sulfonium Salts and Light</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Sulfonium salts are playing an increasingly significant role in contemporary organic synthesis. In particular, the generation of radicals from sulfonium salts is a fundamental process in Nature and has been the subject of investigation for over 50&#8197;years. However, general synthetic methods that use sulfonium salts as radical precursors are rare. The advent of photoredox catalysis has triggered an upsurge of interest in the radical chemistry of sulfonium salts and this review surveys recent applications of aryl&#8208; and alkylsulfonium salts in light&#8208;mediated, radical C&#8722;C bond formation.

      <title>Synthesis of [3.4]&#8208;Spirooxindoles through Cascade Carbopalladation of Skipped Dienes</title>
      <dc:description>









Abstract
A synthetic route to [3.4]&#8208;spirooxindoles based on cascade carbopalladation reactions of 1,4&#8208;dienes is described. While carbopalladation of alkenes have been used to access mainly [4.4]&#8208; or [4.5]&#8208;spirocycles, 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbopalladation has not been yet applied to the synthesis of relevant [3.4]&#8208;spirooxindole scaffolds bearing a cyclobutyl ring. In addition, the cascade reaction generates an exocyclic double bond that can serve as a platform to further diversify the substitution pattern of the spirooxindole nuclei.

      <title>Diastereodivergent Synthesis of Bridged Tetrahydroisoquinoline Derivatives Catalyzed by Modularly Designed Organocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>The diastereodivergent synthesis of bridged 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives has been achieved by using appropriate modularly designed organocatalysts (MDOs) that are self&#8208;assembled in situ from amino acids and cinchona alkaloid derivatives. The domino Mannich/aza&#8208;Michael/aldol reaction between (E)&#8208;2&#8208;[2&#8208;(3&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;oxoprop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl]acetaldehydes and ethyl or benzyl (E)&#8208;2&#8208;[(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)imino]acetates catalyzed by MDOs gives two different diastereomers of the desired bridged tetrahydroisoquinolines in good yields and excellent diastereoselectivities (up to 99:1 dr) and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99% ee). The diastereodivergence was achieved in the aldol reaction step.</dc:description>

Abstract
A synergistic rhodium&#8208; and Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208; catalyzed reaction of quinone imine ketals with diazo compounds to access multi&#8208;substituted anilines is presented here. This reaction takes place through a process involving C&#8722;O bond cleavage, modification of the leaving alcoholic fragment, and selective reassembly of the reactive fragments. Moderate enantioselectivities are achieved when a chiral 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi(2&#8208;naphthol)&#8208;based phosphoric acid is used.

      <title>The Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Carbocyclic Nucleosides via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Amination of Alicyclic MBH Adducts with Purines</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
The enantioselective synthesis of carbocyclic nucleosides through the palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic amination of alicyclic Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) adducts with purines was successfully developed. With a combination of Pd2(dba)3/L7 as catalyst, various optically active carbocyclic nucleosides featuring a C=C double bond in the carbocycle moiety were obtained in high yields (up to 97%) with excellent N9/N7&#8208;selectivities (&gt;95/5) and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99.6%). In addition, these nucleoside analogs allowed for rapid transformation to a variety of other interesting structurally diverse chiral carbocyclic nucleosides.

      <title>Divergent Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Reaction of Cyanomethyl Benzoates with Arylboronic Acids: Synthesis of Oxazoles and Isocoumarins</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed tandem reaction of cyanomethyl benzoates with arylboronic acids has been achieved. Substitution at the 2&#8208;position of cyanomethyl benzoates was found to be crucial for the selective synthesis of oxazoles and isocoumarins. Cyanomethyl benzoates afforded 2,4&#8208;diaryloxazoles as products, while 2&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;substituted cyanomethyl benzoates delivered 3&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;4&#8208;aryl&#8208;isocoumarins selectively. Furthermore, a possible mechanism for the selective reaction of cyanomethyl benzoates with arylboronic acids was discussed.

      <dc:description>








Abstract
A dealkylative intercepted [2, 3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement reaction of allylic sulfides with 2, 2, 2&#8208;trifluorodiazoethane (CF3CHN2) is reported, the commercially available and biocompatible catalyst hemin was found to efficiently catalyze this transformation across a diverse set of allylic sulfides with in&#8197;situ generated CF3CHN2, providing excellent yields (up to 99%) under mild condition without inert gas protection. In addition, CF3CHN2 exhibited unique reactivity toward this process compared with other frequently used diazo reagents. This work expands the range of carbene&#8208;mediated transformations catalyzed by hemin and introduces a concise and general strategy for exploiting new possibility of reactions concerning organosulfides.

Most notably, the method represents the first example of using practical and operationally&#8208;simple Pd(II)&#8722;phosphine precatalysts in the emerging amide bond cross&#8208;coupling manifold. The reactions are efficient at 0.10&#8197;mol% loading, furnishing biaryl ketones with high chemoselectivity for N&#8722;C(O) bond cleavage. This versatile method enables for the first time to achieve Pd&#8722;phosphine&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of amides at ppm loading. This C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling can be used to efficiently furnish pharmaceutical intermediates by orthogonal Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings. We fully expect that operationally&#8208;simple [(PR3)2Pd(II)X2] precatalysts as effective triggers for N&#8722;C(O) cross&#8208;coupling will be of broad synthetic and catalytic interest.

      <title>Cycloaddition Reactions of Azides and Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes in Deep Eutectic Solvents: Pyrazolines, Aziridines and Other Surprises</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
The reaction of organic azides and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes was investigated in a deep eutectic solvents. A series of highly substituted 2&#8208;pyrazolines was successfully isolated and their formation rationalised by DFT calculations. The critical effect of substitution was also explored; even relatively small changes in the cycloaddition partners led to completely different reaction outcomes and triazolines, triazoles or enaminones can be formed as major products depending on the alkene employed.

      <title>Recent Advances in the Construction of Phosphorus&#8208;Substituted Heterocycles, 2009&#8211;2019</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;substituted heterocycles represent an important class of organophosphorus compounds, which not only widely exist in biologically active pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, but also have widespread applications in material science and organic synthesis as ligands for transition metal complexes. The synthesis of such compounds integrates the development of new synthetic methods and exploration of efficient catalytic systems, reflects the latest achievements in organic, transition metal, photo and even electrochemical catalysis, and facilitates the synthesis of sufficient quantities of related compounds as potential medicinal agents and biological probes in this area. Over the past few decades, two major synthetic strategies have been established toward phosphorus&#8208;substituted heterocycles. This review summarizes the recent progress in this field and discusses the reaction mechanisms in detail. The advantages and limitations of each subdivisional tactic are presented, and the synthetic opportunities still open are outlined.

      <title>Enantioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Cyanation of Cyclopropanols and Cyclopropanone Acetals</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
A novel approach for enantioselective cyanation of cyclopropanols and their derivatives through copper&#8208;catalyzed radical relay processes has been developed. Various cyclopropanols and cyclopropanone acetals are compatible to the catalytic conditions, providing &#946;&#8208;carbonyl nitriles with excellent enantioselectivity. These products can be readily converted to chiral &#947;&#8208;amino acids derivatives and drugs such as (R)&#8208;baclofen. Preliminary mechanistic studies have supported a ring&#8208;opening process for cyclopropanoxy radicals followed by copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cyanation of benzylic radicals to form the C&#8722;CN bonds in an enantioselective manner.

Abstract
An efficient and regioselective three&#8208;component heteroarylation&#8208;nitration of alkenes with imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines and tert&#8208;butyl nitrite has been developed.

The reaction is also applicable for some other aza&#8208;heterocycles.

      <title>Enantioselective Vinylogous Mannich&#8208;Type Reactions to Construct CF3S&#8208;Containing Stereocenters Catalysed by Chiral Quaternary Phosphonium Salts</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
A series of benzyl trifluoromethyl sulphides bearing a nitro group were utilized as CF3S&#8208;containing building blocks to construct chiral CF3S&#8208;containing molecules via enantioselective vinylogous Mannich&#8208;type reactions. In such reactions, high yields and enantioselectivities were obtained using chiral quaternary phosphonium salts derived from amino acids. Moreover, a chiral cyclic urea bearing the CF3S moiety was obtained from further transformation of the product.

      <title>Enantioselective Dearomative Cyclization of Homotryptamines with Allenamides into Indolo[2,3&#8208;b]quinolines</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
We have developed a catalytic asymmetric dearomative cyclization of homotryptamine derivatives, furnishing enantioenriched indolo[2,3&#8208;b]quinoline scaffolds. The activation of allenamides in the presence of chiral phosphoric acids triggered the dearomative cyclization in up to 99% ee.

      <title>Iron&#8208;Mediated Ring&#8208;Opening and Rearrangement Cascade Synthesis of Polysubstituted Pyrroles from 4&#8208;Alkenylisoxazoles</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
An iron&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening and rearrangement cascade from 4&#8208;alkenylisoxazoles to polysubstituted pyrroles is described. The cascade reaction conditions are compatible with a variety of functional groups, including ketones, esters, amides, and aryl halides. High reactivity is maintained even if the reaction scale is expanded to 0.5&#8197;grams. It is the first iron&#8208;catalyzed rearrangement of 4&#8208;alkenylisoxazoles to pyrroles that is independent of the presence of the alkoxy or amino group at position 5 of the isoxazole substrates. A plausible mechanism of the iron&#8208;mediated cascade reaction is proposed.

      <title>Free&#8208;Radical&#8208;Promoted Alkenylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond in Chloroalkane with Cinnamic Acid and &#946;&#8208;Nitrostyrene</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
We demonstrated herein a free&#8208;radical alkenylation of the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane with cinnamic acid and &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene. This method not only provides a facile approach to chloroalkylated styrenes, but also would be instructive for halogen&#8208;atom directing selective functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bond.

      <title>Still&#8208;Gennari olefination and its applications in organic synthesis</title>

Its synthetic utility is undoubtedly of great significance for organic chemistry, as can be illustrated by the number of citations of the original report by W. C. Still and C.

In 2008 Nobel prize winner Ei&#8208;ichi Negishi indicated the Still&#8208;Gennari olefination as one of the crucial methods for the olefin synthesis, complementary to palladium catalyzed alkenylations. Surprisingly, so far there is no review concerning this popular and valuable transformation. Therefore, we aim to comprehensively systematize achievements in this field and to present the scope of applications of the Still&#8208;Gennari olefination along with recent examples in total synthesis of biologically active compounds. Our review intends to be of interest for general chemical community as well as to be a helpful source of information for synthetic organic chemists.</dc:description>
