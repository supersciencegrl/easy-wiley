         <title>Visible Light Induced EDA&#8208;mediated Deaminative C&#8208;2 Alkylation of Heterocyclic&#8208;N&#8208;Oxides using Katritzky salts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a direct C&#8208;2 alkylation of Heterocyclic&#8208;N&#8208;oxides with alkyl amines as Katritzky salts via visible&#8208;light induced deaminative approach was developed. Mechanistic studies revealed that Katritzky salts and base were involved to generate an EDA complex, which underwent intermolecular single electron transfer (SET) to give an alkyl radical intermediate. Finally, the alkyl radical intermediate further underwent&#8208;addition with heterocyclic&#8208;N&#8208;oxide substrates to access the desired products with 63&#8208;94% yield. The method worked well with quinoline&#8208;N&#8208;oxides, pyridine&#8208;N&#8208;oxides, and benzopyrazine&#8208;N&#8208;oxides.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Induced Difunctional Hetero&#8208;Annulation of Unsaturated C&#8722;C Bonds</title>

Abstract
Heterocyclic scaffolds are beneficial structural architects in a wide range of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, biological and also functional materials. In this regard, several investigations have been performed to synthesize them. Among these, visible light&#8208;induced difunctionalization cyclization strategy provides attractive solutions by adopting greener routes, breaking the monopoly of conventional thermal processes. A review on these methodologies is also desirable as unsaturated aliphatics, especially alkenes are one of the cheapest feedstocks available. They offer diverse options and modifications to generate different products, including heterocycles, which are highly sought after due to their applications in various sectors. To account for the advancements in this strategy, we summarized the visible light induced difunctionalization strategies that directly lead to the synthesis of heterocyclic scaffolds from unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds. We have categorized the relevant reaction schemes into four mechanistically distinct sections namely (i) Two component oxidative annulations (ii) Radical mediated annulations (iii) Polar radical crossover annulations and (iv) Three component oxidative annulations.

         <dc:description>A substrate&#8208;dependent, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;controlled diversity&#8208;oriented organocatalytic vinylogous Michael addition/cyclization cascade of 2&#8208;alkylidene indane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones with enals, using secondary amines as the catalyst have been developed. These present methodologies allow the synthesis of spiroindane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones, tetrahydrofluoren&#8208;9&#8208;one derivatives, and benzofused oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes in a highly selective manner. Plausible catalytic pathways for the formation of these biologically interesting compounds were proposed. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have clarified and supported the mechanisms how the organocatalyst is able to activate the enals and 2&#8208;hydroxycinnamaldehydes, directing the C&#8208;C bond forming with the vinylogous dienolates and enabling the synthesis of these interesting indane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones derivatives.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Functionalization of Remote C&#8211;H Bonds by Hofmann&#8722;L&#246;ffler&#8722;Freytag&#8208;type Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen radicals are one of the most useful reactive intermediates for selective transposition via intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). The Hofmann&#8722;L&#246;ffler&#8722;Freytag (HLF) reaction is a distinctive radical&#8208;based approach in which nitrogen radicals are used for remote C&#8722;H bond functionalization via intramolecular HAT. Due to its excellent regioselectivity and atomic economy, the HLF reaction represents a new approach for the preparation of valuable functional molecules. In this review, we provide a brief overview of recent research advances in remote C&#8722;H bond functionalization via nitrogen radicals mediated HLF&#8208;type reactions involving intermolecular cyclization, intramolecular cyclization, and remote &#948;&#8208;site functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroaminoalkyl Functionalization of Pyrimidin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones by Visible Light Organophotocatalysis: A Radical Approach to Biginelli&#8208;Type Dihydropyrimidines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated hydroaminoalkylation of pyrimidin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones via the aza&#8208;Giese&#8208;type reaction in presence of acridinium dye as photocatalyst under mild aerobic conditions. Using N&#8208;Boc protected aminoalkyl trifluoroborates as radical precursors and various pyrimidine&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one substrates, a diverse set of Biginelli&#8208;type 3,4&#8208;dihydropyrimidin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones was prepared in 31&#8211;73% yields.

Abstract
Herein, we report peroxidative dearomatization of 2&#8208;naphthol and C&#8722;H peroxidation of 3&#8208;arylbenzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;ones with 66&#8211;94% yield under catalyst&#8208;free conditions using continuous flow module. Besides, an approach for the synthesis of N&#8208;substituted&#8208;2&#8208;phenylbenzo[d][1,3]dioxole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxamide has been achieved via the skeletal rearrangement of peroxybenzofuranone using amines in the absence of catalyst under continuous flow. The mechanistic study suggests that this peroxidation reaction proceeds via free radical formation under thermolytic conditions.

Abstract
Described herein is the development of an organoaluminium&#8208;mediated tandem conjugate addition&#8208;cyclization sequence of p&#8208;quinone monoacetals with 2&#8208;siloxyphenyl Grignard reagents to afford a collection of phenol&#8208;bridged cyclohexanone derivatives. Furthermore, a tandem conjugate&#8208;addition and dimerization reaction of p&#8208;quinone monoacetals with Grignard reagents is also reported to offer a straightforward and diastereoselective synthesis of complex bridged&#8208;ring compounds bearing tricyclo[6.2.2.02,7]dodecene skeletons.

         <title>Synthesis of 5&#8208;Trifluoromethylpyrroles from Heating&#8208;Induced Annulation of Pyridinium 1,4&#8208;Zwitterionic Thiolates with CF3&#8208;Imidoyl Sulfoxonium Ylides</title>

Abstract
A heating&#8208;induced desulfuration annulation of pyridinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates and CF3&#8208;substituted imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides has been achieved, allowing a route to biologically important 5&#8208;trifluoromethylpyrroles. The transformation proceeds through an unusual ((3+3)&#8208;1) pathway under metal&#8208;free conditions with the extrusion of 4&#8208;methoxypyridine, sulfur and DMSO. The scale&#8208;up reaction and further transformation of the obtained pyrrole products have been performed to demonstrate the synthetic utility of the developed method.

Abstract
A new N&#8722;F reagent, N,N&#8242;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium bis(tetrafluoroborate), for iodoarene&#8208;catalyzed fluorination reactions as a terminal oxidant is reported. This reaction is effective for the fluorination of simple alkenes, aromatic alkenes and 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds, giving 1,2&#8208;difluorinated alkanes, geminal difluorinated compounds, 2&#8208;fluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds in good to high yields, respectively. This is a useful fluorination reaction that not only improves the issues of the fluorination reaction using conventional mCPBA as a terminal oxidant but also constructs a simpler catalytic cycle. The present N&#8722;F reagent can be recovered as 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine.

Abstract
Treating 2&#8208;acetyl&#8208;1&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;1&#955;3&#8208;benzo[d][1,2]iodazol&#8208;3&#8208;one 1&#8201;f with sliver cyanate in dried chloroform was found to give hypervalent isocyanato&#8208;iodine(III) reagent 5 in excellent yield, while the oxo&#8208;bridged 1,1&#8242;&#8208;oxybis(2&#8208;acetyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;1&#955;3&#8208;benzo[d][1,2]iodaz&#8208;ol&#8208;3&#8208;one) 6 was obtained when a mixture of chloroform and water was used as solvent. Structure of these two hypervalent iodine reagents were established by X&#8208;ray crystallography and their reaction with base, aniline, methanol and cyclic ether were investigated. A previously reported 1&#8208;cyanato benziodoxole compound was revisited and its structure was revised.

Abstract
Our group has reported several one&#8208;pot protocols for the synthesis of diaryliodonium salts, which have been recognized as attractive multi&#8208;purpose reagents in areas ranging from organic synthesis to materials chemistry. Over the years, we have identified limitations in the published protocols concerning synthesis of mixed electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor, as well as highly electron&#8208;poor diaryliodonium salts, as the corresponding starting materials are either too reactive or too unreactive. In this update, we discuss the underlying limitations concerning the stability and reactivity of the involved reagents and provide strategies to overcome these challenges through updated synthetic protocols.

         <title>Computational Insights into the Reactivity Difference between Hypervalent Bromine(III) and Hypervalent Iodine(III) Reagent in the C&#8722;H Amination and Alkene Aziridination</title>

Abstract
We present herein a computational exploration into the mechanism and origin of the reactivity difference between N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodane and N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;bromane in the C&#8722;H amination and alkene aziridination. Our calculations revealed that the preferred mechanism for C&#8722;H amination involves the generation of free nitrene intermediate, while the alkene aziridination proceeds via a concerted reaction mechanism. The superior reactivity of N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;bromane over N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodane could be mainly ascribed to better nucleofugality of the bromanyl moiety, which can be characterized by the strength of I&#8722;N and Br&#8722;N bond. The effect of solvent polarity on the reactivity of N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;bromane as a nitrene precursor will be discussed.

Abstract
Dibenzoylperoxide emerged as a versatile oxidant for quaternary ammonium iodide or bromide&#8208;catalyzed reactions of phenol derivatives with NaN3. While the use of iodides allowed for efficient benzylic azidations under these oxidative conditions, the use of bromides allowed for dearomative azidations instead. Both approaches have been successfully applied to different phenol derivatives and a first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for an enantioselective variant using chiral quat. ammonium bromides has been obtained as well.

         <title>Front Cover Picture: Recent Progress in Synthetic Applications of Cyclic Hypervalent Iodine(III) Reagents (Adv. Synth. Catal. 16/2023)</title>

The front cover picture, designed by Yoshimura, illustrates applications of benziodoxoles as group transfer reagents. Cyclic hypervalent iodine compounds based on the benziodoxole system have higher stability compared to their acyclic analogues, which makes possible the preparation and safe handling of the reagents with special ligands such as azido, cyano, and trifluoromethyl groups. Substituted benziodoxoles have been widely utilized as reagents for transfer of the substituent on hypervalent iodine to organic substrates. Details can be found in the Review Article by Akira Yoshimura, Akio Saito, and Viktor Zhdankin (A. Yoshimura, A. Saito, V.&#8197;V. Zhdankin, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2023, 365, 2653&#8211;2675; DOl: 10.1002/adsc.202300275).

Abstract
Hypervalent iodine compounds have found broad application in modern organic chemistry as reagents and catalysts. Cyclic hypervalent iodine reagents based on the benziodoxole heterocyclic system have higher stability compared to their acyclic analogues, which makes possible the preparation and safe handling of the reagents with special ligands such as azido, cyano, and trifluoromethyl groups. Numerous iodine&#8208;substituted benziodoxole derivatives have been prepared and utilized as reagents for transfer of the substituent on hypervalent iodine to organic substrate. Reactions of these reagents with organic substrates can be performed under metal&#8208;free conditions, in the presence of transition metal catalysts, or using photocatalysts under photoirradiation conditions. In this review, we focus on the most recent synthetic applications of cyclic hypervalent iodine(III) reagents with the following ligands: N3, NHR, CN, CF3, SCF3, OR, OAc, ONO2, and C(=N2)CO2R. The review covers literature published mainly in the last 5&#8197;years.

Abstract
The clean and facile electrochemical synthesis of hypervalent iodine reagents is a fast growing field. In the past 5&#8197;years, a diverse number of reaction types have been established, from fluorinations, oxidative cyclizations, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;H couplings and oxidations. Electrochemistry is beneficial in terms of sustainability as the requirement for chemical oxidants is eliminated. This contributes to cleaner processes with limited by&#8208;product waste. Often, the purification of iodine(III) compounds is simple, since electrolysis is performed in the absence stoichiometric oxidants. Significant breakthroughs have been made recently, including the first asymmetric application, electrocatalytic applications, and even the synthesis of bromine(III) reagents using similar methodologies.

Abstract
Herein, we report the &#945;&#8722;C&#8722;H acyloxylation of sulfides and disulfides enabled by hypervalent iodine(III) reagents via photoredox catalysis. The methoxylbenziodoxole derivatives serve as the hydrogen atom transfer agent, the mild oxidant, and the acyloxylation source in the reaction. External nucleophiles can also be introduced to the &#945;&#8722;C&#8722;H of sulfides. The reaction applies to various aryl and alkyl sulfides including methionine peptide derivatives. Disulfides are applicable for the first time with excellent chemoselectivity and functional group compatibility.

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Aminopiperidines via I(III)&#8208;Mediated Olefin Diamination with (Hetero)aryl Nucleophiles</title>

Abstract
3&#8208;Aminopiperidines are a valuable motif present in small molecule pharmaceuticals and bioactive natural products. Synthesis of these moieties via olefin diamination would be an attractive approach, however significant challenges remain with regards to both regioselectivity and exogenous nucleophile scope. Herein, we report a metal&#8208;free olefin diamination via a &#8220;heterocyclic group transfer&#8220; (HGT) reaction of I(III) N&#8208;HVI reagents, giving rise to 3&#8208;aminopiperidines with high selectivity. The HGT strategy leverages heteroarenes as oxidatively masked amine nucleophiles, giving rise to (hetero)arylonium salt products which are isolated via simple trituration and provide a versatile handle for downstream diversification. This represents only the second 6&#8208;endo selective I(III)&#8208;mediated diamination reaction and mechanistic studies indicate ring opening of an intermediate aziridinium ion is responsible for the 6&#8208;endo selectivity.

Abstract
Herein, we develop a metal catalyst&#8208;free protocol for O&#8208;arylation of benzamide hydroxamate esters. The chemoselective O&#8208; versus N&#8208;arylation of the amides was tuned by varying the electronic and/or steric properties of the diaryliodonium salt and/or the substrate. The O&#8208;arylation reaction would preferentially occur for sterically and electronically diverse substrates. This study, which reveals the possibility of substituent&#8208; and reagent&#8208;controlled chemoselectivity, with diaryliodonium salts might attract interest in the area of hypervalent iodine chemistry.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Aliphatic C&#8722;H Chlorination and Bromination Using Haloform as the Halogen Donor and Azidobenziodoxole as the Mediator</title>

Abstract
An azidobenziodoxole (BIN3)&#8208;mediated tunable radical reaction system for selective chlorination and bromination of tertiary and secondary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of alkyl substrates using haloform as the halogen donor was developed. Reactions of various substrates with BIN3 under visible light irradiation without any photo or metal catalysts gave C&#8722;H chlorinated or brominated products. These reactions are selective, and compatible with many functional groups. Mechanistic studies suggest that haloform serves as the halogen atom donor and HN3 generated in&#8197;situ from the reaction of BIN3 and water relays the radical chain reaction as the hydrogen atom donor. HN3 reacts with CHX2&#8901; to form CH2X2 and N3&#8901;, which propagates a radical chain by abstracting a hydrogen atom of the alkane substrate.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An azidobenziodoxole (BIN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)-mediated tunable radical reaction system for selective chlorination and bromination of tertiary and secondary C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds of alkyl substrates using haloform as the halogen donor was developed. Reactions of various substrates with BIN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; under visible light irradiation without any photo or metal catalysts gave C&#8722;H chlorinated or brominated products. These reactions are selective, and compatible with many functional groups. Mechanistic studies suggest that haloform serves as the halogen atom donor and HN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; generated &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; from the reaction of BIN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and water relays the radical chain reaction as the hydrogen atom donor. HN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with CHX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901; to form CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;, which propagates a radical chain by abstracting a hydrogen atom of the alkane substrate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Applications of both halogen and chalcogen bonding in organocatalysis are by now well established with various examples. However, the combination of both interactions within one catalyst is currently unknown. Herein, we describe the synthesis of such a mixed chalcogen&#8208; and halogen&#8208;bond donor and present a first indication of its catalytic activity in a benchmark reaction.

Abstract
Herein, we report a direct method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;imidoketones and &#945;&#8208;azolylketones via hypoiodite&#8208;catalyzed oxidative &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;N coupling of ketones with the corresponding imides and azoles, respectively. The use of inorganic base additives such as cesium carbonate in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 as a phase transfer catalyst was crucial to induce high reactivity. Control experiments revealed that the basic additives might not only facilitate high&#8208;turnover hypoiodite catalysis, but also be involved in the activation of coupling partners.

         <title>N&#8208;Heteroarylation of Sulfonamides: An Overview</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
N&#8208;Heteroaryl sulfonamides are an extremely significant variety of organosulfur compounds that are present in many significant FDA&#8208;approved drugs and therapeutic agents. Therefore, synthesis of these N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfonamides is one of the most interesting topics among the synthetic organic chemists. Among the various synthetic methodologies, direct C&#8722;N bond formation through N&#8208;heteroarylation of sulfonamides has emerged as a procedure continued of choice as it bypasses the genotoxicity common in the traditional methods. This review encompasses and summarizes the progress and development in this subject with literature coverage up to June 2023.

         <title>Remote Selective C&#8722;H Halogenation of Arylphosphine Oxides with Ferric Halides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
We developed the remote selective C&#8722;H bromination for the synthesis of C4&#8242;&#8208;brominated biarylphosphine oxides using FeBr3 as a brominating reagent. C3&#8242;&#8208;Brominated products were obtained in reactions with substrates bearing a 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropyl substituent on the bottom ring. Moreover, direct access to C5&#8208;chlorinated peri&#8208;substituted(1&#8208;naphthalenyl)phosphines is developed using FeCl3 as a chlorinating reagent. These halogenated compounds can be utilized for cross&#8208;coupling reactions to construct functionalized phosphine oxides.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Redox&#8208;Neutral Reaction of Nitriles with Quinoline N&#8208;Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A method for the redox&#8208;neutral reaction of nitriles with quinoline N&#8208;oxides via gold catalysis is described. This transformation features a broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance. A series of C2&#8208;amidated quinolines were synthesized in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies suggested that the oxidative gold catalysis of nitriles might be initiated by the &#963;&#8208;coordination of the gold catalyst with the N atom on nitrile, then the coordinated gold&#8208;nitrile intermediate is captured and oxidized by quinoline N&#8208;oxides.

Abstract
Herein, a visible light&#8208;mediated multicomponent radical cross&#8208;coupling reaction of [1.1.1]propellane with N&#8208;heterocycles and disulfides is described. The mild conditions enabled the installation of the BCP motif in a wide variety of compounds in the absence of photocatalyst, additive and metal catalyst, with excellent functional group tolerance, This methodology opens a approach for the synthesis of potentially bioactive 1&#8208;arylthiol&#8208;3&#8208;heteroaryl bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes in moderate to good yield.

Abstract
By employing the sterically highly demanding steering ligand IPr* at a gold(I) center, it is possible to induce a 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization pathway in 1,5&#8208;diynes bearing terminal alkyne moieties. The resulting aurated naphthyl cations are utilized for the intermolecular formation of C&#8722;C bonds via C&#8722;H insertion of aromatic and aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds. The mechanisms of these transformations were studied by quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Chalcogenation of Heterocycles: Application to the Synthesis of Chalcogenoxanthones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A copper&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8722;H chalcogenation of heterocycles with readily available dichalcogenide, benzeneselenol and thiol is described. This protocol demonstrates scalability, good chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectivity, as well as broad functional group tolerance, which overall provides an accessible method to valuable aryl chalcogenides. The chalcogenated picolinamide products could be further transformed into selenoxanthones and thioxanthone scaffolds through intramolecular cyclization via a semi&#8208;one pot process.

         <title>Traceless Directing Group Enabled One&#8208;Pot Regiospecific Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;4&#8208;Fluoropyrroles</title>

Abstract
We describe a traceless group directed one&#8208;pot regiospecific cycloaddition strategy to construct 4&#8208;fluorinated pyrroles, which showcased promising anti&#8208;inflammatory activity previously. By taking advantage of this protocol, a range of 4&#8208;fluoropyrroles which are inaccessible via previous methods can be obtained, and a tentative reaction mechanism was proposed based on observed intermediates.

Abstract
Harnessing visible light to trigger (aza and thia) Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction injects new vitality into [2+2] photocyclization reaction and enable impressive reactivity modes. The popular (aza and thia) Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction is one of the most efficient ways to synthesize strained four&#8208;membered heterocycles. Recently, visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered (aza and thia) Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reactions have received considerable attentions as this strategy has overcome some long&#8208;standing challenges, and remarkable achievements have been made within this field. Strained four&#8208;membered heterocyclics with favorable properties provide a perfect combination of stable skeletons for pharmaceutical chemistry and reaction intermediates for further transformation. In this review, we highlight the most recent advances in visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered (aza and thia) Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction with an emphasis on reaction mechanism and applications. Organization of the review follows a subdivision according to reaction type and substrate classes.

Abstract
A synthetic strategy involving a Simmons&#8208;Smith cyclopropanation, followed by an acid&#8208;catalyzed pinacol rearrangement, was developed to transform &#945;&#8208;hydroxy silyl enol ethers into 1&#8208;substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexan&#8208;5&#8208;ones. These bicyclic ketones underwent further synthetic manipulations to generate various 1,5&#8208;disubstituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes, which could serve as potential bioisosteres of ortho&#8208;substituted arenes.

         <title>Remote Asymmetric Bisvinylogous [4+2] Cycloaddition Reaction to Synthesize Spirocyclic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The highly enantioselective organocatalytic synthesis of spirocyclic compounds by Diels&#8208;Alder reactions via trienamine using cyclic 2,5&#8208;dienones as bisvinylogous precursors and different nitroalkenes as dienophiles is described. The use of cinchonidine&#8208;based primary amine as catalyst and benzoic acid as co&#8208;catalyst has allowed the construction of a wide variety of spiro compounds containing three stereogenic centres in good yields and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Additionally, other dienophiles have been evaluated exhibiting different behaviour depending on the electron withdrawing group nature. Subsequent transformations have yielded complex structures with up to five stereocentres. The plausible reaction mechanism has been investigated by computational methods.

         <dc:description>We report herein a synthesis of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;ones from 3&#8208;hydroxyindolin&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives, which can be synthesized from commercially available isatins in one or two steps. The reaction proceeded through a CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&#8208;mediated azidation via a carbocation, followed by acid&#8208;induced N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; extrusion and ring&#8208;expansion. Both CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H and the solvent 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol were found to be crucial for this rearrangement. The axial chirality in 3&#8208;hydroxyindolin&#8208;2&#8208;one skeleton was fully preserved in the products.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Radical Cascade Reaction of Quinoxalinones, Alkenes and AgSCF3</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A convenient and practical protocol for the preparation of SCF3&#8208;containing quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives via K2S2O8 mediated difunctionalization of alkenes with quinoxalinones and AgSCF3 was developed. The preliminary study showed that a SCF3 radical triggered cascade reaction process might be involved in the current transformation.

         <title>Selective Monoarylation of Ammonium Triflate with Aryl Chlorides Catalyzed by [Pd(&#946;&#8208;MeNAP)Br]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and AdBrettPhos</title>

         <dc:description>The selective introduction of a primary amino group into aromatic compounds is a desirable transformation, but is challenging due to competing double arylation. A catalyst generated from &#946;&#8208;methylnaphthyl (MeNAP) palladium bromide and the bulky ligand biphenyl&#8208;diadamantylphosphine (AdBrettPhos) has been found to promote the amination even of non&#8208;activated aryl chlorides with ammonium triflate within 30 min at 80 &#176;C to the primary anilines. The efficiency of the protocol was evaluated in comparative experiments, its versatility documented by the synthesis of various primary anilines including drug&#8208;like molecules.</dc:description>

Mechanistically, it was proposed that Lewis acids catalyze the generation of oxonium species, which accelerate subsequent annulation and aromatization. This protocol offers the benefit of an operationally simple, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, and air&#8208;tolerant reaction condition, enabling gram&#8208;scale syntheses of the desired products.

         <dc:description>The first iron&#8208;catalyzed oxophosphorylation of styrene derivatives with dialkyl H&#8208;phosphonates under open air conditions is developed, which generates a range of previously underexplored &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates in 55 ~ 70% yields. Furthermore, a convenient one&#8208;pot procedure by direct conversion of styrenes to &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones is also developed based on the new catalytic reactions, thus offering a protocol to access two classes of valuable products from simple starting materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract: Phenanthrenes are key components in the family of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which contribute a lot to the construction of &#960;&#8208;extending polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs). Herein, we report a cascade strategy towards 9&#8208;amino&#8208;10&#8208;alkynylphenanthrenes, which involves copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed reactions of 2&#8217;&#8208;cyano&#8208;biaryl&#8208;2&#8208;aldehyde N&#8208;tosylhydrazones and terminal alkynes in a one&#8208;pot manner. In addition, the obtained 9&#8208;amino&#8208;10&#8208;alkynylphenanthrenes could be engaged as &#960;&#8208;extending building blocks in the synthesis of 9H&#8208; dibenzo[3,4:5,6]borinino[1,2&#8208;b]phenanthro[9,10&#8208;e][1,2]azaborinine (BNTBA), a new&#8208;type BN&#8208;embedded PACs, which owns different properties compared with its all&#8208;carbon analogue tribenzo[f,k,m]tetraphene (TBA). The present synthetic method starts from easily available commercial materials and provides a practical way for the syntheses of highly functionalized phenanthrenes and &#960;&#8208;extension BN&#8208;embedded PACs.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydrogenation: Divergent Synthesis of Quinolines and Quinolones from ortho&#8208;Nitrobenzyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the divergent synthesis of quinolines and quinolones via a transfer hydrogenative condensation of ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl alcohols in one step. The reaction proceeded using the cyclopentadienone iron complex without any additional redox reagents. After transfer hydrogenation between ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl alcohols and secondary alcohols, the subsequent Friedl&#228;nder annulation affords polysubstituted quinoline products in 22&#8208;90% (39 examples). The developed method was also applied to synthesize quinolones by using primary alcohols instead of secondary alcohols (12 examples). The obtained quinoline products were converted into several drug candidates to demonstrate its synthetic potential.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed domino approach toward synthetically challenging phenanthrene derivatives has been developed. The procedure involves a sequence of oxidative homocoupling, cyclization, and oxidation starting from deoxybenzoin derivatives halogenated in the ortho position. Good assembly efficiency and good functional group tolerance have been observed with yields from moderate to excellent. A plausible reaction mechanism has been proposed based on experimental results and literature data.</dc:description>

Abstract
The potential of phosphites as nucleophiles for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral chromene derivatives has been overlooked in the literature. Herein, we report a promising approach via asymmetric organocatalyzed phospha&#8208;Michael addition to iminochromenes, using a bifunctional squaramide, which gives access to chromenylphosphonates, an interesting family of bioactive compounds. Our optimized protocol provides very good reactivity, affording yields of up to 95% and with chiral products exhibiting an enantiomeric excess of up to 98%.

         <title>[2 + 2 + 1 + 1] Cycloaddition Reaction of 1,3,5&#8208;Triazinanes with Methylene Compounds: Approach to Hexahydropyrimidines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An acetic acid&#8208;catalyzed [2 + 2 + 1 + 1] cycloaddition of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes with methylene compounds was developed. This protocol provides an access to hexahydropyrimidines (HHPs) (25 examples) in 35&#8208;99% yields under mild conditions in 2 hours. The potential application of this method was demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Preliminary mechanistic investigation was conducted to elucidate the possible mechanism. This work represents the yet unknown example of [2 + 2 + 1 + 1] cycloaddition reaction between 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes and active methylene compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Assisted Chemoselective and Stereoselective Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Catalyzed Addition of Dithiomalonates to Enones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Dithiomalonates proved to be active nucleophiles in the stereoselective additions to chalcones, dienones, and en&#8208;ynones affording the desired Michael adducts with good to high yields and enantioselectivities. In contrast, the analogous dibenzyl malonate remained inactive. Bifunctional Cinchona squaramides secured the effective chirality transfer and the selectivity towards Michael adducts of various bisthiomalonates following the soft enolization approach. The thioester&#8217;s nature impacted the reactivity and stability of the reactants or products. While the reactions performed in solution led to the products, the required time along with byproducts formation such as sulfa&#8208;Michael adducts, limiting the applicability of reactive dithioesters. On the contrary, reactions performed under solvent&#8208;free, ball milling conditions furnished adducts with essentially shorter time, with subtly or no byproduct generation. Therefore, the mechanochemical approach revealed to be an effective tool for supporting the hardly effective reactions under standard solution conditions.

         <title>Quaternary Ammonium Salts: Catalysts for Hydrosilylation of Alkynes with Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Mixing i&#8208;PrI and DABCO in solvent EtCN gave two quaternary ammonium salts (QASs) quantitatively, one of which is monocationic (QAS&#8208;1) and the other is dicationic (QAS&#8208;2). These QASs were found to catalyze hydrosilylation of alkynes with hydrosilanes (HAH) without the aid of metal and metalloid catalysts. This organocatalysis can be applied to a variety of alkynes: terminal/internal aryl and alkyl alkynes with/without a functional group. With dihydrosilanes (H2Si), the HAH occurred with high E&#8208;selectivity through syn addition, which was exclusively observed when using terminal alkyl alkynes, irrespective of a hydrosilane used. A scalable HAH is also feasible. The H&#8722;Si unit remaining in alkenylsilanes derived from H2Si is available for dehydrogenative alkynylation and N&#8208;heteroarylation under zinc&#8211;pyridine catalysis. This synthetic application delivers unique silicon compounds that have, for instance, alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, and alkynyl groups in a single molecule. Mechanistic studies suggested that alkynes activated by QASs irreversibly react with hydrosilanes that become more nucleophilic by the coordination of EtCN. A radical pathway is unlikely. The QAS catalysts can be recovered and reused at least 5&#8197;times.

Abstract
Direct enantioselective synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted chromen&#8208;4&#8208;ones, bearing the amino group at &#945;&#8208;stereogenic center with respect to the heterocycle is developed. It is based on Mannich&#8208;type asymmetric addition of 3&#8208;hydroxychromen&#8208;4&#8208;one and its analogues to N&#8208;protected imines in the presence of available alkaloid dihydrocuprein. &#945;&#8208;Stereogenic chromenone amino derivatives were formed in this reactions in 81&#8211;95% yield with up to 98% ee. The chiral adducts were transformed to diverse enantiomerically enriched chromen&#8208;4&#8208;one functional derivatives.

         <title>Electrophilic C3&#8722;H Alkenylation of 2,6&#8208;Dialkoxypyridine Derivatives via Pd(II)/Tl(III) Reaction System</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we report the reaction system based on Pd(II) catalyst and Tl(OCOCF3)3 for the electrophilic C3&#8722;H alkenylation of 2,6&#8208;dialkokypyridines with alkenes. Synergistic action of the Pd/thioether ligand catalytic system and Tl(III) results in efficient C&#8722;H alkenylation of various nitrogen heteroaromatics with complete regioselectivity. Remarkably, the use of a sterically hindered thioether ligand and the Pd(II)/Tl(III) system enables mono&#8208;selective C3(5)&#8722;H alkenylation of 2,6&#8208;dialkoxypyridines, and subsequent introduction of a second, different alkene affords unsymmetrical, multi&#8208;substituted pyridine derivatives. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds via electrophilic thallation of heteroarenes followed by Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck&#8208;type reaction. The utility of this method is showcased by its application to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of structurally complex bioactive molecules having 2,6&#8208;dialkoxypyridine as a core structure.

         <title>Synthesis of 1,4&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds via Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Decarboxylative Radical Cascade Reactions</title>

Abstract
We herein report a method for the synthesis of 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds using light&#8208;activated electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes. This multi&#8208;component reaction involves the photoactivation of EDA complexes formed by carboxylic acid derivatives, triphenylphosphine, and sodium iodide, resulting in single&#8208;electron reduction. The subsequent decarboxylation fragmentation leads to the formation of nucleophilic alkyl free radicals, which can undergo sequential radical coupling reactions with electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208;rich olefins. This method has been successfully applied to various aliphatic carboxylic acid derivatives, including tertiary, secondary, and primary ones, as well as multiple types of electron&#8208;deficient olefins and enol silyl ethers. The entire process is conducted under mild conditions, indicating its potential for the synthesis of valuable synthetic compounds.

         <dc:description>








Abstract
Propargylic alcohols are readily available bifunctional (alkyne and hydroxyl groups) synthons, which recognize as one of the attractive synthetic feedstock in organic transformations. Especially, in recent years the employment of these valuable molecules has frequently been observed in the literature. Hence, the present review highlights recent advancements in the application of propargylic alcohols in the cyclization, substitution, and addition reactions.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Phthalimidine&#8208;d2 with Heavy Water as Deuterium Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Phthalimidine finds wide pharmaceutical applications and its deuterated derivative is supposed to exhibit enhanced stability towards metabolism. In this work, an electrochemically reductive deuteration strategy from phthalimide to phthalimidine&#8208;d2 was achieved with D2O as a deuterium source at the reagent level in common solvents. This approach showed broad compatibility with a variety of functional groups. Mechanistic investigations assisted by electrochemical analysis revealed a 4&#8208;electron reduction pathway, and the coupled anodic oxygen evolution collectively maintains a neutral to mild basic conditions for the ongoing electrochemical reaction.

         <title>Substituent&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergent Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Annulative Dearomatization of Phenols toward Skeletally Diverse Spirocyclohexadienones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular dearomative formal [4+2] annulation of phenols with propargyl electrophiles is reported, enabling substituent&#8208;controlled regiodivergent synthesis of a wide range of skeletally diverse spirocyclohexadienones with good yields. The regiodivergence could be precisely controlled by adjusting the steric hindrance of O&#8208; and N&#8208;substituents from binucleophilic substrates, where substrates with an O&#8208;nucleophilic site were converted into spiro[chromane&#8208;4,1&#8242;&#8208;cyclohexane]&#8208;2&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;dien&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;ones with complete regioselectivity and (Z)&#8208;selectivity, whereas N&#8208;nucleophiles enabled a different regiodivergent process to access spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;1,4&#8242;&#8208;quinoline]&#8208;2,5&#8208;dien&#8208;4&#8208;ones.

         <title>Ga&#8208;Catalyzed Temperature&#8208;Dependent Oxazolidinone/Piperazine Synthesis from Phenyl Aziridines Involving a Divergent Ligand&#8208;Assisted Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Application of a binary Ga&#8208;based catalyst system for the coupling of CO2 and aziridines to form oxazolidinones is presented. It has been possible to optimize the catalyst system for the selective formation of a single regioisomer, in excellent yield, under relatively mild reaction conditions. The optimized catalyst system has been successfully applied to a range of substituted aziridines derived from styrene oxide. It has been observed that aziridines bearing two aromatic substituents result in piperazine formation through an unexpected dimerization reaction. These piperazine products can be selectively formed in the absence of CO2 or are favored at lower reaction temperatures. A detailed DFT study into the reaction mechanism for the formation of both products has been carried out and an unusual ligand assistance in the case of oxazolidinone synthesis has been identified. More specifically, this ligand interaction promotes the initial ring&#8208;opening of the aziridine and this work presents the first fully elucidated mechanism involving this intermediate.

Abstract
In 1962, Paul&#8197;J. de&#8197;Mayo initially described the photochemical reaction involving 1,3&#8208;diketones and double bonds, resulting in the formation of 1,5&#8208;diketones. Since then, this reaction has been extensively utilized for the synthesis of a wide range of fascinating natural products. Over time, this synthetic methodology has been applied to various carbonyl systems, including locked enol&#8208;tautomers of diketones, &#946;&#8208;keto esters, and &#946;&#8208;enaminones. Additionally, it has found application in other unsaturated systems such as allenes and alkynes. In this review article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the classical de Mayo reaction, highlighting its scope and potential. Furthermore, we focus on recent advances achieved through photocatalytic conditions. Special emphasis is placed on the regioselectivity of the process and the underlying reaction mechanism, particularly within the context of photocatalysis.

Abstract
In this study, we present a methodology for synthesizing aza&#8208;heterocyclic compounds using N&#8208;tosylhydrazones as key reagents. Our primary objective was to obtain six or seven&#8208;membered ring heterocycles; however, we unexpectedly observed the formation of bi&#8208;indole compounds in high yields. Furthermore, our synthetic pathway enables modifications at the C3 or C2 position of the indole, leading to the formation of the respective 3&#8242;&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;biindole or carbazole derivatives.

Abstract
Switchable synthesis of 3&#8208;alkenyl succinimides and maleimides has been achieved via Michael addition and oxidative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of &#945;&#8208;oxo ketene dithioacetals and maleimides by switching different reaction conditions. In the presence of 30&#8197;mol% of CH3SO3H in DCE at 120&#8201;&#176;C, Michael addition reaction of &#945;&#8208;oxo ketene dithioacetals and maleimides occurred to afford 3&#8208;alkenyl succinimides in 40&#8211;90% yields, whereas in the presence of 30&#8197;mol% of Pd(OAc)2 in DMF at 20&#8201;&#176;C, 3&#8208;alkenyl maleimides were obtained in 40&#8211;80% yields from the oxidative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of &#945;&#8208;oxo ketene dithioacetals with maleimides. The presupposition of directing groups onto the substrates is not required in the Michael addition reaction. The method can be extended to gram scale.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydrogenation of Azides and One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Pyrroles</title>

Abstract
In this work, a single&#8208;atom cobalt&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation (TH) of azides is reported under mild conditions (at 30&#8201;&#176;C in 30&#8197;min) using NH2NH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O as the hydrogen source. Employing this protocol, a wide range of azides were transformed to their corresponding amines. This methodology was extended towards the synthesis of several important N&#8208;substituted pyrroles from azides in one&#8208;pot manner. The control experiments suggested, the transfer hydrogenation favoured by electron withdrawing substituents and one&#8208;pot pyrrole synthesis favoured by electron&#8208;donating substituents. The recyclability test revealed the catalysts could be recycled up to 7th times without significant loss in the catalytic activity.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Aryliminophosphoranes in Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A practical electrochemical method for synthesizing aryliminophosphoranes from widely available nitro(hetero)arenes in a continuous&#8208;flow system is presented. The utilization of flow technology offers several advantages to our approach, including the elimination of the need for a supporting electrolyte and enhanced scalability. Our method demonstrates good tolerance towards various functional groups, with electron&#8208;deficient nitroarenes being particularly suitable for this strategy. In addition, we have demonstrated the versatility of aryliminophosphoranes as intermediates in synthesizing anilines, amines, and amides. To further enhance the utility of our approach, we have developed a telescoped method that utilizes a tube&#8208;in&#8208;tube setup for the in&#8208;situ production of isocyanates.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven, Persulfate&#8208;Mediated Hydrocarboxylation of Vinylsulfones</title>

Abstract
We report a visible light&#8208;mediated approach for the radical hydrocarboxylation of vinylsulfone derivatives. Using cheap and easily accessible sodium formate as C1&#8208;source and K2S2O8 as reagent, a set of vinylsulfone substrates could be efficiently hydrocarboxylated in aqueous medium without any additional catalyst or reagent; and the concept could be also applied for direct hydroacylations, hydroalkylations and hydrophosphorylations. The control experiments clearly indicated that the reaction proceeds via radical mechanism without the generation of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes; supporting the working model of K2S2O8&#8208;initiated in&#8197;situ formation of CO2 radical anion.

Abstract
Herein, a method about hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mediated electrochemical cross dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reaction of heterocycles with ethers has been established. Saturated linear, branched or cyclic ethers were all suitable for this cross&#8208;coupling reaction to form the corresponding products in 70&#8211;98% yields. The advantages of this reaction are transition metal&#8208; and chemical oxidant&#8208;free conditions, high yields, and broad functional group tolerance, etc.

         <title>Direct Introduction of &#8722;OCD3 into the Hantzsch Pyrrole Synthesis via Multicomponent Cascade Cyclization: Synthesis of Fully Substituted Pyrrole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A I2&#8208;DMSO mediated approach to introduce &#8722;OCD3 into pyrroles in&#8197;situ via multicomponent cascade cyclization reaction using methyl ketones, aniline, ethyl benzoylacetate and CD3OD as readily available substrates is reported. This process realizes introduction of &#8722;OCD3 into the Hantzsch pyrrole synthesis and synthesis of deuterated alkoxy&#8208;substituted pyrroles with formation of one C&#8722;C bond, one C&#8722;O bond and two C&#8722;N bonds in one pot. Notably, this conversion has good substrate compatibility (62 examples) and eliminates of the need for anhydrous and anaerobic operation.

&lt;p&gt;A I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-DMSO mediated approach to introduce &#8722;OCD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; into pyrroles &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ via&lt;/i&gt; multicomponent cascade cyclization reaction using methyl ketones, aniline, ethyl benzoylacetate and CD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OD as readily available substrates is reported. This process realizes introduction of &#8722;OCD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; into the Hantzsch pyrrole synthesis and synthesis of deuterated alkoxy-substituted pyrroles with formation of one C&#8722;C bond, one C&#8722;O bond and two C&#8722;N bonds in one pot. Notably, this conversion has good substrate compatibility (62 examples) and eliminates of the need for anhydrous and anaerobic operation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transfer Hydrogenation of Azoarenes to Hydrazoarenes by Ammonia Borane Complex Catalyzed by Au Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Minute amounts of supported Au nanoparticles on TiO2 (0.1&#8197;mol%) catalyze quantitatively at room temperature the transfer hydrogenation of azoarenes to hydrazoarenes by ammonia borane complex, in ethanol as solvent. At 1&#8197;mol% catalyst loading level and 2.5 molar equivalents of ammonia borane the process occurs instantaneously. The catalyst is recyclable and reusable. In the absence of reducing agent, hydrazoarenes undergo smooth Au/TiO2&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation back to azoarenes.

         <title>L&#8208;Proline Derived Thioamide Small Organic Molecule for the &#945;&#8208;Stereoselective Synthesis of 2&#8208;Deoxyglycosides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
L&#8208;Prolinethioamide catalyzes direct stereoselective glycosylation of glycal donors to access 2&#8208;deoxyglycosides under moderate reaction conditions. This proposed glycosylation protocol produced the desired products in up to 88% yield and shows greater tolerance of glycosyl acceptors and a broad substrate scope with better stereoselectivity. This method is also applicable for less nucleophilic acceptors such as phenol. In addition, 1,1&#8242;&#8208;linked trehalose&#8208;type analogues can also be accessed through this methodology. Further, mechanistic studies suggest that, in this glycosylation, L&#8208;prolinethioamide operates via Br&#248;nsted acid/base catalysis.

         <title>Multifaceted Domino Knoevenagel&#8208;Cyclization Reactions; Four Movements for 2H&#8208;Chromenes and Chromans.</title>

The front cover illustrates the diastereoselective formation of condensed heterocyclic ring systems by domino reaction sequences. The dominoes toppling each other represent the steps of the reaction sequences, each transformation initiating the next one. The mechanism of the cyclization is tunable by the choice of reagent, affording four different condensed heterocyclic ring systems. A novel mild transformation of nitroarenes to N&#8208;hydroxyindoles, in which deoxygenation is carried out by an intramolecular nitro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder cyclization&#8208;ring opening, is presented.

Abstract
Gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions between 1,5&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;ols and nitrones to deliver carbazole derivatives are described. Such cascade reactions are applicable to facile synthesis of polyaromatic compounds containing carbazole subunits. Notably, the reaction mechanism involves unexpected oxoarylations, rather than oxidative Mannich reactions as known for but&#8208;1&#8208;yn&#8208;4&#8208;ols. Our control experiments indicate that the presence of a second alkyne as in 1,5&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;ols enables such oxoarylations due to a weak bonding between gold and this alkyne, rending the tethered alcohol less conformationally flexible.

Abstract
A variety of functionalized 2&#8208;pyrrolidinones bearing N&#8208;trifluoromethylphenyl moieties were prepared in moderate to good yields with high diastereoselectivity through copper(II)&#8208;catalyst and base co&#8208;catalyzed formal [4+1] cycloaddition of cinnamaldehyde nitrones with 1&#8208;ethynylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ols in the presence of m&#8208;CPBA as the oxidant. The triple bond of 1&#8208;ethynylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol served as one&#8208;carbon synthon for the pyrrolidinone ring formation. Mechanistic studies revealed that m&#8208;CPBA played an important role to interrupt the intramolecular O&#8208;cyclization to afford the 2&#8208;pyrrolidinones. Moreover, the reaction could be easily performed at gram scales and the obtained products were selectively converted into diverse pyrroline scaffolds.

Abstract
Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot viable protocol to synthesize tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;aminothiophenes engaging readily accessible &#945;&#8208;enolic dithioesters and abundant fumaronitrile under transition metal&#8208;free conditions at room temperature in open air. The reaction proceeds via successive Michael&#8208;type addition/intramolecular cyclization/isomerization cascades. The added features are benign conditions, exclusive regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity, excellent atom&#8208;/step&#8208;economy, easy purification, and tolerance of wide range of functional groups of a diverse electronic and steric nature. This protocol not only provided a robust and modular approach to various 2&#8208;aminothiophenes in moderate to excellent yields, but also demonstrated the potential of dithioesters and fumaronitrile in the challenging intermolecular cross&#8208;coupling reactions widening the arsenal of synthetic methods.

         <title>Multicomponent Reaction of Aliphatic Organozinc Reagents, Acrylates and Acyl chlorides: Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Substituted &#946;&#8208;Ketoesters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An uncatalyzed three&#8208;component reaction employing aliphatic organozinc reagents for the preparation of &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;ketoesters is described. This modular procedure, which relies on a formal conjugate addition/crossed&#8208;Claisen domino reaction between an organozinc, an acrylate and an acyl chloride, allows the straightforward synthesis of the reaction products under mild conditions. The three&#8208;component coupling can also be conducted from alkyl iodides, in an even more simple procedure. Experimental findings account for a probable polar concerted mechanism involving at least two organozinc compounds at the stage of the transition state.

Abstract
(&#946;&#8208;Diazo&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroethyl)phosphonates have been emerging as useful building blocks in organic synthetic chemistry in recent years, which can be used as diazo analog or masked carbene for the rapid assembly of difluoromethylene phosphonate&#8208;containing compounds. Herein, we elaborate a method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates from hydration/C&#8722;F bond cleavage of in&#8197;situ generated (&#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroethyl)phosphonates via a Rh&#8208;carbene intermediate. Divers (&#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroethyl)phosphonates are tolerated in this reaction affording &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates in good yields. This reaction used the in&#8197;situ generated water as the coupling partner, which represents a reaction of (&#946;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroethyl)phosphonates and also a method for generating bioactive &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Amide Synthesis in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
In the present study, for the first time environmentally friendly deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are used as reaction media to perform an efficient, simple and straightforward photocatalytic amide synthesis at room temperature using thioacids and amines. This method features mild conditions, a broad substrate scope, high yields (&#8804;99%) under ambient conditions with air and moisture tolerance. Moreover, the applied operationally mild reaction conditions tolerate the presence of several different functional group substituents on the amine counterpart. Finally, the developed approach allows the recycling of the reaction medium and catalyst for at least three consecutive cycles without a significant decrease in the reaction yield.

Abstract
The palladium (II) catalyzed direct C3&#8208;(sp2)&#8722;H alkenylation of five membered heterocyclic aldehydes has been developed using 3&#8208;aminobutanoic acid as a catalytic transient directing group. A wide range of heterocyclic aldehydes reacted with various acrylates to afford highly site&#8208;selective C3&#8208;alkenylated products. This method features an exclusive E&#8208;selective alkenylation at the C3&#8208;position of heterocyclic aldehydes with a broad substrate scope. The protocol also proved to be useful to construct the mechanochromic luminogen.

Abstract
We have developed an electrochemical reaction for the synthesis of 3&#8208;selenylchromones and deutero&#8208;selenylated chalcones of alkynyl aryl ketones. This method is free from metal catalysts and oxidants, and is regulated by solvents. The reaction conditions are mild, and a wide range of substrates can be employed to produce selenylated chromones and deutero&#8208;selenylated chalcones, displaying potential anti&#8208;inflammatory activities. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the applicability of this approach for the late&#8208;stage deutero&#8208;selenylation of the drug molecule, metochalcone.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Bicyclo[3.2.1]octanes via Catalyst&#8208;Free Cascade Michael/Henry Reaction with a Functionalized Vinylogous Nucleophile</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A readily prepared and functionalized vinylogous nucleophile has been explored and utilized to construct bridged bicyclic compounds. The corresponding cascade Michael/Henry reaction occurred with relatively high reactivity under catalyst&#8208;free and mild conditions. A range of structurally distinct bicyclo[3.2.1]octanes were generated in 40&#8211;96% isolated yields with excellent diastereoselectivities (&#8805;10:1 dr). Gram&#8208;scale synthesis was also demonstrated.

Abstract
Visible&#8208;light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot tandem regioselective synthesis of C4&#8208;phosphorylated phthalazin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones from arylhydrazines, 2&#8208;formylbenzoic acids with diarylphosphine oxides is described. This three&#8208;component transformation occurs smoothly under mild conditions, providing regiospecific access to various phosphorylated products in 73&#8211;91% yield. The efficacy of the current catalysis arises from the use of organic 1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) as the photocatalyst and cheap K2S2O8 as the oxidant.

Abstract
&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated enones possessing an unactivated olefin at the &#1013;&#8208;, &#950;&#8208; or &#951;&#8208;position underwent an aluminum chloride&#8208;promoted Conia&#8208;ene&#8208;related cyclization, affording unsaturated decalones or hexahydroindenones in generally good yields. Cyclopropanes could be used as olefin surrogates in this process, leading to the same bicyclic products in slightly improved efficiency as the result of 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;hydroalkenylation reactions. This method provided an access to a whole range of bi&#8208; or tricyclic enone synthons, some of which were potentially useful as odorants or in the synthesis of biologically active molecules.

         <title>Reductive Denitrogenation of Six&#8208;membered Cyclic Nitronates to Densely Substituted Dihydrofurans with Raney&#174; Nickel/AcOH System</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A protocol for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;dihydrofurans by reductive denitrogenation/ring contraction of 6&#8208;membered cyclic nitronates was developed. The process utilizes cheap Raney&#174; nickel both as catalyst and stoichiometric agent without the need for high&#8208;pressure equipment. The products are formed in high purity and column chromatography is often not required. Studies on the substrate scope, functional group tolerance, and mechanism were performed. The developed approach provides a straightforward two&#8208;step access to densely substituted 2,3&#8208;dihydrofurans from nitrostyrenes and alkenes.

         <title>Cu(III) Trifluoromethyl Complexes with 1,3&#8208;Diketonate Ligands and Their Versatile Reactivity in C&#8722;H Trifluoromethylation</title>

Abstract
High&#8208;valent Cu(III) trifluoromethyl complexes with 1,3&#8208;diketonates as bidentate oxygen donor ligands LCu(III)(CF3)2 were prepared for the first time and fully characterized, including by X&#8208;ray crystallography. These complexes are bench stable and soluble in most organic solvents. Promising reactivity of Cu(III) trifluoromethyl diketonates in radical and radical&#8208;polar crossover trifluoromethylation reactions was demonstrated. Direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of electron&#8208;rich arenes and indoles using Cu(III) trifluoromethyl diketonates under blue light irradiation is described. Azolo&#8208; and oxy&#8208;trifluoromethylation of terminal alkynes and S&#8208;trifluoromethylation of aromatic thiol can be achieved using LCu(III)(CF3)2 in mild conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of Fluoromethyl&#8208;substituted Cyclopropanes by Electrophilic Cyclization of Homoallylic Boronate Intermediates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrophilic cyclization via the boronate complex between various homoallylic boronates and Selectfluor&#174; is reported. This reaction provides a fluoromethylated cyclopropane ring that was difficult to synthesize by previous methods. The use of phenyl lithium, which activates the homoallylic boronate, is important for the reaction. The intermediate boronate species in this reaction was observed through &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B NMR experiments. We also demonstrate the synthesis of a building block including fluoromethyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropane for a bioactive compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium and Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Friedel&#8211;Crafts Acylation with Activated Amides.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inside cover picture illustrates a new approach that was devised for the Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation reaction, involving the combination of an activated amide and an arene. To activate the arene, a catalytic system composed of [Pd(cinnamyl)Cl]2 and Cu(OTf)2 was employed. The reaction between the activated arene and the amide resulted in the formation of the desired aryl ketone, demonstrating favorable yields. This advancement opens up possibilities for the synthesis of diverse aryl ketones through the Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation process. Details can be found in the Update by Haeun Park and Sunwoo Lee (H. Park, S. Lee, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2023, 365, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202300376)

The front cover picture illustrates the synthetic strategy for the regioselective installation of various soft nucleophiles at the C6 position of the highly reactive o&#8208;quinol acetate by 1,6&#8208;addition. Afterward, the substituted phenol intermediate further chemoselectively cyclizes to provide a variety of isocoumarin or flavone products via a lactonization or SNAr pathway.

         <title>Halogenation/Cyanation vs. Cyanation/Halogenation of Alkenes Using ICN and BrCN</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
In a tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3]&#8208;catalyzed reaction of alkenes with cyanogen halides (XCN), BrCN proceeds in a cyanation/bromination manner, in which a cationic CN character is realized. The reaction using ICN switched the mode to iodination/cyanation for enamide substrates and electron&#8208;enriched styrenes. The origin of the iodination/cyanation is the B(C6F5)3&#8208;enhanced &#963;&#8208;hole generated on ICN.

Abstract
This work describes the palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective C8&#8208;H olefination of 1&#8208;naphthamides. Interestingly, naphthamide fused lactam 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[de]isoquinolin&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives were also synthesized in the case of a particular class of napthamides. This protocol was found well compatible with a diverse range of acrylates and styrenes leading to product formation in good yields along with a wide functional group tolerance. The developed strategy was further applied to the synthesis of different drug derivatives.

         <title>Harnessing Supported Gold Nanoparticle as a Single&#8208;Electron Transfer Catalyst for Decarboxylative Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We found that gold nanoparticles function as single&#8208;electron transfer catalysts to promote decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling between N&#8208;hydroxy phthalimide esters and disilanes or diborons. A variety of disilanes coupled with alkyl radicals could be generated from N&#8208;hydroxy phthalimide esters via single&#8208;electron reduction by active carbon&#8208;supported gold nanoparticle catalysts to afford diverse alkylsilanes without the need for external bases.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that gold nanoparticles function as single-electron transfer catalysts to promote decarboxylative cross-coupling between &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxy phthalimide esters and disilanes or diborons. A variety of disilanes coupled with alkyl radicals could be generated from &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxy phthalimide esters via single-electron reduction by active carbon-supported gold nanoparticle catalysts to afford diverse alkylsilanes without the need for external bases. Furthermore, the present gold catalytic system was also effective for decarboxylative carbon-boron coupling to afford alkyl boronates. A detailed mechanistic investigation revealed that single-electron transfer mediated by supported gold nanoparticles enabled the generation of alkyl radical and silyl radical, thereby enabling radical cross-coupling. The reusability and environmentally-friendly nature of supported gold catalyst as well as the scalability of the reaction system enable the practical transformation of carboxylic acid derivatives into value-added organosilicon and organoboron compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances and Development in Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Glycosylation: An Expanding Research Area in Glycochemistry</title>

Abstract
In the last fifteen years, the development of visible&#8208;light photocatalysis, metal/photoredox dual catalysis has become the forefront as a new paradigm in organic synthesis as well as in carbohydrate chemistry. It led to the discovery of unprecedented transformations and also the improvement of known reactions under mild conditions, employing simple household light sources and bench&#8208;stable precursors, which meet the requirements of green chemistry and sustainable development in excellent yield and stereocontrol. In a general sense, the exploitation of photoredox catalysis hinges on the capability of photocatalyst or redox mediator to transform visible light into chemical energy via photo&#8208;irradiated SET (single electron transfer), PET (photoinduced electron transfer), HAT (hydrogen atom transfer), and XAT (halogen atom transfer) to potentially unlock unique reaction pathways, thereby generating a diverse array of reactive intermediates. In view of reaction type, mechanism, and status, this review will systematically summarize the latest advances in visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photocatalytic glycosylation reactions, which are driven by single or dual photoredox catalysis and by the photoactivity of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes.

         <title>Advances in Catalytic Asymmetric Construction of Quaternary Stereogenic Centers by Conjugate Addition to &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Disubstituted Nitroalkenes</title>

Abstract
Quaternary stereogenic centers are of great importance because of their prevalence in a series of bioactive natural products and pharmaceuticals. Although the catalytic asymmetric construction of these highly congested centers poses a formidable challenge, this field has been extensively explored in the past few decades, and several elegant strategies, such as the asymmetric conjugate addition to &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted nitroalkenes, have been developed. The resultant &#946;&#8208;nitro quaternary stereocenters can be conveniently transformed into the corresponding &#946;&#8208;amino quaternary stereocenters commonly found in bioactive compounds. This review summarizes the recent advances in the construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary or hetero&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via metal&#8208;catalyzed and organocatalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition to &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted nitroalkenes, focusing on the scope, applications, and mechanisms of these reactions.

Abstract
Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular cyclization of 2&#8208;amidoazulene derivatives, prepared by the reaction of 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;aminoazulene derivatives with perfluoroalkyl acid anhydrides, resulted in the formation of 2&#8208;perfluoroalkylazuleno[2,1&#8208;d]pyrimidin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones. Heating of these products in phosphoryl chloride led to 4&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;perfluoroalkylazuleno[2,1&#8208;d]pyrimidines. We also evaluated the reactivity of these pyrimidin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones and pyrimidine derivatives toward the electrophilic and nucleophilic substitution reactions, revealing that a variety of functional groups can be incorporated into these derivatives.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Br&#248;nsted acid-mediated intramolecular cyclization of 2-amidoazulene derivatives, prepared by the reaction of 1-cyano-2-aminoazulene derivatives with perfluoroalkyl acid anhydrides, resulted in the formation of 2-perfluoroalkylazuleno[2,1-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]pyrimidin-4(3&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-ones. Heating of these products in phosphoryl chloride led to 4-chloro-2-perfluoroalkylazuleno[2,1-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]pyrimidines. We also evaluated the reactivity of these pyrimidin-4(3&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-ones and pyrimidine derivatives toward the electrophilic and nucleophilic substitution reactions, revealing that a variety of functional groups can be incorporated into these derivatives. The NMR studies, NICS calculations, and single-crystal X-ray structure analyses revealed structural features including the bond-length alternation of the azuleno[2,1-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]pyrimidin-4(3&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-ones and pyrimidine derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Copper catalysts containing alkoxydiaminophosphine (ADAP) ligand catalyze the selective C3&#8208;H functionalization of unprotected indoles upon carbene transfer from donor&#8208;acceptor diazo compounds, the N&#8208;H bond remaining unaltered during the transformation. Mechanistic studies, including DFT calculations, allows proposing  the existence of two competitive pathways, none of the occurring through the formation of cyclopropane intermediates, at variance with previously reported systems.</dc:description>
