         <title>Recent Advances in the Direct Synthesis of Sulfur&#8208;containing Organophosphorus Compounds via Radical Processes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Phosphonothioates, phosphinothioates and phosphorothioates are regarded as an important class of sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds. Because of the unique P(O)S&#8208;R group, these compounds have important biological activities and thus have been widely used in the fields of pharmaceuticals and pesticides. In recent years, the development of sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds by radical processes has attracted considerable attention in organophosphorus chemistry. Along these lines, in this review, the recent advances in the synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds were systematically summarized. According to the different ways of generating radicals during the formation process of phosphonothioates, phosphinothioates and phosphorothioates, these transformations can be divided into four categories: (1) Oxidant or metal&#8208;free promoted radical transformation to fabricate sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds; (2) Copper&#8208;catalyzed radical transformation to produce sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds; (3) Photo&#8208;induced radical transformation to prepare sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds; (4) Electro&#8208;induced radical transformation to derive sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Hypervalent Halogen Compounds in Electrochemical Reactions: Advantages and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. The clean and facile electrochemical synthesis of hypervalent iodine reagents is a fast growing field. In the past 5 years, a diverse number of reaction types have been established, from fluorinations, oxidative cyclizations, C&#8211;N and C&#8211;H couplings and oxidations. Electrochemistry is beneficial in terms of sustainability as the requirement for chemical oxidants is eliminated. This contributes to cleaner processes with limited by&#8208;product waste. Often, the purification of iodine(III) compounds is simple, since electrolysis is performed in the absence stoichiometric oxidants. Significant breakthroughs have been made recently, including the first asymmetric application, electrocatalytic applications, and even the synthesis of bromine(III) reagents using similar methodologies.

         <title>Direct Access to meta&#8208;Alkylated N&#8208;Arylazolium Salts via Ruthenium Catalyzed Electronically Controlled Site Selective Functionalization: Scope and Mechanistic Aspect</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effective access to new types of azolium salts with varying stereoelectronic properties has always fascinated the organometallic chemists. Herein, we described a Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed unprecedented one&#8208;step access to diverse meta&#8208;alkylated N&#8208;aryl (benz)imidazolium salts (&gt;40 examples) via &#963;&#8208;bond activation strategy starting from the readily available azolium salts using alkyl bromide. Notably, the present method is compatible with a wide range of azolium salts and secondary/tertiary alkyl bromides, including the biologically relevant motifs. Various control experiments along with the DFT calculation established the reaction pathway of first the orthometalated Ru(II)&#8208;NHC complex (6) formation followed by the generation of a Ru(III)&#8208;intermediate, which controls the observed meta&#8208;selectivity, via single electron transfer. Crucially, detailed insight of the reaction mechanism helped to comprehend why some substrates are challenging for this methodology.</dc:description>

Abstract
Grignard reagent&#8208;mediated and solvent&#8208;controlled regioselective 1,8&#8208;addition of &#945;&#8208;(2&#8208;thienylidene)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketosulfones provides diversified substituted 2&#8208;thienylmethyl &#946;&#8208;ketosulfones in moderate yields in a diethyl ether&#8211;dioxane cosolvent and dioxane (v/v=4/1) under ice&#8208;bath conditions. The 1,4&#8208;addition of &#945;&#8208;heterocyclic &#946;&#8208;ketosulfones was also studied. The structure of the key product was confirmed via X&#8208;ray analysis. The uses of various reaction solvents and organomagnesium bromides were investigated for transition metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H functionalization. Related plausible mechanisms are proposed and discussed. The DFT calculations are utilized to rationalize the regioselectivity of the 1,8&#8208;addition reaction.

         <title>Discovery and Engineering of an Ene&#8208;reductase for Kinetic Resolution and Cascade Reduction of Hajos&#8208;Parrish/Wieland&#8208;Miescher Ketones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Ene&#8208;reductase (ERED)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones is an attractive method in organic synthesis. Through the discovery and further structure&#8208;guided protein engineering of BsER, an ERED from Bacillus subtilis, the selective bio&#8208;reduction of the well&#8208;known building blocks Hajos&#8208;Parrish ketone (HPK, 1&#8201;a) and Wieland&#8208;Miescher ketone (WMK, 1&#8201;b) was achieved in this study. The optically pure (R)&#8208;HPK ((R)&#8208;1&#8201;a) and (R)&#8208;WMK ((R)&#8208;1&#8201;b) with corresponding &gt;99% and 98% enantiomeric excess (ee) values were obtained by kinetic resolution of the racemic substrates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of ERED mediated kinetic resolution of rac&#8208;HPK and rac&#8208;WMK. In addition, the reduction products cis&#8208;7a&#8208;methylhexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;indene&#8208;1,5(4H)&#8208;dione (cis&#8208;2&#8201;a) and cis&#8208;8a&#8208;methylhexahydronaphtha&#8208; lene&#8208;1,6(2H,5H)&#8208;dione (cis&#8208;2&#8201;b) with high diastereomeric ratios (dr) were also obtained. We also developed four routes of biocatalytic cascade reduction involving BsER and ketoreductases (KREDs). Using optimized ERED&#8208;KRED and KRED&#8208;ERED cascades, (S)&#8208;HPK ((S)&#8208;1&#8201;a) and (S)&#8208;WMK ((S)&#8208;1&#8201;b) could be reduced stepwise, yielding the bioactive products all with &gt;91% purity. This study presents a biocatalytic strategy for the kinetic resolution and cascade reduction of HPK and WMK (1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b).

In addition, the reduction products &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-7a-methylhexahydro-1H-indene-1,5(4H)-dione (&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-8a-methylhexahydronaphtha- lene-1,6(2H,5H)-dione (&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;2&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;) with high diastereomeric ratios (&lt;i&gt;dr&lt;/i&gt;) were also obtained. We also developed four routes of biocatalytic cascade reduction involving BsER and ketoreductases (KREDs). Using optimized ERED-KRED and KRED-ERED cascades, (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;HPK ((&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;WMK ((&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;) could be reduced stepwise, yielding the bioactive products all with &amp;gt;91% purity. This study presents a biocatalytic strategy for the kinetic resolution and cascade reduction of HPK and WMK (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>In situ Generated Copper(II)&#8208;Quinoline Complexes as Robust and Versatile Photocatalysts for the Chlorosulfonylation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A series of copper complexes was synthesized and studied as photocatalysts for the chlorosulfonylation of olefins. Featuring a tetradentate ligand consisting of one amino quinoline and two methyl pyridine moieties, the resulting Cu(II)&#8208;complex is effective under visible light irradiation to add sulfonyl chlorides to alkenes and alkynes, including unactivated aliphatic olefins. A weak base additive such as Na2CO3 prevents catalyst poisoning, resulting in an improvement of reaction yields and catalyst lifetime. A broad scope of sulfonyl chlorides and alkenes/alkynes as coupling partners are amenable for the title process, including examples previously reported unsuccessful with established copper&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Enantioselective Intramolecular Hydroacylation of Alkynes by Rhodium Catalysis through Dynamic Kinetic Resolution.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroacylation of racemic alkynals having a substituent at the &#945;&#8208;position of the carbonyl group. Mechanistic studies revealed that hydroacylation occurs preferentially from one enantiomer of the racemic substrate via a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process. The picture shows an outline of the DKR process by using an illustration of soccer, in which the player getting the good ball (i.&#8201;e., enantiomer) successfully scores a goal. Details can be found in the Communication by Yoshihiro Sato and co&#8208;workers (Y. Oonishi, K. Takagishi, Y.&#8208;M. Liu, Y. Sato, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2023, 365, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202300206).

Abstract
We described an Rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed divergent C&#8722;H bond functionalization of N&#8208;aryl amidines with iodonium ylides. Carbazolones and zwitterionic salts were diversely constructed through intermolecular annulation and intramolecular proton transfer under the different reaction conditions. This protocol is operationally simple and tolerates a variety of functional groups. The efficient post&#8208;modification of pharmaceutical molecules demonstrates its practicability.

         <title>A Base&#8208;Free, Low Temperature Click and Release Reaction for the In Situ Generation of Diazomethane</title>

Abstract
Diazomethane is a powerful reagent for numerous chemical reactions such as esterifications and the homologation of carboxylic acids. Unfortunately, the synthetic utility of diazomethane is severely limited by its toxicity and highly explosive nature. Diazald&#174; is typically used for ex situ synthesis, however it requires cumbersome and hazardous transfer of diazomethane from a caustic aqueous phase to the reaction medium. Herein, we present a low temperature and base&#8208;free in&#8197;situ synthesis of diazomethane via a &#8220;click and release&#8221; reaction between an enamine and sulfonyl azide. Its utility is exemplified by the synthesis of diverse methyl esters in yields of up to 93%. Moreover, diazoketone synthesis from in&#8197;situ generated diazomethane and acid chlorides was demonstrated for the first time. Finally, trideuteromethylation was achieved using acetone&#8208;d6 as the deuterium source. We anticipate that this method will enable the safer use of diazomethane in organic synthesis and drug discovery programs.

Abstract
A cobaltaelectro&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative [4+2] annulation of arylphosphinamides with alkynes was proposed in the present study to selectively construct a range of cyclic phosphinamide derivatives. Picolinic acid acted as a ligand to promote this transformation. A total of 38 examples demonstrated broad substrate scope, sufficient functional tolerance and excellent regioselectivity. Moreover, no additional oxidants and electrolytes were needed and it was possible to achieve gram scale synthesis, late&#8208;stage diversification and the removal of the directing group. Cyclic voltammetry and kinetic isotope experiments provided a better understanding to the reaction mechanism.

Abstract
An electrochemical oxydifluoroethylation of alkenes involving the anodic oxidative generation of MeCF2 radical has been achieved, which enabled to construct diversified difluoroethylated benzoxazines and lactones in 35&#8211;87% yields. Moreover, the developed protocol was also extended to the synthesis of cyclopropyldifluoromethylated benzoxazines. Detailed mechanistic studies indicated the reaction underwent a radical process concerned with tandem C&#8722;CF2R and C&#8722;O bond formation.

Abstract
A chemoselecive cyclodehydration of &#945;&#8208;acyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;arylaminoacrylamides via an electrophilic activation strategy has been described. A series of substituted 4&#8208;aminopyridines are chemoselectively prepared in 73&#8211;92% yields from &#945;&#8208;acyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;arylaminoacrylamides activated by hexaphenyloxodiphosphonium triflate (Hendrickson reagent), whereas substituted diaza[n]phenacenes (n=4&#8211;6) are obtained in 72&#8211;93% yields directly from &#945;&#8208;acyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;arylaminoacrylamides using Hendrickson reagent in combination with triflic anhydride (Tf2O). The synthetic protocols feature with readily available starting materials, mild reaction conditions, simple execution, and wide range of synthetic potential of products.

         <title>From Diazonium Salts to Optically Active 1&#8208;Arylpropan&#8208;2&#8208;ols Through a Sequential Photobiocatalytic Approach</title>

Abstract
The photocatalytic Meerwein arylation between aromatic diazonium salts and isopropenyl acetate under blue LED light irradiation in aqueous medium has been deeply investigated. Optimization of the reaction conditions in terms of substrate concentration, ester equivalents, cosolvent type and amount, reaction time and photocatalyst source, has allowed the access to a variety of 1&#8208;arylpropan&#8208;2&#8208;ones with yields up to 95% using 9&#8208;mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methylacridinium perchlorate ([Acr&#8208;Mes]ClO4). Next, the design of a one&#8208;pot sequential photobiocatalytic linear approach was accomplished, by the combination of the Meerwein arylation with the bioreduction of the corresponding ketone intermediates. Thus, a total of 19 pairs of 1&#8208;arylpropan&#8208;2&#8208;ol enantiomers were obtained depending on the alcohol dehydrogenase stereopreference. Global yields up to 76% were attained with high to excellent stereoselectivity (90 to &gt;99% ee). Also, it was possible to get access to both 1&#8208;phenylpropan&#8208;2&#8208;ol antipodes (51&#8211;53% yield) starting from aniline through a one&#8208;pot three&#8208;step sequential photobiocatalytic protocol.

         <title>Aerobic Coupling of Organophosphonium Salts with Alkenes: Catalyst&#8208;Free C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) Bond Formation</title>

Abstract
An aerobic coupling of benzhydryl phosphonium salts with simple alkenes for accessing trisubstituted olefins is developed under metal&#8208;free, catalyst&#8208;free, and additive&#8208;free conditions. New C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bond is constructed via the C&#8722;P and C&#8722;H bond functionalization by synergistically using O2 as a &#8220;green&#8221; oxidant and DMSO as a promoter. The method also distinguishes itself by its broad substrate scope and synthetic potential. Particularly, the use of 1,3,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzene fragment in the resulting products as a carbon&#8208;based leaving group for further transformations is proved to be feasible.

Abstract
In this paper, we report a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of N&#8208; or O&#8208;nucleophile tethered&#8208;vinylidenecyclopropanes (VDCPs), resulting in the synthesis of pyrrole, furan, pyrrolidine, and piperidine skeletons in 30%&#8208;98% yields. Depending on the carbon chain length connecting the nucleophile and VDCPs, two reaction pathways are available, leading to different products. Both &#945;&#8208;amino VDCPs and &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl VDCPs, where nucleophiles and VDCPs are connected by a methylene group, undergo intramolecular nucleophilic addition and aromatization, followed by ring&#8208;opening of the cyclopropane unit to produce substituted pyrroles and furans. By extending the chain length to three or four carbons, it becomes possible to form pyrrolidines and piperidines with a cyclobutene moiety via ring expansion of the cyclopropane unit, accompanied by gold carbene induced vinylogous nucleophilic addition.

Herein, sulfinyl chlorides and styrenes have been exploited to afford either &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;phenylethyl sulfides catalyzed by homogenous ZnCl2, or &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208;phenylethyl sulfones mediated by heterogeneous CuO nanoparticles (NPs). The key to achieve such a divergent synthetic strategy is the controlled disproportionation process of sulfoxide&#8208;onium ions, induced by different metal complexes. Owing to the mild conditions, a wide range of functional groups and heterocycles could be tolerated by both of the protocols. The mechanistic studies reveal the key role of sulfoxide&#8208;onium ions in both of the reaction pathways, and suggest that metal&#8208;steered disproportionation defines the oxidation state of sulfur in products.

Abstract
Arylation of amino&#8208;, diamino&#8208; and triaminophosphines with aryl(mesityl)iodonium triflates under blue light irradiation followed by oxidative P&#8722;N bond cleavage in the in&#8197;situ generated amino phosphonium salts under hydrolytic conditions represent a method for the synthesis of substituted arylphosphine oxides, arylphosphinic and arylphosphonic amides respectively. The proposed approach is based on using visible light as the only promoter for the C&#8722;P bond formation, accommodates a variety of functional groups, and can be applied to the late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization of drug molecules.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Quinolones through Radical C&#8722;H Functionalization/Cyclization</title>

Abstract
Divergent synthesis is an effective, yet challenging method to selectively access different molecules from a single starting material. Herein, we demonstrate a divergent and controllable synthesis of quinolones by sulfonyl chloride&#8208;controlled, copper&#8208;catalyzed, site&#8208;selective radical C&#8722;H functionalization/cyclization of quinoline scaffolds. Our catalytic system can tolerate a wide range of functional groups and provide both 2&#8208;thioquinolone and 4&#8208;quinolone derivatives in moderate to good yields. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations indicate a single&#8208;electron transfer mechanism, and the steric hindrance of sulfonyl chlorides and their electronic effect are decisive for reaction selectivity. This transformation provides not only a novel example of divergent radical C&#8722;H functionalization controlled by small organic molecules, but also an efficient way to rapidly derivatize medicinally important scaffolds and ultimately facilitate late&#8208;stage drug modification.

Abstract
A direct strategy for the preparation of fused thienoindoles from substituted indoles and elemental sulfur has been reported. The present approach produces a range of structurally valuable fused thienoindoles in 51&#8211;78% yield under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, which may have potential applications in pharmaceutical industry and organic functional materials. In this work, the double C&#8722;S bonds formation is achieved via base promoted direct sulfuration of C&#8722;H bonds with elemental sulfur.

The cover design shows a Chinese fairy tale &#8220;Carp jump over the dragon gate&#8221;. There was a Dragon Gate on the Yellow River. Carps could jump over it and turn into dragons, which means that everyone should conquer some difficulty before success. Herein, this design illustrates the Rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond intramolecular annulations and proton transfer strategy. The &#8220;dragon gate&#8221; represents the energy to be overcome in the catalytic cycle. The &#8220;leaping carp&#8221; represents the intramolecular annulation and proton transfer progress, indicating that the carp would become a dragon (products) after it crosses the dragon gate (energy). Details can be found in the Research Article by Cui, Wu and co&#8208;workers (J. Ren, L. Yang, C. Pi, X. Cui, Y. Wu, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2023, 365, 1817&#8211;1823; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202201390).

Abstract
In the last decade, free radicals have found a wide application in functionalization of unsaturated compounds, such as alkenes, alkynes, and arenes, via the free&#8208;radical addition to carbon&#8208;carbon &#960;&#8208;bonds. In these processes, intermolecular free&#8208;radical attack on the aromatic substrates represents a challenge due to relatively high resistance of aromatic &#960;&#8208;system to addition reactions in comparison to alkene C=C bonds. The free&#8208;radical functionalization of heterocycles is especially interesting due to the diversity of their structures and chemical properties as well as their importance for medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and materials science. Addition of C&#8208;centered radicals to heterocycles is widely known as the Minisci&#8208;type reactions and well&#8208;reviewed. In this paper, we have summarized the main achievements in less explored group of processes: functionalization of heterocycles by intermolecular addition of heteroatom&#8208;centered radicals (O&#8208;, N&#8208;, S&#8208;/Se&#8208;, and P&#8208;radicals) with the emphasis on the papers published after 2010. Literature analysis revealed the strong trend towards the usage of electrochemistry and photoredox&#8208;catalysis for the generation of free radicals in recent years. The remaining fundamental problem in this field is the lack of strong experimental support for the proposed mechanisms and frequent existence of several plausible reaction pathways. The progress in mechanistic studies can significantly improve the prediction of optimal reaction conditions depending on the substrates structure.

Addition of C-centered radicals to heterocycles is widely known as the Minisci-type reactions and well-reviewed. In this paper, we have summarized the main achievements in less explored group of processes: functionalization of heterocycles by intermolecular addition of heteroatom-centered radicals (O-, N-, S-/Se-, and P-radicals) with the emphasis on the papers published after 2010. Literature analysis revealed the strong trend towards the usage of electrochemistry and photoredox-catalysis for the generation of free radicals in recent years. The remaining fundamental problem in this field is the lack of strong experimental support for the proposed mechanisms and frequent existence of several plausible reaction pathways.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Dual C&#8722;H Activation for Regioselective Triple Annulation of Enaminones: Access to Polycyclic Naphthopyran Derivatives</title>

Abstract
Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation of arenes for oxidative annulations with alkynes stands out as a protocol for polycyclic scaffolds. This perspective drives us to disclose herein a rhodium catalyzed regioselective triple annulation of enaminones with hydroxyl&#8208;alkynoates via double C&#8722;H functionalization for polycyclic naphtho&#8208;pyran scaffolds. Secondary coordination of OH in alkynoate dictated the regioselectivity. Initial lactonization occurred chemoselectively on to enamine part via carbo rhodation followed by reductive elimination. This protocol was scalable and has shown high functionality tolerance. KIE studies were done to get insight in to the mechanism, and some downstream transformations were achieved to show the synthetic potential of the method.

Abstract
Reductive functionalization reactions between two electrophiles is a straightforward protocol to access carbon&#8208;carbon bonds without use of organometallic reagents prepared in advance. Here, we developed a manganese&#8208;mediated reductive alkylation of heterocyclic thiazolyl&#8208;phosphonium salts with benzyl bromides to form C2&#8208;alkylated benzothiazoles. The reaction features a broad substrate scope, high&#8208;functional&#8208;group tolerance, and can be utilized in late&#8208;stage modification of complex natural products and bioactive molecules.

Abstract
A series of 2,4&#8208;dithiohydantoins were synthesized regiospecificlly from various phenacyl sulfoxides bearing 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazole and N&#8208;substituted thioureas in moderate to excellent yields. The proposed mechanism involved the generation of &#945;&#8208;sulfines from sulfoxides through thermolytic elimination, carbonphilic attack of sulfines by substituted thioureas, and dehydration condensation. The current method provides a safe strategy for the preparation of 2,4&#8208;dithiohydantoins.

Abstract
Imidazole derivatives are critical building blocks in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, fluorescent materials, and ligands. Despite the development of many strategies, the reliable synthesis of 2,4,5&#8208;substituted imidazoles remains heavily researched. In this study, we present a protocol for synthesizing 2,4,5&#8208;substituted imidazole&#8208;bearing methyl groups using A3&#8208;coupling cyclization with calcium carbide as the acetylene source, reacting with amidines and aldehydes. This methodology is characterized by several features, including the utilization of a solid alkyne source, readily accessible starting materials, and applicability to 34 examples.

Abstract
An electrochemical method for the C(sp2)&#8722;H thiocyanation of pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;amines and enamines were developed in an undivided cell. A variety of thiocyanated pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;amine and enamine derivatives were accessed in 36&#8211;91% yields, employing thiocyanate salts as electrolyte and thiocyanating reagent. Moreover, this electrochemical protocol can be extended to the synthesis of various iodinated and brominated pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;amine derivatives in 51&#8211;95% yields. This electrochemical protocol does not require a metal or external chemical oxidants and tolerates unprotected amino groups.

Moreover, this electrochemical protocol can be extended to the synthesis of various iodinated and brominated pyrazol-5-amine derivatives in 51&#8211;95% yields. This electrochemical protocol does not require a metal or external chemical oxidants and tolerates unprotected amino groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Anilides by Aminolysis of Unactivated Esters using MnCl2 in Combination with strong Bases as Catalyst</title>

Abstract
Anilides are often found in pharmaceuticals and active ingredients in crop protection. Although of great interest, the atom&#8208; and step economic formation of the amide bond between a less nucleophilic aniline with an acid or ester remains still a major challenge. Herein, we report an aminolysis of aromatic and alkyl esters with anilines catalyzed by a readily available catalytic system comprising of an earth&#8208;abundant Mn&#8208;salt in combination with an inexpensive base.

Abstract
Herein, we reported the electrochemical hydroboration of olefins to access the organoboron derivatives in a one&#8208;pot reaction under air and at room temperature. This reaction manifold was applied to a broad range of alkenes with 40&#8211;90% yields and good functional group tolerance without using a metal catalyst or an additional hydride source. Mechanistic studies suggested that this anodic oxidation conducted in an undivided cell allowing the production of a boron radical species, which initiates the hydroboration of olefins event by a radical addition process.

Abstract
A decarboxylative condensation of malonic acid half thioesters (MAHTs) with aldehydes catalyzed by benzylammonium trifluoroacetate has been developed for the synthesis of (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioesters. The reaction of aromatic aldehydes and sterically non&#8208;demanding aliphatic aldehydes proceeded smoothly at room temperature in DMF in a stereo&#8208; and regioselective manner. Besides the unsubstituted malonate, 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and 2&#8208;methylmalonates could be employed as a nucleophile. Use of the present catalyst could avoid nonproductive protiodecarboxylation of MAHTs.

         <title>Highly Atom&#8208;Economic and Efficient Electrochemical Selenylative Annulation of 2&#8208;Alkynyl Biaryls</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A catalyst&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free, highly efficient, scalable, and sustainable synthetic method is developed for the selenylative annulation of 2&#8208;alkynyl biaryls or 2&#8208;heteroaryl&#8208;substituted alkynyl benzenes with readily available diselenides under electrochemical conditions to synthesize a wide variety of selanyl polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic heteroaromatics in high to excellent yield up to 99% at room temperature in a short time (2&#8208;5&#8197;h). The transformation required only electricity as a green reagent and produces hydrogen gas as the only innocuous byproduct. Notably, the green chemistry metrics of the protocol are found excellent. Mechanistic studies revealed a radical pathway being initiated by the in&#8197;situ generation of the corresponding selenyl radical from diselenides under electrochemical conditions. Significantly, a direct comparison of the electrochemical approach with that of our previously developed iodine&#8208;catalyzed chemical approach revealed that the electrochemical approach is not only catalyst&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free, but also more energy&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;yielding, sustainable, and practical.

         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component strategy for the synthesis of an important class of trifluoromethylated cyanopyrazoles from aldehydes, malononitrile and trifluorodiazoethane is reported. This approach involves a domino Knoevenagel condensation/1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition/dehydrocyanation process. Surprisingly, the use of cyanoacetate in place of malononitrile resulted in the formation of trifluoromethylated cyanopyrazolines. The protocol provides access to a wide variety of trisubstituted pyrazoles and pyrazolines thus expanding the chemical space for these structural units.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Dibenzoylperoxide emerged as a versatile oxidant for quaternary ammonium iodide or bromide&#8208;catalyzed reactions of phenol derivatives with NaN3. While the use of iodides allowed for efficient benzylic azidations under these oxidative conditions, the use of bromides allowed for dearomative azidations instead. Both approaches have been successfully applied to different phenol derivatives and a first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for an enantioselective variant using chiral quat. ammonium bromides has been obtained as well.</dc:description>

The synthetic versatility of this protocol is highlighted by the preparation of a precursor of the drug molecule oxcarbazepine, a gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and two product transformations. Unlike previous amination/Heck sequence, this cascade process is supposed to undergo a C(vinyl), C(aryl)&#8208;palladacycle involved pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>A Simple Preparation of Alkylzinc Reagents Compatible with Carbonyl Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a direct  method to prepare alkylzinc compounds from functionalized alkyl bromides using cobalt catalysis under mild conditions. This procedure only requires a simple catalytic system composed of CoBr2 and bipyridine as ligand in a mixture of acetonitrile/pyridine. This reaction is stable under air and moisture conditions opening the way to an accessible procedure. A wide range of functional groups such as esters, cyano and halogens on primary and secondary alkyl bromides was well tolerated and gave high yields of the corresponding alkylzinc compounds. Additionally, we managed to form unprecedente alkylzinc reagents bearing sensitive functional groups such as ketones and aldehydes with good yields. The direct application of these alkylzinc derivatives in palladium&#8208;catalyzed Negishi cross&#8208;coupling with various functionalized aryl bromides proved the efficiency and robustness of this methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Transformations Involving the Heck Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elaborated molecular architectures including complex carbocycles, heterocycles, and polycyclic molecular structures represent an important class of organic compounds because they are ubiquitous structural units in a broad variety of biologically and pharmacologically relevant natural products, medicinal molecules, and functional materials. A major challenge in modern synthetic methodology is the development of strategically efficient and selective construction of these compounds from readily available starting materials. Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations involving Heck reaction as the pivotal step have afforded a powerful approach for accessing sophisticated polycyclic skeletons from a set of easy&#8208;to handle starting materials, thus highlighting its potential significance in streamlining the drug discovery process. Over the past few decades, significant effort has been devoted to accessing complex polycyclic derivatives in efficient and versatile routes, and a number of powerful and direct synthetic strategies have been reported. In this review, the latest advances in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations involving Heck reaction as the critical step are summarized, which could be divided into six categories: 1) Heck/Sonogashira tandem reaction; 2) Heck/Suzuki tandem reaction; 3) Heck/Heck tandem reaction; 4) Heck/Hiyama tandem reaction; 5) Heck/Cacchi tandem reaction; 6) Heck/C&#8208;H bond functionalization tandem reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiols as Powerful Atom Transfer Catalyst: Opportunities in Photoredox&#8208;Mediated Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The employing visible light to drive organic transformations is the most promising choice to meet the needs for green synthesis, in which the reactions promoted by visible light may provide a more efficient and greener method. Currently, the most abundant methods for activation and functionalization of reaction substrates have relied on the direct single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) between the excited photocatalyst and substrates, and these wonderful works were summarized and docoumented in many reviews. As a complement to the above reactions, the photoredox&#8208;mediated atom transfer transformations (photocatalyst&#8208;to&#8208;HAT catalyst&#8208;to&#8208;substrates) to generate radical species is showing an explosively growing trend. In this review, we highlight 	recent significant developments in this rapidly growing area, mainly focusing on the photoinduced base&#8208;to&#8208;substrates charge transfer reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Cycloisomerization of Enyne Diesters Derived from Biaryls and Related Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enyne diesters derived from biaryls and related substrates undergo intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition and concomitant cyclo&#8208;reversion when treated with 10 mol% In(OTf)3 in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane. This enyne metathesis type cycloisomerization reaction enables the synthesis of phenanthrene, benzophenanthrene, benzotetraphene and other polycyclic (hetero)aromatic compounds bearing a synthetically useful diethyl &#946;&#8208;(hetero)arylidene malonate moiety in a step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economic manner. In(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed two independent intramolecular cycloisomerization on substrates 5a &amp; 5b provides direct access to benzotetraphenes 6a &amp; 6b containing bis(diethyl &#946;&#8208;phenylmethylene malonate) moiety. Tetrasubstituted vinylidene malonate 4a, substiututed by two different aromatic groups, is stereoselectively converted into E&#8208; &amp; Z&#8208;isomer of triaryl group containing all carbon tetrasubstituted olefins (8a, 8a&#1371; &amp; 8b) via Pd&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective decarboxylative arylation reaction.</dc:description>

The chemoselective O&#8208; versus N&#8208;arylation of the amides was tuned by varying the electronic and/or steric properties of the diaryliodonium salt and/or the substrate. The O&#8208;arylation reaction would preferentially occur for sterically and electronically diverse substrates. This study, which reveals the possibility of substituent&#8208; and reagent&#8208;controlled chemoselectivity, with diaryliodonium salts is expected to attract great interest in the area of hypervalent iodine chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of C&#8208;3&#8208;Functionalized Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines via Direct para&#8208;position Arylation of Electron&#8208;rich Anilines under Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a multi&#8208;component tandem arylation reaction was established under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions to synthesize structurally diverse imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines.

         <dc:description>The Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation reaction between activated amides and arenes was effectively carried out by employing [Pd(cinnamyl)Cl]2 and Cu(OTf)2 as catalysts. A range of N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;N&#8208;tosylbenzamides, which were substituted at the phenyl ring of the benzamide moiety, underwent reaction with various arenes, such as mesitylene, toluene, anisole, 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzene, o&#8208;xylene, m&#8208;xylene, and p&#8208;xylene, affording the corresponding diaryl ketones in moderate to good yields.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The established process proceeds through copper (II)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization of &#946;&#8208;diketones/&#946;&#8208;ketoesters with 2&#8208;bromobenzaldehyde oximes followed by the intramolecular cyclization of in situ generated acylated intermediates to deliver the isoquinoline N&#8208;oxides. The copper(II) acetate catalyzed C&#8208;H functionalization showed maximum efficacy at 60 &#176;C in methanol/toluene as solvent. The described reaction conditions were applicable over a wide range of substrates with a variety of functional groups to yield isoquinoline N&#8208;oxides in yields up to 85%. The developed approach was further elucidated by means of control experiments and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Insights into the Reactivity Difference between Hypervalent Bromine(III) and Hypervalent Iodine(III) Reagent in the C&#8208;H Amination and Alkene Aziridination</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present herein a computational exploration into the mechanism and origin of the reactivity difference between N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodane and N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;bromane in the C&#8208;H amination and alkene aziridination. Our calculations revealed that the preferred mechanism for C&#8208;H amination involves the generation of free nitrene intermediate, while the alkene aziridination proceeds via a concerted reaction mechanism. The superior reactivity of N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;bromane over N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodane could be mainly ascribed to better nucleofugality of the bromanyl moiety, which can be characterized by the strength of I&#8208;N and Br&#8208;N bond. The effect of solvent polarity on the reactivity of N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;bromane as a nitrene precursor will be discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissymmetrically Substituted Diphosphines with Two Atropisomeric Axes and Their Application in Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Imines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Despite the great potential and widespread applications, the majority of diphosphine ligands used in asymmetric catalysis are C2&#8208;symmetric and their structural modifications are often limited. Herein, we reported the design of original enantiopure dissymmetrical diphosphines, BiaxPhos, bearing two atropisomeric axes. Their original chiral architecture combined with important modularity, renders BiaxPhos ligands appealing candidates for asymmetric catalysis, as illustrated by the Ir&#8208;BiaxPhos catalyzed asymmetric imines hydrogenation, furnishing chiral amines with excellent enantioselectivities under mild conditions. Remarkably, combined experimental mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations delineate yet unexplored mechanistic scenario implying the hydrogenation of the enamine tautomeric form instead of the classic reduction of the imine.

         <title>Carboline Regioisomers Based on Unified Synthetic Approaches</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Carbolines are a prominent class of tricyclic alkaloids omnipresent in natural products and bioactive compounds. Four different carboline regioisomers are known (&#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, and &#948;&#8208;carbolines), which can be classified according to the nitrogen atom position inside the pyridine ring. As an emerging structural motif in drug discovery, a multitude of synthetic methods have been established for the construction of carboline frameworks, which in general requires customized approaches for the assembly of each regioisomer. Distinguishingly, their frameworks are also accessible from unified approaches, which are capable of generating multiple regioisomers, thus suitable for introducing diversity in isomeric carbolines. In this review, the construction of isomeric carbolines based on unified synthetic approaches is summarized.

         <title>NHPI/O2&#8208;Mediated Electrochemical Intermolecular Cyclization/Dehydrogenation for the Construction of Polycyclic Quinazolinones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Herein, an eco&#8208;friendly and atom&#8208;economical electrochemical methodology with isatins and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinolines through NHPI/O2&#8208;mediated intermolecular oxidation/annulation is disclosed, leading to a variety of polycyclic quinazolinones in 46&#8211;82% yields. This oxidative cyclization proceeded in transition metal&#8208; and strong oxidant&#8208;free conditions and generated H2 and CO2 as byproducts. Additionally, late&#8208;stage functionalization and broad substrate scope demonstrated the synthetic usefulness of this protocol.

This oxidative cyclization proceeded in transition metal- and strong oxidant-free conditions and generated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as byproducts. Additionally, late-stage functionalization and broad substrate scope demonstrated the synthetic usefulness of this protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade double cyclization reaction has been designed to synthesize heterobiaryl compounds such as furanyl and pyrrolyl 2H&#8208;chromenes from bis(alkynyl)&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols and 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols. The starting materials are readily available from biomass platform molecules such as &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids and &#945;&#8208;amino acids. The process involves an initial heterocyclodehydration step enabling the formation of the furan or pyrrole ring, followed by an alkyne hydroarylation to form the chromene core.

Abstract
An oxidative sulfonylation/cyclisation of N&#8208;propargylindoles with Hantzsch esters through sulfur dioxide insertion has been developed. The method uses Na2S2O5 as sulfur dioxide source along with 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted Hantzsch esters as radical precursors for accessing sulfonyl radicals, and allows for the synthesis of 2&#8208;sulfonated 9H&#8208;pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles.

         <title>Enantioselective C&#8211;P Bond Formation through C(sp3)&#8211;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enantioselective C&#8211;P bond formation has been developed through a C(sp3)&#8211;H activation in an oxidation step followed by an organocatalyzed hydrophosphonylation protocol. The asymmetric organocatalytic Pudovik reaction has been achieved following a one&#8208;pot strategy, starting from different benzylic and allylic alcohols and dibenzyl phosphite, using MnO2 as the oxidant and a chiral squaramide as organocatalyst. The scope of the reaction provides enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxy phosphonates with yields from 40% to &gt;95% and enantioselectivities from 64% to &gt;99%. Furthermore, the use of this methodology has been demonstrated to form a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter, generating an acetophenone derivative in situ, using diphenyl phosphite. Therefore, this approach represents an asymmetric strategy for constructing chiral C&#8211;P bonds, which are of interest to the pharmaceutical industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluoroalkyl Iodides in Fluoroalkylative Difunctionalization of C&#8722;C Multiple Bonds</title>

Abstract
Fluorinated alkyl iodides serve as a convenient and inexpensive source of fluoroalkyl radicals that can readily undergo addition to the C&#8722;C unsaturated bonds of alkynes and alkenes which is the foundation for a variety of useful synthetic protocols. Since 2010 this field has witnessed huge progress in several respects. First the portfolio of fluorinated alkyl iodides was extended beyond only simple perfluoroalkyl iodides (CnF2n+1I). In particular, employment of iododifluoro&#8722;methyl&#8208; carbonyls and phosphonates has enabled facile installation of the medicinally relevant difluoromethylene motif. Secondly, from a conceptual point of view, novel strategies for activation of fluoroalkyl iodides towards radical formation have been introduced, relying on the formation of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes, photoredox catalysis, frustrated Lewis pairs and transition metal catalysis, complementing prior approaches based on heat and UV induced C&#8722;I homolysis, radical initiators, and simple electron transfer processes. Based on these strategies a range of novel fluoroalkylative transformations of unsaturated systems have been added to classical iodoperfluoroalkylation. Broadly applicable protocols for simple fluoroalkylation and hydrofluoroalkylation, as well as for more sophisticated, complexity&#8208;building methods of fluoroalkylation&#8208;annulation and tandem multicomponent fluoroalkylations with concomitant installation of another functionality have been recently disclosed. This review summarizes the progress achieved since 2010 in the reactivity of fluoroalkyl iodides towards alkenes and alkynes with emphasis placed on the above&#8208;mentioned advances.

Abstract
A selenium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular oxidative amination of cyclopentenes has been described. A variety of 2&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptenes were obtained with 58%&#8211;96% yields. This protocol was featured with mild reaction conditions and broad substrate scope. The subsequent modification of the bicyclic backbone and amino group further demonstrated the application value of this aza&#8208;bridged ring.

         <title>Merging Continuous Flow Technology, Photochemistry and Biocatalysis to Streamline Steroid Synthesis</title>

Abstract
Since their structural elucidation in 1935, the introduction and substitution of functional groups and the modification of the steroidal scaffolds have been a fertile ground of research for synthetic and medicinal chemists. The discovery of steroids with hormonal and pharmacological activity has stimulated tremendous efforts to the development of highly selective and efficient synthetic procedures. Despite the progress made, steroid chemistry remains challenging and the preparation of steroidal compounds of pharmaceutical interests and in clinical practice, often requires long and elaborated synthesis. In recent years, a new impetus in the field came with the advent of enabling chemical technologies, such as continuous flow chemistry, which are exploited to overcome problems that arise from batch synthesis. Although it is still a niche sector, the use of flow technology in steroid synthesis and functionalization holds the premise to empower methodology development and to provide innovative tactics also for many hitherto uncharted chemistries. In this review, scientific contributions are reported and discussed in terms of flow set&#8208;up and advantages offered concerning process efficiency, optimization, waste minimization, safety improvement, easy scale&#8208;up and costs. We also highlight the main challenges, key improvements and the future trajectory in the application of continuous flow chemistry and its implementation to different disciplines such as photochemistry and biocatalysis with the ultimate goal of streamlining steroid synthesis.

         <title>Catalytic Difluoromethylation of Alkenes with Difluoroacetic Anhydride: Reactivity of Fluorinated Diacyl Peroxides and Radicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Given the importance of difluoromethylated molecules for drug and agrochemical development, much attention has been drawn to the establishment of related synthetic protocols, as exemplified by the CF2H radical&#8208;mediated catalytic difluoromethylation of alkenes. However, most of these difluoromethylations proceed under photocatalytic conditions, whereas those requiring thermal conditions are few. Herein, we developed a general and practical method of Cu&#8208;catalyzed alkene difluoromethylation with difluoroacetic anhydride (DFAA) as a CF2H source, showing that the thus realized amino&#8208;, allylic&#8208;, and oxy&#8208;difluoromethylations involve bis(difluoroacetyl) peroxide (BDFAP) in&#8197;situ generated from DFAA and H2O2 and further demonstrating the occurrence of carbo&#8208;difluoromethylation under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The obtained results pave the way to the simple and efficient synthesis of a broad range of difluoromethylated species and thus facilitate their practical applications, including those in medicinal and agricultural chemistry. Moreover, we probed the mechanisms of the observed transformations, rationalized the extraordinary fast decomposition of BDFAP compared to that of diacyl peroxides containing CF3 or CF2Cl groups, and performed DFT calculations to shed light on the low stability and decomposition mode of BDFAP. Finally, we examined the influence of fluorinated radical philicity on the reaction outcome.

         <title>Chemical Modification of Peptides and Proteins Using Spirooxindole Oxirane Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods for chemical modification of proteins and peptides at certain positions are required for the preparation of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates, protein&#8208; or peptide&#8208;biotin conjugates, and conjugates used as therapeutics or as tools in biomedical research. We have developed chemical modification methods that use spirooxindole oxirane derivatives for the synthesis of protein&#8208; and peptide&#8208;conjugates. In most cases, the epoxide group of the spirooxindole oxirane derivatives reacted to form a covalent bond with certain histidine residues and/or the N&#8208;terminal amino group of peptides and proteins. The modification reactions of various proteins resulted in the formation of proteins modified at only one or two positions.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies and Methods for the Synthesis of 2&#8208;Pyrazolines: Recent Developments (2012&#8211;2022)</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
2&#8208;Pyrazolines are important five&#8208;membered heterocycles, containing two adjacent nitrogen atoms. They can incorporate various functional groups and possess unique biological properties. Moreover, they have been used as useful building blocks. In recent years, the field of 2&#8208;pyrazoline synthesis has experienced enormous progress. Novel strategies have been developed, and many studies reporting improvements or adaptations of existing protocols have been published, giving access to new functionalizations, unexplored structures, and/or enantioselective synthesis. This review summarizes the progress made in synthetic methodologies during the period from 2012 to 2022. The functionalization challenges and capabilities, scopes and limitations of the reactions, substitution patterns, and mechanisms of the reactions, where appropriate, will be discussed.

Abstract
Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed cascade oxidative C&#8722;H functionalization/aza&#8208;annulation of indole and pyrrole&#8208;N&#8208;carboxamides with 1,3&#8208;enynes involving 1,4&#8208;rhodium migration is disclosed. This [4+1] annulation protocol provides an approach for the synthesis of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]indol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones from easily accessible substrates. Moreover, sulfonamides are also found to be well compatible in this method, leading to the corresponding benzo[d]sultams. The efficacy of this protocol is highlighted by handy downstream conversions of the dienyl&#8208;sultam.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Enabled Photo&#8208;Sulfonylation of Aryl Halides Using Alkylsulfinates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A photochemical synthetic method to access sulfones from aryl halides and sodium alkylsulfinates in the presence of CuCl is reported. Regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity for the sulfonylation is observed for polyhalogenated arenes. Mechanistic studies indicate that a copper sulfinate reagent is formed in&#8197;situ from CuCl and sodium sulfinate based on NMR experiments. Potential reaction intermediates, including excited state aryl halides are studied using density functional theory calculations and reveal energetically accessible non&#8208;planar triplet geometries.

         <title>Mechanochemical Defluorinative Acylation of ortho&#8208;Hydroxyarylenaminones by CF3&#8208;Compounds: Synthesis of 3&#8208;Acylchromones</title>

         <dc:description>









Abstract
An alternative strategy for the mechanochemical defluorinative acylation of ortho&#8208;hydroxyarylenaminones has been developed to synthesise 3&#8208;acylchromones utilizing CF3&#8208;compounds via activation of the C&#8722;F bound of the trifluoromethyl group in the presence of ytterbia (Yb2O3). The current protocol tolerated a wide range of coupling substrates to access a library of diversely substituted 3&#8208;acylchromones under the mechanochemically induced domino cyclisation mode. This is the first report for the deflourinative transformation of the inert CF3 group to the corresponding carbonyl functionality under the mechanochemical conditions.

         <title>Uncovering the Reactivity of Cobalt&#8208;catalyst Towards Regioselective Hydroarylation of 1,6&#8208;Diyne via Weak&#8208;chelation Assisted C&#8208;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the reactivity of cobalt(III)&#8208;catalyst towards hydroarylative functionalization of 1,6&#8208;diyne, which has never been explored before. The N&#8208;aryl lactam is the prime substrate that undergoes sp2 C&#8208;H bond activation. C&#8208;Co(III) bond formation occurs through weakly coordinating pyridone group. The reaction mechanism reveals the in&#8208;situ formation of a six&#8208;membered cobaltacycle which undergoes further functionalization with 1,6&#8208;diyne. Also, radical quenching experiments suggest the involvement of the ionic pathway for this conversion. In addition, hydrogen scrambling and kinetic isotope experiments support the proposed mechanism. A wide range of electronically biased substrates and reacting partners work well with this method in a highly atom&#8208;economical fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>From Pyridine to (&#8208;)&#8208;Agelastatin A</title>

         <dc:description>(&#8208;)&#8208;Agelastatin A was synthetized employing a flow photorearrangement of a pyridinium salt, constructing in one step the cyclopentene core possessing the desired functionalities and relative configurations. A flow enzymatic kinetic resolution of the resulting bicyclic vinyl aziridine delivered the enantiopure precursor to the natural product. This total synthesis required the use of a single protective group. Two novel agelastatin N3&#8208;derivatives were synthesized and their cytotoxicity evaluated against a series of cancer cell lines, which corroborated the importance of unsubstituted N3 in the biological activity of (&#8208;)&#8208;agelastatin A.

Abstract
The synthesis of chiral contiguous cyclopropylaziridine was achieved through cyclopropanation of (E)&#8208;3&#8208;((S)&#8208;1&#8208;[(R)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethyl)aziridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl]acrylaldehyde with bromomalonate in the presence of (2R)&#8208; or (2S)&#8208;[diphenyl(trimethylsilyloxy) methyl]pyrrolidine as a chiral organocatalyst and 2,6&#8208;lutidine as a base. This chiral cyclopropylaziridine was then subjected to various functional transformations, leading to the construction of a wide range of structurally important motifs.

Abstract
Regiodivergent [3+2] and [4+2] C&#8722;H annulation of imines and imidate esters with unsymmetrical alkynes has been achieved under Rh(III) catalysis. Further transformation of the aldehyde and TMS functionality on the indene products is also demonstrated. The current work highlights the alcohols&#8208;directed multiple C&#8722;H annulation of imines and imidate esters, leading to diverse fused heterocycles.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Branch&#8208;Selective and Enantioselective C2&#8208;Alkylation of N&#8208;Benzimidazolyl Indoles</title>

         <dc:description>









Abstract
Iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C2&#8208;alkylation of indole derivatives with terminal alkenes proceeded to give branched alkylation products with high enantioselectivity (39&#8211;99% yields, 20&#8211;91% ee). The reaction of indole derivatives having an N&#8208;substituted benzimidazolyl as a directing group gave the branch&#8208;selective alkylated products. Styrene derivatives and allylsilanes were good substrates displaying high enantioselectivity. The directing group was readily removed in several ways.

         <title>Radical Decyanations of Unactivated Carbon&#8208;CN Bonds: Recent Achievements and Mechanistic Studies</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Decyanation is an important process in the synthesis of aromatic molecules in the studies of pharmaceutical research, medical and materials sciences. In late&#8208;stage modifications of privileged carbo/heterocyclic scaffolds, radical&#8208;type decyanation techniques have been devised to date. As a result, the chemistry of cyano&#8208;involved conversions, a hotly debated subject over the past few decades, has advanced significantly. The cyano group (CN), on the other hand, has rarely been acknowledged as a good reaction site due to its thermodynamic robustness. The most recent advancements in catalytic radical decyanation protocols that CN behaved as a leaving group has made are surveyed in this article. Following the introduction of a number of different reaction modes, the catalytic reactions that are used to activate the C&#8722;CN bonds are primarily categorized, and the text herein are divided into three groups: (1) photo&#8208;catalyzed decyanation transformations, (2) electro&#8208;catalyzed decyanation transformations, and (3) transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed or metal&#8208;free decyanation transformations. With an emphasis on the catalytic systems and synthetic applications in C&#8722;CN bond activation, this review will provide the readers with an overview of decyanation chemistry in radical reactions.

         <title>Organocatalytic Remote Stereocontrolled Additions of In Situ Formed Electron&#8208;Deficient Conjugate Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Conjugate addition is one of the most powerful and practical methods for the formation of carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds in organic synthesis. Owing to the rapid development of asymmetric catalysis, significant progress has been made in the field of asymmetric conjugate addition, such as 1,4&#8208;addition and 1,6&#8208;addition. However, formidable challenge of controlling chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity arises with the extended conjugated systems. Recently, with the aid of Br&#248;nsted acids catalysis, functionalized benzyl alcohols and indolylmethanols has been successfully developed as suitable precursors of electron&#8208;deficient conjugate systems for organocatalytic remote stereocontrolled conjugate additions. This review investigates the advances in the field of organocatalytic enantioselective 1,8&#8208;conjugate addition and 1,10&#8208;conjugate addition of in&#8197;situ formed electron&#8208;deficient conjugate systems from functionalized alcohols, which is organized according to the substrates.

         <title>Selective C&#8722;H Acyloxylation of Sulfides/Disulfides Enabled by Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Herein, we report the &#945;&#8722;C&#8722;H acyloxylation of sulfides and disulfides enabled by hypervalent iodine(III) reagents via photoredox catalysis. The methoxylbenziodoxole derivatives serve as the hydrogen atom transfer agent, the mild oxidant, and the acyloxylation source in the reaction. External nucleophiles can also be introduced to the &#945;&#8722;C&#8722;H of sulfides. The reaction applies to various aryl and alkyl sulfides including methionine peptide derivatives. Disulfides are applicable for the first time with excellent chemoselectivity and functional group compatibility.

         <title>Weak Nucleophiles in the Aza&#8208;Michael Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The 1,4&#8208;conjugated addition of nitrogen centered nucleophiles to electron&#8208;deficient alkenes is one of the most significant and widely used reactions in modern synthetic organic chemistry. To date, various protocols for the aza&#8208;Michael reaction have been developed. However, these reports mainly focus on the use of strong Michael donors. In recent years, the conjugate addition of weak nitrogen nucleophiles to various Michael acceptors gained increasing popularity. Impressive progress in this area has been achieved by the use of more efficient catalyst systems. This review aims to provide a critical analysis of the results obtained in reactions of weak nucleophiles (azoles, pyrroles, indoles, carbamates, purines, amides, hydrazides, uraciles etc) with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes which were reported over the past twelve years.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introducing the primary amino group into aromatic ring is one of the most important study issues in organic chemistry, particularly for the pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals chemistry. Herein, we describe a photoinduced direct C&#8208;H amination of arenes with ammonia via the site&#8208;selective C&#8208;H thianthrenation that forms a new C&#8208;N bond with excellent regioselectivity. The reaction is carried out under mild conditions, and with a wide range of functional group tolerance, such as sensitive &#8208;Cl, &#8208;Br, and &#8208;OH groups which are poorly tolerated in conventional approaches. Moreover, the synthetic utility of our amination protocol has been confirmed through late&#8208;stage modification and gram&#8208;scale synthesis of complex drug&#8208;like molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Advancements in the Synthesis of Diaryliodonium Salts: Updated Protocols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Our group has reported several one&#8208;pot protocols for the synthesis of diaryliodonium salts, which have been recognized as attractive multi&#8208;purpose reagents in areas ranging from organic synthesis to materials chemistry. Over the years, we have identified limitations in the published protocols concerning synthesis of mixed electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor, as well as highly electron&#8208;poor diaryliodonium salts, as the corresponding starting materials are either too reactive or too unreactive. In this update, we discuss the underlying limitations concerning the stability and reactivity of the involved reagents and provide strategies to overcome these challenges through updated synthetic protocols.

         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component vicinal carbophosphorothiolation of vinyl arenes by the cooperation of visible light and iron(II) catalysis has been established for the synthesis of S&#8208;alkyl phosphorothioates.

The preliminary mechanistic study reveals that the catalytic cycle is accomplished by single&#8208;electron transfer (SET).

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Aminopiperidines via I(III)&#8208;Mediated Olefin Diamination with (Hetero)aryl Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3&#8208;Aminopiperidines are a valuable motif present in small molecule pharmaceuticals and bioactive natural products. Synthesis of these moieties via olefin diamination would be an attractive approach, however significant challenges remain with regards to both regioselectivity and exogenous nucleophile scope. Herein, we report a metal&#8208;free olefin diamination via a &#8220;heterocyclic group transfer&#8220; (HGT) reaction of I(III) N&#8208;HVI reagents, giving rise to 3&#8208;aminopiperidines with high selectivity. The HGT strategy leverages heteroarenes as oxidatively masked amine nucleophiles, giving rise to (hetero)arylonium salt products which are isolated via simple trituration and provide a versatile handle for downstream diversification. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and broad scope with regards to both the heteroarene nucleophile and olefin. This represents only the second 6&#8208;endo selective I(III)&#8208;mediated diamination reaction and the use of (hetero)arene nucleophiles provides practical and synthetic advantages over prior approaches. Mechanistic studies indicate ring opening of an intermediate aziridinium ion is responsible for the 6&#8208;endo selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Intramolecular Hydroacylation of Alkynes by Rhodium Catalysis through Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroacylation of racemic alkynals having a substituent at the &#945;&#8208;position of the carbonyl group is described. This reaction can be applied for the wide range of substrates (22 examples), and mechanistic studies revealed that a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process occurs during the hydroacylation, giving various cyclic ketones in 47&#8211;93% yields with 59:41 to 97:3 er from racemic starting materials.

         <title>Recent Progress in Synthetic Applications of Cyclic Hypervalent Iodine(III) Reagents</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Hypervalent iodine compounds have found broad application in modern organic chemistry as reagents and catalysts. Cyclic hypervalent iodine reagents based on the benziodoxole heterocyclic system have higher stability compared to their acyclic analogues, which makes possible the preparation and safe handling of the reagents with special ligands such as azido, cyano, and trifluoromethyl groups. Numerous iodine&#8208;substituted benziodoxole derivatives have been prepared and utilized as reagents for transfer of the substituent on hypervalent iodine to organic substrate. Reactions of these reagents with organic substrates can be performed under metal&#8208;free conditions, in the presence of transition metal catalysts, or using photocatalysts under photoirradiation conditions. In this review, we focus on the most recent synthetic applications of cyclic hypervalent iodine(III) reagents with the following ligands: N3, NHR, CN, CF3, SCF3, OR, OAc, ONO2, and C(=N2)CO2R. The review covers literature published mainly in the last 5&#8197;years.

Abstract
A new N&#8722;F reagent, N,N&#8242;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium bis(tetrafluoroborate), for iodoarene&#8208;catalyzed fluorination reactions as a terminal oxidant is reported. This reaction is effective for the fluorination of simple alkenes, aromatic alkenes and 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds, giving 1,2&#8208;difluorinated alkanes, geminal difluorinated compounds, 2&#8208;fluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds in good to high yields, respectively. This is a useful fluorination reaction that not only improves the issues of the fluorination reaction using conventional mCPBA as a terminal oxidant but also constructs a simpler catalytic cycle. The present N&#8722;F reagent can be recovered as 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine.

         <title>Synthesis of Fluoroalkylated Pyrrolidines through Neat Reaction of Fluoroalkyl Iodides with N, N&#8208;Diallylamines</title>

Abstract
We presented a cascade transformation of N, N&#8208;diallylamines and fluoroalkyl iodides into various functionalized fluoroalkylated pyrrolidines through a visible light&#8208;induced synthetic process in the solvent&#8208;free conditions. In this reaction system, the substrate N, N&#8208;diallylamine acted both as the base and the electron donor. We further demonstrated the practicality of this protocol by the direct modification of amino acids and pharmaceutical molecules.

         <title>Multifaceted Domino Knoevenagel&#8208;Cyclization Reactions; Four Movements for 2H&#8208;Chromenes and Chromans</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Domino Knoevenagel&#8208;cyclization reactions of 2H&#8208;chromene and chroman derivatives containing o&#8208;formylaryl amine or ether side&#8208;chain was carried out to produce four series of chiral condensed heterocycles representing four novel skeletons and exhibiting antiproliferative activity. The cyclization step occurred with four different mechanisms: a concerted intramolecular hetero Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (IMHDA), a stepwise polar [2+2] cycloaddition, a [1,5]&#8208;hydride shift&#8208;6&#8208;endo cyclization or a multi&#8208;step nitro hetero Diels&#8208;Alder&#8208;ring&#8208;opening&#8208;Cadogan&#8208;type cyclization sequence. The latter reaction provided a new route to hydroxyindoles by an inverse Cadogan&#8208;type cyclization, in which the nitro group is deoxygenated by a nitro IMHDA&#8208;ring&#8208;opening sequence. The cyclization mechanisms and their stereoselectivity were studied by DFT calculations, based on which we proposed a mechanism for the multi&#8208;step cyclization to hydroxyindoles and explained the observed diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Construction of Functionalized Isocoumarin, Flavone, and Isoquinolinedione via a One&#8208;pot Reaction of o&#8208;Quinol Acetate and Soft Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A one&#8208;pot strategy for the synthesis of substituted isocoumarin, flavone, and isoquinolinedione derivatives through a switchable C&#8208;arylation/lactonization or SNAr reaction from a wide range of soft nucleophiles and o&#8208;quinol acetates has been developed. This base&#8208;mediated protocol proceeds under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions and selectively affords various heteroarenes in 13&#8211;98% yields from readily prepared or commercially available 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl and &#945;&#8208;EWG&#8208;substituted carbonyl compounds. The synthetic utility is further demonstrated in the synthesis of potential anti&#8208;HIV and anti&#8208;coronavirus derivatives and COX&#8208;2 inhibitors. In addition, detailed experimental and computational studies are performed to provide an intensive understanding and strong support of the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Short and Scalable Synthesis of Plant&#8208;Based Cholesterol in GMP Grade</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A plant&#8208;based straightforward and short four&#8208;step synthesis of cholesterol starting from commercially available diosgenin is reported. This offers a large&#8208;scale production of highly needed GMP&#8208;grade cholesterol, which is part of the lipid cocktail for the assembly of effective mRNA&#8208;based vaccines against the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. These lipids are formulated into the delivery system of the mRNA fragments by forming Lipid Nano Particles (LNP) that introduce the mRNA into the cells. Cholesterol plays a crucial role because it stabilizes LNP and facilitates endosome escape of the mRNA into the cytosol.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Cyclization of Spirocyclopropanes with Stabilized Phosphorus Ylides: Access to Indane and Azulene Skeletons</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
In this study, regio&#8208; and diastereoselective ring&#8208;opening cyclization of spirocyclopropanes with phosphorus ylides stabilized by electron&#8208;withdrawing groups were developed. The reaction of various cyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione&#8208;2&#8208;spirocyclopropanes with phosphorus ylides bearing alkoxycarbonyl groups proceeded smoothly without any additives to provide the corresponding 6,7&#8208;dihydroindan&#8208;4&#8208;ones in 32&#8211;87% yields. Cycloheptane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione&#8208;2&#8208;spirocyclopropanes were also used in this reaction, producing the corresponding products 1,2,3,6,7,8&#8208;hexahydroazulen&#8208;4&#8208;ones in 52&#8211;67% yields. The resulting [5.6]&#8208; and [5.7]&#8208;fused carbocyclic products were readily converted into highly substituted indanes and azulenes, respectively, by oxidation.

Abstract
Merging the latest advances in the field of gold catalysis and the efficiency of hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP), a gold&#8208;catalyzed orthogonal tandem reaction has been developed to access carbocyclic ketone on naphthalene substrates. The methodology involved a cycloisomerization/nucleophilic addition and a C&#8594;O rearrangement. The HFIP solvent most probably acted as a Lewis&#8208;acid on isochromene derivatives, through hydrogen donor bond activity. A large range of acenaphthylene carbaldehyde has been engaged in this process coupling gold catalysis and Lewis&#8208;acid behavior of HFIP leading to cyclic ketones with a yield ranging from 15 to 91% (27 compounds). The mechanism was investigated, and the reaction most presumably occurred via a classical cyclization process followed by a [Au]&#8208;HFIP interaction for the final rearrangement. The interest of such transformation was demonstrated by performing it on a gram&#8208;scale. Moreover, a post&#8208;functionalization bromination was performed, as well as the isomerization of some functionalized ketones leading to full trans derivatives with a yield ranging from 78 to 90% yields.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Trisubstituted Piperidines via Biocatalytic Transamination and Diastereoselective Enamine or Imine Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Substituted piperidine rings are a common motif in natural products and pharmaceutical drugs. The asymmetric synthesis of piperidines bearing multiple stereocentres remains a challenge, and current approaches often rely on lengthy reaction sequences and &#8216;chiral pool&#8217; strategies. Herein, we report multi&#8208;enzymatic and chemo&#8208;enzymatic methods that allow the preparation of piperidines with three chirality centres in only two steps from achiral diketoester precursors. Stereocontrol is achieved by a highly enantioselective transamination leading to optically pure (ee &gt;99%) enamine or imine intermediates, followed by diastereoselective reduction of these unsaturated N&#8208;heterocycles using either platinum(0)&#8208;catalysed flow hydrogenation or enzymatic imine reduction. In the latter case, coupling of the two biocatalytic reactions in a concurrent one&#8208;pot process is possible, thus reducing the synthetic sequence to a single biotransformation. In total, nine trisubstituted piperidines were prepared in high stereoisomeric purities (dr &#8805;98:2) and isolated yields of up to 73%. Lead&#8208;likeness analysis of five representative products using an open&#8208;source webtool suggests that these compounds possess considerable application potential as building blocks in drug discovery.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Construction of Fluorinated Chiral Alcohols via Sequential Substitution/Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Bromoarylketones and Fluoroalcohols</title>

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot synthesis of fluorinated chiral alcohols from &#945;&#8208;bromoarylketones and fluoroalcohols is described. The fluorinated ketone intermediates were formed from &#945;&#8208;bromoarylketones with fluoroalcohols as nucleophiles and solvents, which were reduced subsequentially by adding a chiral Ru catalyst and a mixture of formic acid and triethyl amines (FA: TEA=1.1:1) as hydrogen donor to give 27 examples of fluorinated chiral alcohols in 60&#8211;93% yields and 85&#8211;98% ee values. Notably, K3PO4 acts as a base in nucleophilic substitution and an additive in reductive step to enhance the reactivity and enantioselectivity, which is crucial for constructing compatible conditions for one&#8208;pot process. This one&#8208;pot process is also applicable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis.
