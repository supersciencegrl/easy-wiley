         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefin&#8208;Phosphines Based Cationic Ruthenium Complexes as Pre&#8208;Catalysts for Dual C&#8208;H Bond Functionalizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin&#8208;phosphines and the corresponding ruthenium complexes were synthesized and structurally characterized. One of the cationic complexes [(BzIM)(NHOP)Ru(p&#8208;cymene)Cl2]I was employed as a catalyst in N&#8208;benzylbenzamides/alkyne coupling reactions. With this catalytic protocol a variety of substituted isoquinolones were synthesized through ortho&#8208;selective double C&#8208;H bond functionalization involving oxidative annulation followed by olefination reactions. All these products were achieved in one&#8208;pot manner without the use of additives.

         <title>Insights into the Enantioselective Au(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions between 2&#8208;Alkynyl Ketones and Naphthols using the TCDC approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The CPAPhosAuCl bifunctional complexes catalyse the enantioselective tandem cycloisomerization&#8208;nucleophilic addition reactions between 2&#8208;alkynylenones and naphthols, where naphthols behave mainly as O&#8208;nucleophiles. The inherent acidity of the catalysts induces then the isomerization of the O&#8208;addition&#8208; into the C&#8208;addition products with concomitant decrease of their enantiomeric excesses. In depth mechanistic studies have provided insights into these processes. Subsequently, the undesired racemization pathways could be suppressed by using substituted naphthols as nucleophiles, which delivered a large series of chiral bicyclic furanes in high enantioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new mode of reactivity of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;sulfonylhydrazones towards alkynes is described: ketone&#8208;derived N&#8208;tosylhydrazones (NTHs) bearing &#945;&#8208;H atoms behave as &lt;i&gt;[NN]&lt;/i&gt; synthons in their reactions with alkoxy alkynyl Fischer carbene complexes (FCCs) and only the two N atoms are incorporated into the newly formed pyrazole ring. The scope of the reaction, leading to 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;N&#8208;alkenyl pyrazoles, proved to be wide regarding both partners; thus, a variety of aryl and primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl substituents are tolerated within the FCC, while aryl alkyl NTHs, symmetric and asymmetric dialkyl NTHs and NTHs derived of cyclic ketones can be also employed. In addition, the reaction can be performed at large scale and applied for late&#8208;stage diversification of natural products. A reasonable reaction mechanism is also proposed, which is supported by deuteration experiments and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Radical Transformations of Propargylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Propargylic alcohols are regarded as a class of readily available and versatile synthons in organic synthesis. Due to their unique bifunctional character, the transformation of propargylic alcohols has been widely utilized as a powerful strategy for the construction of various functionalized frameworks over the past few decades. Recently, the radical transformation of propargylic alcohols has attracted considerable attention in synthetic chemistry. This review summarises recent progress in the radical transformation of propargylic alcohols. Based on the different mechanisms of radical formation underlying these transformations, this review has been divided into four parts: (1) transition&#8208;metal catalyzed radical transformation; (2) photo&#8208;induced radical transformation; (3) electroc&#8208;induced radical transformation; and (4) metal&#8208;free or oxidant&#8208;mediated radical transformation of propargylic alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvated Electrons: Dynamic Reductant in Visible Light Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Open shell species are alluring significant attention owing to their unique physiochemical properties in redox chemistry for activating remarkably stable bonds. Solvated electrons are one of them that have been extensively investigated due to their high reduction potential (Ered=&#8722;2.9&#8197;V vs SHE in CH3CN), diverse substrate activation, and promising applications. If the activating species have a larger redox potential with a longer lifetime, then the broader range of substrates will be activated. Hence, the solvated electron qualifies as a super&#8208;reductant with these qualities. However, due to safety issues, generating solvated electrons by dissolving alkali metals in an ammoniated solvent limits its use towards complicated organic transformations. Instead photochemically generated solvated electron overcome this limitation and is identified as a user&#8208;friendly, sustainable, and much safer alternative approach for producing solvated electrons. In this minireview, we have comprehensively highlighted the recent key methods to generate the solvated electron photochemically, characterization techniques, and its application in organic transformations with selected examples. The minireview provides new opportunities for chemists to understand the conceptual, physical, and mechanistic chemistry principle of this super reductant for exploiting a new photochemical route for the transformations that are difficult to achieve by other means.

         <title>Oxidative Alkenylation of (Hetero)aromatics with Unactivated Alkenes: Control of the Reaction Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Alkenylbenzene skeletons represent one of the most widely occurring structural motifs in pharmaceutical drugs, natural products, and advanced materials. The construction of alkenylbenzenes is promising through the use of a straightforward oxidative alkenylation protocol, particularly from unactivated alkenes. This is significant because unactivated alkenes are inexpensive raw materials that can be obtained in bulk quantities from petrochemical feedstocks and renewable resources. However, controlling the reactivity and regioselectivity of olefination with unbiased olefins remains a significant challenge, necessitating continuous efforts and potentially having a substantial impact on both organic synthesis and the industry. This review aims to provide an overview of the latest advances in regiocontrol strategies for oxidative alkenylation reactions with unactivated alkenes, which can be categorized into three types: 1) ligand&#8208;promoted/accelerated reactions; 2) prefunctionalized olefins&#8208;facilitated reactions; 3) directing group&#8208;induced reactions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkenylbenzene skeletons represent one of the most widely occurring structural motifs in pharmaceutical drugs, natural products, and advanced materials. The construction of alkenylbenzenes is promising through the use of a straightforward oxidative alkenylation protocol, particularly from unactivated alkenes. This is significant because unactivated alkenes are inexpensive raw materials that can be obtained in bulk quantities from petrochemical feedstocks and renewable resources. However, controlling the reactivity and regioselectivity of olefination with unbiased olefins remains a significant challenge, necessitating continuous efforts and potentially having a substantial impact on both organic synthesis and the industry. This review aims to provide an overview of the latest advances in regiocontrol strategies for oxidative alkenylation reactions with unactivated alkenes, which can be categorized into three types: 1) ligand-promoted/accelerated reactions; 2) prefunctionalized olefins-facilitated reactions; 3) directing group-induced reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
The direct diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective Ru(II)&#8208; catalyzed cyclopropanation reaction of alkenes with ((2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoroethyl)sulfinyl)benzene was described. The desired enantioenriched PhSO2CF2&#8208;cyclopropanes were obtained in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities in the presence of a chiral ruthenium complex Ru(II)&#8208;Pheox (17&#8211;94% yields, &gt;20:1 d.r. and 83:17&#8211;98:2 e.r.). The robustness of the approach was showcased and This methodology gave access to chiral 1,2&#8208;trans difluoro&#8208;methylcyclopropanes.

A DBU&#8208;promoted [3+2] cyclization/retro&#8208;Mannich cascade reaction of N&#8208;aminoisoquinolinium and N&#8208;aminoquinolinium derivatives with para&#8208;quinone methides has been established, employing a C=C double bond cleavage. A broad range of N&#8208;aminoquinolinium salts, N&#8208;aminoisoquinolinium salts, and para&#8208;quinone methides are well tolerated, providing the corresponding rearrangement products. Moreover, scaled&#8208;up reactions and diverse derivatizations of the products were also investigated and discussed.

         <title>Electrochemical Hydroxylation of &#945;&#8208;Bromoacetophenones: Access to &#945;&#8208;Hydroxyacetophenones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Herein, a new method has been developed for the synthesis of various &#945;&#8208;hydroxyacetophenones via an electro&#8208;oxidation process. It involves electrocatalytic hydroxylation via debromination of C(sp3)&#8722;Br bond. Here, simultaneous breaking of carbon&#8208;bromine (C&#8722;Br) bond and formation of a new carbon&#8208;oxygen (C&#8722;O) bond has been achieved through electrolysis of H2O using binary mixture of water and DMSO. The protocol features easy performance, oxidant and base&#8208;free mild conditions and short reaction time.

This reaction is tolerant to various structural variations and has allowed us to synthesize a library of diversely substituted silacycles with yields from 28 to 85%. We also studied the fluorescence properties of these compounds which show structural similarities with recognized probes such as Si&#8208;Rhodamine for example.</dc:description>

Compared with previous studies, this protocol employs more readily accessible acids as a radical precursor under the redox&#8208;neutral conditions. Moreover, the reaction exhibits high compatibility with diverse primary, secondary and tertiary acids, especially natural amino acids and drug&#8208;derived acids. Preliminary mechanism investigations reveal that a radical pathway is involved in the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesizing Silyl Arylsulfonyl hydrazones as Silyldiazomethane Precursors and Their Use in Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for synthesizing silyl arylsulfonyl hydrazones as silyldiazomethane precursors has been developed. Although silyldiazomethanes are an important class of diazo compounds, their use in intramolecular cyclization reactions has not been fully explored despite the rich chemistry of diazo compounds, particularly metal carbenoid chemistry. The fundamental challenge underlying the absence of such studies is the lack of a method for synthesizing silyldiazomethanes with functional groups that can react with metal carbenoids. The method reported here provides access to variety of silyl arylsulfonyl hydrazones with functional groups such as ethers, carbamates, and alkynes, which can serve as reaction sites for metal carbenoids. A one&#8208;pot hydrazone formation using unstable formylsilane formed in situ is key to a successful synthesis. The use of 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzenesulfonohydrazide contributed toward achieving broad generality in hydrazone formation. The synthetic potential of this method was demonstrated through the generation of silyldiazomethane and its transformation to several silacycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Regio&#8208; and Enantiocomplementary Synthesis of Chiral Aryloxazolidinones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We described the protein engineering of the halohydrin dehalogenase HheG to enhance its R enantioselectivity for the synthesis of chiral 4&#8208;aryloxazolidinones via &#945;&#8208;regioselective ring&#8208;opening of aryl epoxides with cyanate. Additionally, we achieved the inversion of its regioselectivity and enantioselectivity, resulting in a HheG variant tailored for the synthesis of chiral 5&#8208;aryloxazolidinones via &#946;&#8208;regioselective and S&#8208;enantioselective ring&#8208;opening of aryl epoxides with cyanate. Leveraging these engineered mutants, we developed a biocatalytic platform capable of synthesis of both chiral 4&#8208;aryloxazolidinones (up to 47% yield, 98% ee, and 99% regioselectivity) and chiral 5&#8208;aryloxazolidinones (up to 46% yield, &gt;99% ee, and 98% regioselectivity). Furthermore, a collaborative approach utilizing two regio&#8208; and enantioselective HheG mutants has been demonstrated to enable the simultaneous synthesis of chiral 4&#8208;aryloxazolidinones and chiral 5&#8208;aryloxazolidinones.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing Indenoazulenes via a Gold&#8208;Catalysed Cyclisation of Cycloheptatrienyl&#8208;Substituted 1,5&#8208;Diynes</title>

Abstract
Herein we report that cycloheptatrienyl&#8208;substituted 1,5&#8208;diynes with aromatic backbones undergo a gold&#8208;catalysed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclisation to give 11H&#8208;indeno&#8208;[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes at room temperature. This methodology complements the established range of aromatic structures obtained from gold&#8208;catalysed conversions of differently substituted 1,5&#8208;diynes accessed via highly reactive cationic intermediates. We have demonstrated the scope of the reaction and have assessed the possibility of further functionalisation of the indenoazulene scaffold. Additionally, we have studied the optical and electrochemical properties as well as the frontier molecular orbitals of this structural motif by both spectroscopic and theoretical means.

Abstract
Mg&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition reactions between 2&#8208;aminobenzaldehydes and ynones offered an array of 2&#8208;arylquinoline motifs merged with a CF3&#8208;acyl group. Furthermore, with Mg&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation as the key step, DDD107498, DDD102542, and Hit analogues were assembled. Finally, a computational study of the reaction mechanism was conducted.

Abstract
An exclusive anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamination as well as hydroalkoxylation of allylic alcohols catalyzed by a simple catalyst Y(CH2SiMe3)3(THF)2 has been developed, providing a variety of &#947;&#8208;amino and &#947;&#8208;alkoxy alcohols in good yields under mild conditions. Moreover, this protocol is applied to the synthesis of drug molecules Propipocaine and Proroxan. The rare&#8208;earth metal catalyst features readily available, wide substrate compatability, exclusive anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity, and performs in the absence of a base or an additive.

Abstract
Herein a regioselective indole C4&#8208;alkynylation has been uncovered utilizing an earth&#8208;abundant cobalt(III)&#8208;catalyst. For this process, (bromoethynyl)benzene was used as an alkynylating agent. Also, after screening various amide&#8208;protected chelating groups we found dimethyl&#8208;amide is optimal for the in&#8208;situ generation of cobaltacycle intermediate. The six&#8208;membered cobaltacycle intermediate has been detected through high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry HRMS, which is a key intermediate for this conversion. Further, mechanistic studies were performed such as KIE experiments, and reactions with radical scavengers, and based on the results a plausible mechanism has been proposed. Moreover, to show the application of this methodology, the product has been oxidized to diketone, monoketone, alkene, alkane and further derivatized to a tricycle indole derivative, which is a core structure of many natural products.

         <title>Direct Intramolecular Coupling of Primary/Secondary Alcohols with Secondary Alcohols for Macrocyclic Alkenylation Using Ni&#8208;Zeolite Catalyst Under Continuous&#8208;Flow Conditions</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report the direct intramolecular coupling of primary and secondary alcohols for the selective synthesis of macrocyclic olefins in the presence of Ni&#8208;zeolite catalyst under continuous flow. This reaction proceeds via dehydration of secondary alcohols to alkenes, which subsequently undergo intramolecular dehydrative coupling reaction with a primary alcohol to obtain moderate yields of macrocyclic olefins. This reaction is also effective for the coupling of secondary&#8208;secondary alcohols and alkene&#8208;alcohols to produce diverse macrocyclic olefin products. This unique approach has various advantages including step&#8208;economy, no additives and pre&#8208;functionalization required, inexpensive and reusable catalyst, and exemplification with 23 macrocycles in different ring sizes. The continuous flow macrocyclisation afforded higher productivity and space&#8208;time yield than the batch reaction conditions.

         <title>Aryl Ketone&#8208;Catalyzed Light&#8208;Driven Radical Oxy&#8208;Functionalization of Non&#8208;Acidic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds Enabled by Triple Role of TEMPO</title>

Abstract
A light&#8208;driven radical oxy&#8208;functionalization of non&#8208;acidic aliphatic and benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds was achieved with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) in a single&#8208;step by employing an aryl ketone as a sole catalyst. The transformation was initiated by homolysis of a C(sp3)&#8722;H bond in the starting substance by the photo&#8208;excited aryl ketone. The derived carbon radical was then promptly trapped by TEMPO leading to the formation of the TEMPO&#8208;adduct. The derived TEMPO&#8208;adduct is synthetically versatile as an alcohol equivalent since it can be readily converted to the corresponding ketone by oxidation and to the corresponding alcohol by reduction. The key to realizing the present catalytic reaction relies on the distinctive triple role of TEMPO, which acts as the precursor of the oxygen functionality, the oxidant to regenerate the aryl ketone, and the protective group for the derived TEMPO&#8208;adduct from over&#8208;oxidation.

Abstract
A three&#8208;component phase&#8208;transfer catalytic domino reaction involving cyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione&#8208;derived enaminones, 5&#8208;alkenyl rhodanines, and haloalkanes has been developed. This protocol produces a wide range of 3&#8208;thioquinoline&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones in yields of 52&#8211;81%. The construction of a C&#8722;S bond at the C&#8208;3 position of the quinoline&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione framework expands its structural diversity. Studies into the reaction mechanism revealed that the reaction undergoes a conjugate addition, ammonolysis, elimination, and nucleophilic substitution sequence. The synthetic potential of the reaction was demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale syntheses of representative products. Chloroalkyl chains were installed on the sulfur atoms of most products obtained in this reaction. Diversified product derivatives were obtained by exploiting the favorable leaving nature of the chloride moiety.

         <title>Borylated Cyclopentanes via Atom Transfer Radical [3+2] Annulation</title>

Abstract
An atom transfer radical [3+2] annulation (ATRAn) reaction involving alkenyl boronic esters and homoallylic iodides provides a rapid access to polysubstituted borylated cyclopentanes. A variety of &#945;&#8208;substituted vinylboronic esters are suitable substrates and offer unique opportunities for further modification of the formed 5&#8208;membered ring. For instance, the oxidation of the boronic ester to an alcohol allows the preparation of products that corresponds to an annulation involving the enol form of acetone. Substitution of the iodide by a nucleophile such as lithium methoxide without modifying the boronic ester moiety is also feasible. Finally, by using a (3&#8208;acetoxyprop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;yl)boronic ester, a facile 1,2&#8208;elimination reaction provided a methylenecyclopentane. In this case, the alkenylboronate radical trap acts as an equivalent to allene, a building block so far elusive for preparative radical reactions.

Abstract
Silylzinc reagents are desirable for the synthesis of organosilanes due to their compatibility with functional groups; however, the use of pyrophoric silyllithium and dissolved lithium salts in their production hinders their development. Our solid Me3SiZnI circumvents these limitations, and herein, we demonstrate its significance in the synthesis of aryl and alkyl trimethylsilanes via cross&#8208;coupling of aryl and alkyl bromides. The milder reaction condition tolerates functional groups such as MOM, Boc, Bpin, and aldehydes.

         <title>FeCl3/KI&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Oxidative Cyclization for Switchable Total Synthesis of Luotonin A, B and Derivatives</title>

Abstract
A total synthesis strategy was developed for the synthesis of luotonin A, B and their analogues using synergistic FeCl3/KI&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization. This protocol utilizes cheap and widely available N&#8208;propargyl 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;quinazolinones and arylamines under mild conditions, and it has a wide substrate scope and high atom economy. Different natural products (luotonin A, B and derivatives) can be synthesized via a unique switchable approach. Further transformations from luotonin B to luotonin E and structural modification of natural products demonstrate the potential applications of this method. Moreover, camptothecin can also be modified with the reported protocol to afford the hydroxyl&#8208;substituted product.

&lt;p&gt;A total synthesis strategy was developed for the synthesis of luotonin A, B and their analogues using synergistic FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/KI-catalyzed oxidative cyclization. This protocol utilizes cheap and widely available &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-propargyl 2-methyl-quinazolinones and arylamines under mild conditions, and it has a wide substrate scope and high atom economy. Different natural products (luotonin A, B and derivatives) can be synthesized via a unique switchable approach. Further transformations from luotonin B to luotonin E and structural modification of natural products demonstrate the potential applications of this method. Moreover, camptothecin can also be modified with the reported protocol to afford the hydroxyl-substituted product.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A substrate&#8208;induced synthesis of coumarin&#8208;fused quinolinones is achieved from 4&#8208;(phenylamino)&#8208;2H&#8208;chromen&#8208;2&#8208;ones using N&#8208;alkyl amines as the solvent and a carbon source under air conditions without any catalysts in one pot. This protocol highlights the special roles of 4&#8208;(phenylamino)&#8208;2H&#8208;chromen&#8208;2&#8208;ones which were not only used as reactants but also as an internal oxidant selectively activated N&#8208;&#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond. This reaction features catalyst&#8208;free, broad substrate scopes (N&#8208;alkyl amines 27 examples and quinolinones 24 examples), operationally simple for the one&#8208;step synthesis, and recovery and recycling of the solvent.

         <title>Synthesis of Vinyl and 1,3&#8208;Dienyl Sulfones Enabled by Photochemical Excitation of Halogen&#8208;Bonding Complexes</title>

Abstract
The photochemical catalyst&#8208;free radical&#8208;based synthesis of vinyl and 1,3&#8208;dienyl sulfones is disclosed. Mechanistic investigations support that the transformations rely on a visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted activation of a halogen&#8208;bonding complex, which is formed between an alkenyl (or 1,3&#8208;dienyl) bromide and a sodium sulfinate salt. The reactions exhibit a wide functional group tolerance (compatible with heteroatoms, electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating groups), finding application in the structural modification of biologically relevant molecules. Eventually, a continuous flow protocol was developed to upscale these transformations.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Reaction of 2&#8208;Styrylbenzaldehydes with Indoles in the Synthesis of 1H&#8208;Indenes via 4&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization</title>

Abstract
A cascade reaction between 2&#8208;styrylbenzaldehydes and indoles has been developed for the synthesis of 1H&#8208;indenes. An iodine&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic addition of indoles to an aldehyde group of 2&#8208;styrylbenzaldehydes leads to the formation of carbocation intermediates that undergo 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization to give indenes with a trisubstituted double bond. These indenes are transformed into thermodynamically more stable products with a fully substituted double bond under the reaction conditions. Minor quantities of indolylbenzo[b]carbazoles are also produced as by&#8208;products.

Abstract
We demonstrate the application of chiral magnesium complexes in an asymmetric carbon&#8208;sulfur bond&#8208;forming reaction. Enantioselective and cost&#8208;effective methodology under mild condition for the thia&#8208;Michael addition, utilizing an in&#8197;situ generated chiral dinuclear magnesium&#8208;ProPhenol complex, has been developed. The versatility of this protocol is demonstrated with a broad range of thiol nucleophiles and a wide selection of enones. Enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;ketosulfides are obtained in good to excellent yields and moderate to excellent enantioselectivity. The presented catalytic system exhibits excellent tolerance for structurally different substrates while maintaining high enantioselectivity. This observation aligns with proposed mechanism, wherein the sulfur atom coordinates to the catalyst in close proximity to the reaction center.

Abstract
We report the development of the diastereoselective rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular conjugate addition (Hayashi&#8208;Miyaura reaction) of robust and easily handled 4&#8208;pinacolboronic ester D&#8208;tryptophan derivatives tethering an activated alkene as the acceptor. This methodology provides, access to the functionalized chiral tricyclic core of the ergoline skeleton diastereoselectivity and allows further modification for the cyclization of the fused fourth ring present in several clavine alkaloids.

The front cover picture visualises the colourful beauty of the synthesised compound class of 11H&#8208;indeno&#8208;[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes. In contrast to their colourless structural isomer naphthalene, azulenes are known for exhibiting vibrant colours, resulting from their non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbon nature. Whereas the unsubstituted azulene is blue, the presented indenoazulenes show a range of dark green emerald&#8208;like shades. The golden highlights depict the elegance and eternity of gold in its elemental state, emphasising the crucial role of the metal as a catalyst in the presented methodology. Details can be found in the Research Article by Hashmi and co&#8208;workers (A. V. Mackenroth, A. Ahrens, J. F. Wunsch, R. Berger, F. Rominger, M. Rudolph, A. S. K. Hashmi, Adv. Synth.

Abstract
Elaborated molecular architectures, specifically those bearing one or more carbon stereocenters, stand as an important class of carbocyclic and heterocyclic frameworks because they are frequently occurring core structures in numerous natural products and biologically active pharmaceutical molecules. Over the past few decades, the development of versatile synthetic approaches via cascade cyclization reactions of 1,6&#8208;enynes for the construction of a series of fused and spiro compounds has been the focus of a great deal of research initiatives. These synthesis strategies are peculiarly fascinating in the context of the assembly of a wide array of pharmaceutical molecules, natural products, agrochemicals, and functional materials. In this review, recent developments in the transformations of 1,6&#8208;enynes with diverse coupling reagents are summarized since 2018, which could be divided into five categories: 1) Introduction; 2) Transition metal catalyzed cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes; 3) Metal&#8208;free cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes; 4) Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes; 5) Electrocatalytic cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes.

Abstract
Axially chiral architectures exist widely in natural products, biologically relevant molecules, chiral ligands and catalysts as well as functional materials. Therefore, catalytic asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers has become one of the most fast&#8208;growing fields in the community of chemistry and rapid advances have occurred. Among different methods reported, the organocatalytic atroposelective dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) involving ring manipulations stands out as a cutting&#8208;edge technology to construct axial chirality from the point of atom/step economy. In this DKR strategy, the configurational lability of starting materials originates from chirally&#8208;labile ring structure of cyclic substrates/intermediates or transient ring formation through noncovalent interactions from acyclic substrates. The two atropisomers of starting material are in equilibrium in the reaction medium, ensuring the constant transformation of the less reactive atropisomer into the more reactive one, and then to a single enantiopure product in the presence of an appropriate organocatalyst. This review summarizes recent advancements on this topic, including their scopes, limitations, mechanisms, applications and provides some insights into further developments.

Abstract
The design, inspired by the core&#8208;structure of oxicam has allowed the enantioselective synthesis of benzopyranothiazinone motifs employing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. The NHC&#8208;mediated transformation involves the reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes with suitable substituted benzothiazinone derivatives. This process encompasses the initial formation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acylazoliums from ynals and concurrent generation of enolates from benzothiazinone. The culmination of these reactions results in an efficient annulation, yielding the desired products with reasonable yields and high stereoselectivities. This study underscores the potential of NHC catalysis in the streamlined synthesis of complex heterocyclic structures.

Abstract
Both furan and 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine (1,4&#8208;DHP) are key structural motifs in pharmaceuticals. Herein, we report the synthesis of 4&#8208;(furan&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines from pyridiniums and furfural derivatives under NHC catalysis. This reaction involves the generation of NHC&#8208;bounded trienolates from furfural derivatives and following addition to the C&#8208;4 position of N&#8208;aryl pyridinium salts. This protocol features good yields (41&#8211;99%), and high levels of regioselectivity (&gt;20:1 for all cases).

         <title>Hydroformylation of Alkynyl Sulfides: A Stereo&#8208; and Regioselective Route to &#945;&#8208;Sulfenyl Acroleins</title>

Abstract
The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation of alkynyl sulfides at 40&#8201;&#176;C under 5 bars of syngas is described. The method gives access to &#945;&#8208;sulfenyl acroleins with &#945;/&#946; regioselectivities up to 89/11 and is applicable to alkyl or aryl substituted substrates. It is effective even on more complex substrates, such as cysteine and cholesterol derivatives. To demonstrate the synthetic potential of the obtained products, (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;cyclohexyl&#8208;2&#8208;methylsulfenyl acrolein was selected as an example and its sulfur atom selectively oxidized to the corresponding sulfoxide or sulfone. Acid&#8208;promoted (Z) to (E) isomerization of the double bond occurred during oxidation. The three obtained sulfenyl&#8208;, sulfinyl&#8208;, and sulfonyl&#8208;functionalized acroleins have been then used as dienophiles to access cyclohexene carbaldehydes.

&lt;p&gt;The rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation of alkynyl sulfides at 40&#8201;&#176;C under 5 bars of &lt;i&gt;syngas&lt;/i&gt; is described. The method gives access to &#945;-sulfenyl acroleins with &#945;/&#946; regioselectivities up to 89/11 and is applicable to alkyl or aryl substituted substrates. It is effective even on more complex substrates, such as cysteine and cholesterol derivatives. To demonstrate the synthetic potential of the obtained products, (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-3-cyclohexyl-2-methylsulfenyl acrolein was selected as an example and its sulfur atom selectively oxidized to the corresponding sulfoxide or sulfone. Acid-promoted (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;) to (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;) isomerization of the double bond occurred during oxidation. The three obtained sulfenyl-, sulfinyl-, and sulfonyl-functionalized acroleins have been then used as dienophiles to access cyclohexene carbaldehydes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed norbornene&#8208;mediated regioselective direct C&#8722;H glycosylation of free N&#8722;H pyrrole and electron&#8208;deficient pyrrole derivatives has been developed. The reaction involves the use of a PdII catalyst and norbornene as a transpositional co&#8208;catalyst, in which a pyrrole&#8208; and norbornyl&#8208;fused palladaheterocycle forms as the key intermediate. The 2&#8208;substituted pyrroles, and other 2,3&#8208;disubstituted pyrroles underwent the selective C5 glycosylation. This reaction is compatible with various types of glycosyl chlorides including D&#8208;mannose, L&#8208;rhamnose, D&#8208;mannofuranose, and D&#8208;ribofuranose. The viability of this strategy is showed by gram&#8208;scale, various synthetic transformation and functionalization.

Abstract
Copper&#8208;catalyzed silylarylation of N&#8208;(arylsulfonyl)acrylamides via a tandem silyl radical addition/1,4&#8208;aryl migration/desulfonylation sequence has been developed. This method employs silanes as the precursor of silyl radical and di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide (DTBP) as the initiator. By using this cascade procedure, a series of &#946;&#8208;silyl amide&#8208;pharmaceutical hybrids which contain an &#945;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter were facilely synthesized.

Abstract
Herein, we report a modular photocatalytic platform for the site&#8208;selective pyridination of saturated hydrocarbon compounds employing organic photoredox catalysis to forge new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. The site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H pyridination could couple benzylic/allylic C&#8722;H bonds with pyridylphosphonium salts, which installed directly and regioselectively from C&#8722;H heteroarenes through a radical&#8208;radical cross coupling mechanism. This synthetic methodology could tolerate a variety of functional groups, complex heteroarenes, even late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals selectively.

Abstract
Herein, we describe a copper&#8208;catalyzed sequential C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H annulation of indoles with propargylic alcohols for the synthesis of diversely functionalized hydrobenzo[b]carbazole scaffolds. The reaction involves a Friedel&#8208;Crafts addition, 1,5&#8208;H shift, 6&#960; electrocyclization, and dearomatization&#8208;aromatization cascade. Importantly, this is a report of the use of 2&#8208;(diarylmethyl)indoles as three&#8208;carbon synthons in a (3+3) annulation reaction involving C(sp3)&#8722;H indole functionalization under oxidant&#8208;free conditions.

Abstract
Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular dual annulation reaction of alkyl nitrile&#8208;containing 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones to synthesize polycyclic quinazolinones. This catalytic reaction can construct the core structure of polycyclic quinazolinone alkaloids; therefore, we also apply this reaction as the critical step to access fifteen relevant alkaloids to demonstrate efficacy.

Abstract
When a mixture containing 1&#8208;halo&#8208;1&#8208;alkyne, a dinucleophilic agent, and a base (Cs2CO3 or K3PO4) was heated in DMF, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective nucleophilic addition of the dinucleophilic agent to the acetylenes occurred. This reaction yielded (Z,Z)&#8208;bis(haloalkene), which subsequently underwent Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclization through C&#8722;H bond activation, resulting in the formation of two&#8208;oxygen&#8208; or &#8208;nitrogen&#8208;containing hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds. N&#8208;(5&#8208;Hydroxynaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methanesulfonamide was treated with 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;chloroethyne followed by 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;hexadecyne. After these reactions, Pd&#8208;catalyzed double C&#8722;H cyclization was employed to produce 1H&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;7&#8208;tetradecylbenzofuro[7,6&#8208;g]indole. Notably, this compound transformed into a fan&#8208;shaped structure at 86&#8201;&#176;C and transitioned into a smectic A phase characterized by a layered structure.

         <title>An Electrochemically Driven Oxidative Strecker Reaction via the Unique Hydroxymethyl Radical Intermediate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Alfa&#8208;aminonitriles are versatile and valuable intermediates in pharmaceutical chemistry. Until now, the Strecker reaction has remained the most efficient tool for synthesizing these compounds. Nevertheless, it is only applicable to aldehyde/imine systems and generally needs metal catalysts and external additives. Herein, an electrochemically driven oxidative Strecker reaction strategy was designed and accomplished for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles with alcohol as the alkylation reagent. The strategy is environmentally friendly, scalable, and compatible with a wide range of functional groups, encompassing aromatic primary amines, secondary amines, and even alkylamine. Utilizing the merits of electro&#8208;organic synthesis, it can be readily magnified from milligram to gram scale by simply adjusting the electrochemical parameters. Emphasized, it testified that a unique intermediate CH2*OH well&#8208;established in fuel cells was involved in the reaction.

Abstract
A Cp*Ir&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation of 1&#8208;isoquinolinone and 2&#8208;pyridones with N&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl as a directing group to afford 6&#8208;phenylpyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and 3&#8208;phenylisoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones by using arylsilanes is described in this paper. This method tolerates a series of functional groups, such as halide, trifluoromethyl, C=C double bond and offers a synthetic approach to the core structure of protoberberine alkaloids. Several experiments on mechanism studies were conducted to reveal the possible process of this Cp*Ir&#8208;catalytic cycle.

Abstract
A base&#8208;and&#8208;additive&#8208;free photo&#8208;induced radical&#8208;mediated cascade cyclization reaction of 1,6&#8208;enyne compounds was presented. In this study, C(sp3)&#8722;H hydrocarbons, including various alkanes and ethers, were activated via Fe&#8208;catalyzed photo&#8208;induced conditions, providing a bunch of &#947;&#8208;lactam products via hydrogen atom transfer and radical addition processes. Control experiments indicated that the reaction proceeded through photo&#8208;induced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) process. Gram scale experiment was also completed by using continuous&#8208;flow&#8208;photocatalytic&#8208;device.

Abstract
A phosphine&#8208;mediated cyclization of benzo[c][1,2]dithiol&#8208;3&#8208;ones and amidines is demonstrated herein. Triphenylphosphine was harnessed as the activating reagent to facilitate the ring&#8208;opening of benzo[c][1,2]dithiol&#8208;3&#8208;ones via S&#8722;S bond cleavage. This PPh3&#8208;Promoted cyclization reaction of benzo[c][1,2]dithiol&#8208;3&#8208;ones enabled to forge a diverse array of 1,3&#8208;benzothiazones in decent yields with wide substrate scope under mild conditions.

Abstract
A variety of functionalized 3&#8208;arylazoindoles were prepared in good to excellent yields through an iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H azolation of 2&#8208;substituted indoles with arylhydrazines under mild reaction conditions. The reaction underwent an initial TBN&#8208;mediated nitrosation, 1,5&#8208;hydrogen migration, intramolecular condensation, and 1,5&#8208;hydrogen migration over four steps in one pot. A paracyclophane&#8208;derived 3&#8208;phenylazoindole could be prepared in 25% yield over three steps and some prepared 3&#8208;arylazoindoles showed a different fluorescence emission wavelength and existed obvious pH conditions response. The present method highlights broad substrate scope of easily available starting materials, wide range of functional group compatibility, gram scalable preparations, high atom economy, avoidance of unstable and explosive azolation reagents, and simple purification operations by extraction, washing, and recrystallization without flash column chromatography.

Abstract
We report here a formal insertion of a metal carbene complex in a single carbon&#8208;carbon bond. This behavior occurs with the participation of an &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene complex, generated from benzofused triazapentalenes or, in a one&#8208;pot procedure, from their 1&#8208;propargyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzotriazole precursors, and gold&#8208;catalytically activated ynamides. As the result, 3H&#8208;indole derivatives were obtained, with formation of a quaternary center. A computational analysis carried out on the reaction mechanism indicates that the bulkiness of the gold ligand plays a key role forcing a conformation, which includes aromatic interactions, that favors the approximation of the carbenic carbon to the reactive site. In addition, a negative crossover experiment rules out a cationic arene migration pathway.

         <title>Tetrafluoropyridinyl Thiolate as a Tool for Enabling Photoredox Alkylation of 1,2,4&#8208;Oxadiazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A method for the radical functionalization of 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazoles using alkyl halides as precursors of radicals is described. The reaction efficiency is determined by potassium tetrafluoropyridinyl thiolate additive, which plays dual role. First, the thiolate converts alkyl halides into more reactive fluorinated aryl sulfides, which undergo photoredox activation of the C&#8722;S bond. Second, the thiolate decreases the unproductive loss of alkyl radicals by converting them back to the sulfides.

         <title>Electrochemical Site&#8208;Selective Alkylation of Tropones via Formal C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The first site&#8208;selective electrochemical alkylation of tropones is realized by reacting 2&#8208;acetoxytropones and redox&#8208;active&#8208;esters (RAEs). The electroreductive protocol enables the preparation of mono&#8208; and disubstituted tropones in high yields (up to 71%) under very mild conditions. Dedicated voltammetric measurements served for the identification of 2&#8208;acetoxytropones as a class of valuable trapping agents of nucleophilic radical species and shed light on the whole mechanistic profile. Wide tolerance towards functional groups (27 examples) and application to late&#8208;stage functionalization of a bioactive compound (i.&#8201;e. Colchicine analogue), emphasize the synthetic impact of the present methodology.

         <title>Cascade Cyclization/Amination of para&#8208;Quinone Methides with &#946;&#8208;Ketodinitriles: Synthesis of Polysubstituted Furans</title>

Abstract
A protocol for the synthesis of trisubstituted furans via phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed regioselective cascade cyclization/amination of para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) with &#946;&#8208;ketodinitriles has been disclosed for the first time. Various kinds of p&#8208;QMs and &#946;&#8208;ketodinitriles can effectively produce the desired polysubstituted furan derivatives in 64&#8211;95% yields, demonstrating high atomic economy and their application in the construction of polysubstituted furan heterocycles. Preliminary biological activity assay suggests that these furans have potential anticancer activities.

         <title>Ruppert&#8208;Prakash Reagent (TMSCF3)&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Esterification of Weinreb Amides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A straightforward TMSCF3&#8208;catalyzed conversion of Weinreb amides into esters through the treatment with sodium alkoxides is reported. The procedure documents a genuine selectivity for the esterification of primary alcohols with Weinreb amides featuring diverse substitution pattern. The constitutive N&#8208;methoxy fragment of these acylating agents is responsible for the unique reactivity they display, thus enabling to explore alkoxides as competent nucleophilic elements. The protocol is compatible with the fully transfer of stereochemical information embodied in the starting material, as well as, guarantees the preparation of pharmaceuticals. Mechanistic investigations revealed that under the adopted reaction conditions (NaOR, R primary) TMSCF3 does not release the trifluoromethyl (CF3&#8722;) anion &#8211; as occurs with tertiary alkoxides &#8211; but rather it catalytically activates the amidic bond.

Abstract
We describe the efficient synthesis of novel dehydroxyquinines by arylation of quincorine bromide using Ni&#8208;catalysed cross electrophile coupling. The method demonstrates robust compatibility with (hetero)aryl bromides bearing diverse functional groups. Oxidation at C&#8208;9 of the dehydroxyquinines expediently provided quinine&#8208;inspired pseudo&#8208;natural products (&#8216;quinalogs&#8217;). Investigation of the compound collection against Plasmodium falciparum revealed a new insight into the structure activity relationship of quinine. Analogs bearing specifically functionalised pyridines, in place of the 6&#8208;methoxyquinoline ring of quinine, retained activity at the same order of magnitude, albeit not exceeding the activity of the natural product. This synthetic strategy conveniently enables iteration of the aromatic component of quinine for the first time, and holds promise for the development of effective new antimalarials.

The present work demonstrates conjugate additions with catalysis by a chiral 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;Pd complex (L1&#8208;PdCl2) that exhibit complete regioselectivity with a high degree of enantioselectivity. These reactions afford chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted succinimides having all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters with 40&#8211;99% ee. Importantly, chiral 3,3&#8208;diaryl succinimides could also be obtained in 35&#8211;98% yields and 40&#8211;99% ee. Moreover, the present L1&#8208;PdCl2&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition could be performed on the gram scale and was also used to introduce such stereocenters into bioactive molecules.

Abstract
2&#8208;Exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones are useful synthetic intermediates with a unique indole scaffold. However, their synthesis has not yet been reported owing to their reactivity and instability. In this study, a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed method for generating 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivatives via the 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#8208;selective cyclization of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;amino)phenyl alkynyl ketones with an alkyne terminus was developed. The subsequent pseudo&#8208;dimerization of the generated 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones and their [4+2] cyclization reactions with 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes afforded spiropseudoindoxyl and pyranoindole derivatives, respectively, in 21% to quantitative yields. Density functional theory calculations of the gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization provided insights into the 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig selectivity. Furthermore, the reactive 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one was isolated for the first time based on the results from 1H NMR spectroscopic monitoring. The isolated product was applied to various transformations. Our synthesis method promotes the development of bioactive agents and functional materials with complex cyclic structures.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A range of densely functionalized ullazines have been synthesized by a one&#8208;pot Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed twofold C&#8208;H activation/oxidative annulation of N&#8208;arylpyrroles with alkynes. Electrophilic bromination at 5&#8208; or 5,7&#8208; positions of the EWG&#8208;substituted ullazine core offers an interesting single or double entry for further extended functionalization. Mechanistic considerations suggest two complementary paths, EWG&#8208;assisted and SEAr, for the C&#8208;H activations. All ullazines exhibit strong fluorescence emissions. Ullazines bearing thiophene and triarylamine units at 5&#8208; and 5,7&#8208; positions show a significant bathochromic shift in their emission spectra, attributed to the more extended electronic circuits present.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed difunctionalization of olefins has attracted considerable attention as a method to construct carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;hetero bonds. Herein, the copper&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component radical cross&#8208;coupling of oxime esters, styrenes, and AgSCF3 through a visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted iminyl radical&#8208;mediated carbon&#8208;carbon bond cleavage strategy has been described. Utilizing low&#8208;cost copper salt as both photosensitizers and cross&#8208;couplers, this protocol delivers diverse target products, providing a supplementary approach for cyanoalkylation and trifluoromethylthiolation of drug molecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report an iron&#8208;catalyzed divergent synthesis of alkylated indoles based on precise control of the activation sites on indoles through the selection of catalysts. Using indoles and styrenes as starting materials, 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;alkylated indoles could be prepared selectively and directly for the first time by treating with a catalytic amount of Fe(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and 3&#8208;alkylated indoles were achieved exclusively by adding a catalytic amount of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin as the cocatalyst with Fe(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This simple method was demonstrated with 52 examples with high yields and broad functional group compatibilities.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic, [1,5]&#8208;aryl migrations of propargyl benzyl ethers &#172;&#8211; A stereospecific approach to E&#8208; and Z&#8208;tetrasubstituted olefins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Herein we report the discovery and development of the first example of a cationic [1,5]&#8208;aryl migration reaction, through an unprecedented phenonium ions. This reaction does not require any acid, base, transition metal&#8208;based catalyst or promoter, instead promoted by the water activated NXS reagents. It provides a highly diastereoselective and rapid access to the medicinally and biologically important tetra&#8208;substituted olefins (allyl alcohols). The involvement of an ipso&#8208;carbon, as well as the phenonium ion during this novel, cationic [1,5]&#8208;aryl migration was strongly supported by the isolation of 2&#8208;oxaspiro[5.5]undecane&#8208;9&#8208;ones. 	This methodology is highly tolerable for a wide range of propargyl&#8208;benzyl ethers, resulting in a selective construction of structurally divergent library of mono&#8208;halo&#8208;tricarbon&#8208;substituted alkenes. Synthetic application has also been demonstrated by converting two isomeric&#8208;iodo&#8208;olefins to respective E&#8208; and Z&#8208;isomers of tamoxifen in a stereospecific manner.

         <title>Rhodium(I) Catalyzed Hydroacylation Reactions of Alkenyl Compounds</title>

Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroacylation of unsaturated substrates with aldehydes involving the formyl C(sp2)&#8722;H bond activation provides an expedient and efficient access to the carbonyl compounds such as ketones and esters, which are a class of important scaffolds in natural products and in drug development. Recently, extensive attention has been paid to the hydroacylation reactions of the components containing an alkenyl moiety that can trigger a regioselective transformation in the presence of a transition metal catalyst. In this review, we summarize the constructive endeavors in rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed (formal) hydroacylation reactions from 2018, and the plausible pathway is also dissected to offer some insights into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>A Solely Fe&#8208;Catalyzed Sonogashira&#8208;Type Coupling of non&#8208;Activated Secondary Alkyl Iodides with Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An iron&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling of non&#8208;activated secondary alkyl iodides with terminal alkynes is described. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions in N&#8208;MethylPyrrolidone without auxiliary ligand or co&#8208;catalyst. This procedure allowed the obtention of 28 coupling products. Moreover, slow addition of LiHMDS base allows to achieve up to 89% yields. This method enables the conversion of non&#8208;activated alkyl iodides in a Fe&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling, which was so far not achievable with iron catalysts. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest the implication of a key single electron transfer in the catalytic process.

Abstract
We herein successfully demonstrate the use of chiral isochalcogenoureas as Lewis Base catalysts for a variety of (4+2)&#8208;cycloaddition reactions of allenoates and different Michael acceptors. In all cases the same structural key&#8208;motive, a dihydropyran with a (Z)&#8208;configurated exocyclic double bond could be accessed as the major regio&#8208; and diastereoisomer in an enantioselective manner. Furthermore, these chiral dihydropyrans were successfully engaged in different follow&#8208;up transformations.

This front cover illustrates the palladium&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective amination of chloro(hetero)aryl triflates using alkyl&#8208;pyrazole&#8208;based phosphine ligands. The sea hawk, or osprey, depicted in the picture symbolizes the accuracy of this reaction, much like the bird&#8216;s skill in catching its prey. The alkyl&#8208;pyrazolyl&#8208;phosphine ligand plays a crucial role, demonstrating remarkable selectivity and reactivity towards the C&#8722;Cl bond within chloro(hetero)aryltriflates. This enables the palladium&#8208;catalyzed amination reaction to proceed with broadening substrate scope. Details can be found in the Research Article by Chau Ming So and co&#8208;workers (C. Gu, O.

         <title>Air&#8208;stable bis&#8208;cyclometallated iridium catalysts for ortho&#8208;directed C(sp2)&#8211;H borylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new class of isolable bis&#8208;cyclometallated iridium precatalysts (ImIr) and their use in regioselective ortho&#8208;C&#8211;H borylation of aromatic, heteroaromatic, acrylic, and aliphatic systems. The catalysts consist of two imine ligands and an acetate coordinated to an iridium (III) center. The isolable character of ImIr warrants its compatibility with high&#8208;throughput experimentation, a prerequisite for applications in late&#8208;stage functionalization (LSF) of complex substrates.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report a new class of isolable bis-cyclometallated iridium precatalysts (ImIr) and their use in regioselective ortho-C&#8211;H borylation of aromatic, heteroaromatic, acrylic, and aliphatic systems. The catalysts consist of two imine ligands and an acetate coordinated to an iridium (III) center. The isolable character of ImIr warrants its compatibility with high-throughput experimentation, a prerequisite for applications in late-stage functionalization (LSF) of complex substrates. Initial mechanistic studies point towards an inner-sphere mechanism involving bis-cyclometallated species shedding light on the general mechanistic understanding of ortho-selective C&#8211;H borylations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemical Mitsunobu Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Mitsunobu process performed under neat grinding conditions, using a mixer mill, is reported. It proceeds in the absence of reaction solvent and in short reactions times (10 &#8211; 20 min). A broad substrate scope encompassing primary and secondary alcohols, as well as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon&#8208;centered nucleophiles is demonstrated. Application to the functionalization of a selection of APIs is shown, also. The developed process is amenable to scale up on a planetary ball&#8208;mill, yielding over 2 grams of product. Finally, a representative alcohol is inverted with excellent stereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to 3&#8208;Azetidines via Halogenation of Titanacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azetidines are valuable nitrogenous heterocycles. Herein, we disclose a strategy for the modular assembly of 3&#8208;azetidines and related spirocyclic congeners featuring all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers. This approach leverages titanacyclobutanes generated from ketones or alkenes. Halogenation of these organotitanium species gives rise to functionalized alkyl dihalides that can be subsequently captured by amines to afford azetidine building blocks. This strategy facilitated the synthesis of a small molecule anti&#8208;tuberculosis drug. It also enabled access to carbon&#8208;13 isotopologs of diazaspiro[3.3]heptane fragments that are challenging to prepare by any other means.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Trifluoromethylalkoxylation of Endocyclic Enamides in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A regioselective electrochemical oxytrifluoromethylation of endocyclic enamides is reported. The 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization proceeds under mild conditions and employs the inexpensive bench stable Langlois&#8217; reagent. This multicomponent strategy gives access to a wide range of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;substituted amines by means of various alcohols as nucleophiles in high yields and with good functional group tolerance. In addition, an electrochemically induced C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of enamides has been developed. A continuous flow protocol using a commercial microflow electrochemical reactor was also developed with improved reaction performance and efficiency over traditional batch versions without any supporting electrolyte.

         <title>Photoredox Radical Cascade Cyclization of 2&#8208;Alkynylarylnitriles in Visible Light: Direct Access to 3&#8208;Amino&#8208;1&#8208;indenones</title>

Abstract
A photoinduced direct synthesis of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;indenones via radical cascade cyclization strategy is demonstrated. The methodology involves a domino reaction between 2&#8208;alkynylarylnitrile and N&#8208;aminopyridinium salt and captures the reactivity of in&#8208;situ generated nitrogen&#8208;centered radical (NCR) in visible light. Multiple bond&#8208;forming events including C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C, and C&#8722;O take place sequentially on 2&#8208;alkynylarylnitrile enabling construction of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;indenone core at room temperature in 35&#8211;76% yield. A preliminary biological screening of synthesized compounds is indicative of their potent anti&#8208;cancer property.

Abstract
We report herein an enantioselective [3+3] annulation of indoline&#8208;2&#8208;thiones with yne&#8211;enones by chiral dinuclear zinc catalysts via a Br&#248;nsted base and Lewis acid cooperative activation model. This transformation proceeded through sequential conjugate addition, allenyl ketone formation and intramolecular sulfa&#8208;Michael 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization. A range of enantioenriched tetrahydrothiopyrano[2,3&#8208;b]indole derivatives bearing an exocyclic double bond were obtained in moderate yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 20 : 1 dr, 20:1 Z/E ratio and 95% ee). Late&#8208;stage functionalization, large&#8208;scale experiment and further derivatizations were also explored.

         <title>Ball&#8208;Milling to Access Dinucleoside Polyphosphates and Analogues</title>

Abstract
Dinucleoside 5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;polyphosphates (NpnNs) play essential roles in various biological processes. Access to these high value&#8208;added compounds, while avoiding the many drawbacks of solution phase synthesis, is a challenge that has been overcome thanks to mechanochemistry. A straightforward solid&#8208;state synthesis based on activation of phosphate or pyrophosphate sodium salts to their diimidazolides, followed by coupling with commercially available nucleotides, under air conditions, gave symmetrical NpnNs. The scope ranged from Np3Ns to highly challenging Np6Ns. The methodology has also been implemented using medronic acid and imidodiphosphate to obtain NpnNs analogues, some of which are unprecedented.

Abstract
We described a base&#8208;promoted O&#8208;arylation of N3&#8208;hydroxyl quinazolinones with diaryliodonium salts and sequential BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 and visible light&#8208;controlled [3,3]&#8208; or [1,3]&#8208;rearrangements of quinazolinone N&#8722;O aryl moieties to prepare a variety of 2&#8208;(quinazolin&#8208;4&#8208;yloxy)phenols and atropisomeric 3&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)quinazolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones in 44%&#8208;75% yields and 28%&#8208;70% yields, respectively. Mechanistic studies showed that HBF4 generated in&#8197;situ from BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O and water served as the catalyst in this process and aryloxyquinazolinium salts are vital intermediates promoting the [3,3]&#8208; or [1,3]&#8208;rearrangements. The N&#8722;O aryl moieties of aryloxyquinazolinium salts were found to undergo solely [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement with heating whereas [1,3]&#8208;rearrangement occurred via a radical process under irradiation of visible light. This method highlights the formation of aryloxyquinazolinium salts based on the use of BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 and visible light to prompt [1,3]&#8208;rearrangement generating atropisomeric quinazolinones.

         <title>Organophotocatalytic Carbamoylation of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Carbonates</title>

Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate that carbamoyl radicals generated through an organophotocatalytic protocol from 4&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;dihydropyridines (carbamoyl&#8208;DHPs) can be incorporated into Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) carbonates, affording a range of polyfunctionalized scaffolds with yields ranging from 63&#8211;98%. Reaction monitoring experiments, scale&#8208;up, reuse of the organophotocatalyst, and the hydrogenation of the succinamic ester's alkene moiety was also conducted, in order to showcase the mechanistic features and the robustness of this photochemical protocol.

         <dc:description>








Abstract
A visible light&#8208;mediated strategy for the preparation of aromatic stannanes from aryl halides (mostly aryl bromides) is presented herein. The reaction proceeds under metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions and exhibits a broad substrate scope. The products obtained have been employed in the C&#8722;C bond formation via Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Mechanistic investigation evidenced the key role of both aryl radical and trimethylstannyl radical in Ar&#8722;Sn bond formation.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Oxidation&#8208;Migration of 3&#8208;Propargyl Indoles: Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyls</title>

Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds are synthesized from 3&#8208;propargyl indoles, obtained by direct propargylation of indoles, via a gold&#8208;catalyzed tandem oxidation&#8208;1,2&#8208;indole migration reaction in the presence of pyridine N&#8208;oxides. Fine&#8208;tuning of the catalyst and oxidant enables the reaction of 3&#8208;propargyl indoles bearing different substituents. The order of oxidation and indole migration is determined by the terminal or internal nature of the alkyne moiety. In addition, the process can be coupled with additional reactions, allowing an increase in molecular complexity or the design of more elaborated tandem reactions. In this sense, indole derivatives bearing an alkenyl substituent at the alkyne position evolve through a gold&#8208;catalyzed tandem oxidation&#8208;1,2&#8208;indole migration&#8208;Nazarov cyclization producing &#945;&#8208;indolyl cyclopentenones.

&lt;p&gt;&#945;-Indol-3-yl &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated carbonyl compounds are synthesized from 3-propargyl indoles, obtained by direct propargylation of indoles, via a gold-catalyzed tandem oxidation-1,2-indole migration reaction in the presence of pyridine &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxides. Fine-tuning of the catalyst and oxidant enables the reaction of 3-propargyl indoles bearing different substituents. The order of oxidation and indole migration is determined by the terminal or internal nature of the alkyne moiety. In addition, the process can be coupled with additional reactions, allowing an increase in molecular complexity or the design of more elaborated tandem reactions. In this sense, indole derivatives bearing an alkenyl substituent at the alkyne position evolve through a gold-catalyzed tandem oxidation-1,2-indole migration-Nazarov cyclization producing &#945;-indolyl cyclopentenones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Synthesis of Atropoisomers via Non&#8208;Canonical Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reactions</title>

Abstract
The Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction stands as a powerful synthetic tool for C&#8722;H functionalization of aromatic feedstocks, which is conventionally realized through electrophilic alkylation and acylation. The burgeoning interests in axially chiral compounds across diverse fields have spurred extensive exploration of this classic transformation for catalytic atroposelective synthesis. Consequently, the past decade has witnessed the rapid expansion of various non&#8208;canonical Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions, including electrophilic arylation, alkenylation, halogenation, sulfenylation, and amination of aryl C&#8722;H bonds, thereby delving into new chemical spaces. A range of catalytic atroposelective synthetic methods have been devised for these significant arene C&#8722;H functionalization. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the cutting&#8208;edge catalytic synthesis of atropoisomers through non&#8208;canonical Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions, categorized into three parts based on the type of bond formation on the aromatics: C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formations, C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) bond formations and C(sp2)&#8722;heteroatom bond formations. The richness of electrophiles and the modulation of atroposelectivity by diverse chiral organocatalysts, particularly chiral Br&#248;nsted acids, are elucidated. We anticipate that the repertoire of asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction will continue to flourish and to be demonstrated in not only scientific researches but also industrial organic synthesis.

Abstract
Recently, C&#8208;glycosidic bonds have emerged as pivotal elementary units present in many naturally occurring alkaloids as well as in pharmaceutically active molecules. Because of the stability and great utility of C&#8208;glycosides, synthetic approaches en route to the C&#8722;C bond formation have gradually become a center of attraction in carbohydrate chemistry. Towards these researches, C&#8208;glycosylation with heteroaryl moieties like indole, and tryptophan can remarkably expand the functional and structural evolution, which has great value for medicinal chemists and chemical biologists. The indolyl and tryptophan&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides have unique structures and biological activities that have attracted a number of synthetic studies. Therefore, these motifs have possessed an extensive interest in the direction of efficient synthesis. Herein, this review systematically summarizes the classical approaches to C&#8208;heteroaryl glycosides mainly focusing on indole and tryptophan synthesis. Furthermore, highlighted the recently developed metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization and photoinduced cross&#8208;coupling strategies that aim to control the regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity of the reaction in carbohydrate chemistry. In view of reaction type, mechanism, and status, this review will cover the synthesis of indole and tryptophan C&#8208;heteroaryl glycosides with diverse regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity from four perspectives which include a) conventional approach, b) heterocyclization and C&#8208;glycosylation sequence, c) metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization, and d) photoinduced cross&#8208;coupling. 1.

         <title>Visible Light Induced Photocatalyst&#8208;Free C&#8722;X (X=B, C, O, P,S, Se) Bond Formation of Aryl Halides</title>

Abstract
Aryl halides are one of the most important chemical feedstocks in pharmaceuticals due to its easy accessibility, inexpensiveness, and widely utilized as aryl radical precursors in organic synthetic chemistry. Conventionally, the stoichiometric reagents such as AIBN/n&#8208;Bu3SnH were used for generation of aryl radical from aryl halides, and suffered from requirement of toxic radical initiators, high temperature and thus, the development of simple, mild strategies for the generation of aryl radical from aryl halides are highly desirable. Recently, visible light mediated strategies received considerable attention, allowing the generation of aryl radical from aryl halides under mild reaction conditions. The present review described the recent breakthroughs and advancements in visible light mediated photocatalyst&#8208;free C&#8722;B/C/O/P/Se/S bond formation of aryl halides.

         <title>Recyclable Iridium Catalyst Supported on Porous Organic Polymer for Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Silylation: Synthesis of Ring&#8208;Fused Oxasilacycles</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
The direct conversion of specific C&#8722;H bonds to C&#8722;Si bonds in alkanes or aromatics via catalytic methods has attracted growing research interest. Herein, we report the preparation of a new iridium catalyst supported on a naphthyridine&#8208;based porous organic polymer and its successful application in the dehydrogenative silylation of 2&#8208;arylphenols or alcohol and hydrosilanes to access ring&#8208;fused oxasilacycles. The synthetic method exhibits broad substrate scope and good functional group compatibility while avoiding the use of hydrogen acceptors. In addition, this organic polymer supported iridium catalyst could be easily recovered from the reaction system and reused for at least seven times without apparent deactivation. This research provides new insights for the further design of heterogeneous nanocatalysts and contributes to the synthesis of silicon&#8208;substituted functional molecules.

Abstract
Dihydroquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones, recognized for their bioactive properties, feature a six&#8208;membered structure with nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. A method has been developed for synthesizing enantioenriched 3,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives. This approach utilizes an asymmetric [4+2]&#8208;cyclization process, combining 2&#8208;amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes with azlactones, and is facilitated by a bifunctional squaramide&#8208;based organocatalyst. This process has enabled the creation of chiral 3,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones with complex structures, including chiral tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenters, delivering corresponding products in 26&#8211;95% yield with a diastereomeric ratio of 1.2:1&#8211;19:1 and 52&#8211;97 ee.

Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free dearomative aza&#8208;spirocyclization reaction of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles is established by using molecular iodine under basic conditions. The required substrates were prepared via sequential Fisher indole synthesis and sulfonylation. This dearomatization reaction is amenable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and provides access to various spiroindolenine derivatives from indole sulfonamide precursors.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Ring&#8208;Opening Reactions of 2H&#8208;Indazoles with Alcohols to Obtain Ortho&#8208;alkoxycarbonylated Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy for synthesis of azo&#8208;derived compounds by electrochemical oxidative ring&#8208;opening reactions of 2H&#8208;indazoles with alcohols is reported. The reactions are carried out under galvanostatic electrolysis conditions in an undivided cell without the use of transition metal catalysts. On the basis of cyclic voltam&#172;metry and control experiments, a plausible mechanism for this ring&#8208;opening reaction involving the radical pathway is proposed. Furthermore, various 2H&#8208;indazoles and alcohols are suitable in this system, giving the desired ortho&#8208;alkoxycarbonylated azobenzenes in 9&#8208;84% yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Functionally Rich Spirooctahydroquinoline Oxindoles via Enynamide Cycloisomerisation/[4+2]&#8208;Addition Sequence</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Creating an expedient method for synthesizing biologically significant functionally rich octahydroquinoline is a highly sought&#8208;after yet challenging endeavour. In this report, we document an unprecedented approach to the construction of novel spirooctahydroquinoline oxindole architectures. The reaction proceeds through Pd (II) catalyzed cycloisomerisation and quinine catalyzed [4+2]&#8208;addition sequence to afford the desired adduct in moderate to excellent yield (up to 91%) in a single diastereomer with three contiguous stereocenters including one spirocenter. An overwhelming number of libraries were generated (35 examples) reflecting the synthetic versatility and functional groups/substituents tolerance. Further, the adduct is transformed into medicinally important fluoro&#8208;decahydroepoxyethanoquinoline spirooxindole scaffold with five contiguous stereocenters in excellent yield and selectivity (95% yield and &gt;99:1 dr) through a three steps sequence which signifies the synthetic utility of the developed methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;arylindoles and their fused analogues via intramolecular C&#8208;arylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;Aminobenzyl cyanide was reacted with nitrobenzenesulfonyl chlorides and alkylated under Mitsunobu or Fukuyama conditions. The resulting intermediates were exposed to basic conditions, which triggered a Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement, leading to intramolecular C&#8208;arylation. This reaction was followed by spontaneous cycloaddition, which yielded 2&#8208;aminoindole derivatives. The developed synthetic route represents a simple and metal&#8208;free approach for accessing 1&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;arylindoles. Furthermore, pyrimido[1,2&#8208;a]indoles and dihydrobenzo[6,7][1,3]diazepino[4,5&#8208;b]indoles were synthesized through the use of functionalized alcohols.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Hydrohalogenation of alkynes is one of the fundamental reactions in organic chemistry, as described in textbooks that begins from old time as Reppe&#8217;s chemistry. This method, which directly affords haloalkenes in a single step, is attractive from both industrial and academic viewpoints. Despite the long history of this reaction, novel efficient catalysts and regioselective and/or stereoselective controlled reactions are still a challenging topic.

This review addresses the recent (past decade) advances in this field of organic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Arylations of Ketimines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arylation of ketimines is the most straightforward strategy for the construction of chiral &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines, important structural motifs in natural products and biologically active compounds. This comprehensive review highlights the achievements in the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed and organocatalyzed asymmetric arylations of ketimines from the seminal report on catalytic asymmetric arylation of ketimines in 2010 till November 2023. The review is divided into three chapters: (1) Arylation of diaryl ketimines, (2) Arylation of aryl&#8208;alkyl and aryl&#8208;acyl ketimines, and (3) Arylation of acyl&#8208;alkyl and dialkyl ketimines. Each chapter is further divided into transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reactions (grouped by individual metals) and organocatalyzed reactions. Covered literature includes emphasis on the advantages of the reported methodology, its scope and limitations, and the description of the transition state (where applicable).</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling C7 Methylation and Arylation of the Indolyl Core via P(III)&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Peripheral editing of complex molecules via C&#8722;H functionalization removes the pervasive retrosynthetic bias toward pre&#8208;functionalization and taps into the innate, often subtle, stereoelectronic differences between C&#8722;H linkages. Using this approach, bioactive molecules and residues can be modified without being beholden to lengthy sequences, thus allowing biochemical hypotheses to be interrogated on accelerated timelines. Herein, the C&#8722;H functionalization paradigm is leveraged to tackle C7&#8197;C&#8722;H functionalization of the biologically important tryptophan core. The devised process, which was expanded to indolyl (and related) systems, utilizes an N&#8208;bound unsymmetrical &#8220;designer&#8221; phosphine to direct C&#8722;H functionalization to the desired position while maintaining operational ease of directing group installation/removal. Quantum mechanically calculated steric properties and activation free energies suggest that this phosphine is hindered enough for favoring C&#8722;H functionalization over deactivation pathways but is still easily cleaved by nucleophiles. In addition, the process enables the direct C&#8722;H methylation, cyclopropanation, and arylation of tryptophan to yield unnatural amino acid (UAA) building blocks. As a testament to the versatility of this method, a solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS)&#8208;ready phosphinated tryptophan was incorporated into a pentapeptide and the C&#8722;H functionalization/dephosphination sequence was executed with ease. The utility of &#8220;on&#8208;peptide&#8221; editing was exhibited through the late&#8208;stage functionalization of several pentapeptides with a diverse set of C7 substituents on&#8208; and off&#8208;resin.

         <title>Application of Bertagnini's Salts in a Mechanochemical Approach Toward Aza&#8208;Heterocycles and Reductive Aminations via Imine Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Our research has demonstrated that mechanochemical activation is more effective with solid reagents. We have showcased the practicality of Bertagnini's salts, also called aldehyde&#8208;bisulfite adducts, which are crystalline, simplifying preparation and storage. These salts are stable substitutes for liquid aldehydes and ketones that have been employed in reductive amination, synthesizing aza&#8208;heterocycles and hydrazones within mechanochemistry. The technique&#8216;s effectiveness broadens the substrate scopes, simplifies purification, reduces reaction times, and yields the desired products ranging from 38&#8211;91%. Additionally, the thermal stability of the bisulfite adducts has been confirmed through TGA (Thermogravimetric analysis) analysis.

Abstract
Enantioselective access to polycyclic tetrahydroxanthone compounds was achieved through an organocatalyzed cascade reaction of alkene&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;diketones and alkenyloxindoles, using quinine&#8208;derived squaramide as an efficient catalyst. It afforded a variety of optically active spirooxindole&#8208;based tetrahydroxanthones with 18&#8211;94% yields, &gt;19:1 dr, and 86&#8211;99% ee.

         <title>Development of Cyanopyridazine Derivatives as Photoredox Catalysts and Evaluation of their Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An array of cyanopyridazine derivatives have been developed through a sequence of (3+3) cycloaddition/oxidative aromatization/derivatization steps. Investigation of the physicochemical properties of these compounds shows that four have interesting fluorescence properties and have the potential to be developed into bimodal photoredox catalysts. One has been confirmed to be an photoredox catalyst in the reactions of N&#8208;aryl&#8208; tetrahydroisoquinolines with phosphite, nitromethane, malonitrile and sodium thiocyanate, led to 22%&#8211;95% yields. The catalyst capabilities remain with recyclable using under the reaction conditions.

Abstract
In this work, we reported a method for construction of difluorocyclopropanes through visible light&#8208;promoted [1+2] cycloaddition reaction of aryl diazo esters with gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, encompasses a wide range of substrates (36 examples), exhibits good tolerance to various substituents, and demonstrates a diastereoselectivity of &gt;20:1. Additionally, antifungal activity evaluation revealed that these derivatives exhibited certain activity, the EC50 values for the products towards Botrytis cinerea and Rhizoctonia solani were measured to be 1.51 and 1.36&#8197;&#956;M, respectively, which are significantly lower than those of commercial fungicides Hymexazol and Azoxystrobin. This work not only provides an efficient method for the synthesis of difluorocyclopropanyl derivatives, but reveals their potential applications in fungicide creation.

Abstract
The transmetalation triggered rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation and tandem annulation of 2&#8208;biphenylboronic acids with sulfoxonium ylides or iodonium ylides has been developed. Various products of phenanthrenes were constructed under redox&#8208;neutral conditions in 34&#8211;86% yields. Several mechanism exploration experiments and derivatization reactions were conducted in sequence to gain a deeper understanding of the process and the potential of this transformation. It offers an alternative approach for the synthesis of phenanthrene derivatives.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Production of Vanillin from Capsaicinoids through a Retrosynthetic Enzyme Cascade</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Vanillin is a key organoleptic component in vanilla, one of the most important natural flavors in the industry. The limited supply of natural vanilla, extracted from cured vanilla beans, elevates the commercial value of &#8216;natural&#8217;&#8208;labeled vanillin, producible by microbial conversion of natural precursors such as ferulic acid, eugenol, isoeugenol, lignin, and glucose. However, cellular toxicity and undesirable overoxidation of vanillin remain challenges to the microbial methods. Here, we developed a one&#8208;pot enzymatic conversion of capsaicinoids to vanillin by retracing the biosynthetic pathway found in Capsicum plants. The enzyme cascade consists of the hydrolysis of capsaicinoids by immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB) and the oxidative deamination of the resulting vanillylamine by &#969;&#8208;transaminase from Paracoccus denitrificans (PDTA). Process optimization of individual enzyme reactions was conducted on an analytical scale, enabling&gt;95% reaction yield of vanillin from capsaicinoids in the one&#8208;pot cascade reaction without undesirable accumulation of the oxidation byproduct and the inhibitory reaction intermediate, i.&#8201;e., vanillic acid and vanillylamine, respectively. To verify practical applicability, we performed a preparative&#8208;scale reaction starting with 1.75&#8197;g capsaicinoids and 2.75&#8197;g sodium pyruvate at 10&#8197;mg/mL CALB and 3&#8197;&#956;M PDTA, leading to an 81% reaction yield and a 57% isolation yield. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of one&#8208;pot production of vanillin from capsaicinoids, which might pave the way for cost&#8208;effective and sustainable access to natural&#8208;labeled vanillin from a renewable feedstock readily available from Capsicum fruits.

Abstract
Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed and solvent&#8208;switched [3+2]&#8208;spiroannulation and [4+n] (n=1, 2, 3) annulations of 2&#8208;aryl quinazolinone or 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophthalazine&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones with ynones or alkynyl alcohol or 1,3&#8208;diynes under mild reaction conditions have been analyzed. These reactions take place in the presence of the appropriate solvent and features a redox&#8208;neutral pathway. Ynone serves as an &#8216;atypical one&#8208;carbon unit&#8217; in [4+1] annulation and generates a tetrasubstituted carbon center bearing diverse heterocycles through [3+2] and [4+1] annulation strategies. Post transformations of the synthesized spiro&#8208;products augments the potential of the developed methodology.

         <dc:description>P&#8208;stereogenic benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles is a privileged skeleton due to their outstanding catalytic properties and bioactivities. However, their enantioselective synthesis is still underdeveloped. Here we demonstrate the use of easily accessible racemic H&#8211;P(O) compounds as starting materials and commercial chiral N1, N2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diphenylethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine ligand in combination with Cu(I) catalysts to enable an attractive dynamic kinetic C(sp2)&#8211;P cross&#8208;coupling reaction. This protocol not only exhibits a broad substrate scope but also provides general access to a diverse range of useful P&#8208;stereogenic five&#8208;, six&#8208;, seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered benzo&#8208;fused O, P&#8208; containing heterocycles with good to high yields and enantioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Orthogonal Glycosylation Enabled by Enynal&#8208;Derived Copper Carbenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we present an approach for catalytic orthogonal glycosylation utilizing earth&#8208;abundant copper carbenes. This method operates under mild conditions and employs readily accessible starting materials, including benchtop stable enynal&#8208;derived glycosyl donors, synthesized at the gram scale. The reaction accommodates a variety of glycosyl acceptors, including primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols. The enynal&#8208;derived copper carbenes exhibit remarkable reactivity and selectivity, allowing for the formation of glycosidic linkages with different protecting groups and stereochemical patterns. This approach provides access to both 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208; and &#8208;trans&#8208;glycosidic linkages. The product stereoselectivity is independent of the anomeric configuration of the glycosyl donor, which also has orthogonal reactivity to widely used alkynes and thioglycoside donors. An iterative synthesis of a trisaccharide further demonstrates the application of this orthogonal reactivity.

Abstract
An intermolecular addition reaction involving an unconventional combination of a diarylmethyl anion and an electrophile, which is mediated by the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis, was developed. Diarylmethyl anions having a benzofuran moiety were generated through the rearrangement with the aid of a catalytic amount of phosphazene base P2&#8208;tBu. The resulting carbanion intermediates were trapped by various electrophiles, such as &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, aryl aldehydes, &#945;&#8208;ketoesters, and N&#8208;Boc imines, providing the corresponding diarylalkane derivatives in good yields.

         <title>C&#8722;N Coupling between Aryl Azides and Cyclopropanols by Photoredox/Copper Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A photoredox/copper co&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening cross&#8208;coupling of aryl azides with cyclopropanols has been developed with fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 as the photocatalyst. The reaction involves intermediacy of the anilino radical generated through reduction of the azido group by fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3* and [CuII]&#8208;enabled oxidative ring&#8208;opening of the cyclopropanol. An array of &#946;&#8208;aminoketone compounds were synthesized under redox&#8208;neutral conditions by using this method.

         <title>Recent Progress in Functionalization of the Pyridine Ring through C&#8722;S Bond Formation under Transition Metal Catalyst Free Conditions</title>

Abstract
Pyridines and quinolines substituted with sulfur&#8208;containing functional groups are widely used as drugs, drug candidates, organic materials, N,S&#8208;ligands and others. Traditional synthetic routes to produce these compounds are based on nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions of (pseudo)halopyridines. While effective in many cases, both approaches are limited due to using forcing conditions and expensive, specifically designed catalytic systems. In the last decade, a number of innovative methods for the functionalization of the pyridine ring via the formation of a C&#8722;S bond have been developed. Most of these methods proceed through the direct or indirect C&#8722;H functionalization of unfunctionalized pyridines, thus avoiding the use of oftentimes not readily available halopyridines as the starting materials. Deoxygenative C&#8722;H functionalization of pyridine&#8208;N&#8208;oxides and deaminative transformation of aminopyridines have been also employed for the introduction of diverse organosulfur functionality into the pyridine ring. All these processes can be easily performed under mild conditions, typically affording value pyridines and quinolines in good to high yields. Usually being highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective, these methods allow the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules including drugs and natural products. In this Review, we summarize the most recent synthetic methods for functionalization of pyridines and fused pyridines with sulfur&#8208;containing functional groups reported mostly since 2018. For a better understanding of the processes, the mechanisms of the described reactions are briefly discussed.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;Quinolones based on Visible Light&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation of Diazo compounds</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a photocatalytic method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;quinolones under mild conditions by employing &#945;&#8208;diazo acetamide as substrates. The use of Eosin Y as a photocatalyst allows an economical and environmentally benign synthetic method. The process involves the generation of radicals from diazo compounds promoted by a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism. The method demonstrates a broad substrate scope to provide various aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;quinolones. To support the proposed mechanism, a series of mechanistic experiments were conducted.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Free NNN&#8208;Manganese(II) Catalyzed C&#8208;alkylation of Methyl N&#8208;Heteroarenes via Borrowing Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Mn(II)&#8208;catalyzed alkylations of methyl N&#8208;heteroarenes was reported via borrowing hydrogen strategy with alcohols as the alkylating reagent. The developed geometry&#8208;constrained benzimidazole&#8208;iminopyridyl ligand played a key role in promoting the transformation and stablizing the metal center. A wide range of alcohols (aromatic, heteroaromatic and aliphatic) and methyl N&#8208;Heteroarenes could be able to apply in the current catalytic system, with TON up to 7400.

         <title>Tandem Hydrogen&#8208;Borrowing Dehydrogenative Coupling and Hydrodefluorination</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Dehydrogenative coupling (DC) is an attractive approach to constructing new C&#8722;N bonds using alcohols as electrophiles. In &#8216;hydrogen&#8208;borrowing&#8217; variants of DC, the H2 liberated can be used to re&#8208;hydrogenate unsaturated intermediates to produce saturated products. Here, we show how so&#8208;generated H2 can also be used to replace fluorine atoms with hydrogens in CF3 groups in a tandem dehydrogenative coupling/hydrodefluorination process.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Enabled Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Manganese (Mn) is the third most abundant transition metal on Earth and is known for its exceptional biocompatibility. The development of novel catalytic mode for Mn is of great significance to advancing organic synthesis. In this study, the first manganese (Mn)&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of alkynes is achieved with the aid of visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis. Photoredox catalysis is proposed to promote the transformation by in&#8197;situ reduction of high&#8208;valent Mn(II) complex to Mn(0) species, thereby initiating the reaction. Additionally, a photooxidation&#8208;induced reductive ellimination step is also suggested. This system is further distinguished by its notable tolerance towards both terminal and internal alkynes as counterparts of diynes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manganese (Mn) is the third most abundant transition metal on Earth and is known for its exceptional biocompatibility. The development of novel catalytic mode for Mn is of great significance to advancing organic synthesis. In this study, the first manganese (Mn)-catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of alkynes is achieved with the aid of visible-light photoredox catalysis. Photoredox catalysis is proposed to promote the transformation by in&#8197;situ reduction of high-valent Mn(II) complex to Mn(0) species, thereby initiating the reaction. Additionally, a photooxidation-induced reductive ellimination step is also suggested. This system is further distinguished by its notable tolerance towards both terminal and internal alkynes as counterparts of diynes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Due to amine derivatives widely existing in numerous clinical medicines and bioactive compounds, their synthesis has received considerable attention over the past few decades. Traditional methods for the synthesis of amine derivatives largely relied on the reduction of nitroarenes, amides, hydrazines, nitriles, and azides. Recently, the discovery of 2&#8208;azaallyl anions as super&#8208;electron&#8208;donors (SEDs) has opened up new possibilities for the construction of diverse carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds through radical coupling strategies. This breakthrough highlights the potential of generating 2&#8208;azaallyl radicals as versatile intermediates in organic synthesis. Then, hydrolysis of the coupling product can easily separate the corresponding amine derivatives. Thus, tremendous attention has been paid to the C&#8722;H functionalization of ketimines as an alternative strategy for the synthesis of amine derivatives. Herein, we comprehensively summarize the recent progress in radical coupling strategies enabled by 2&#8208;azaallyl anions as SEDs. Their proposed mechanistic pathways, advantages, and limitations are also discussed in detail. 1. Introduction 2. C&#8722;C Bond Formation 2.1. Vinylation of Ketimines 2.2. Arylation of Ketimines 2.3. Alkylation of Ketimines 2.3.1. Methylation of Ketimines 2.3.2. Other Alkylation of Ketimines 3. C&#8722;X Bond Formation 3.1. C&#8722;P and C&#8722;S Bonds Formation 3.2.

Abstract
A tert&#8208;butyl nitrite (TBN) promoted visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced one&#8208;pot C&#8722;N cross coupling reaction of 3&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles with benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine was explored. Simultaneously, the indoline motif of 3&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles as well as 3&#8208;ylidene oxindoles are regioselectively nitrated at the C&#8208;6 position by in&#8208;situ formed NO2 radical. (E)&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;(aryl)&#8208;2&#8208;oxoethylidene)oxindole and (E)&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene oxindole produce distinct nitrated diastereomeric coupling products, a phenomenon influenced by the steric bulk of the functional group. The experimental findings suggest the potential involvement of a radical pathway in this reaction.

Abstract
Herein, we report a photochemical synthesis of 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl containing quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones through consecutive photoredox catalysed reactions. A wide range of C3&#8208;modified quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones were obtained in 53&#8211;91% yields by this approach. Mechanistic studies including radical trapping, EPR studies, D&#8208;labelling investigations, and many other control experiments well explained the proposed consecutive photoredox mechanism.

Abstract
Herein, we report a chemo&#8208; and regioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed redox C7&#8208;spiroannulation reaction of N&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole indolines with maleimides, resulting in a series of N&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole indoline fused azaspirocycles in up to 92% yield. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by the synthesis of highly functionalized nitrogen&#8208;containing spiropolycyclic skeletons. The annulation reaction could also be performed with maleic esters and acrylates. The products were purified by simple filtration. The Rh catalyst can be recycled, and the reaction could be performed at gram&#8208;scale using 0.5&#8197;mol% of catalyst, which makes this protocol potentially applicable in industry. Moreover, the efficient post&#8208;modification of pharmaceutical molecules demonstrates its practicability.

Abstract
An acylative fluorination of two different alkenes is developed, assisted by the interaction of silver catalyst and Selectflour. Various &#945;&#8208;ketonic acids can be decarboxylated to form acyl radicals at 35&#8201;&#176;C, sequentially add to the electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208; rich alkenes to provide the benzyl fluorinated compounds containing diversified functional groups.

The active aryne species can be generated from o&#8208;diiodoarenes and NaH in THF at room temperature, then lead to the arylations of a wide range of aryl thiols and thioureas. Different from transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, no disubstituted byproduct is formed in our protocol. The o&#8208;iodoaryl thioether products are intermediates that could be transformed into pharmaceutically interesting molecules.

&lt;p&gt;Herein we report a method for the synthesis of thioethers by forging C(aryl)-S bond via an aryne mechanism. The active aryne species can be generated from &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-diiodoarenes and NaH in THF at room temperature, then lead to the arylations of a wide range of aryl thiols and thioureas. Different from transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions, no disubstituted byproduct is formed in our protocol. The &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-iodoaryl thioether products are intermediates that could be transformed into pharmaceutically interesting molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>N&#8208;Heterocyclic compounds, in particular, quinolines and quinazolines are frequently used in medicinal chemistry. Therefore, the direct and clean synthesis of these valuable scaffolds has been a great interest for many years. 2&#8208;Aminobenzyl alcohols as an alternative reactant instead of unstable and expensive 2&#8208;aminobenzaldehydes can be used in the construction of N&#8208;fused heterocycles including quinolines, quinazolines, oxazines, thiazines, selenazines, imidazoles, diazepines, etc. In this review article, we have discussed recent developments in the use of 2&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohols in the synthesis of diverse heterocycles</dc:description>
