         <title>Radical Carbocyclization Intercepted Reductive C&#8208;C Bond Formation Between 1,n&#8208;Enynes or Dienes and Electron&#8208;Poor Olefins/Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal hydride catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) reaction of 1,6&#8208;enyne and electron&#8208;poor alkene progresses through a radical cascade, involving ene&#8208;yne cyclization and exocyclic C&#8208;C bond formation superseding the direct reductive olefin cross&#8208;coupling; which is realized in the current study. The generality of this reaction manifold is demonstrated with a range of functionalized 1,6&#8208;enyne and dienes and involving structurally distinct electron&#8208;poor olefins and alkynes as partners. Current work unveils a merger of MHAT&#8208;based olefin&#8208;hydro functionalization with radical ene&#8208;one cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Mediated Carbamoyl Amination of Alkylidenecyclopropane&#8208;Tethered Carbamoyl Chlorides: Synthesis of Functionalized 2&#8208;Quinolones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transition metal catalyzed cyclization of alkene&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chloride has now emerged as a vital tool to construct oxindoles bearing all carbon quaternary centers. However, most of these reactions proceed via carbometalation&#8208;initiated 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization followed by nucleophilic trapping of the resulting &#963; alkyl&#8208;metal species to achieve diverse functionalized oxindoles. The 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig type cyclization of alkene&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chloride has been rarely reported. Herein, a zinc&#8208;mediated carbamoyl amination of alkylidenecyclopropane&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides with anilines for the synthesis of functionalized 2&#8208;quinolones was developed. A range of different substituted 2&#8208;quinolones were prepared in 65&#8208;89% yields from alkylidenecyclopropane&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides and aniline derivatives using Zn/TMSCl system.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct C&#8211;C Bond Cleavage of CH3CN as a Single&#8208;Carbon Synthon&#65306;Synthesis of Pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxalines via Electrochemical Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A direct electrochemical redox reaction involving radical cross&#8208;coupling cyclization for the synthesis of pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxaline derivatives from 1&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrroles and CH3CN has been developed, which includes the functionalization of C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds as well as the construction of C&#8208;C and C&#8208;N bonds. Notably, the control and deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments suggest that CH3CN in this reaction acts as both a carbon source via C&#8208;C cleavage and solvent. The reaction features metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions, and various substituted pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxaline derivatives were obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>New Synthetic Approaches for the Construction of Enantioenriched Molecules Bearing Quaternary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optically active molecule architectures stand as an important class of organic compounds and occupy a key role in academic and industrial communities. Particularly, the molecules bearing quaternary carbon are of vital importance because of its favorable conformation and valuable three&#8208;dimensional molecules, which frequently play a key role in a broad spectrum of functional materials, pharmaceutical relevant natural molecules, and agrochemicals. Over the past few decades, a large amount of synthetic strategies for the enantioselective construction of compounds with chiral quaternary carbon centers have been the focus of a number of research initiatives. In this review, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art toward the synthesis of enantioenriched molecules bearing quaternary stereocenters are summarized, which could be segmented into four categories: 1) Construction of optically active quaternary carbon centers by addition to prochiral sp2 carbon; 2) Construction of optically active all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via substitution at non&#8208;chiral tetra&#8208;substituted carbon; 3) Construction of optically active all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via kinetic resolution; 4) Construction of optically active all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via desymmetrization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Formate Salts: The Rediscovery of Their Radical Reaction under Light Irradiation Opens New Avenues in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formates are abundantly available and inexpensive commodity chemical, widely used in laboratory and industrial organic synthesis. Formates are promising hydrogen carrier and green C1 source, and have also been a subject of research as SET re&#8208;ductants in recent years. Compared to the toxic and flammable gas carbon monoxide, which also serves as a C1 source, for&#8208;mates are easier to handle, store, and transport, and are more environmentally friendly. Therefore, in recent studies of radical reactions, formate is not only as an ideal source of green carbonyl, 	which is of great significance to synthesize carboxyl compounds with various structures, but also as a SET reductant for editing organic molecules either in scientific research or industrial production. The activation and conversion of formate, as a source of C1 or a SET reductant, is a very challenging and hot research field in organic synthesis.

         <dc:description>The replacement of benzene rings with saturated bioisosteric counterparts is a key priority in drug discovery programs, and disubstituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes have been recognized as flexible molecular scaffolds that could act as &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;substituted benzene bioisosteres. In this study, we outline the synthesis of a wide range of 2&#8208;substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexan&#8208;1&#8208;ols, which have the potential to emulate &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenolic derivatives, via SmI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;mediated reductive cyclization reactions. The synthetic utility of this methodology was exemplified by the preparation of several saturated analogs of pharmaceutically relevant compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Shaking Up the Friedl&#228;nder Reaction: Rapid, Scalable Mechanochemical Synthesis of Polyaryl&#8208;substituted Quinolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quinolines are a ubiquitous heterocyclic aromatic scaffold, which can be found in many natural and synthetic products. They are highly valued for their pharmacological and electrochemical properties, encouraging the discovery of new routes for quinoline synthesis and diversification. Polyaryl&#8208;substituted quinolines have recently surged as useful substrates for a wide variety of applications, yet their synthetic routes remain difficult and inefficient. Herein, we report a rapid and novel mechanochemical Friedl&#228;nder synthesis of polyaryl&#8208;substituted quinolines under basic conditions using ball milling. Optimized reaction conditions result in moderate to excellent yields ranging from 69% to &gt;95% and demonstrates broad functional group tolerance at 1 hour reaction times. We further demonstrate a new route for the synthesis of photocatalyst DPQN2,4&#8208;di&#8208;OMe and photo&#8208;ligand PPQN2,4&#8208;di&#8208;OMe as well as OLED donor&#8208;acceptor pCzPPQ, electron transport material oligoquinoline TQB and organic semiconductor DPA. A gram&#8208;scale reaction was also achieved using Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM), providing an isolated yield of 87% after a simple recrystallization in ethanol.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Quinolines are a ubiquitous heterocyclic aromatic scaffold, which can be found in many natural and synthetic products. They are highly valued for their pharmacological and electrochemical properties, encouraging the discovery of new routes for quinoline synthesis and diversification. Polyaryl-substituted quinolines have recently surged as useful substrates for a wide variety of applications, yet their synthetic routes remain difficult and inefficient. Herein, we report a rapid and novel mechanochemical Friedl&#228;nder synthesis of polyaryl-substituted quinolines under basic conditions using ball milling. Optimized reaction conditions result in moderate to excellent yields ranging from 69% to &amp;gt;95% and demonstrates broad functional group tolerance at 1 hour reaction times. We further demonstrate a new route for the synthesis of photocatalyst DPQN2,4-di-OMe and photo-ligand PPQN2,4-di-OMe as well as OLED donor-acceptor pCzPPQ, electron transport material oligoquinoline TQB and organic semiconductor DPA. A gram-scale reaction was also achieved using Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM), providing an isolated yield of 87% after a simple recrystallization in ethanol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Ladderanes by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclodimerization of Allenynes: Scope and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a Ni&#8208;catalyzed cyclodimerization of 1,6&#8208;allenyenes which affords pentacyclic derivatives containing a [3]&#8208;ladderane. Six new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds are formed in a single operation which is fully atom&#8208;economical. The reaction proceeds with an inexpensive catalyst and shows a broad scope in the alkyne, the allene and the tethering group. A computational and experimental study on the reaction mechanism suggests that this process proceeds by oxidative cyclometallation of the allenyne coordinated to Ni(0) followed by reductive elimination leading to cyclobutenes. Then, two of these molecules are coupled following a related cyclometallation&#8208;reductive elimination sequence, the latter being the rate&#8208;limiting step.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium Catalysts Based on Phenyl Substituted Cp Ligands for Indole Synthesis via Oxidative Coupling of Acetanilides and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling of acetanilides and alkynes via C&#8208;H activation is the most powerful synthetic tool for producing the indole motif from commercially available precursors. However, this reaction usually requires large catalyst loadings (5 mol% of rhodium). In this study, a 1,2&#8208;diphenylcyclopentadienyl ligand&#8208;based catalyst was developed that works well at 1 mol% loading of rhodium. DFT calculations of the C&#8208;H activation step provided insight into its high catalytic activity. The catalyst efficiency was also demonstrated in the synthesis of naturally occurring isocoumarins, such as polygonolide, tubakialactone B and penicimarine F. The developed catalytic protocols tolerate a wide range of functional groups, for example, halide, nitro, hydroxy, and alkoxy.</dc:description>

         <title>Contrasting Facial Selectivity of a Squaramide&#8208;Tagged Proline in the Asymmetric Michael Addition of Ketones to Maleimides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A squaramide moiety was introduced at the C&#8208;4 position of proline to afford an organocatalyst that served as a stereocontrol element to promote the asymmetric Michael addition of cyclic ketones to maleimides. A variety of chiral succinimides were obtained by the conjugate addition in 84&#8208;98% yield accompanied by 58&#8208;96% enantioselectivity. The results also include an interesting contrast in the facial selectivity observed with cyclohexanones and cycloheptanones, whereas an asymmetric desymmetrization of 4&#8208;alkyl cyclohexanones was also achieved using the transformation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Trimethyl phosphite promotes the synthesis 2,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted 2H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. The protocol developed affords a two&#8208;step method towards triazoles from available reagents. 3,4&#8208;Disubstituted isoxazolones are initially coupled with diazonium tetrafluoroborates. The subsequent reaction is triggered by a single electron transfer from the phosphite to the diazenylisoxazolone under heating or blue LED irradiation at room temperature. The radical anion cascade proceeds via the &#8220;ring opening/decarboxylation/cyclization&#8221; sequence. The synthesized triazoles show promising fluorescence in the region from 340 nm to 450 nm with a quantum yield up to 81.6%. The emission energy depends slightly on the substituent nature at the triazole carbon atoms.  If an electron&#8208;donor group is introduced into the N2 substituent of the triazole ring, it results in a bathochromic shift of the luminescence energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Photocatalytic Pathways for Reductive Dearomatizations of N&#8208;Arylformylindoles by a Visible&#8208;light Triplet Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light triplet photocatalyst 5&#8208;acetyl&#8208;2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;benzoic acid methyl ester (AcBSH) was developed through introducing acetyl into benzenethiolate to improve the efficiency of intersystem crossing (ISC) and using o&#8208;methoxyformyl to increase the molar extinction coefficient. In the photocatalytic system of AcBSH, the reductive dearomatization of N&#8208;arylformylindoles is achieved to afford the desired indolines in moderate to excellent yields, including both indoles without (1) and with 2&#8208;substituent (2). The 2&#8208;substituent is a steric hindrance for the conjugation between benzoyl and indole moiety, and makes indole 2 and indole 1 exhibit different reduction potentials (Ered) and different triplet energy levels (&#916;ET). Thereby, two kinds of substrates undergo primarily two photocatalytic pathways: i) successive SET/protonation pathway, which merging photosensitization via triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (EnT) and photoinduced SET for substrates 1, and ii) single electron transfer (SET) from the triplet photocatalyst and a concerted hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process for substrates 2.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We present a diastereoselective Au/Pd relay catalytic tandem cyclization reaction to produce dearomatic 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;7&#8208;azaspiro[4.5]decane derivatives under mild conditions. This process involves generating furan&#8208;derived azadiene from readily available enynamide, followed by a [2 + 4] cycloaddition with Pd&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl dipole decarboxylated from vinyl benzoxazinanone. Our method efficiently constructs the spiro[4.5]decane skeleton, achieving yields ranging from 31&#8208;97% and diastereoselectivities from 6:1 dr to &gt;20:1 dr across 34 examples. This research introduces new cycloaddition sites for azadienes as 1,2&#8208;dipoles and offers a reliable approach for constructing oxa&#8208;azaspiro[4.5]decane frameworks.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;9&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl) adenine ((&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;HPA) is an important intermediate for the synthesis of tenofovir and its prodrugs. Herein, structure&#8208;guided rational design of short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase LfSDR1 was adopted to improve the catalytic performance for enantioselective synthesis of (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;HPA at high substrate loading. The crystal structures of LfSDR1 in its apo form as well as in complex with NADPH were solved, which were used for mutagenesis studies and illustration mechanism. Three residues (G92, E141 and V186) were identified as hotspots by structural analysis, and variants V186A/G92V and V186A/G92V/E141L with remarkably improved activity were obtained. By molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of WT and variants, G92V plays a key role in enzyme&#8208;substrate interaction in the binding pocket. Whole cells expressing the mutant LfSDR1&#8208;V186A/G92V and glucose dehydrogenase BsGDH from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; were used as the catalyst, and up to 200 g L&#8208;1 substrate without cosolvent was completely converted to (R)&#8208;HPA with 99.9% ee and a high space&#8208;time yield (STY) of 800 g L&#8208;1 day&#8208;1. This study improves the understanding of the catalytic mechanism of LfSDR and provides a potential biocatalytic strategy for industrial synthesis of (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;HPA.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Formal Addition of Aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds to Alkenes via Phenyl Radical Involved Intermolecular HAT</title>

Abstract
A copper catalyzed aerobic formal addition of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds to alkenes via a phenyl radical mediated intermolecular HAT process is reported herein, in which the phenylhydrazine not only acts as a HAT reagent precursor, but also as a hydrogen atom donor. This reaction affords an alternative method for the direct formal addition of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds to alkenes utilizing air as the radical initiator without additional reductants at ambient temperature. A variety of alkanes and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes are successfully incorporated, furnishing a series of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H formal addition products in 20&#8211;93% yield. Preliminary mechanistic studies show that the 2&#8208;tetrahydrofuranyl and phenyl radical are formed in this reaction.

Abstract
With triethylamine as a synthon, an alternative method for the synthesis of 3&#8208;formyl imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines has been accomplished from aldehydes, and 2&#8208;aminopyridines. The reaction proceeded via iodine&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N bond cleavage of triethylamine, generation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde in&#8197;situ, and oxidative cyclization with air as the oxygen source. This protocol may facilitate the synthesis of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives and provide a reference for the usage of triethylamine as a synthon.

Abstract
It remains a challenge to achieve regioselectivity and stereoselectivity in the synthesis of dihydropyranone derivatives. Herein, an Ir/Pd&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative allylic (amino)ketalization was disclosed to prepare dihydropyranone derivatives in regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities under mild conditions, resulting in O&#8208; and N&#8208;allylative products. It provided a strategy for the post&#8208;modifications of dihydropyranone derivatives.

Abstract
The oxaspiro&#8208;phthalides ([n,5]&#8208;oxaspirobenzalactones) bearing a phthalide spirofused to a cyclic&#8208;ether of various sizes are frameworks found in bioactive natural products. The discovery and development of an alkynyl&#8208;Prins cyclization based, strategy for the construction of structurally interesting, medicinally useful [5,5]&#8208;[6,5]&#8208;, and [7,5]&#8208;oxaspirophthalides is reported in this manuscript. Our strategy represents a report on the construction of oxaspiro&#8208;phthalides using the alkynyl&#8208;Prins cyclization. This approach exhibits broad substrate scope with respect to carbonyl compounds and 2&#8208;(alkynol)benzoates, with yields ranging between 43&#8211;98%. Isolation of intermediate, and further conversion of it to the end&#8208;product supported the proposed mechanistic pathway.

         <dc:description>
The front cover picture, provided by Singh, Park, Kim, and co&#8208;workers, illustrates the synthetic method for the vicarious&#8208;type nucleophilic amination of azine N&#8208;oxides and cyclic iminoamides using iminyl anions, readily generated from organic azides under basic conditions. The formation of iminyl anions and site&#8208;selective nucleophilic aromatic substitution in this process were supported by a series of mechanistic investigations including DFT calculations. The utility of C2&#8208;aminated products was highlighted by the photocatalytic reduction of a N&#8208;oxide group and the formation of a five&#8208;membered iridacycle. More details can be found in Update by Singh, Park, Kim, and co&#8208;workers (J. Min, S. Min, E. Chung, K. Moon, H. S. Kim, T. Jeong, A. Rakshit, P. Singh, J. S. Park, I. S. Kim, Adv. Synth.

         <dc:description>The combination of a gold(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complex and an ene&#8208;reductase (ERED) has made possible the synthesis of enantiopure &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones in a one&#8208;pot concurrent approach. The protocol consists of the Meyer&#8208;Schuster rearrangement of racemic propargylic tertiary alcohols using [1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene]&#8208;[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)&#8208;imide]gold(I) (IPrAuNTf2), followed by asymmetric alkene reduction of the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone intermediate using the Zymomonas mobilis ERED (NCR&#8208;ERED). The chemoenzymatic cascade was optimised with a model substrate, where E/Z&#8208;isomers both generated the (R)&#8208;ketone, which was rationalised using in silico molecular docking experiments. The cascade was then applied towards the production of a series of (R)&#8208;4&#8208;substituted&#8208;alkan&#8208;2&#8208;ones in enantiopure form in a straightforward manner.</dc:description>

Abstract
A convenient cyano source for the nucleophilic 1,4&#8208;addition to enones and 1,2&#8208;addition to imines has been developed, by generating the cyano unit in&#8197;situ. via the TCT&#8208;assisted dehydration of formamide. This protocol distinguishes itself by transition&#8208;metal/ligand free conditions, compatibility with 1,4&#8208;/1,2&#8208;addition, readily available substrates and versatile synthetic utilities of the cyanated products.

         <title>Electrochemical &#945;&#8208;Functionalization of N&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Activated Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Numerous appropriately substituted pyridyl or phenyl groups serve as a particularly advantageous activation motif for the electrochemical oxidation of amines. Such groups enable a general, mild method for the electrochemical &#945;&#8208;functionalization of tertiary amines across numerous activating groups and amine scaffolds. Notably, the method accommodates an unprecedented range of nucleophile classes, allowing for the introduction of diverse functional groups to the readily prepared amine substrates. The utility of this method is then demonstrated through applications to unsymmetrical bisfunctionalization, site&#8208;selective functionalization of N&#8208;pyridyl amines vs. other activated amines, a formal synthesis of ivosidenib and the diversification of FDA&#8208;approved drugs or natural product substrates.

PIII/PV redox cycling has recently emerged as a valuable strategy to minimized the chemical waste generated by phosphine&#8208;mediated reaction, as well as enabling asymmetric transformation. In this article, we detail our contribution to this field by designing a series of diversely functionalized, electron&#8208;rich bridgehead phosphine oxides with structural features that make them well&#8208;suited as PIII/PV redox organocatalysts. Their catalytic performance has been assessed in various model reactions, including Wittig or Staudinger reactions, along with the reduction of activated alkenes and allenes. For each of these scenarios, we performed a comparative analysis with existing catalysts in order to demonstrate the applicability and limitation of methanophosphocines.

Abstract
Herein, we describe a reaction conditions&#8208;based switchable Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkylation and alkenylation of 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazinones with maleimides, where the triazinone serves as a directing group rather than its traditional role denitrogenative precursor. This strategy enables the selective synthesis of diverse 3&#8208;arylated succinimides and 3&#8208;arylated maleimides in up to 99% yield and a broad substrate scope (48 examples). Furthermore, for the first time, a tandem C&#8722;H alkylation and denitrogenative coupling of 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazinones has been achieved by slightly modifying the reaction conditions. Additionally, gram&#8208;scale reactions and product derivatizations were conducted to demonstrate the synthetic utility.

Abstract
A de novo synthesis of cyclobutene&#8208;fused indoline derivatives via thermally induced intramolecular cyclization was reported. This approach efficiently yields valuable high&#8208;strained cyclobute[b]indolines in moderate to high yields and enables further transformation into other valuable heterocycles, demonstrating its potential in organic synthesis.

         <title>Intramolecular Buchner Reaction: Experimental and Theoretical Comparison of the Effect of the Carbene Substituent on the Chemoselectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The intramolecular Buchner reaction is a powerful transformation able to dearomatize benzenic rings. However, the competitive C&#8722;H insertion of the carbene moiety into benzylic positions still remains a limitation, and the reasons governing this uncomplete chemoselectivity are poorly understood. The carbene substitution, in particular, has been observed to influence the selectivity strongly, though the currently proposed explanation relying on the electrophilicity of the metallocarbene hardly describes some experimental results reported in the literature. In this article, we present our experimental observations of intramolecular rhodium&#8208;catalyzed Buchner reactions, combined with DFT calculations on selected carbene substituents, to propose a complementary explanation for the observed chemoselectivity modification.

         <dc:description>We have developed a method for the synthesis of thieno[3,2&#8208;b]furans on the basis of a strategy consisting of a formal [3+2] cycloaddition utilizing the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement and a subsequent Br&#248;nsted base&#8208;mediated cyclization. The method streamlines access to a wide range of well&#8208;organized 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted thieno[3,2&#8208;b]furans that are otherwise difficult to synthesize and is also applicable to the syntheses of 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted seleno[3,2&#8208;b]furans.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We here report a catalytic strategy to enable the decarboxylative allylic amination of vinyl cyclic carbonates using various aliphatic and nucleophilic amines. The use of a protic medium and chelating diphosphine ligands is a main driver towards chemo&#8208;selective allylic
amine formation, thereby minimizing undesired ligand&#8208;driven complex speciation and aminolysis of the involved substrate. This improved approach amplifies the repertoire of allylic amine synthons that can be prepared from a variety of substrate combinations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction has been developed using two distinct electrophiles: an aryl alkyl selenide and an aryl bromide. The organoselenium compound, due to the lower bond dissociation energy of the C&#8208;Se bond, acts as a pseudohalide. This one&#8208;pot reaction proceeds by cleaving the C&#8208;Se bond, producing the desired biaryls in moderate to good yields. This method has the potential to become a valuable tool in organic synthesis, owing to its substrate scope and scalability. Importantly, the use of commercially available aryl bromides eliminates the handling of pre&#8208;formed organomagnesium reagents, enhancing the practicality and applicability of this approach.</dc:description>

Abstract
Herein, we describe a strategy for the synthesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from readily available 2&#8208;iodostyrenes and o&#8208;halobenzoic acids through a ligand&#8208;free palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade vinyl C&#8722;H activation/decarboxylative cyclization. A vinyl&#8208;coordinated five&#8208;membered palladacycle was proposed as the key intermediate for this sequential process. Furthermore, Heptagon&#8208;embedded aromatic compounds can be smoothly synthesized by employing 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;naphthoic acid as decarboxylative insertion unit.

         <title>Organocatalytic Regioselective Aldol Reaction of Hydroxyacetone with Aliphatic Aldehydes for the Synthesis of Linear Products</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we present an organocatalyst that addresses the reactivity issue of aliphatic aldehydes with hydroxyacetone, leading to the formation of a linear product. Previous proline&#8208;based catalysts required a significant excess of hydroxyacetone and could only be applied to aromatic aldehydes. The proposed sulphonamide containing a proline moiety effectively controls the reaction, generating a new stereogenic center dependent on the catalyst&#8216;s configuration and does not require a large excess of the ketone. We demonstrated that this methodology can be effectively utilized in the synthesis of natural compounds, as confirmed by obtaining the 2&#8208;keto&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;gluconic acid (KDG) methyl ester from optically pure glyceraldehyde and protected hydroxyacetone.

         <title>Synthesis of Polyaryl&#8208;Substituted Azafluoranthenes via Co&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition of 1,6&#8208;Diynes with Nitriles</title>

Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of azafluoranthene derivatives under mild conditions via [2+2+2] cycloaddition of 1,6&#8208;diynes and nitriles catalyzed by CoBr2/dppp, exhibiting good atom economy. This procedure uses an inexpensive ligand and an earth&#8208;abundant metal as catalyst to lower the cost of synthesis. Several azafluoranthenes are produced in 28&#8211;95% yields using this approach, featuring mild conditions, wide substrate scope, and good functional group tolerance. The fluorescence spectra of some azafluoranthenes indicate that these scaffolds have good photophysical properties for material science.

         <title>Base&#8208;Catalyzed Domino Isomerization/Oxidant&#8208;Free Dehydrogenative Annulation of Allylic Alcohols: Scope, Mechanism, and Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A domino reaction comprising four consecutive steps based on the strategy of isomerization of allylic alcohols was developed. This base&#8208;catalyzed protocol provided an approach for constructing polysubstituted quinolines without additional additives. A wide range of di&#8208; or trisubstituted &#947;&#8208;aminoaryl allylic alcohols bearing alkyl or (hetero)aryl substituents were transformed to a range of structurally diverse quinolines. The utility of this transformation was demonstrated by the application in the concise synthesis of several polysubstituted quinoline derivatives, including natural products and pharmacological agents. Preliminary mechanistic experiments suggest that the isomerization of &#947;&#8208;aminoaryl allylic alcohol proceeds via an intramolecular 1,3&#8208;hydrogen shift whereas for the aromatization of the dihydroquinoline intermediate two possible pathways exist: acceptorless dehydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation.

         <dc:description>Herein, we reported a protocol for direct visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated decarboxylative aminomethylation of ferulic acid with N&#8208;aryl tetrahydroisoquinolines in air atmosphere. Current protocol uses naturally available ferulic acid as coupling partner, inexpensive organic photocatalyst riboflavin tetraacetate (RFTA) as photocatalyst and molecular oxygen as oxidant, which is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. This methodology was further demonstrated its utility by the protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free semi&#8208;synthesis of natural alkaloids maclekarpine E and assessing the anti&#8208;inflammatory activity of its analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Dimerization of Fungal Natural Products through Intermolecular Disulfide Bridges</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The biosynthetic pathway for the production of natural products from various species often include a dimerization step which increases the structural variability and range of biological activities. These dimerization reactions are highly interesting for biocatalytic applications. Epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) are an important class of natural products whose potent bioactivities rely on disulfide bridges. ETPs often carry a transannular disulfide bridge and can be linked through C&#8211;C and C&#8211;N bonds to form dimers. In this study, we shed light on the mechanism of disulfide formation in the case of the dimeric vertihemiptellides (vhe) produced by the fungus Verticillium hemipterigenum BCC1449. These compounds feature a unique intermolecular disulfide bridge which links two monomers together. Using comparative genomics, we identified the 12&#8208;membered vhe gene cluster. In vitro assays, kinetic analysis, and protein mutagenesis, enabled us to characterize VheT, the oxidase catalyzing an intermolecular disulfide bond formation resulting in ETP dimers. We showed that the CxxC motif of VheT plays a crucial role in catalyzing this reaction. VheT is an oxidase linking natural product monomers through intermolecular S&#8211;S bridges and could be developed into a biocatalyst for thiol specific dimerization reactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A variety of &#945;&#8208;benzotriazinium ketones were prepared in 38%&#8208;89% yields through a copper(II)&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam reaction and [2,3]&#8208;rearrangement in a one pot reaction open to air from N&#8208;hydroxybenzotriazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones and alkenyl boronic acids at room temperature. Experimental results showed that the copper catalyst not only played as cross&#8208;coupling catalyst but also served as Lewis acid catalyst to control the chemoselectivity of [2,3]&#8208;rearrangement. The reaction tolerated various linear and cyclic disubstituted alkenyl boronic acids. Moreover, &#945;&#8208;benzotriazinium ketone could be easily prepared in gram scales.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aminopyridine Derivatives via a Tandem CuAAC/Ring&#8208;Cleavage/[4+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition/Rearrangement Reaction Sequence</title>

Abstract
2H&#8208;Azirines are an important class of small&#8208;ring heterocycle that have been employed as versatile synthetic building blocks. Herein, a one&#8208;pot CuAAC/ring&#8208;cleavage/[4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/rearrangement reaction sequence involving terminal ynones, sulfonyl azides and 2H&#8208;azirines is reported that leads to 2&#8208;aminopyridine derivatives. In the first step, highly reactive N&#8208;sulfonyl &#945;&#8208;acylketenimines are generated, via a CuAAC/ring&#8208;cleavage process, from sulfonyl azides and terminal ynones and these undergo inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition reactions with 2H&#8208;azirines to form (isolable) 1,3&#8208;oxazines that themselves undergo base&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;cleavage and rearrangement reactions to afford the title compounds.

Abstract
We report a one&#8208;pot cascade sequence catalyzed by gold starting from 1,5&#8208;diynes and a zwitterion (source of Tf2C=CH2), which allows the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective preparation of cyclobutene&#8208;fused [4&#8208;7&#8208;6] tricycles and displays orthogonal reactivity of the 1,5&#8208;diyne system, zwitterion and metal catalyst. Moreover, the obtained tricyclic bis(triflyl)cyclobutenes [triflyl=(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl] can be easily converted into more complex structures such as bridged ketal and fused 1,3&#8208;oxazine tetracyclic systems, demonstrating the potential of our protocol.

Abstract
Site&#8208;selective amination of N&#8208;heterocycles is an interesting topic in organic synthesis and drug discovery. We herein present a method for the vicarious&#8208;type nucleophilic amination of azine N&#8208;oxides and cyclic iminoamides using iminyl anions, readily generated from organic azides under basic conditions. The plausible reaction mechanism involving nucleophilic aromatic substitution by iminyl anions is elucidated by a series of mechanistic investigations.

Abstract
A tandem oxidative radical functionalization/annulation of N&#8208;acryloyl amino saccharin is disclosed. This strategy allows the facile construction of diversely functionalized 3,4&#8208;fused tricyclic benzosultams that previously have not been reported. A wide range of functionalities were installed through the formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;S and C&#8722;P bond enabled by the respective radicals.

         <title>Unconventional Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Catalyst Ratio for the Distal C&#8722;C Bond Formation via C&#8722;H Activation and Chain&#8208;Walking</title>

Abstract
A mechanism&#8208;navigated enantioselective alkylation of an indole C2&#8197;C&#8722;H bond with an internal alkene was developed. Under the unconventional ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal catalyst ratio, a moderate enantiomeric ratio (er), ranging from 70:30 to 88:12, was achieved with our original ligand. We propose that chain&#8208;walking and bond formation are mechanistically independent and suggest that hydridoiridium generated from the C&#8722;H source does not play a role in the chain&#8208;walking process.

Abstract
Another class of gold(I) redox&#8208;switchable catalysts, incorporating ferrocenyl phosphane&#8208;imines, enriches the existing library of gold(I) complexes. Our catalyst proves efficacy in gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations of furans and benzamides, exhibiting reversible &#8220;on&#8208;off&#8221; switching. Furthermore, we explored the unconventional role of &#8220;Magic Blue&#8221;, commonly used as an oxidizing agent in various organic transformations, as a potential activator of the Au&#8722;Cl bond, initiating conventional gold(I) catalysis.

         <dc:description>The first enantioselective reaction of acyclic &#945;&#8208;ketiminoesters with thiols has been developed. Good yields and enantioselectivities were obtained using our original cinchona alkaloid amide/zinc(II) catalysts. The obtained products were converted into useful chiral thiazolidines. Based on experimental results and DFT calculation, transition states were proposed to explain the stereoselectivity of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyst&#8208;controlled switchable (4 + 3) and (4 + 2) annulation reactions of Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates with benzofuran&#8208;derived azadienes have been established. Employing PCy3 as the catalyst, the reaction could provide a variety of synthetically useful benzofuro[3,2&#8208;b]azepines in good yields (80&#8208;92%) with excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities via (4 + 3) cycloaddition reactions. Whereas changing the catalyst from PCy3 to DMAP, the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities were switched to construct highly substituted spirotetrahydroquinoline scaffolds with three sequential stereocenters containing all&#8208;carbon spiro&#8208;quaternary stereocenters in excellent efficiency and diastereoselectivities (92&#8208;96% yields with all cases &gt; 25:1 dr) via (4 + 2) annulations. In addition, the synthetic utility of this method was further showcased by gram&#8208;scale reactions and synthetic transformations of the product.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomative Functionalization of Activated Quinolines: Transfer Hydrogenation/Cycloaddition Cascade to Construct &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cascade dearomative functionalization is a robust protocol to convert flat arenes into medicinally relevant three&#8208;dimensional architectures with added new functionality. Herein, a dearomative cycloaddition protocol for synthesizing tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;embedded &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine scaffolds has been developed employing quinolinium salts and sulfonyl azides under metal&#8208;free conditions. An underexplored and mechanistically distinct pathway is unveiled, creating quaternary&#8208;center&#8208;bearing amine skeletons by an amine group migration during the transfer hydrogenation and cycloaddition cascade reaction. This approach provided a broad substrate scope of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine scaffolds from a plethora of C3&#8208;substituted quinolinium and sulfonyl azides. The post&#8208;synthetic modifications have further diversified the &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine core into interesting scaffolds. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested the involvement of aziridine ring formation for the amine migration to the C&#8208;3 position of quinoline to generate the &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine core.

         <title>Access to Functionalized Indenes via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Homolytic Cleavage of a Furan C&#8722;O Bond</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A photoinduced palladium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydroarylation of furans to form functionalized indenes was achieved via an intramolecular reductive coupling of aryl bromide with furan using silane as the reductant. Deuterium tracking and DFT analysis revealed a reasonable reaction pathway involving: 1) the homolytic cleavage of the furan C&#8722;O bond induced by the &#945;&#8208;allyl radical; 2) a 1,6&#8208;H atom transfer from carbon to oxygen.

         <title>Photocatalytic &#945;&#8208;Difluoroalkoxyketones Synthesis via Radical Intermolecular Alkoxylation of Difluoroenol Silyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We present a metal&#8208;free photocatalytic approach for the synthesis of difluoroalkoxylatedketones. This strategy involves the generation of alkoxyl radicals from pyridinium salts upon the activity of a catalytic electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex. This mild process tolerates several functional groups and can be scaled up to gram scale. Diverse products manipulations accounts for the versatility of the obtained fluorinated products, highlighting the synthetic usefulness of this method.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, external photocatalyst&#8208;free, site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H arylation of 4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones and various 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes has been developed to provide ortho arylated products 41&#8211;95% yield at room temperature. A mechanistic study using control experiments, UV&#8208;visible study, DFT study, and observation of colored aggregates suggest that in&#8197;situ generated Ag&#8208;palladacycle complex of 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes is responsible for absorbing the visible light and generating aryl radicals from aryldiazonium salts. Further, this methodology demonstrates its versatility by transforming various 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes, including 2&#8208;phenylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;one, 3&#8208;phenylquinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one, 2&#8208;phenylpyridines, pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines, 2&#8208;phenylquinolines, 2&#8208;phenylisoquinolines, and 2&#8208;phenylbenzo[d]thiazoles, into their respective regio&#8208;selective C&#8722;H arylated products under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;CF3&#8208;Indoles from HFO&#8208;1234ze(E) via Cross&#8208;Coupling and Intramolecular Cyclization</title>

Abstract
The synthesis of indoles with a trifluoromethyl group has attracted a lot of attention because they are promising structural subunits for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. As part of our project aimed toward the upcycling of hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), we developed a method to construct a CF3&#8208;bearing indole ring system through the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of a brominated HFO&#8208;1234ze(E) (CF3CH=CHF) with N&#8208;tosylated o&#8208;borylanilines, followed by nucleophilic 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization at the vinylic position of the generated fluorostyrenes. We found that the Pd2(dba)3/SPhos catalyst system in the presence of K2CO3 and water in toluene afforded the corresponding 3&#8208;CF3&#8208;indoles in high yields in a one&#8208;pot operation.

Abstract
Due to the presence of multiple reactive sites, including an alkyne, an alkene, and a ketone, 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)&#8208;2&#8208;alken&#8208;1&#8208;ones (yne&#8208;enones) can successfully participate in the synthesis of various carbo&#8208;, and heterocycles, as well as acyclic compounds. In this regard, a wide variety of transition metal catalysts and organocatalysts are utilized in cycloaddition and functionalization reactions of yne&#8208;enones with other coupling partners. Considering the versatility of this synthon, in this review, we have described metal&#8208;catalyzed and non&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations of yne&#8208;enones over the last decade.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Allylic Alkylation Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Diazo Ketones with Water and Allyl Carbonates for Construction of Homoallylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A three&#8208;component allylic alkylation reaction of &#945;&#8208;diazo ketones, water and allyl carbonate under the cooperative catalysis of Rh2(OAc)4, Pd2(dba)3 and Br&#248;nsted acid was disclosed. This method provides an expeditious access to &#945;&#8208;keto homoallylic alcohols in good to high yields. Controlled experiments support that the transformations proceed through cross&#8208;interception of two active intermediates Pd&#8208;allyl species and enol intermediates derived from oxonium ylides. Moreover, synthetic transformations of the generated products enable the creation of motifs enriched with dense functional groups, underscoring their potential as valuable building blocks.

Abstract
The substrate&#8208;controlled regioselective conjugate addition (1,8&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;addition) of tropones with difluoroenoxysilanes is reported, which offered an approach for the selective synthesis of multifunctional seven&#8208;membered 3,5&#8208;cycloheptadien&#8208;1&#8208;ones and 1,3&#8208;cycloheptadien&#8208;1&#8208;ones featuring a gem&#8208;difluoroketone moiety. Moreover, these fluorinated cyclo&#8208;heptadienones exhibit effective anti&#8208;proliferative activities (IC50&lt;1&#8197;&#956;M) for human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells in&#8197;vitro, thus providing potential lead compounds for developing new anticancer agents.

Abstract
An efficient and regioselective cyclization for construction of pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;b]pyridines and methylene&#8208;bridged bis(pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines) has been established. It involves a [3+2+1] annulation of 3(5)&#8208;aminopyrazole, N,N&#8208;dimethylethanolamine (DMEA), with 1,2&#8208;insertion of aryl methyl ketones or 2,1&#8208;insertion of aryl alkynes. DMEA is oxidized through C(sp3)&#8208;H activation to provide a single or triple carbon source.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;induced annulation&#8208;halocyanomethylation of indole&#8208;linked 1,6&#8208;enynes has been established using haloacetonitrile as radical precursors, enabling the synthesis of 21 cyanomethylated pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles with yields ranging from 42% to 81% and a Z/E ratio up to 19:1. Moreover, by adjusting the reaction temperature, a variation of the annulation&#8208;bromobicyanomethylation process was achieved, resulting in the production of 12 bicyanomethylated pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indole isomers in yields of 41&#8211;68%. The stereoisomeric mixture of bicyanomethylated products could be purified to their pure configurations through recrystallization. The proposed reaction mechanism was formulated through a series of control experiments.

         <title>Access to &#946;&#8208;Lactam Sulfonamides from Sulfamoyl Chlorides via Photoredox Catalyzed C&#8722;S Bond Formation</title>

Abstract
Sulfonyl chlorides are a synthetically attractive source of sulfonyl radicals in photoredox catalysis and are useful precursors in the synthesis of sulfones. Sulfamoyl chlorides, on the other hand, remain poorly represented despite their similar potential. In this study, N&#8208;chlorosulfonylated &#946;&#8208;lactams were prepared from readily available precursors and utilized in an atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction with a variety of olefins, producing &#946;&#8208;lactam sulfonamides in 49&#8211;95% yields. &#946;&#8208;Lactams fused to a dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;thiazine ring which closely resemble carbacephems, a widely used class of antibiotics, were also synthesized by an intra&#8208;molecular ATRA reaction. This methodology enables the preparation of &#946;&#8208;lactam sulfonamides, a class of compounds that are of great interest in pharmacology.

The control experiments indicated that the substrate reacts with alkynes in tandem to synthesize 1,3&#8208;diene intermediates, and ultimately 1,3&#8208;diene underwent intramolecular cyclization to produce benzofulvene derivatives.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed asymmetric [3+3] cycloaddition of N&#8208;viny oxindole nitrones with 2&#8208;indolylmethanols to prepare various spirooxindole[1,2]oxazines in 43&#8208;93% yields and 88:12&#8208;97:3 enantiomeric ratios. Experimental results revealed that the addition of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) played important roles to help CPA control the reaction reactivity and enantioselectivity. The present method features the construction of tetrasubstituted chiral carbon stereocenter and the example of N&#8208;vinyl nitrones in asymmetric [3+3] cycloaddition.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Monophosphine ligands based on C&#8211;N axially chiral N&#8208;Arylpyrrole backbones are prepared starting from amino acids and evaluated in Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitutions. 20.7&#8208; 99.9% ees are achieved in the reactions of rac&#8208;1,3&#8208;diphenylallyl acetates with O&#8208;, N&#8208; and C&#8208;nucleophiles. Ligand screening revealed that the steric hindrance from 3&#8208; or 4&#8208; position of the pyrrole is crucial for the enantioselectivity of the reaction. The synthetic utilization of the products was demonstrated by the transformation of one product by a gold&#8208;catalyzed oxidative rearrangement reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic electrosynthesis has become a green, efficient and sustainable alternative to traditional organic transformation for the redox reactions. In this connection, indirect electrolysis employing redox mediators is attaining increasing significance as it offers a chance to improve reaction selectivity and avoids the over&#8208;oxidation/reduction issues encountered in direct electrolysis. Triarylamines and triarylimidazoles, as representative organic molecular mediators, have attracted widespread attention in recent years due to the advantages of well&#8208;defined easy structural modification and tunable redox ability. Hence, in this minireview, the recent growth of triarylamine and triarylimidazole derivatives mediated electrochemical oxidation reactions were presented, highlighting the structural optimization, electrochemical performance and reaction mechanism of these organic mediators. Moreover, the photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic cases with these molecular mediators were also highlighted. To conclude, the current challenges and future prospects of this field are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper and Photocatalytic Synergistic Strategies for Radical Cyclization Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid development of photo&#8208;synergistic transition metal catalytic systems has provided a green paradigm to complement thermal transition metal catalytic methods. However, the most commonly used iridium or ruthenium complexes involve expensive in nature, in contrast to the abundant copper elements in the earth's crust, which are highly valued for their unique electronic structure and light&#8208;absorbing properties. Recently, the application of copper and photocatalytic synergistic strategies in radical cyclization reactions has progressed considerably, leading to a renaissance in the synthesis of functional natural products, drugs and their analogues, but summary work addressing this aspect has not been reported. In this review, we briefly analyze the effect of ligand choice on copper complexes and some inorganic copper salts and even on light sources. We then summarize the copper and photocatalytic synergistic strategies in radical cyclization reactions and classify them into three categories, C, N and O radicals, according to the class of the central atom of the radical in each work, and in each category will be elaborated in turn from coordination cyclization via Cu catalysts, direct radical cyclization and other cyclization mode. For individual more complex reactions, the mechanisms are explored and briefly discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Emerging Advances of the Radical Pathway Glycosylation Enabled by Bench&#8208;Stable Glycosyl Donors: Glycosyl Sulfoxides, Glycosyl Sulfones, and Glycosyl Sulfinates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. In synthetic carbohydrate chemistry, the modification of glycosyl radicals pathway stands as a central area of focus. The radical&#8208;based reactions often demonstrate remarkable compatibility with various functional groups owing to the mild initiation conditions. In particular, the identification of novel glycosyl radical precursors, combined with advanced reaction techniques, has substantially broadened the scope of glycosyl compound synthesis. Despite the presence of versatile donors, the synthesis of noble donors is still addressed as a synthetic need and challenges associated with sugar chemistry. Currently, a new class of glycosyl radical precursors has been developed which enables the production of C&#8208;, S&#8208;, O&#8208;, and N&#8208;glycosides efficiently. In this light, we highlight strategies towards bench&#8208;stable glycosyl sulfoxides, sulphone, and sulfite donors that can enable the site&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective transformation of protected or naked sugar synthons in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry. Here, this review article covers the recent developments in the selective glycosyl radical diversification such as glycosyl alkylation, arylation, alkenylation, sulfuration, C&#8208;H activation, and DNA conjugation via the bench&#8208;stable donors along with mechanistic aspects, challenges, and future directions.		1.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Diastereoselective Cascade Cyclization to Construct Polycyclic Spiroindolines</title>

Abstract
We herein reported, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced K2S2O8 mediated cascade reaction of 3&#8208;(2&#8208;isocyanoethyl)indoles with &#945;&#8208;oxocarboxylic acids leading to diastereoselective synthesis of polycyclic spiroindolines bearing an N&#8208;formyl unit derivative utilising the alkali metal salt K2S2O8 as a mediator under mild reaction conditions. This study offers an illustration of &#945;&#8208;oxocarboxylic acids and 3&#8208;(2&#8208;isocyanoethyl)indoles&#8208;based reactions as it shows the involvement of glyoxolate ions without decarboxylation to access polycyclic spiroindolines bearing an N&#8208;formyl unit analogue. The batch process can be extended to a continuous flow system using a glass tube loaded with K2S2O8 placed between the PFA capillary reactor, which can greatly advance the reaction efficiency and can even be promoted to gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylative Transformation for the Synthesis of Tetracyclic Indoline Thioesters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed thioesterification of (aza)indole&#8208;tethered aryl iodides, Mo(CO)6, and sulfonyl chlorides is reported. A series of C2 thioester&#8208;group substituted indoline&#8208;fused ring compounds are constructed by an intramolecular Heck cyclization and carbonylation chemistry involving N&#8208;(2&#8208;iodobenzoyl)indole. The salient features of this three&#8208;component cascade sequence include the use of solid Mo(CO)6 as the carbon monoxide source and good functional group tolerance.

The front cover picture was generated by artificial intelligence around our description of the landscape we intended to create. The cascade waterfall symbolizes the cascade transformation depicted schematically on the image. The starting oxime containing a proximal allene in palladium catalyzed process undergoes several in&#8197;situ transformations to afford the triquinane type product. The cascade stream involves three components and creates four new bonds in a single operation. More details can be found in article by P. Jovanovic, V. Savic and co&#8208;workers (P. Jovanovic, M. Jovanovic, M. Petkovic, M. Simic, G. Tasic, M. Rodic, S. Rakic, F. Vlahovic, V. Savic, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2024, 366, DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202400253)

         <title>Electroreductive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling of Aromatic Carbonyl Compounds and Alkyl Bromides</title>

Abstract
Classical methods for the synthesis of tertiary alcohols mainly rely on the nucleophilic addition of organometallic reagents to carbonyl compounds. Here, we disclose a strategy for synthesizing tertiary alcohols via electroreductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of aromatic carbonyl compounds and alkyl bromides (allyl, propargyl, benzyl and cyclohexyl bromides). This procedure features good substrate tolerance and friendly conditions (undivided cell, cheap and reusable carbon electrodes, reaction in open air, room temperature, without any external transition metal/activating reagent). Using this method, 32 desired products can be obtained with moderate to good yields, and gram&#8208;scale synthesis is feasible, demonstrating the practicality of this approach.

         <title>Recent Developments in Selenylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkynes are simple yet important organic feedstocks. The selenylation of alkynes is able to produce complex selenium&#8208;containing compounds in a facile way. Although there are some reviews about the selenylation of alkynes, most of them focus on one specific reaction or what types of products that can be obtained. There is a lack of attention given to the various uses of different selenium reagents and their mechanisms. This review mainly focuses on recent advances (2013&#8208;2023) based on diverse selenium reagents. Mechanisms and how the added reagents work will be discussed. Different reaction types, including difunctionalization, Se&#8208;annulation, spiro&#8208;cyclization, C&#8208;Se coupling, click reaction will be recorded in this review. The regioselectivity can be achieved through various mechanisms, including radicals, seleniraniums or electrophilic cyclization. We hope it will do help for future research in this area.</dc:description>

         <title>A High&#8208;Throughput in vitro Assay System for the Detection of the Enzymatic Dihydroxylation of Aliphatic Olefins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rieske dioxygenase enzymes can perform the cis&#8208;dihydroxylation of aliphatic olefins, representing a potential green alternative to established methods of performing this important transformation. However, the activity of the natural enzymes in this context is low relative to their more well&#8208;known activity in the cis&#8208;dihydroxylation of aromatics. To enable the engineering of dioxygenase enzymes for improved activity in the dihydroxylation of aliphatic olefins, we have developed an assay system to detect the relevant diol metabolites produced from whole&#8208;cell fermentation cultures. Optimization studies were carried out to maximize the sensitivity of the assay system, and its utility in the in vitro screening of enzyme variant libraries was demonstrated. The assay system was utilized in screening studies that identified Rieske dioxygenase variants with significantly improved activity in the dihydroxylation of aliphatic olefins relative to the wild&#8208;type enzyme.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;tailored Divergence of Copper&#8208;catalyzed Aerobic Oxidation of Cyclopropanols. Application to the Practical Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Aminoketones and &#946;&#8208;Enaminones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aerobic ring&#8208;opening oxidation of cyclopropanols catalyzed by copper complexes was systematically investigated, with a focus on the effect of nitrogen ligands on the distribution of oxidation products. This study led to the development of a new synthesis of &#946;&#8208;aminoketones and &#946;&#8208;enaminones from cyclopropanols, where product specificity is tuned through ligand and solvent selection. &#946;&#8208;Aminoketones were prepared in 34&#8211;99% yields by copper(II) acetate&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation of cyclopropanols in the presence of nucleophilic secondary aliphatic amines. In contrast, bipyridine&#8208;ligated copper catalysts resulted in the generation of &#946;&#8208;enaminones in 36&#8211;86% yields, presumably via the Kornblum&#8208;DeLaMare rearrangement of intermediate 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes</dc:description>

This study led to the development of a new synthesis of &#946;-aminoketones and &#946;-enaminones from cyclopropanols, where product specificity is tuned through ligand and solvent selection. &#946;-Aminoketones were prepared in 34&#8211;99% yields by copper(II) acetate-catalyzed aerobic oxidation of cyclopropanols in the presence of nucleophilic secondary aliphatic amines. In contrast, bipyridine-ligated copper catalysts resulted in the generation of &#946;-enaminones in 36&#8211;86% yields, presumably via the Kornblum-DeLaMare rearrangement of intermediate 1,2-dioxolanes&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>An enzymatic method for the selective hydroxylation of phenols using a peroxygenase
from Aspergillus brasiliensis (AbrUPO) is reported. A broad range of phenolic starting
materials can be selectively transformed into the corresponding hydroquinones. Semipreparative

Abstract
Pulsed ultrasonic irradiation with on&#8208;off modulation remarkably enhances asymmetric noncovalent organocatalysis &#8220;on water&#8221;, specifically for Michael addition and Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. This approach effectively addresses challenges associated with solid reactant dispersion encountered in &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221; reactions and mitigates overheating issues caused by continuous ultrasound exposure, thereby significantly augmenting reaction rates and stereoselectivities.

Abstract
An electrochemical method with high faradaic efficiency was developed for the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;regioselective aroylation of quinoline N&#8208;oxides under oxidant&#8208;free conditions by using aryl &#945;&#8208;ketoacids as the aroylation reagent. A series of 8&#8208;aroylquinoline N&#8208;oxides were effectively synthesized in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. Furthermore, the proposed method was successfully applied to the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a tubulin polymerization inhibitor. Additionally, a plausible reaction mechanism for the decarboxylation radical acylation was proposed on the basis of the results of cyclic voltammetry and control experiments. Overall, this method provides a novel solution for the C8&#8208;regioselective aroylation of quinoline N&#8208;oxides.

Abstract
Achieving &#945;&#8208;methylation of BODIPYs remains challenging due to the electron&#8208;deficient property of &#945;&#8208;position of BODIPYs. Herein, a H2O2/DMSO&#8208;promoted radical process was employed, providing an approach for the construction of a series of &#945;&#8208;methyl and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dimethyl BODIPYs in 57&#8211;68% yields. In addition, representative transformations and half&#8208;gram experiments as well as their photophysical properties were studied to examine the potential applications.

Abstract
Complexes [(bpy)2Ru(BL)](PF6)2 (Ru(BL), BL=N,N&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthrolinamine) have been investigated in the coupling reaction of aryl halides and sodium arylsulfinates under visible light irradiation. The position (3, 4 or 5) of the nickel&#8208;coordinating di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amine fragment in the 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline core has a strong influence on the activity of the catalytic system. The advantage of binding fragments of photocatalyst and metal complex into one molecule in the systems with bridging ligands N,N&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthrolin&#8208;3&#8208;amine (BL1) and N,N&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthrolin&#8208;4&#8208;amine (BL2), in comparison with mixed catalytic systems, is shown. With Ru(BL2) photocatalysts it is possible to reduce the loading to 0.1&#8197;mol%, instead of the commonly used 1&#8211;2&#8197;mol%, and to eliminate the use of the additional ligand for nickel. Under these conditions, more than 20 diarylsulfones of different structures were synthesized in 25&#8211;95% yields.

Abstract
With phenacyl chlorides as simple nucleophilic species, the asymmetric Darzens reaction of isatins using Ni(acac)2 as the Lewis acid and imidazolidine&#8208;pyrroloimidazolone pyridine as the ligand is reported. In the presence of 1&#8197;mol% of the catalyst, diverse spiro&#8208;epoxyoxindoles with two new contiguous stereocenters were afforded in 82&#8211;99% yields, &gt;20:1 dr, with 91&#8211;99% ee. Chiral spiro&#8208;epoxyoxindoles could undergo ring&#8208;opening reactions in further transformations. The developed method was applied to the derivatization of complex molecules including indomethacin, gemfibrozil, and febuxostat&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;chloroketones. A strong positive nonlinear effect was observed, which was caused by the precipitation of a less&#8208;soluble racemic catalyst complex.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced method was developed to synthesize selenylated cyclic boronic esters through intermolecular oxyselenenylation. This method can be performed under additive&#8208;free and photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions and generates potentially pharmaceutically useful heterocycles. A plausible reaction mechanism was proposed based on several control experiments and previous reports.

Abstract
The combination of RLi&#8208;mediated organic transformations (under air and at room temperature) with a subsequent stereoselective biocatalytic reaction is for the first time presented. Most of the previous asymmetric chemoenzymatic routes have been limited to the concomitant or sequential combination of transition metals/organocatalysts with enzymes. However, the use of polar organometallic reagents (RLi) in the design of these stereoselective hybrid protocols has been totally neglected, as far as we are concerned. Thus, in this work, the combination of organolithium chemistry and asymmetric biocatalysis is described for the first time in a one&#8208;pot fashion. The chemoenzymatic approach converts a series of nitriles into chiral alcohols consisting of two steps, where the key item was the finding of suitable conditions to adapt the reactivities of organolithiums and alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) in the same recipient. The organolithium addition occurred with total chemoselectivity (no side reactions were observed) under neat conditions and room temperature leading to the corresponding imines, which were hydrolyzed using a buffer, and adjusting the pH for the subsequent ADH action. Commercial and made in house overexpressed ADHs allowed to produce chiral alcohols with excellent selectivities and good overall yields. The different behavior displayed for the reductive enzymes in the presence of diethyl ether clearly influenced in the decision to let the organolithium solvent evaporate under open&#8208;air conditions before developing the bioreduction step. Our results demonstrate the importance of the fine orchestration of the reaction conditions for the development of efficient hybrid chemoenzymatic cascades without the need of intermediate isolation/purification steps or compartmentalization of the different synthetic systems.

Abstract
Copper&#8208;catalyzed and visible&#8208;light catalytic difluoroalkylation reactions of N&#8208;cyanamide alkenes have been developed. Various &#945;&#8208;bromodifluoromethyl substituted esters, amides and heterocycles were employed as the CF2 source. Both protocols are characterized by medium to high yields, good functional group compatibility, and applicable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Comparable studies of copper catalysis and photoredox catalysis demonstrate minimal differences between the two protocols. Preliminary mechanism suggest that both transformations involve tandem radical cyclization process.

Abstract
Heterocycles are important compounds existed in diverse advanced chemicals, functional materials, bioactive molecules and natural products. Different strategies through transition metal&#8208;catalyzed alkyne cyclization have been developed to synthesize various heterocycles. The merger of alkyne cyclization and metal nanoparticle catalysis has emerged as an important approach to diverse heterocycles. By using different kinds of metal nanoparticle catalysts, such as gold, silver, copper and palladium nanoparticles, a number of heterocycles are prepared with high yield and selectivity in a green, sustainable and highly efficient manner. This review summarizes and discusses recent achievements in metal nanoparticle&#8208;catalyzed alkyne cyclization for the synthesis of heterocycles.

Alternatively, irradiation of 3&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;hydroxypropyl&#8208;pyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones in the presence of HCl aqueous solution (1&#8197;M) led to the formation of cis&#8208;(8b,15a)&#8208;9a&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;11H,15H&#8208;dibenzo[f,h][1,3]oxazino[3,2&#8208;b]isoquinolin&#8208;15&#8208;ones and cis&#8208;(8b,15a)&#8208;9a&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;11H,15H&#8208;dibenzo[f,h][1,3]oxazino[3,2&#8208;b]isoquinolin&#8208;15&#8208;ones by a one&#8208;pot reaction of photo 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization and addition cyclization.

Abstract
Indoline&#8208;fused polycycles are commonly found as a key structural component in numerous natural products and biologically active compounds. In recent times, the incorporation of sulfonyl fluoride groups has drawn significant attention in research due to their potential to enhance or confer new biological activities to molecules. In this study, we report the development of a modular approach for synthesizing FSO2&#8208;functionalized cyclobutane&#8208;fused indolines by employing an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between indoles and SuFExable ethenesulfonyl fluoride under triplet energy&#8208;transfer catalysis. This method features mild reaction conditions, metal&#8208;free photocatalysts, and excellent tolerance to various functional groups. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of further modifying the FSO2&#8208;functionalized indoline products via SuFEx click reactions, enabling their conjugation with other molecules.

Abstract
A photoinduced three&#8208;component reaction of thianthrenium salts, DABCO&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(SO2)2, and benzyl ether substituted alkenes is developed, affording &#948;&#8208;hydroxylsulfones with good functional group tolerance. This transformation proceeds through an anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrosulfonylation of alkenes under a mild reaction condition. Mechanism studies indicates that this reaction undergoes a radical pathway involving sulfur dioxide insertion and 1,5&#8208;hydrogen transfer processes.

Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced difunctionalization of alkenes is a powerful strategy for constructing complex molecules. Herein, we disclose a three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;alkylpyridylation of alkenes under mild and photosensitizers&#8208;free conditions. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopy studies and NMR titration experiments indicate that the formation of an EDA complex between 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;DHPs and 4&#8208;cyanopyridines. Primary, secondary, and tertiary C(sp3)&#8208;centered radicals were formed by homolytic cleavage of 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;DHPs. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage functionalization of medicinally relevant molecules showed the synthetic potential of our methodology.

Abstract
An electrochemical protocol for synthesizing tetra&#8208;substituted sulfonated pyrazoles is developed. The notable feature of this method is the electrocatalytic generation of an active iodine species, which enables the direct use of 1,3 dicarbonyls as the reactant and also eliminates the necessity for external electrolytes. A wide range of functionalities are compatible under the electrocatalytic condition, resulting good to excellent production of the desired pyrazole derivatives. Detailed synthetic and electrochemical studies enlighten the electrocatalytic pathway.

Abstract
A class of novel chiral&#8208;bridged biphenyl monophosphine ligands with a benzofuran moiety (He&#8208;phos) has been successfully synthesized and reported. These ligands exhibited good performance in the gold&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cycloaddition reaction of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones with nitrones, resulting in the successful preparation of a series of polyaryl&#8208;substituted heterocyclic compounds with high enantioselectivities (up to 99% yield, 98% ee). The wide substrate adaptability (53 examples) and mild reaction conditions demonstrate the practicability of He&#8208;phos in this reaction.

         <title>Aldehyde&#8208;Mediated Open&#8208;Air Stereoselective &#946;&#8208;Glycosylation of Glycals: An Expeditious Route towards Glycosyl&#8208;Ester Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study introduces a method for achieving a selective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;glycosyl esters through the reaction of glycals with carboxylic acids. This process is characterized by stereoselectivity, operating under mild reaction conditions and in an open&#8208;air environment mediated by an aldehyde. Detailed investigations and control experiments indicate the significance of benzaldehyde in conjunction with atmospheric air in facilitating this transformation. The method's versatility is evident in its broad substrate scope, accommodating various carboxylic acid derivatives with electron&#8208;releasing and electron&#8208;neutral functional groups. The practical applicability of the protocol is demonstrated by successfully esterifying different drugs, including indomethacin, tolmetin, and stearic acid, resulting in the production of novel compounds with excellent yields. Mechanistic studies, supported by controlled experiments, highlight the formation of glycal epoxide as an intermediate in the reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Cycloadditions of Cyclic Sulfamidate Imines: Straightforward Access to Chiral N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds are key structures in natural compounds and pharmaceuticals, and they serve as essential building blocks of functional materials. Catalytic asymmetric cycloaddition reactions represent one of the most efficient synthetic strategies for constructing optically active heterocycles. Cyclic sulfamidate imines have recently come to be extensively studied and widely utilized in both organocatalytic and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions, where they have been shown to provide various N&#8208;fused&#8208;heterocycles and spiro&#8208;cycles exhibiting high efficiencies with excellent stereoselectivities. This review highlights recent advancements in catalytic asymmetric cycloadditions of cyclic sulfamidate imines for the stereoselective synthesis of biologically active sulfamidate&#8208;containing heterocycles since 2012 while focusing on the diverse reactivities of cyclic sulfamidate imines and the mechanisms of chiral induction in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A domino sequence consisting of a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed Doyle&#8208;Kirmse rearrangement followed by a Claisen&#8208;thioimidate rearrangement has been developed. This type of thio&#8208;Claisen rearrangement represents the first example reported in the homoallenylsulfenyl series. The sequence involves 2&#8208;propargylsulfenyl benzazoles and diazoesters, affording N&#8208;butadienyl substituted benzazole&#8208;2&#8208;thiones as a mixture of Z and E isomers, in yields ranging from 12% to quantitative (32 examples).

         <title>C&#8208;C Bond Formation by Dual Pyrrolidine and Nickel Catalysis: Allylation of Ketones by Allylic Alcohols.
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whilst catalytic ketone allylation using palladium(0) is well&#8211;precedented, nickel(0)&#8208;catalysed equivalents of such reactions remain scarce. We report here the first nickel&#8208;catalysed allylation of ketones which uses an easily handled and inexpensive bench&#8208;stable Ni(II) pre&#8208;catalyst. This method avoids generation of stoichiometric by&#8208;products via the use of readily available allyl alcohols, rather than the esters or related derivatives which are often used in such transformations. Under the optimised conditions, 25 monoallylated ketones were obtained in 16% to 98% yield and with high selectivity for the linear (E)&#8211;isomers.</dc:description>

         <title>A Catalytic Intramolecular Aldehyde&#8211;Alkyne Metathesis Approach to Azepino[1,2&#8208;a]indoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported herein is a method for the construction of azepino[1,2&#8208;a]indoles via an intramolecular aldehyde&#8211;alkyne metathesis of 1&#8208;(5&#8208;aryl&#8208;4&#8208;pentynyl)indole&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehydes. This Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed reaction has several remarkable features, such as ready accessibility of the starting materials, broad substrate scope, operational simplicity, and high yields. The practicality of the process and the synthetic potential of the products were demonstrated with an upscaling experiment and downstream synthetic derivatizations of the obtained products. We have also extended this methodology to synthesize a 6,7&#8208;dihydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indole derivative.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid (Deuterio)difluoromethylation of Heteroatoms using R&#8208;22 Gas: A Demonstration of Flow Chemistry in Suppressing Intrinsic Reaction Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration and use of deuteriodifluoromethyl heteroatom groups (X&#8208;CF2D) has been limited by persistent challenges, including the unavailability of CF2D precursor reagents, as well as safety, scalability, and environmental concerns associated with conventional batch&#8208;mode syntheses.  In this study, we report the use of atom&#8208;efficient and cost&#8208;effective R&#8208;22 gas (ClCF2H) in continuous flow for the rapid installation of CF2H and CF2D groups on heteroatom centers.  However, the intrinsic nucleophilic substitution between heteroatom anions and ClCF2H decreases the deuterium incorporation levels.  Notably, a judiciously designed continuous flow system proves to suppress the previously unavoidable SN2 reaction and allows for the selective carbene coupling to generate X&#8208;CF2D products with high deuterium incorporation levels up to 96%.  Our continuous flow systems provide a broad scope of X&#8208;CF2H and X&#8208;CF2D products (X = S, O, N) within a short residence time of 5 minutes and scalability is also demonstrated.

         <dc:description>The development of synthetic methods for the synthesis of organic azides is highly important, given their critical role in advancing click chemistry over the last twenty years. We report a reagent&#8208;economical, reliable, and scalable synthesis of alkyl azides from primary and secondary alcohols.

The method offers procedural ease, accommodates a wide array of substrates, and enables late&#8208;stage functionalization. Additionally, we demonstrate the protocol's adaptability by validating a straightforward one&#8208;pot deoxyazidation&#8208;CuAAC sequence for drug discovery applications.</dc:description>

Abstract
The enantioselective introduction of gem&#8208;difluorinated carbonyl (i.&#8201;e. &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro carbonyl) moieties into organic structures is a synthetically valuable but highly challenging approach. During the past decades, continuous efforts have been made for the developments of synthetic strategies for constructing C(sp3)&#8722;CF2COR chiral centers with high levels of enantioselectivities. This review summarizes and discusses the recent advance in the enantioselective construction of gem&#8208;difluorinated carbonyl moieties, which are organized according to the reaction categories.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Direct Hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Epoxy Ketones and &#945;&#8208;Ketoamides at Room Temperature</title>

Abstract
Chemoselective hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy ketones and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides is achieved at room temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C) using 2.0&#8197;bar H2 and a pincer&#8208;ligated Mn(I) catalyst that provides synthetically valuable &#945;&#8208;hydroxy epoxides and &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amides. This protocol applies to a wide range of alkyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy ketones, including terpenes (&#945;&#8208;ionone, nootkatone, and R&#8208;carvone)&#8208; and steroids (testosterone and progesterone)&#8208;derived epoxy ketones, and tolerates H2 sensitive functionalities, such as halides, acetyl, nitrile, nitro, epoxide, alkenyl and alkynyl groups. Additionally, &#945;&#8208;ketoamides bearing reducible functional groups, including acetyl and diazo benzene, were untouched under this protocol and selectively converted to &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amides. A preliminary mechanistic study highlighted the metal&#8208;ligand cooperative H2 activation process.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review focuses on summarising the studies on transition metal catalysed transfer vinylation of alcohols using vinyl ethers and vinyl acetate as vinylating agents. Mercury, palladium, iridium and gold catalysts are discussed herein. Selected examples from publications and patents are given for the purpose of analysing functional group tolerance towards the methodology. In addition, mechanistic pathways are described.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Application of Primary Phosphine Oxides in Domino&#8208;Phospha&#8208;Aldol Reactions of Diketones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An approach for the preparation and stabilization of primary phosphine oxides is presented complementing previous methods of in&#8197;situ generation. Specifically, RP(O)H2 where R=benzyl (Bn), cyclohexyl (Cy), 2&#8208;naphthyl (2&#8208;Naph), phenyl (Ph), tert&#8208;butyl (t&#8208;Bu) was prepared by controlled oxidation of the corresponding primary phosphine in presence of ferrocene as stabilizing reagent. The primary phosphine oxides were characterized using NMR and MS and studied in twofold hydrophosphorylation of diketones. The&#160;domino&#8208;phospha&#8208;aldol reaction catalysed with 5&#8197;mol% of sodium methoxide yielded five&#8208;, six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered heterocyclic tertiary phosphine oxides with a high degree of stereoselectivity, as confirmed by single X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Furans: Three&#8208;Component Reactions Involving Ketene Dithioacetals, Acetylenes, and Phosphines to Generate Phosphorus Ylides or N&#8208;Acyliminophosphoranes</title>

Abstract
Synthesis of new polysubstituted furans incorporating reactive phosphorus ylides or N&#8208;acyliminophosphoranes was achieved by the heterocyclization of flexible &#945;&#8208;acyl ketene dithioacetals. This one&#8208;pot tandem reaction was initiated by acyl&#8208;directed desulfurative Sonogashira coupling, followed by 1,6&#8208;addition of phosphine to the in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated enynone and subsequent 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization, as well as phosphoranation. The selectivity toward the two products, i.&#8201;e. &#945;&#8208;phosphorus ylides vs. &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acyliminophosphoranes&#8208;substituted furans, was determined by both electron&#8208;deficient acetylenes and copper salts.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Sc(OTf)3/Cs2CO3&#8208;Assisted C&#8722;O Cross&#8208;Coupling of Vinylidenecyclopropane&#8208;Diesters with Phenolic Compounds</title>

Abstract
We herein describe a method in the synthesis of aryl ether derivatives from a cross&#8208;coupling reaction of vinylidenecyclopropane&#8208;diesters (VDCP&#8208;diesters) with commercially available phenolic compounds for the formation of C&#8722;O bond under palladium catalysis and assisted by Sc(OTf)3/Cs2CO3. This developed transformation proceeds through a nucleophilic addition at the 2&#8208;position of allenic moiety at 50&#8201;&#176;C for 4.0&#8197;h and is compatible with substituents such as bromine, iodine and borate on the phenolic substrates via a zwitterionic &#960;&#8208;propargyl palladium species, affording the desired products in 29% to 95% isolated yields. A plausible reaction mechanism has been also proposed on the basis of control, deuterium labeling experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Abstract
We report the addition reaction of lithium enol ethers to fluoroalkyl imines. A range of different fluoroalkyls and lithiated reagents are well tolerated. Diastereoselective addition of lithium vinyl ethers to fluoroalkyl N&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsulfinylimines is disclosed, providing enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;fluorinated amines in up to 98% yield. This general approach led to the diastereoselective formation of various amino alcohols and amino ethers, which are difficult to obtain by other methods.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Induced C&#8208;3 Carbamoylation of Quinoxalinones Assisted by EDA Complex</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted strategy for the decarboxylative C&#8208;3 carbamoylation of quinoxalinone scaffolds is developed. This approach initiates through the formation of an EDA complex between oxamic acid and quinoxalinone. Successive SET and decarboxylative carbamoylation construct the C&#8722;C bond. This method utilizes aerial oxygen as the green oxidant and eradicates the process from the use of external photocatalysts and transition metals. Detailed synthetic and photophysical studies enlighten the reaction pathway.

Abstract
Herein, we report a Pd&#8208;catalyzed aerobic lactamization of unactivated &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of aliphatic carboxylic acids and amino acids derivatives. The utilization of Pd(OAc)2 as a catalyst, along with catalytic AgNO2 as an electron transfer mediator, circumvents the need for stoichiometric oxidants and demonstrates significant practicality.

Abstract
Vicinal halohydrins are key building blocks to produce bioactive molecules and drugs, especially if they can be obtained in enantiomerically pure form. In this study, we present a bi&#8208;enzymatic sequence that allows to obtain vic&#8208;halohydrins through a photochemoenzymatic olefin hydroxy halogenation followed by a lipase catalysed kinetic resolution. The absolute configuration of the resulting products was determined using Mosher's method

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclohexenone(aryl)iodonium Salts and Their Application in Construction of Fused aza&#8208;Heterocyclic Skeletons</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A class of cyclohexenone(aryl)iodonium salts was readily prepared from 2&#8208;iodocyclohexenones and arenes under mild conditions. This novel series of hypervalent iodonium building blocks exhibits dual characteristics of hyperiodonium salts and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated cyclic ketones, enabling access to intricate aza&#8208;heterocycles. The reaction of these cyclohexenone(aryl)iodonium salts with arylamines and benzene sulfonamides affords 2&#8208;acylaziridines, while with 1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines leads to the formation of the 1H&#8208;imidazoimidazole&#8208;fused compounds. The transformation is postulated to proceed through an exclusive hyperiodonium&#8208;mediated N&#8208;Michael addition followed by N&#8208;annulation cascade.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances on Direct Phosphorothiolation Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organophosphorothioates are organic molecules containing sulfur and phosphorus, with significant biological activity and physicochemical properties, widely used in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, and the agrochemical industry. In particular, many phosphorothioates display a variety of biological activities, such as antifungal, antibacterial, anti&#8208;parasite, anticancer, and so on. Traditionally, the synthesis of phosphorothioates has mainly relied on indirect methods involving the construction of S&#8208;P bond. In recent years, direct phosphorothiolation has gained attention as a reliable and rapid method for introducing the &#8208;S&#8208;P(O)(OR)2 group into parent molecules. This article reviews the latest advances in direct phosphorothiolation reactions, categorized based on the different sources of the &#8208;S&#8208;P(O)(OR)2 group.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative photochemical cyclisations to access spiroketals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The spiroketal moiety is an important substructure within many biological natural products.  One method to access them is via the oxidative cyclisation of a pendant hydroxyl group on to a pre&#8208;formed pyran.  However applications of this methodology have been severely limited by requiring the use of toxic and powerful oxidants, such as lead (IV) tetraacetate or mercuric oxide.  Herein we report a novel and high yielding photochemical route to prepare complex spiroketals using a photochemical oxidative approach with mild and non&#8208;toxic reagents and demonstrate the methodology to the synthesis of a number of insect pheromones.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Oxaspirocyclohexadienones via Lewis&#8208;Acid Catalyzed [2+3]&#8208;Annulations of p&#8208;Quinone Methides and Iodonium Ylides</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a mild method for the synthesis of oxaspirocyclohexadienones by using a combination of Lewis acid&#8208;HFIP mediated [2+3]&#8208;annulation of p&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) and iodonium ylides. The proposed mechanism proceeds through a one&#8208;pot sequence of carbonyl activation/cyclopropyl formation/Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement to provide a broad range of oxaspirocyclohexadienones in moderate to high yields. Interestingly, the spiro&#8208;annulated products were further converted to tetrahydroxanthane derivatives via BF3.OEt2 mediated dienone&#8208;phenol rearrangement pathway. Moreover, the spiro&#8208;annulated derivatives also showed a moderate anti&#8208;tuberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra ATCC25177.

         <title>Deep Study of Thiocarbamoyl Fluorides: Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Thiocarbamoyl fluoride is an understudied fluorinated group, mainly due to the paucity of data on its properties. Herein, an in&#8208;depth study of the stability of thiocarbamoyl fluorides, especially under near&#8208;physiological conditions, is described. Since efficient and easy to implement syntheses of these compounds are still under&#8208;described, a new method, based on the use of a trifluoromethanesulfenamide, a well&#8208;described reagent, has also been developed. This trifluoromethanesulfenamide turned out to be able to generate in&#8197;situ difluorothiophosgene, which was able to react rapidly with amines to provide various thiocarbamoyl fluorides.

Abstract
Indan&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones stand as versatile precursors to a plethora of complex molecules with wide applications; however, their direct cross&#8208;coupling methodologies remain largely unexplored. Herein, we unveil an in&#8197;situ triflation&#8208;tandem cross&#8208;coupling strategy to synthesize a diverse variety of indenones and benzofulvenes from indan&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones. The successful synthesis of a neolignan natural product and the key intermediate of Indatraline (antidepressant) showcased the synthetic utility of the methodology. The strategy enabled tuning the electronic characteristics of indenones and benzofulvenes, modulating the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps. The photophysical properties of these molecules were studied, and the experimental results were compared with the predictions obtained from the DFT studies.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8722;Catalyzed Synthesis of Cyclic Sulfamides via an Intramolecular Dehydrative Amination of Allylic Alcohols: A Strategy for 1,3&#8208;Diamine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular dehydrative amination method has been developed to synthesize diverse cyclic sulfamides efficiently. Reactions proceed smoothly at room temperature using a combination of (IPr)AuCl (5&#8197;mol%) and AgBF4 (5&#8197;mol%). This method showcases a broad substrate scope, encompassing challenging seven&#8208;membered ring structures, and exhibits functional group compatibility. Moreover, the reaction demonstrates high stereoselectivity, allowing the synthesis of enantiomerically enriched cyclic sulfamides from chiral secondary allylic alcohols. The synthesized cyclic sulfamides serve as valuable intermediates for generating 1,3&#8208;diamines. This approach provides an improved route for cyclic sulfamide synthesis and a strategic entry point for obtaining essential 1,3&#8208;diamine derivatives.

         <title>g&#8208;C3N4 Photocatalyzed Decarboxylative Oxidation of Carboxylic Acids and the Oxidation of Alkenes and Alkanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The decarboxylative oxygenation of readily available carboxylic acids as well as the oxidation of alkenes and alkanes has been accomplished through visible light using g&#8208;C3N4 as a robust and recyclable catalyst. The scalable protocol furnishes an array of aldehydes and ketones under mild reaction conditions, requiring only molecular oxygen as an oxidant. Notably, no addition of stochiometric amounts of base is required, and furthermore, the reaction proceeds efficiently open to the air.

         <title>Metal&#8208;free photocyclization/oxidation cascade constructing quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones and tetrahydrocarbazolones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reported a one&#8208;pot photocyclization/ oxidation cascade of N&#8208;aryl acrylamides to afford quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones. Thioxanthone was used as a bifunctional energy transfer agent to mediate both photocyclization and generation of singlet oxygen, the latter facilitates the dehydrogenation of dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;one intermediate. This cascade strategy also supports the 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization to synthesize tetrahydrocarbazolones from phenylamino cyclohexenones.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dearomative trifluoromethylation of arenes provides an ideal method for constructing CF3&#8208;containing three&#8208;dimensional architectures which are of increasing interest in drug discovery. However, such transformation is rare and challenging because of the inherently low reactivity of arene &#960;&#8208;systems and selectivity issues. Herein, we disclose a general dearomative 1,2&#8208;hydrotrifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes utilizing activation by temporary &#960;&#8208;complexation to chromium, thus affording convenient access to 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes bearing the privileged CF3 group. The versatility of this strategy further enables a dearomative 1,2&#8208;deuterotrifluoromethylation with high deuterated ratios. The related dearomative 1,2&#8208;(deutero)hydroperfluoroethylation reactions were conducted well for a range of chromium&#8208;bound (hetero)arenes. Finally, a reasonable mechanism was proposed based on the intermediate capture and control experiments.</dc:description>

Abstract
We are reporting the preparation and use in cross&#8208;coupling reactions of a newly developed, bench&#8208;stable (1&#8208;fluorocyclopropyl)metalloid reagent. The Stille cross&#8208;coupling reaction described for this &#945;&#8208;fluorinated stannane reagent is amenable to a wide range of aryl and alkenyl (pseudo)halides bearing a variety of functional groups. An enantioenriched cross&#8208;coupled product was also obtained from the corresponding 1&#8208;fluorocyclopropyltin reagent bearing an ester handle. Finally, the chemical stability of the 1&#8208;fluorocyclopropyl moiety was also demonstrated by performing several post&#8208;functionalizations.

         <title>Three Component Cascade Processes Involving Palladium Catalyzed Transformations/Dipolar Cycloadditions for the Synthesis of Angular Heterotriquinane Derivatives</title>

Abstract
Combining chemical reactivities of allenes and oximes created a methodology for the preparation of heterocyclic triquinane&#8208;type skeletons via a cascade process constructing four bonds in a single step. The initial reaction of allene moiety promoted by Pd&#8208;catalysis, affording &#960;&#8208;allyl Pd&#8208;species, was followed by two additional transformations &#8208; nucleophilic displacement and dipolar cycloaddition &#8208; to furnish the product highly stereoselectively in moderate to good yields. For the process to be efficient, it was necessary to use a dipolarophilic component as a solvent. Intriguingly, while the reaction with cyclopentanone derived oxime progressed through the whole cascade, with cyclohexanone analogue it stopped at the nitrone stage, requiring an additional step to yield similar type of products. Some aspects of the studied cascade were examined by DFT.

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Decarboxylative Mannich Reaction for the Synthesis of Non&#8208;Natural &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids Bearing Alkynyl Groups</title>

Abstract
Asymmetric decarboxylative Mannich addition of &#946;&#8208;keto acids or malonic acid half&#8208;esters to &#946;,&#947;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketimino esters catalyzed by cinchona alkaloid&#8208;derived squaramide has been developed. The reaction proceeded by forming a nucleophilic enolate after decarboxylation, followed by its addition to &#946;,&#947;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketimino esters facilitated by the bifunctional catalyst. A broad range of substrates with various substituents are tolerated in this reaction, yielding a series of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acid derivatives bearing alkynyl functional groups in high yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities. The practicality of this method was demonstrated by a gram&#8208;scale reaction and subsequent elaboration of the Mannich adducts.

         <title>Stereoselective Organocatalyzed Glycosylation of Glycosyl Trichloroacetimidate Donors: Thiouracil as Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we report thiouracil&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;selective O&#8208;glycosylations employing easily accessible glycosyl trichloroacetimidate donors without using any co&#8208;catalyst or additive. A variety of alcohol nucleophiles including saccharides, and amino acids with different protecting groups containing glycosyl trichloroacetimidate donors were successfully &#945;&#8208;glycosylated using an operationally simple protocol. Moreover, mechanistic investigations suggest that thiouracil functions as Br&#248;nsted acid/base catalyst in this glycosylation process.

         <title>Oxidative Rearrangement Approach for the Ring Contraction of N&#8722;H Piperidines to Pyrrolidines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We have developed a method for ring contraction of N&#8722;H piperidines using oxidative rearrangement with PhI(OAc)2. The reaction forms iminium ion intermediates that are effectively trapped by nucleophiles (e.&#8201;g., NaBH4, H2O) yielding the corresponding pyrrolidine derivatives. Additionally, we propose an ionic mechanism supported by experiments and density&#8208;functional theory calculations.

         <title>Nanocellulose as Reaction Medium for FeCl3&#8208;Mediated Mechanochemical Deaminative Fluorination of (Hetero)aromatic Amines</title>

Abstract
The development of an efficient alternative to the widely employed Balz&#8208;Schiemann deaminative fluorination method (i.&#8201;e. without using aryl diazonium tetrafluoroborate salt) is a challenging task. Herein, we report a convenient one&#8208;pot method for the FeCl3&#8208;nanocellullose mediated mechanochemical synthesis of fluoroarenes through the selective substitution of an aromatic amino group by fluorine group using pyrylium tetrafluoroborate (Pyry&#8208;BF4) and sodium fluoride (NaF) via in&#8197;situ formation of pyridinium salt intermediate. The scope of the present protocol includes synthesis of thirty&#8208;four organofluorine compounds with excellent yields via a selective substitution (SNAr) of an amino group by fluorine. The presented concise methodology opens a pathway to access new chemical spaces for the late&#8208;stage functionalization in pharmaceutical industries.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8208;)&#8208;Daphenylline by Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Dearomatization Reaction of Methoxynaphthalene</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Daphenylline, a structurally unique triterpenoid Daphniphyllum alkaloid, has attracted considerable attention from the synthetic community since its isolation. Herein, we delineate an enantioselective total synthesis of (&#8208;)&#8208;daphenylline, which is based on a gold&#8208;catalyzed dearomatization reaction of &#946;&#8208;methoxynaphthalene. Other features include installation of the initial chiral stereocenter via an enantioselective rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of an indene derivative; construction of the other vital stereocenter by organocatalytic asymmetric Mukaiyama&#8211;Michael reaction of a structurally complex benzofused cyclohexanone; and a tandem reductive amination/amidation double cyclization reaction to assemble the distinctive azapolycyclic cage&#8208;like architecture.</dc:description>

Herein, we delineate an enantioselective total synthesis of (-)-daphenylline, which is based on a gold-catalyzed dearomatization reaction of &#946;-methoxynaphthalene. Other features include installation of the initial chiral stereocenter via an enantioselective rhodium-catalyzed hydrogenation of an indene derivative; construction of the other vital stereocenter by organocatalytic asymmetric Mukaiyama&#8211;Michael reaction of a structurally complex benzofused cyclohexanone; and a tandem reductive amination/amidation double cyclization reaction to assemble the distinctive azapolycyclic cage-like architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
