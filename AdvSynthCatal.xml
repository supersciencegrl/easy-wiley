         <title>Divergent Synthesis of 3&#8208;Trifluoroethyl Benzofurans Through Rh&#8208;Catalyzed C&#63743;C Bond Activation Coupled with Transfer Hydrogenation</title>

Divergent synthesis of 4&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto&#8208; and 4&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;trifluoroethyl benzofurans has been realized through Rh&#8208;catalyzed atom&#8208;economical skeletal reorganizations of readily accessible trifluoromethyl alkene&#8208;tethered benzocyclobutenols. These transformations proceed via complicated sequences involving C&#63743;C bond activation, migratory insertion, &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination, chain walking, and inter&#8208; or intramolecular transfer hydrogenation.

The strategic incorporation of the pharmacologically privileged trifluoroethyl group into the biologically significant benzofuran scaffold offers considerable potential for medicinal and agrochemical applications. Herein, an atom&#8208;economical synthetic approach to 3&#8208;trifluoroethyl benzofurans through Rh&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of readily available trifluoromethyl alkene&#8208;tethered benzocyclobutenols is reported. This transformation proceeds via a mechanistically intricate sequence involving C&#63743;C bond activation, migratory insertion, &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination, chain walking, and transfer hydrogenation. By modulation of reaction conditions, both intermolecular and intramolecular transfer hydrogenation pathways have been developed, leading to the divergent synthesis of 4&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto&#8208; and 4&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;trifluoroethyl benzofurans.

         <title>Electrochemical Imidoyl Radical&#8208;Involved Functionalization of Isocyanides to Construct Benzotriazole&#8208;Sulfonamide and Guanidine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical synthesis methods are developed for benzotriazole&#8208;benzenesulfonamide derivatives using benzotriazoles, isocyanides, and benzenesulfonamides as substrates, and electrochemical synthesis methods for guanidine derivatives using benzotriazoles and isocyanides as substrates. Both methods require no exogenous chemical oxidants and can be carried out at room temperature.

Benzotriazoles and benzenesulfonamides arewidely present in various bioactive molecules, so the development of mild and convenientsynthetic strategies to synthesize compounds containing these functional groups is crucial for discovering candidate therapeutic drugs with higher efficacy and fewer side effects. Herein, we report an imidoyl radical&#8208;involved electrochemical method for the difunctionalization of isocyanides with benzotriazoles and benzenesulfonamides, and also realize the electrochemical reaction of isocyanides with benzotriazoles to construct guanidine derivatives. This strategy achieves the difunctionalization of isocyanide under the action of a base, with benzotriazole as the radical precursor and sulfonamide as the nucleophile. Either does not require a chemical oxidant and can be carried out at room temperature.

         <title>Harnessing Carbenoid Reactivity From Imidazoles and Oxiranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of azole compounds and oxiranes exhibits carbenoid reactivity at elevated temperatures, as demonstrated by the successful benzoin condensation of aromatic aldehydes. Using this catalytic system to polymerize bifunctional aldehyde/oxirane monomers yields thermosets with glass transition temperatures above 100&#176;C.

The combination of azole compounds, such as 1&#8208;methylimidazole and oxiranes (e.g., phenyl glycidyl ether) gives carbenoid reactivity at elevated temperatures. Benzoin condensation was performed with 5 mol% azole and 10 mol% oxirane under air at temperatures of 70&#176;C and above, achieving conversions of up to 85% of benzaldehyde and yields of up to 64% of benzoin. The lower benzoin yield is due to the formation of oxidative benzoin follow&#8208;up products under these reaction conditions. A variety of combinations of azole compounds and oxiranes have been shown to catalyze benzoin condensation. Thus, a modular, potentially inexpensive method of generating carbenoid reactivity has been revealed. The proposed mechanism for catalyst formation involves oxirane opening by, for example, 1&#8208;methylimidazole, which forms a zwitterionic methylimidazolium adduct with the oxirane. Then, the acidic proton in the 2&#8208;position of the imidazolium core is deprotonated by the zwitterion's alkoxide releasing the corresponding N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC). In addition to its primary function, surplus oxirane serves as a scavenger, removing acidic byproducts that are formed from the aldehyde through oxidative NHC catalysis. This property enables benzoin condensation without the exclusion of oxygen. The practical utility of this catalytic system was demonstrated by polymerizing simple bifunctional aldehyde/oxirane monomers&#8212;namely, 4&#8208;(2&#8208;oxiranylmethoxy)&#8208;benzaldehyde, 3&#8208;(2&#8208;oxiranylmethoxy)&#8208;benzaldehyde, and vanillin&#8208;based 2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8208;oxiranylmethoxy)&#8208;benzaldehyde&#8212;using 5 mol% 1&#8208;methylimidazole in a solventless manner and without excluding air. The monomers polymerized via both the formyl and the oxirane groups, yielded thermosets with glass transition temperatures above 100&#176;C.

         <title>Design and Utilization of Stable Hydrofluoroolefin&#8208;Based Trifluoropropynyl Surrogate for Sonogashira Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel methodology for the construction of aromatic and heteroaromatic trifluoropropynyl derivatives has been developed. The new protocol is based on a tandem Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction between a bench&#8208;stable trifluoropropynyl carbinol reagent, generated from the commercially available and inexpensive hydrofluoroolefin&#8208;1234yf gas, and (hetero)aryl iodides, leading to a wide scope of trifluoromethylated (hetero)arylacetylenes.

The synthesis of aromatic trifluoromethylated scaffolds is of considerable importance in organic chemistry and pharmaceutical research. Herein, a catalytic method with broad functional group tolerance for the construction of aromatic and heteroaromatic trifluoropropynyl derivatives is reported. This methodology is based on a tandem Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction between an hydrofluoroolefins&#8208;based carbinol and (hetero)aryl iodides. The developed protocol employs inexpensive and commercially available HFO&#8208;1234yf gas to generate a bench&#8208;stable trifluoropropynyl carbinol reagent.

A P4S10&#8208;promoted [5+1] spiroannulation of 2&#8208;(2&#8208; nitrophenyl) indoles with cyclic ketones for the preparation of spirocyclic tetrahydrocarbolines is developed. This transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free approach provides an efficient and practical pathway toward structurally valuable spirocyclic tetrahydrocarbolines.

An NH4I&#8208;promoted three&#8208;component cascade cyclization reaction for the modular synthesis of maleimide&#8208;fused benzocarbazoles and maleimide&#8208;fused indoles has been developed. The present approach starts from readily available indoles/pyrroles, cyclohexanones, and maleimides, affording variety of maleimide&#8208;fused benzocarbazoles and maleimide&#8208;fused indoles in 40&#8211;83% yields under metal&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Azide&#8208;Selenoalkyne Cycloadditions: A Combined Synthetic&#8211;Computational Study into Reaction Scope, Mechanism, and Origins of Regioselectivity</title>

A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (RuAAC) reaction is reported for the synthesis of selenium&#8208;substituted triazole products. Reaction regioselectivity is dependent on the identity of the non&#8208;selenium substituent of the alkyne, which challenges the perceived understanding of RuAAC regioselectivity. Computational modeling has accurately reproduced the experimental results and provided insights into the origins of regioselectivity.

A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (RuAAC) reaction involving selenoalkynes is reported for the synthesis of selenium&#8208;substituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazole products (26 examples, up to 89% yield). The reaction works well with a wide range of alkyl and aryl azides bearing both electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing groups. This contrasts RuAAC reactions using regular terminal and internal alkynes, where aryl azides bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups are not generally tolerated. The regioselectivity of the cycloaddition is highly dependent on the identity of the non&#8208;selenium substituent of the alkyne. This challenges earlier reports on RuAAC reactions involving thioalkynes and questions the perceived understanding of the regioselectivity of these reactions. Computational modeling of the reaction profiles for four alkyne substrates that provided contrasting regioselectivities accurately reproduces the experimental results. The observed regioselectivity is primarily attributed to the relative nucleophilicity of the alkyne carbons upon coordination to ruthenium and an approach is proposed in which reaction regioselectivity may be predicted.

A dual photocatalytic system of o&#8208;PQ and Sn(OTf)2 enables visible light&#8208;induced Mannich&#8208;type addition of ethers to nitrones via Csp&#179;&#8211;H activation. This oxidant&#8208;free method offers broad scope and good yields.

An additive&#8208;free photochemical atom&#8208;transfer radical addition of fluoroiodomethyl sulfoxide to [1.1.1]propellane provides fluoromethyl&#8208;bicyclopentane sulfonium reagents, enabling nucleophilic substitution under mild conditions.

Fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) have emerged as an attractive scaffold in drug discovery. Herein, the modular construction of fluoromethyl&#8208;linked BCPs is reported. Fluoroiodomethyl phenyl sulfoxide is found to be a synthetic equivalent of a formal fluoromethylene radical cation synthon, which, under metal&#8208;free conditions and violet light irradiation (400&#8201;nm), enables an atom&#8208;transfer radical addition reaction to [1.1.1]propellane. This straightforward approach provides access to novel bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;substituted fluoromethyl sulfonium reagents. The electrophilic properties of these sulfonium salts allow nucleophilic displacement under mild conditions, enabling the introduction of the fluoromethyl bicyclopentyl group into diverse natural products and drug molecules with good functional group tolerance.

Construction of meta&#8208;Disubstituted Triaryls via Iodine&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Aromatization Coupling of Cycloalkenes with Indoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 23, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxidative aromatization coupling strategy has been developed for the construction of meta&#8208;substituted unsymmetric triaryls using various substituted cyclohexenes and indoles. It is expected that this protocol may be of broad interest in chemistry community and constitutes a practical alternative to the synthesis of natural products, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials.

meta&#8208;Disubstituted triaryls are privileged scaffolds in bioactive molecules and functional materials, but their efficient synthesis remains challenging, due to limitations in regioselectivity and reliance on prefunctionalized substrates or transition metals. Herein, an iodine&#8208;catalyzed oxidative aromatization strategy is reported for the construction of meta&#8208;triaryls via direct coupling of readily available cycloalkenes with indoles. This protocol enables regioselective C&#63743;C bond formation at the indole C3&#8208;position and a subsequent dehydrogenative desaturation of the cycloalkene component to form the meta&#8208;substituted arene motif. The method features broad substrate scope, accommodating diverse substituted cycloalkenes and indoles. Key advantages include economical catalyst (HI as iodine source), avoidance of precious metals, and operational simplicity. Additionally, the products can undergo an array of synthetic transformations, including heterocycle skeleton editing to quinolines, halogenations, and photoredox functionalizations, which highlight the potential applications of this strategy.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Controlled C&#8211;H Cyanation or Thiocyanation of Indolizines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 23, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced method for the C&#8211;H cyanation/thiocyanation of indolizine derivatives has been developed by using NH4SCN as the cyano or thiocyano source.

An efficient and controlled approach for C&#8211;H cyanation/thiocyanation of indolizines is reported under visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced conditions. NH4SCN is used as the cyano or thiocyano source and the presence or absence of H2O2 are found to be the key factor in the selective construction of C&#8208;3 cyano or thiocyano indolizines. A set of control experiments, such as radical trapping experiments and fluorescence quenching studies are conducted to assess mechanistic insights of the reaction.

NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SCN is used as the cyano or thiocyano source and the presence or absence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are found to be the key factor in the selective construction of C-3 cyano or thiocyano indolizines. A set of control experiments, such as radical trapping experiments and fluorescence quenching studies are conducted to assess mechanistic insights of the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cleaner Production of Acetals/Ketals Using a Phosphorus&#8208;Doped Biomass&#8208;Based Carbon Catalyst via Acetalization Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 23, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of novel phosphorus&#8208;doped carbon catalysts is carried out for the acetalization of aldehydes and ketones toward acetals and ketals under mild conditions (60 &#176;C, atmospheric pressure). This catalyst, showing high conversion (87.1%) and selectivity (&gt;99.9%), offers an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional methods. The work highlights the crucial role of P&#8208;doping in modulating the acid properties of the catalyst for enhanced performance.

The transformation of aldehydes and ketones into acetals and ketals has garnered significant attention due to their wide applications as fragrances, bio&#8208;oil additives, and organic synthetic intermediates. Conventional acetalization methods, however, often rely on corrosive acids or stoichiometric additives, necessitating harsh conditions and increasing production costs. Here, the development of a phosphorus&#8208;doped carbon catalyst is presented, that enables the acetalization of aldehydes and ketones into acetals and ketals under mild conditions (e.g., 60 &#176;C, atmospheric pressure). This catalyst achieves a high yield of 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (87.1%) from benzaldehyde and exhibits exceptional stability, operating continuously for 120&#8201;h in a continuous fixed&#8208;bed reactor. In the continuous reaction, the yield of 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane remains over 96% in the first 18&#8201;h and slightly decreases to 86% after 120&#8201; h of continuous operation. Comprehensive physicochemical characterizations reveal that phosphorus acts as a Lewis acid sites and plays a critical role in modulating the Lewis acid sites of the PC catalysts. This work highlights the significance of optimizing acid properties for the efficient acetalization reaction, offering a promising approach to sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation on an NHC&#8208;Catalyzed [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] Annulation of 2&#8208;Bromoenals with &#946;&#8208;Oxodithioester: Mechanism, Origins of Stereoselectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 23, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism and origin of selectivities of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] annulation reaction have been systematically investigated using density functional theory method. The key roles of Lewis acid are also elucidated through the solvent&#8211;solute interaction model.

An increasing number of studies have demonstrated the cooperative use of chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and Lewis acid to enhance catalytic efficiency in stereoselective annulation reactions. Herein, molecular&#8208;level insights into the NHC&#8208;catalyzed [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] annulation of 2&#8208;bromoenals with &#946;&#8208;oxodithioester are elucidated through density functional theory calculations. The reaction proceeds via multiple key steps: formation of the Breslow intermediate, C&#63743;Br bond cleavage, &#945;&#8208;protonation generating &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acylazolium, stereoselective Si&#8208;face addition between the acylazolium and LiCl&#8208;coordinated &#946;&#8208;oxodithioester, intramolecular proton transfer, and catalyst regeneration. The stereoselectivity&#8208;determining C&#63743;C bond formation step exhibits enhanced facial control through cooperative effects. Noncovalent interaction (NCI) and atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules analyses reveal that hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, LP&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;, and O&#183;&#183;&#183;S interactions preferentially stabilize the RS&#8208;configured isomer. Notably, LiCl plays dual roles: (1) it amplifies stereocontrol by facilitating multiple NCIs during the C&#63743;C bond formation, and (2) reduces transition&#8208;state polarity through solvent&#8211;solute interactions, thereby lowering the activation barrier. The work deepens the understanding of how Lewis acid additive modulate both electronic and steric landscapes in NHC catalysis, offering valuable insights for stereocontrolled annulation reactions.

A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed protocol for a hydrocarbamoylation of allamines with readily accessible 4&#8208;carboxyamido Hantzsch esters under metal&#8208;free and mild conditions is reported.

Herein, a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed protocol for allylamine hydrocarbamoylation under metal&#8208;free and mild conditions is reported. The proposed method utilizes readily accessible 4&#8208;carboxyamido Hantzsch esters as convenient substrates that deliver carbamoyl radicals upon a visible light&#8208;mediated SET process. Their addition to various allylamines proceeds with good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent efficiency and with high levels of regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity to provide the corresponding &#947;&#8208;amino acid amides.

A photoinduced hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and halogen atom transfer cascade, propelled by in situ&#8208;produced boryl radicals from amine&#8211;borane adducts, facilitates chemoselective C(sp2)&#8211;H alkylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. Utilizing easily accessible alkyl iodides and ambient air as an oxidizing agent, this metal&#8208;free approach offers extensive substrate generality, elevated regioselectivity, and functional group tolerance for the late&#8208;stage diversification of heterocycles.

The chemoselective activation of alkyl halides under mild and sustainable conditions continues to pose an ongoing issue in C&#8211;H functionalization chemistry. A metal&#8208;free, photoinduced sequential hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and halogen atom transfer (XAT) method that utilizes transient boryl radicals produced in situ from stable amine&#8208;borane adducts is presented. This platform facilitates effective C(sp2)&#8211;H alkylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones through a synergistic HAT/XAT cascade, utilizing easily accessible alkyl iodides and ambient air as the terminal oxidant. The approach demonstrates broad substrate generality, elevated regioselectivity, and favorable functional group compatibility, enabling late&#8208;stage diversification of pharmaceutically significant heterocycles under operationally simple conditions.

         <title>Installation of Trifluoromethylated Quaternary Carbon Stereocenters via Asymmetric Epoxidation of Tetrasubstituted Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 23, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic enantioselective epoxidation of acyclic tetrasubstituted alkenes, bearing a trifluoromethyl group, is reported. In the presence of Takemoto's thiourea organocatalyst and tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide, epoxides are obtained with excellent yield and good to high enantioselectivity. Computational studies provide insights into the reaction mechanism and stereocontrol. Densely functionalized trifluoromethylated compounds, bearing two vicinal quaternary stereocenters, are obtainable via epoxide derivatization.

The construction of vicinal quaternary carbon centers via epoxidation of tetrasubstituted alkenes remains a formidable challenge in asymmetric synthesis. Herein, a first catalytic enantioselective epoxidation of acyclic tetrasubstituted alkenes is reported, prepared through the Knoevenagel condensation of trifluoromethyl ketones with malononitrile. (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;configured epoxides are obtained in generally excellent yields (up to 98%) and with good to high enantioselectivities (up to 89% ee), employing a commercially available system, comprising Takemoto's catalysts and tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP). Highly reactive new tetrasubtituted alkenes allow the first successful use of Takemoto's catalyst under oxidative conditions. Interestingly, density functional theory studies show that TBHP is exclusively activated by the amino thiourea, with halogen&#8208;bonding interactions playing a critical role in affecting the stereochemical outcome of the epoxidation. Derivatizations provide access to densely functionalized trifluoromethylated compounds, featuring one or two vicinal carbon quaternary stereocenters, with the second center being introduced in a highly stereoselective manner.

The study presents dearomative higher&#8208;order cycloaddition as an effective strategy for constructing the biologically important dihydropyrimidin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;one core. The method employs indole&#8208;7&#8208;carbaldehydes as precursors of higherenes, which, under N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis, generate NHC&#8208;bound aza&#8208;o&#8208;quinodimethanes. These intermediates undergo asymmetric cycloaddition with cyclic trifluoromethyl ketimines, serving as hetero&#8208;higherenophiles, enabling rapid formation of structurally complex molecules in a single step.

In this article, we demonstrate that dearomative higher&#8208;order cycloaddition constitutes a useful method for the construction of biologically relevant dihydropyrimidin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;one scaffold. The reaction utilizes indole&#8208;7&#8208;carbaldehydes acting as higherene precursors that under N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis, lead to the generation of NHC&#8208;bound aza&#8208;o&#8208;quinodimethanes. Their cycloaddition with cyclic trifluoromethyl ketimines, acting as hetero&#8208;higherenophiles, proceeds in an asymmetric fashion opening access to high molecular complexity in a single step.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 23, December 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advancements in transition metal catalysis have enabled efficient strategies for constructing C&#8211;S bonds via olefin functionalization. This review summarizes recent developments in hydrothiolation, carbothiolation, and related sulfonylative transformations, with an emphasis on chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selective synthesis of complex sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Mechanistic insights, current challenges, and future research directions are also discussed. 

The development of efficient and selective strategies for constructing C&#63743;S bonds has garnered significant attention in organic and medicinal chemistry, owing to the widespread presence of this linkage in biologically active molecules, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional materials. Among the various approaches, alkene thiolation and sulfonylation stand out as one of the most straightforward methods for organosulfur synthesis, enabling the direct introduction of sulfur&#8208;containing functionalities into unsaturated hydrocarbons. This review provides a comprehensive summary of recent advances (2013&#8211;present) in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;S bond formation via alkene thiolation and sulfonylation. We systematically discuss the synthetic methodologies, including transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrothiolation, carbothiolation, hydrosulfonylation, and carbosulfonylation, highlighting their respective substrate scope, chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, enantioselectivity, and reaction mechanisms. By consolidating the latest developments and critical perspectives, this review aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers, encouraging further exploration and innovation in this dynamic field. The continued evolution of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;S bond formation is expected to unlock new opportunities in drug discovery, materials science, and synthetic methodology.

The carbocations generated through electrochemical Hofer&#8208;Moest pathways can be trapped by diverse nucleophiles or undergo elimination to form alkenes, significantly expanding synthetic versatility. This review systematically surveys advances in electrochemical Hofer&#8208;Moest reactions since 2019, categorizing transformations by bond&#8208;forming events. The review concludes by highlighting key challenges and proposing strategic research directions in this rapidly evolving field.

In contrast to radical&#8208;mediated electrochemical decarboxylative couplings, electrochemical decarboxylative functionalizations proceeding through carbocation intermediates (Hofer&#8208;Moest pathway) unlock unique reactivity and selectivity. These in&#8201;situ&#8208;generated carbocations can be trapped by diverse nucleophiles or undergo elimination to form alkenes, significantly expanding synthetic versatility. This review systematically surveys advances in electrochemical Hofer&#8208;Moest&#8208;type reactions since 2019, categorizing transformations by bond&#8208;forming events (C&#63743;N, C&#63743;O, C&#63743;P, C&#63743;F, C&#63743;C, and C&#63742;C). Beyond summarizing key breakthroughs, it also provide balanced evaluation of current limitations to delineate the scope and applicability of these methods. Finally, persistent challenges are outlined and future research directions in this emerging field is proposed.

Substituted internal alkynes are one of the most important functional groups in organic chemistry, with broad applications ranging from biochemistry to material science, medicinal chemistry, and pharmaceutical research. Much effort has been made to explore efficient methodologies to introduce an alkyne moiety into molecules. Among alkynylation reagents, terminal alkynes are considered to be the ideal reagent compared to other substrates like halogenated alkynes and alkynyl hypervalent iodine since it avoids multistep synthesis of these substrates from terminal alkynes to meet the atom&#8208;economy criteria. In this review, we summarized recent achievements in the application of terminal alkynes for the alkynylation to afford substituted internal alkynes and alkynylation&#8208;triggered tandem reactions to yield carbo&#8208; and heterocycles, which exist abundantly in the nature as synthetic drugs, biologically active natural and non&#8208;natural products.

This review surveys dioxazolones as key nitrogen radical precursors for photocatalytic C&#63743;N bond formation. It highlights their application in nitrene transfer reactions toward amide synthesis and mechanistic insights, aiming to guide the development of green heteroatom&#8208;bond&#8208;forming strategies and foster their application in pharmaceutical and materials science.

As efficient nitrogen radical precursors, dioxazolones have emerged as key intermediates in photocatalytic C&#63743;N bond construction due to their mild reaction conditions, and generation of only CO2 as a byproduct. This review summarizes recent advances in the application of dioxazolones in photocatalytic nitrene transfer reactions, with a focus on synthetic methodologies for diverse amides and their derivatives and the mechanistic insights into different catalytic systems. The aim is to provide guidance for developing green and efficient C&#63743;N, S&#63743;N, P&#63742;N, and S&#63742;N bond formation strategies and to promote the application of photocatalytic nitrene transfer reactions in pharmaceutical and materials science.

A divergent Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed strategy transforms &#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxonium ylides into two distinct scaffolds under mild conditions. With [Ru(p&#8208;cymene)Cl2]2/Cu(OAc)2&#183;H2O, amination with amines yields biologically relevant &#945;&#8208;ketoamides, while homocoupling in their absence affords &#945;,&#945;,&#946;&#8208;tricarbonyl ylides. Both pathways proceed via a common Ru&#8208;carbene intermediate, display broad scope, and enable downstream heterocycle formation and late&#8208;stage modifications.

A divergent Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the efficient transformation of &#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxonium ylides into two distinct molecular scaffolds under mild conditions has been developed. In the presence of [Ru(p&#8208;cymene)Cl2]2 and Cu(OAc)2&#183;H2O, selective amidation with primary or secondary amines provides biologically relevant &#945;&#8208;ketoamides, whereas homocoupling in the absence of amines affords less explored &#945;,&#945;,&#946;&#8208;tricarbonyl sulfoxonium ylides. Both pathways proceed via a common Ru&#8208;carbene intermediate and exhibit broad substrate scope and functional group tolerance. The synthetic utility is further demonstrated by downstream transformations, including heterocycle formation and late&#8208;stage modifications.

We disclose an ionic liquid&#8208;catalyzed annulation of 2&#8208;arylanilines and diazo compounds via cascade Wolff rearrangement, which is different from the precedent similar transformation catalyzed by metal or acid via N&#8211;H insertion. A spectrum of diverse diazos are well compatible, especially unsymmetric diazo affords exclusive product through selective Wolff rearrangement. Mechanistic studies revealed that ionic liquid promoted tandem Wolff rearrangement, nucleophilic addition, and cyclization via the electrostatic interaction and hydrogen&#8208;bonding effect.

         <title>Hydricity Modulated Methylation of Indoles and Nitriles Using Methanol: Selective Synthesis of C3&#8208;Methylated Indoles, Bisindolylmethanes, and &#945;&#8208;Methylated Nitriles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemodivergent functionalization of indoles with methanol via borrowing hydrogen and interrupted borrowing hydrogen pathways was achieved using benzimidazole&#8208;based Ru(II) complexes. The product selectivity between C3&#8208;methylated indoles and bis(indolyl)methanes was effectively governed by tuning the hydricity of the Ru&#8208;H species through ligand backbone modification. This study demonstrates the pivotal role of metal hydricity in directing product outcomes, offering a versatile catalytic system with broad substrate scope.

The selective functionalization of indoles using methanol via borrowing hydrogen (BH) and interrupted borrowing hydrogen (I&#8208;BH) pathways offers a sustainable approach to access value&#8208;added molecules. Herein, the synthesis of a series of benzimidazole&#8208;functionalized cyclometalated (NC)&#8208;Ru(II) and (NN)&#8208;Ru(II) complexes and their application in the chemodivergent functionalization of indoles with methanol are reported, affording either C3&#8208;methylated indoles or bis(indolyl)methanes (BIMs). The product selectivity was governed by the hydricity of the Ru&#8211;H species, which was effectively tuned by ligand backbone modification. This varying catalytic behavior of these complexes under consideration toward the selective formation of different products was fairly understood by analyzing their electronic properties based on electrochemical and density functional theory studies. Additionally, the electron&#8208;rich (NC)&#8208;Ru complex facilitated the &#945;&#8208;methylation of phenylacetonitrile under relatively mild conditions. Finally, an array of control experiments and the identification of different intermediates aided in establishing the proposed mechanism.

A variety of imidazo&#8208;fuzed pyrazino[2,1166b]quinazolinone scaffolds were prepared in good to excellent yields through gold(I)166catalyzed and base166mediated intramolecular hydroamination reactions of N3166alkynyl quinazolinone tethered imidazoles. 5166Methylene imidazo166fuzed pyrazino[2,1166b]quinazolinones were obtained under gold(I)166catalyzed conditions, while base166mediated conditions afforded 5166alkyl imidazo166fuzed pyrazino[2,1166b]quinazolinones. Moreover, the prepared 5&#8208;methylene imidazo166fuzed pyrazino[2,1166b]quinazolinones could be applied in the various metal ions recognition based on their fluorescence properties.

Unlocking sulfonamide diversity through a light&#8208;driven copper catalyst: A one&#8208;step strategy bypasses preactivation, directly transforming these medicinally vital scaffolds into stereocontrolled (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;iodovinyl sulfones&#8212;molecular building blocks primed for drug discovery.

A dual&#8208;catalytic metallaphotoredox strategy repurposes sulfonamides as sulfonylating reagents via radical cascades, leveraging copper's dual role as photoredox mediator and coupling catalyst. Exemplified by iodosulfonylation of alkynes, the protocol achieves in&#8201;situ sulfonamide diazotization to generate sulfonyl radicals, followed by regioselective addition to alkynes and copper&#8208;catalyzed iodination. This all&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy eliminates the need for sulfonamide prefunctionalization, offering step&#8208;economy, operational simplicity, and broad functional group tolerance.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Enabled Organocatalyst&#8208;Assisted Enantioselective Regiodivergent Cascade Reactions: Overriding Intrinsic Reactivity of Vinylogous Pyrazolones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for enantioselective regiodivergent accessing complex spiro&#8208;pyrazolone scaffolds with multiple quaternary stereogenic centers is established. The enantioselective regiodivergent outcome of this protocol is tuned by the polarity of the solvent, thus providing both enantioselective regioisomers using quinine&#8208;derived bifunctional catalysts.

Enantioselective regiodivergent cascade reactions remain a significant challenge due to the dual requirement of achieving precise control over both regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. Herein, a quinine&#8208;derived bifunctional catalyst&#8208;driven strategy is presented for constructing the diverse asymmetric polycyclic spiro&#8208;pyrazolone scaffolds in a cascade manner. The cascade reaction is initiated by the asymmetric vinylogous Michael addition (VMA) of arylidene pyrazolones to the indandione&#8208;derived acceptors, followed by regioselective transformations that lead to structurally diverse products. The divergent reaction outcomes are governed by the interaction between the in situ generated conjugate acid of the catalyst and the anionic intermediate (VMA adduct). These outcomes are further modulated by adjustments in the reaction conditions, particularly the polarity of the solvent. In toluene, the reaction predominantly yields the cage product with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity via a cascade pathway involving asymmetric VMA/acetalization/oxa&#8208;Michael/Michael addition. In contrast, in MeCN, the reaction proceeds through an asymmetric VMA/proton transfer/aldol/acetalization, furnishing the fused product. Mechanistic studies reveal that the formation of the fused product involves an unusual and reversible reaction pathway. Specifically, the catalyst&#8208;controlled 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition of 1,3&#8208;indandione to the diene intermediate occurs under optimal conditions. This strategy demonstrates a versatile foundation for asymmetric regiodivergent cascade reactions.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Chemoselective Amide Bond Cleavage for the Synthesis of N&#8208;Acyl Sulfoximines in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable and metal&#8208;free protocol enables the chemoselective N&#63743;C bond cleavage of amides for the synthesis of N&#8208;acyl sulfoximines. Utilizing bench&#8208;stable N&#8208;acyl saccharin as an acyl source, this green process operates efficiently in both batch and continuous&#8208;flow systems, affording high yields, broad substrate scope, reagent recyclability, and significant reduction in reaction time.

Amides and sulfoximines are pivotal structural motifs in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals; however, sustainable and direct methods for their incorporation remain underdeveloped. Herein, a metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free protocol is presented for the efficient synthesis of N&#8208;acyl sulfoximines via selective N&#63743;C bond cleavage of amides, utilizing bench&#8208;stable N&#8208;acyl saccharin as an acylating agent for NH&#8208;sulfoximines. This transformation proceeds under mild conditions using green solvents and exhibits a broad substrate scope encompassing natural products and drug derivatives. Notably, the method is compatible with both batch and continuous&#8208;flow platforms, achieving a significant reduction in reaction time from 24&#8201;h to 15&#8201;min. The process offers high yields, excellent functional group tolerance, and gram&#8208;scale scalability. Furthermore, the recovery of recyclable saccharin enhances atom economy and minimizes waste generation.

A copper catalyst&#8208;controlled cascade annulation of CF3&#8208;imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides with activated nitriles has been developed, which enables the divergent synthesis of trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted pyrroles and quinolines, respectively.

A copper catalyst&#8208;controlled cascade annulation of CF3&#8208;imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides with activated nitriles has been disclosed, which enables the divergent synthesis of trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted pyrroles and quinolines. For the synthesis of pyrroles, the [3&#8201;+&#8201;2] annulation proceeds to give the multisubstituted pyrrole products. For the synthesis of quinolines, the CuI&#8208;induced intramolecular cyclization is involved in the reaction with the cleavage of C&#63743;CN bond.

This article presents a catalyst&#8208;free, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven strategy for the direct C&#63743;H functionalization of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. Using ambient air as the sole oxidant, this unified platform enables alkylation, arylation, and acylation under mild conditions. The protocol expands structural diversity of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones, offering a sustainable tool for late&#8208;stage functionalization and drug discovery.

Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and their derivatives constitute a privileged class of bioactive scaffolds with broad pharmacological potential, including anticancer, antibacterial, and neuroregulatory activities. Developing efficient and sustainable strategies for their molecular diversification under mild conditions remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. Here, we report a catalyst&#8208;free, light&#8208;driven C&#63743;H functionalization strategy that exploits visible light and ambient air as the sole oxidant to achieve direct alkylation, arylation, and acylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. This operationally simple protocol features excellent substrate scope and functional group tolerance, delivering a wide range of structurally diverse quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones derivatives in a rapid and sustainable manner. Mechanistic investigations, supported by control experiments and spectroscopic studies, reveal that the transformation proceeds via the excitation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor complexes, which endows this system with the unique capability of enabling efficient C&#63743;H functionalization without the need for any external catalyst.

         <dc:description>
Chiral sulfonimidoyl fluorides enable stereocontrolled SuFEx click chemistry for synthesizing enantioenriched S(VI) compounds, advancing covalent drug discovery and material design.

Sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) has emerged as a powerful click chemistry platform for covalent bond formation, with broad applications in drug discovery, polymer science, and bioconjugation. Among the diverse SuFEx linkers developed in recent years, sulfonimidoyl fluorides (RN=S(&#63742;O)F) have gained prominence due to their tunable electrophilicity, multifunctional modifiable sites, and the presence of chiral sulfur(VI) centers. This reagent exhibits exceptional reactivity in stereospecific SuFEx transformations, offering not only an efficient strategy for the synthesis of enantioenriched sulfur compounds but also a versatile foundation for covalent drug discovery and chemical probe development. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in sulfonimidoyl fluoride chemistry, with an emphasis on the construction of chiral S(VI) centers and stereocontrolled SuFEx reactions. Despite the limited literature in this nascent field, key breakthroughs and discuss future research directions, is consolidated providing forward&#8208;looking perspectives to stimulate further progress in stereospecific SuFEx chemistry.

         <dc:description>
A mild, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, and oxidant&#8208;free amination protocol for enones by employing user&#8208;friendly ammonium carbonate as the primary amino source was developed. When the ammonia surrogate is replaced with a readily available combination of 15NH4Cl and Na2CO3, a variety of completely 15N&#8208;labeled primary &#945;&#8208;aminoenones can be obtained.

Developing efficient methods to incorporate a primary amino group onto small molecules is of great importance in pharmaceutical and agrochemical fields. This significance becomes even more pronounced when it comes to accessing their corresponding 15N isotopologs. Here, we present a mild, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, and stoichiometric oxidant&#8208;free amination protocol for fluoroenones by employing user&#8208;friendly ammonium carbonate as the primary amino source. The protocol demonstrates high atom economy by directly converting starting materials into the &#945;&#8208;aminoenones. When the ammonia surrogate is replaced with a readily available combination of 15NH4Cl and Na2CO3, a variety of completely 15N&#8208;labeled primary &#945;&#8208;aminoenones can be synthesized with excellent functional group compatibility. The critical role of iodine in enhancing primary amination of fluoroenones is revealed by the transient formation of a more reactive iodinated enone, which facilitates downstream nucleophilic amination. Furthermore, the protocol exhibits robust scalability and is compatible with biologically and naturally relevant molecules. Molecular iodine is demonstrated as an inexpensive, environmentally benign, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle additive to pursue primary amination.

A variety of 3&#8208;dithiocarbamyl chromones and 3&#8208;carbamothioyl chromones were constructed efficiently from readily available o&#8208;hydroxyphenylenaminones (o&#8208;HPEs) and carbon disulfide (CS2) via KIO3/DTBP cooperative catalytic oxidation. Notably, this transformation proceeds efficiently by recycling by&#8208;product dimethylamine and employing equivalent amount of CS2. This strategy features high atom economy, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, gram&#8208;scale preparation and further derivatization.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Aryloxycarbonylayion of Aryl Bromides with Phenols Using Inositol Hexaformate as an Efficient CO Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a novel carbon monoxide surrogate inositol hexaformate (HFI) and applied it to the palladium&#8208;catalyzed aryloxycarbonylation of aryl bromides with phenols. HFI liberates six molecules of carbon monoxide, exhibiting a significantly higher efficiency and CO capacity than the conventional formate surrogates. This surrogate provides a practical and efficient platform for the synthesis of carbonyl&#8208;containing compounds in the laboratory.

Carbonylation represents a straightforward and powerful strategy for installing carbonyl groups into organic molecules. However, the widespread adoption of carbon monoxide gas in laboratories is hampered by its toxicity, flammability, and smell&#8208;less properties. To address these challenges, we developed a new carbon monoxide surrogate, inositol hexaformate (HFI), and demonstrated its utility in the palladium&#8208;catalyzed aryloxycarbonylation of aryl bromides with phenols. Notably, HFI efficiently releases six equivalents of carbon monoxide, showing a significant improvement in efficiency over commonly used formate surrogates. This work provides a practical and robust method for conducting carbonylation reactions, which is expected to broaden the accessibility of this important transformation in synthetic chemistry.

Presented herein is a novel synthesis of CF3&#8208;isoxazolidine&#8208;fused isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones through the cascade reaction of N&#8208;hydroxybenzamides with CF3&#8208;ynones. The formation of products is initiated by aryl C&#8722;H bond metalation and insertion of the triple bond, followed by protodemetalation, intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition, and oxo&#8208;nucleophilic addition. In addition, the products thus formed can be transformed into several valuable compounds through easy&#8208;to&#8208;run derivations by taking advantage of the rich chemistry of the functional groups embedded therein.

Both isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;one and isoxazolidine are privileged scaffolds in developing new pharmaceuticals and functional materials. Presented herein is a novel synthesis of CF3&#8208;isoxazolidine&#8208;fused isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones through the cascade reaction of N&#8208;hydroxybenzamides with CF3&#8208;ynones. The formation of product is initiated by aryl C&#63743;H bond metalation and insertion of the triple bond, followed by protodemetalation, intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition, and oxo&#8208;nucleophilic addition. In this cascade process, the N&#8208;hydroxyamide group plays a triple role by acting as: 1) directing group for C&#63743;H bond metalation; 2) N&#8208;nucleophilic site for isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;one ring formation; and 3) O&#8208;nucleophilic site for isoxazolidine ring formation. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report on the concurrent construction of these two privileged cyclic scaffolds in one pot. In addition, the products thus formed can be transformed into several valuable compounds through easy&#8208;to&#8208;run derivations by taking advantage of the rich chemistry of the functional groups embedded therein.

         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective synthesis of Pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]coumarin containing aza&#8208;quaternary stereocenter has been reported. The reaction proceeds via [3+3] annulation of &#945;&#8208;CF3 alkynyl ketimines and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins under metal/organo catalytic system. This method affords CF3&#8208;containing chiral pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]coumarin derivatives in good yields (up to 85%) with outstanding enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee) under mild reaction conditions.

An efficient regio&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]coumarins has been developed via a [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] annulation reaction between &#945;&#8208;CF3 alkynyl ketimines and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins. The reaction proceeds via a squaramide&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific Mannich reaction followed by a Lewis acid&#8208;mediated annulation, enabling excellent control of both regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Notably, this represents the first enantioselective synthesis of pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]coumarin derivatives bearing an aza&#8208;quaternary stereocenter. The methodology exhibits broad substrate compatibility with both steric and electronic variations. Practicality of the protocol is demonstrated by scale&#8208;up reaction as well as diverse downstream functionalizations.

         <title>Stereoselective De Novo Synthesis of Substituted Cyclopentanes via a Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed (3&#8201;+&#8201;2) Cycloaddition of Enamides</title>

         <dc:description>
A wide range of cyclopentylamine scaffolds can be prepared from various N&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;amides through a stepwise (3&#8201;+&#8201;2) allyl cation cycloaddition. The synthetic method involves the generation of an aurated dithioallyl cation, the reactivity of which is governed by the well&#8208;defined gold(I)&#8208;catalyst that is used, in addition to some remarkable counterion effects that affect the chemoselectivity of the overall process.

A general and stereoselective synthesis of highly substituted cyclopentylamine scaffolds is reported starting from various N&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;amides. The reaction involves the generation of an aurated dithioallyl cation which undergoes a classical stepwise (3&#8201;+&#8201;2) allyl cation cycloaddition with a range of enamide substrates. The close coordination of the reactive intermediates with the well&#8208;defined gold(I)&#8208;catalyst results in a reactivity and selectivity profile that can be readily rationalized on the basis of a nonconcerted carbocationic cycloaddition reaction, and some remarkable counterion effects are seen to effect the chemoselectivity of the overall process.

         <title>Exploring the Uncharted Indolizine Chemical Space: Construction of 5&#8208;Acylindolizines via a Domino Aldol&#8211;Vinylogous Aldol Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A domino aldol condensation&#8211;intramolecular vinylogous aldol condensation process was implemented for the first time to enable access to a wide range of novel 5&#8208;acylated indolizines with a hydrogen, an alkyl, an aryl, or an alkoxy moiety at the C7 site.

Described herein are two annulative functionalization approaches to novel indolizines leveraging a domino aldol condensation&#8208;vinylogous aldol condensation procedure to construct the pyridine moiety of indolizines, enabling installation of an alkyl, an aryl, or an alkoxy group at the C7 position and an acyl group at the C5 position of indolizine framework. In the first approach, aldehyde oxidatively generated in situ from trialkylamine participated in a [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] annulation process with N&#8208;substituted pyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxaldehydes to give rise to 5&#8208;acylindolizines. In the second approach, the use of various aldehydes as reaction partners in this protocol allowed for the introduction of a wide range of substituents at the C7 site of indolizines.

         <title>Synthesis of an Amphiphilic Polymer With Adjustable Surface Charge and Polarity and its Use for Obtaining Water&#8208;Soluble Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straighforward encapsulation approach for hydrophobic nanomaterials is presented, that allows tuning of the surface charge and stable dispersion in water.

Amphiphilic copolymers can be effectively used to encapsulate a broad range of nanomaterials. Since the surface charge and charge distribution can strongly affect relevant effects like protein adsorption, effective routes are required to tune it. Herein, a straightforward strategy is presented to tune the formal charge of poly (isobutylene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride), converting it into an amphiphilic polymer with negative charge, zwitterionic character, or positive charge. This is a route of surface modification in which impact on other colloidal parameters apart for surface charge is minimized. The encapsulation of quantum dots are tested with the resulting polymers and confirm their robust stabilization over a range of pH values and ionic strengths.

         <title>Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Alkylated Enamides by Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Anti&#8208;Stereoselective and &#946;&#8208;Regioselective 1,2&#8208;Alkylamination of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;stereoselective and &#223;&#8208;regioselective 1,2&#8208;alkylamination of alkynes with amides and azobis(alkylcarbonitriles) has been developed for the synthesis of substituted &#223;&#8208;alkylated enamides

Polysubstituted alkenes are versatile molecules and their multidimensional transformations have significant promotion for the creation and screening of chemotherapeutic agents and polyolefin functional materials. The difunctionalization of alkynes is an inevitable pathway for the generation of highly substituted alkenes with specific conformations. However, there is currently limited development on the construction of &#946;&#8208;alkylated enamides through 1,2&#8208;alkylamination of alkynes, and the newly generated C&#63743;C and C&#63743;N bonds in traditional reports maintain syn&#8208;stereoselectivity. In addition, the formation of anti C&#63743;C/C&#63743;N bonds through difunctionalization of alkynes via free radical processes is overly dependent on electron deficient fluorinated alkyl radicals. We therefore seek to explore anti&#8208;stereoselective and &#946;&#8208;regioselective 1,2&#8208;alkylamination of alkynes with amides and azobis(alkylcarbonitriles). Dozens of all&#8208;new &#946;&#8208;alkylated enamides, including those containing biologically active patterns, are exported in 38%&#8211;88% yields by combining the addition of alkyl radicals to C&#63743;C triple bonds with copper chelate&#8208;assisted functionalization of vinyl radicals. In addition, extensive mechanism explorations and synthetic applications are also conducted to explore the details and potential of this protocol.

A practical and mild strategy for Me3SiCl&#8208;mediated electrophilic carbocyclization&#8208;phosphorothiolation of alkynes with N&#8208;phosphorothiosuccinimide has been developed. This method enables efficient access to a wide range of fused phosphorothiolated phenanthrene and 2H&#8208;chromene derivatives in 61&#8211;86% yields from readily available o&#8208;alkynylbiphenyls and but&#8208;1&#8208;yne&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyldibenzenes, showcasing a broad substrate scope.

Heterogeneous Copper Single&#8208;Atom Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Radical Difunctionalization of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst Cu1@NC enables efficient three&#8208;component alkene difunctionalization with quinoxalinones and polyhalogenated alkanes. This versatile protocol features broad substrate scope, excellent catalyst recyclability, and successful late&#8208;stage modification of complex bioactive molecules.

Multicomponent alkene difunctionalization is persistently challenged by the difficult recovery of homogeneous catalysts and limited applicability to unactivated alkenes. While single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) hold promise for overcoming these limitations, their application to such complex transformations remains unexplored thus far. Herein, we developed a Cu SAC (Cu1@NC) featuring atomically dispersed Cu&#8211;N4 sites that enable efficient three&#8208;component coupling of alkenes, quinoxalinones, and polyhalogenated alkanes. This catalytic system simultaneously installs both gem&#8208;dihaloalkyl and quinoxalinone pharmacophores across a broad substrate scope (52 examples), including traditionally challenging unactivated aliphatic alkenes. Remarkably, Cu1@NC maintains excellent catalytic stability over&#8201;&gt;10 cycles with&#8201;&gt;95% of its initial activity retained and demonstrates robust scalability (72%&#8211;77% isolated yields in gram&#8208;scale reactions). Most significantly, this catalytic system enables efficient late&#8208;stage difunctionalization of alkenes derived from complex bioactive molecules (e.g., ibuprofen, borneol derivatives), underscoring its potential for pharmaceutical applications. Mechanistic investigations reveal that Cu1@NC mediates the radical pathway through two essential single&#8208;electron transfer processes: activating TBHP to generate oxygen&#8208;centered radicals and oxidizing intermediate IM&#8208;4 to regenerate the catalytic center. This study delivers an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical route to valuable drug&#8208;like scaffolds, thus opening new avenues for heterogeneous catalysis in multicomponent reactions.

         <title>Breaking Technological Limits in HT Synthesis: A Platform Concept to Unlock Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis in Microplate&#8208;Based SN2 Automation</title>

Unlock phase&#8208;transfer catalysis in microplate&#8208;based SN2 by using covalently functionalized glass microvials.

We report a covalently immobilized crown ether&#8208;based platform that enables phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalyzed SN2 reactions under fully automated microplate conditions. This regenerable system overcomes key limitations of HT synthesis&#8212;solubility mismatches, mixing constraints, and purification demands&#8212;offering a zero&#8208;waste solution for expanding the accessible reaction space in robotized synthetic workflows. The approach relies on silanized glass microvials bearing dibenzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 functionalities, providing a well&#8208;defined catalytic interface between immiscible organic and aqueous phases. The dynamic movement of the phase boundary during orbital shaking ensures continuous reagent exchange without the need for mechanical stirring. Model transformations using benzyl chloride and alkali metal salts (KCN, NaSCN) validated the efficiency of the immobilized phase&#8208;transfer system, showing comparable or superior yields relative to homogeneous conditions. The covalently anchored catalysts remained active over multiple cycles, demonstrating excellent stability and reusability. The results establish a generalizable strategy for integrating biphasic reactions into automated high&#8208;throughput synthesis workflows by eliminating the need for free phase&#8208;transfer catalysts.

         <title>Synthesis of Polysubstituted Tetrahydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;Thiazepines by Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Ring Expansion of Dihydro&#8208;1,3&#8208;Thiazines with Diazoesters</title>

         <dc:description>
A rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed ring expansion of stereodefined dihydro&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazines with diazomalonates gives 1,4&#8208;thiazepines via a sulfonium ylide rearrangement. The reaction shows a cis/trans reactivity divergence arising from different metal coordination, as revealed by experiments and density functional theory studies. Post&#8208;transformations further demonstrate the versatility of these N,S&#8208;heterocycles.

We report a rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed ring expansion of dihydro&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazines with diazomalonates that provides tetrahydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;thiazepines bearing multiple stereocenters. The reaction proceeds through nucleophilic addition of the thiazine to the metallocarbene, catalyst release to form a sulfonium ylide, and rearrangement via an addition&#8211;elimination sequence to afford the thiazepine. A pronounced stereochemical effect arises for some cycloalkane&#8208;fused thiazines: cis isomers efficiently furnish the corresponding cis&#8208;thiazepines, whereas trans isomers remain unreactive under standard conditions and react only at higher temperatures. Control experiments and density functional theory studies show that trans isomers coordinate more strongly to rhodium, thereby inhibiting the catalytic cycle. The synthetic versatility of the 1,4&#8208;thiazepine scaffold is demonstrated by post&#8208;transformations of the cyclic imine, including hydrolysis, reduction, and Krapcho decarboxylation.

         <dc:description>
A chemodivergent Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of allene is reported for the synthesis of fused carbazoles. The present cascade reaction involves Knoevenagel condensation, in situ alkyne&#8208;to&#8208;allene isomerization, regioselective Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, followed by oxidation or aromatization.

Herein, we have reported chemodivergent Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of allene formed in situ via a base&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;to&#8208;allene isomerization for the synthesis of fused carbazoles in a cascade reaction manner. The regioselectivity of the cycloaddition reaction was achieved using copper additives.

         <title>Emergence of Phosphinium Radical Cations as Intermediates for Organic Radical Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, phosphinium radical cations (R3P.+) have been involved in an elegant approach to generate organic radicals via either nucleophilic trapping/fragmentation or via radical addition. A wide range of radicals, along with hydrogen atom (H&#8208;atom) equivalents, have been produced from their precursors by tapping these intriguing radical&#8208;cationic intermediates. An account of this recent development is documented in this manuscript.

Development of methods with newer strategies for organic radical generation has been a major thrust area of synthetic organic chemistry in the last decade and a half. Often, the radical generation is aided by photoirradiation or electrochemical activation. Phosphinium radical cations, accessed by single electron oxidation or hydrogen atom abstraction, have recently emerged as a unique tool to furnish a variety of organic radicals leading to diverse functional group installations, reductions, cyclization, rearrangements, etc. Herein, we provide an account for the working model of this chemistry and the recent progress of this elegant approach with exciting prospects in the future.

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Homoallylic Alcohols via a Salt&#8208;Free Three&#8208;Component Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling reaction between an aldehyde, a secondary amine, and butadiene allows a straightforward access to 5&#8208;aminopent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ol scaffolds according to a salt&#8208;free process. Key steps are oxidative coupling reaction between one aldehyde, one butadiene on a low valent nickel precursor, and the nucleophilic attack of a secondary amine on the nickel&#8208;allyl moiety.

In the presence of a catalytic amount (1&#8201;mol%) of Ni(cod)2 and dppmb (1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphinomethyl)benzene)), a three&#8208;component coupling reaction between industrially available aldehydes, buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene, and amines leads to the formation of variety of homoallylic alcohols with a highly functionalized 5&#8208;aminopent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ol structure. The reaction proceeds with 100% atom economy under mild conditions (80&#8201;&#176;C) in isopropanol as solvent. The process accommodates both aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes in combination with cyclic and acyclic secondary dialkyl amines, demonstrating a broad substrates scope. Reaction monitoring shows that the initial rate of the reaction is 39&#8201;h&#8722;1, and the process reaches a maximum within 3&#8201;h of reaction at 80&#8201;&#176;C. A competitive reaction has been identified as the hydroamination of 1,3&#8208;butadiene that affords light butenylamines. The key mechanistic feature of the three&#8208;component nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction is the formation of an &#951;3:&#951;1&#8208;allylalkoxy nickel (II) intermediate obtained from the oxidative coupling reaction between a low valent nickel (0) precursor, buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene, and an aldehyde. The amine subsequently reacts as a nucleophile with the electrophilic allyl moiety of this intermediate, while the alkoxy group acts as an internal base facilitating proton transfer that enables the synthesis of 5&#8208;aminopent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ol derivatives without any base and salt formation.

Chiral potassium base catalysts featuring 1,1&#180;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol&#8208;derived chiral crown ethers as ligands promote a tandem allylic isomerization/asymmetric aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction of allylic alcohols and aldehydes. This method provides enantioenriched 1,3&#8208;diols with excellent diastereoselectivity and high enantioselectivity, thereby expanding the synthetic utility of potassium catalysis.

A series of chiral potassium Br&#248;nsted bases containing 3,3&#8242;&#8208;substituted 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol&#8208;based chiral crown ethers are demonstrated as sustainable metal catalysts for a tandem allylic isomerization/asymmetric aldol&#8211;Tishchenko reaction. The crown ether creates an effective chiral environment around the potassium cation, yielding diverse 1,3&#8208;diols containing three contiguous stereogenic centers with excellent diastereoselectivity and high enantioselectivity. This system allows the use of allylic alcohols instead of enolizable ketones as nucleophiles, thus broadening the synthetic applicability of this reaction.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Covalent Organic Frameworks: Synthetic Strategies and Catalytic Applications in Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically outlines the design, synthesis strategies, structure&#8208;activity relationships, and latest applications of M&#8208;COFs in various organic transformations, such as C&#8211;H bond activation reaction, cross&#8208;coupling reaction, reduction reaction, oxidation reaction, addition reaction, multicomponent reaction, and asymmetric synthesis. It also highlights the advantages and discusses the future development directions in this field.

Metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (M&#8208;COFs) are a class of crystalline porous materials formed by the coordination bonds between metals centers and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). They retain the characteristics of COFs while providing exposed metal active sites. Compared with homogeneous transition metal catalysts, M&#8208;COFs exhibit superior catalytic activity, high stability, tunability, high specific surface area, and ordered pore channels. More importantly, due to their heterogeneous nature, M&#8208;COFs catalysts can be reused multiple times conveniently, avoiding the residual presence of transition metals and reducing resource and environmental consumption. This review introduces the general design strategies and synthesis methods of M&#8208;COFs, briefly discusses the intrinsic relationship between their structure and catalytic activity, and focuses on summarizing their applications in organic transformations. It also highlights the advantages and challenges of M&#8208;COFs in catalyzing organic transformation reactions and discusses the future development directions in this field.

A photocatalyst&#8208;free trifluoromethylation/cyclization of unactivated alkenes with trifluoromethylsulfonyl&#8208;pyridinium salt to access trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted quinazolinones is achieved.

A novel photochemical trifluoromethylation/cyclization of unactivated alkenes to synthesize trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted quinazolinones with trifluoromethylsulfonyl&#8208;pyridinium salt (TFSP) is achieved under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal that an electron&#8208;donating&#8208;accepting complex is formed between the quinazolinone and TFSP, making this the first example of TFSP&#8208;based trifluoromethylation conducted in the absence of expensive iridium photocatalysts.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Insights into On&#8208;Surface Chemistry of Organosilicon Compounds by Scanning Probe Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning probe microscopy techniques enable atomic&#8208;level visualization of Si&#9472;H/O and C&#9472;Si bond activation and aromatic C&#9472;Si bond formation in organosilicon compounds (silane, silyl, and silole). Each class exhibits distinct surface&#8208;mediated transformations and bottom&#8208;up fabrication of functional nanostructures.

Organosilicon compounds (OSCs), which consist of silicon atoms bonded to organic groups, have become vital in fields such as materials science, catalysis, and electronics. Their flexibility comes from the ability to adjust their properties by attaching different organic groups to the silicon framework. Despite many progresses, a key challenge persists in controlling the structure and reactivity of these compounds, particularly on a solid surface. Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques, including scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM), are powerful tools for studying molecular behaviors at the atomic level. These techniques enable real space imaging and precise measurements, making them invaluable for understanding OSCs. This article examines the application of STM, STS, and AFM in the on&#8208;surface chemistry of organosilicon, with a focus on molecular adsorption, self&#8208;assembly, surface&#8208;driven reactions, and innovative synthesis of nanostructures. These techniques can provide valuable insights into surface reactivity, molecular organization, and the formation of nanostructures, driving the development of advanced functional materials. Further, density functional theory offers exciting opportunities for advancing surface chemistry and nanomaterial design. This article highlights the critical role of SPM in pushing forward OSCs research and enabling the development of next&#8208;generation organosilicon nanomaterials.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient dearomative spirocyclization reactions of biaryl ynones have been reported for the construction of various functionalized spiro[5.5]trienones and 3,3&#8208;spiroindanones.

In recent years, special emphasis has been put on spirocyclization reactions of biaryl ynones since these strategies offer versatile platforms for introducing various important functional groups into spirocyclic frameworks in a step&#8208;economical manner, which is conducive to drug discovery. In this regard, various functionalized spiro[5.5]trienones and 3,3&#8208;spiroindanones have been synthesized via the radical, radical cation, or electrophilic process promoted by thermal, photochemical, and electrochemical means. In this invited review, we systematically summarize the spirocyclization reactions of biaryl ynones with diverse organic precursors, highlighting the reaction patterns, mechanistic insights, and synthetic applications.

In this invited review, we systematically summarize the spirocyclization reactions of biaryl ynones with diverse organic precursors, highlighting the reaction patterns, mechanistic insights, and synthetic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A Sustainable Electrochemical Platform for Decarboxylative Amidation: Direct Access to N&#8208;Arylamides from &#945;&#8208;Keto Acids and Arylamines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This electrochemical strategy enables the direct synthesis of amides from &#945;&#8208;keto acids and arylamines. Using ferrocene as a redox mediator, the system promotes single&#8208;electron oxidation to generate acyl radicals that couple with anodically oxidized arylamines. Operating under mild, oxidant&#8208;free conditions, the method provides a versatile and sustainable route to valuable N&#8208;arylamides and displays exceptional functional group tolerance, enabling the synthesis of more than 40 structurally diverse amides, including pharmaceutically relevant examples.

Amide bonds are ubiquitous in bioactive molecules, yet their synthesis often relies on prefunctionalized reagents or stoichiometric activators, posing sustainability challenges. Herein, we report a novel electrochemical decarboxylative amidation strategy enabling direct coupling of &#945;&#8208;keto acids with arylamines to access N&#8208;arylamides under mild, oxidant&#8208;free conditions. This redox mediator&#8208;controlled indirect electrolysis harnesses ferrocene to facilitate single&#8208;electron oxidation of &#945;&#8208;keto acids, generating acyl radicals that couple with anodically oxidized arylamine radicals to form amides efficiently. This programmable approach offers operational simplicity and synthetic versatility, providing streamlined access to valuable amide scaffolds with promising applications in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Discovery of Switchable Metal&#8208; and Ligand&#8208;Centered Reactivity via Mechanistic Studies on C&#63743;O Activation of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents two orthogonal reactivities localized at metal and ligand sites separately with tandem Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;O arylation of pyridyl methyl ether and homocoupling of pyridine derivatives: 1) two&#8208;electron C&#63743;O arylation via a Ni(0)/Ni(II) redox manifold with the reactive site located at metal center; 2) one&#8208;electron homocoupling via [IPr&#8211;Ni(0/I)&#8211;pyridyl&#8226;&#8722;] intermediates with the reactive site at ligands.

Metal&#8211;ligand cooperation (MLC) reaction revolutionizes the boundaries of homogeneous catalysis by permitting ligand&#8208;centered reactivity beyond traditional metal&#8208;orientated reactivity. Pyridine is key motif in many pharmaceuticals and agrochemical products, but it also shows promise in participating MLC reaction for further derivatization. However, such unique reaction integration into C&#63743;O bond functionalization remains underexplored, largely due to poorly understood reactivity profiles. In this work, a mechanistic investigation into nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;O bond activation of pyridine&#8208;based aryl ethers is reported to elucidate the electronic and structural features of the active species and MLC/metal&#8211;ligand role reversal (MLRR) pathway. With detailed mechanistic studies including density functional theory calculation, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, and model catalyst, two distinct catalytic cycles are elucidated: 1) a two&#8208;electron&#8208;based C&#63743;O arylation at nickel center and 2) a single&#8208;electron&#8208;driven pyridine homocoupling reaction via MLC and MLRR manifolds. These insights subsequently allow establishment of a synthetic methodology for switchable C&#63743;O bond cleavage and homocoupling in substrate scope studies.

         <title>1,3&#8208;Difunctionalization of Allyl Carboxylates Enabled by 1,2&#8208;Radical Migration (RaM) and Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote C&#8211;H Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
This work merges 1,2&#8208;radical migration (1,2&#8208;RaM) with ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8211;H activation for alkene 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization, enabling distal C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) bond formation. The cascade combines Ru single&#8208;electron transfer (Ru&#8208;SET), acyloxy migration, and radical addition, showcasing broad scope, scalability, and late&#8208;stage applicability. Mechanistic studies support the radical&#8208;involved pathway.

Radical migration, especially 1,2&#8208;radical migration (1,2&#8208;RaM), has emerged as a powerful strategy in reaction discovery and synthetic development, enabling highly selective 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes and granting access to previously unexplored functional molecules and chemical space, with broad implications for complex molecule construction and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report efficient and regioselective catalytic methods that, for the first time, combine 1,2&#8208;radical migration (1,2&#8208;RaM) with ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed remote C&#8211;H activation to achieve difunctionalization at the meta&#8208;position of aromatic C(sp2)&#8211;H bonds and the C3 position of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds. This transformation demonstrates broad functional group tolerance and scalability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, offering a novel approach for the construction of complex molecules.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Atropisomeric Amines via Transaminase&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic kinetic resolution approach is developed for the atroposelective synthesis of heterobiaryl primary amines. Using transaminases and leveraging Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions to induce racemization, a variety of axially chiral primary amines are produced in high yields and enantioselectivities. This mild, metal&#8208;free method expands the scope of biocatalytic asymmetric synthesis.

Atropisomeric heterobiaryl primary amines are of significant interest in both organic and pharmaceutical chemistry. A series of transaminases have been employed to synthesize these valuable compounds with high yields (up to 98% conversion) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to &#8805;99% ee) via dynamic kinetic resolution of the corresponding heterobiaryl aldehydes. This process features a Lewis acid&#8211;base interaction strategy to facilitate labilization of the stereogenic axis.

         <title>Aerobic Oxidative Dethioacetalization Catalyzed by an Iron Phthalocyanine Complex</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protocol for iron octacarboxyphthalocyanine&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidative dethioacetalization in an aqueous solvent is developed. This method can efficiently convert a broad range of dithioacetals into the corresponding carbonyl compounds. Inspired by enzyme&#8208;mediated redox processes, the environmentally friendly catalytic system exhibits remarkable functional group compatibility.

An aerobic oxidative dethioacetalization catalyzed by an iron octacarboxyphthalocyanine complex, which is designed by mimicking enzymatic oxidation, in an aqueous media is developed. The developed method can efficiently convert a broad range of dithioacetals, including those derived from aryl and aliphatic ketones and aldehydes, into the corresponding carbonyl compounds while tolerating various functional groups. This protocol is readily scalable to the gram scale. Mechanistic studies indicate that the iron phthalocyanine complex initiates the reaction by accepting a single electron from the sulfur atom of the dithioacetal, forming a radical cation intermediate. This is followed by unimolecular fragmentation and subsequent degradation of the resulting hemithioacetal to afford the corresponding carbonyl product, along with 1,2&#8208;dithiolane and its oxides.

         <title>Initiation Kinetics of Latent Olefin Metathesis Precatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ready, set, go: Initiation of several latent olefin metathesis precatalysts was measured both by light and heat activation. Sulfur&#8208;chelated ruthenium precatalysts were initiated more efficiently when thermally activated, while the precatalysts with phosphite ligands were more responsive to photochemical stimulation. The initiation results were compared with benchmark RCM and ROMP reactions.

Latent catalysts represent a specialized class of precatalysts that remain dormant under ambient conditions until activated by external stimuli to initiate catalytic activity. This study investigates the initiation behavior of latent olefin metathesis precatalysts, focusing on two different types: sulfur&#8208;chelated systems and phosphite&#8208;ligated ruthenium complexes. The initiation process was first monitored in situ by tracking characteristic proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H&#8208;NMR) signals in the presence of butyl vinyl ether under two activation modes: heating and light irradiation. The analysis for both activation stimuli enabled the determination of initiation rate constants and revealed details of the distinct mechanistic pathways. Moreover, comparing the initiation kinetics and catalytic performance in ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) and ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) established structure&#8211;activity relationships. The ligand environment was found to significantly modulate precatalyst reactivity, with sulfur&#8208;chelated complexes mostly showing enhanced thermal activity, while phosphite systems demonstrated superior photochemical responsiveness. These findings provide support for advancing the development of next&#8208;generation latent metathesis catalysts with tailored activation profiles for precision polymer synthesis and spatiotemporal control of polymerization processes.

         <title>Harnessing the Excited&#8208;State Reactivity of o&#8208;Nitrobenzyl Alcohols for the Rapid Synthesis of N&#8208;Substituted 2H&#8208;Indazoles</title>

         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, iron&#8208;catalyzed cascade enables the one&#8208;pot synthesis of 3&#8208;arylamino&#8208;2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2H&#8208;indazoles from readily available o&#8208;nitrobenzyl alcohols and anilines under mild, sustainable conditions. The process involves photoinduced formation of o&#8208;nitrosobenzaldehyde, followed by condensation, cyclization, and aromatization. The resulting indazoles exhibit a selective fluorescence quenching response toward hypochlorite, highlighting their potential for ClO&#8722; detection.

2H&#8208;Indazole scaffolds represent privileged structural motifs prevalent in a wide range of bioactive compounds and pharmaceutical agents. Despite their significance, conventional synthetic approaches to 2H&#8208;indazole derivatives often suffer from limitations such as harsh reaction conditions, the use of expensive or toxic catalysts, and multistep procedures. To address these challenges, we report a cost&#8208;effective, environmentally benign, and one&#8208;pot strategy for the synthesis of biologically and synthetically valuable 3&#8208;arylamino&#8208;2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2H&#8208;indazoles. This method employs readily available o&#8208;nitrobenzyl alcohols as key building blocks and utilizes a Lewis acid iron salt as a catalyst under visible light irradiation, harnessing the excited&#8208;state reactivity of the substrates. The transformation proceeds efficiently without the need for precious metal catalysts, external oxidants, or additives and operates under mild and sustainable conditions. The protocol enables the construction of structurally complex 2H&#8208;indazoles, including those embedded in medium&#8208;sized rings. Notably, the synthesized 3&#8208;arylamino&#8208;2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2H&#8208;indazoles exhibit a selective fluorescence quenching response toward hypochlorite, highlighting their potential as an effective probe for ClO&#8722; detection.

         <title>Domino Synthesis of Functionalized Cyclic Acetals From Organic Carbonates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic carbonates equipped with acrylic functional groups are shown to undergo a domino process in the presence of a suitable alkoxide to deliver novel types of decorated cyclic acetals. The developed protocol combines practical conditions and a wide scope and features a new reactivity modus for these carbon dioxide&#8208;derived heterocyclic precursors.

We report a method for the base&#8208;mediated transformation of ether&#8208;tethered acrylic ester&#8208;based cyclic carbonates into functionalized cyclic acetals. The protocol builds on the use of hydroxyalkyl&#8208;substituted cyclic carbonates that undergo an oxa&#8208;Michael addition reaction in the presence of alkyl propiolates thereby forging (E)&#8208;configured acrylic ether intermediates. The scope of the reaction involves the use of both five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered cyclic carbonates, and correspondingly, both five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered cyclic acetals can be prepared. The amount of reagents, the purification method, and the type of ester substrate all contribute to the efficiency of the transformation. Mechanistic control reactions point at the intermediacy of an alkoxide that induces an intramolecular Michael addition onto the acrylic double bond following alkoxide&#8208;mediated formation of both an alcohol and ester in the final product. These functional groups, among others, further enable easy diversification of acetal&#8208;based synthons.

         <title>Engineering of an Ancestral McbA with Enhanced Domain Mobility Extends Biocatalytic Amide Synthesis Scope</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show how engineered ancestral amide bond synthetases (ABSs) together with cofactor recycling using a single polyphosphate kinase paves the way for chemoenzymatic synthesis of pharmacophores. The figure illustrates how ancestral ABS has a more flexible C&#8208;terminal domain, which is associated with enhanced catalytic performance and expanded amine scope. An ancestral enzyme can thus be robust but still show enhanced interdomain mobility.

Amide bond formation is a basal transformation in synthetic chemistry and the pharmaceutical industry that is traditionally performed under harsh conditions, using excess amounts of amine and relying on coupling agents. Biocatalysis shows great potential in contributing to milder and more sustainable amide bond formation in water, in particular using the emerging family of amide bond synthetase (ABS) enzymes. Here, we use molecular dynamics, biocatalysis, and enzyme engineering to study amide bond formation in extant and ancestral ABS from Marinactinospora thermotolerans (McbA). Our results show that while being more thermostable, the C&#8208;terminal domain that delivers the amine substrate to the adenylated acid intermediate is more flexible in ancestral McbA, presumably leading to an extended amine scope as observed experimentally from a small panel of aliphatic and aromatic substrates. An engineered ancestor of McbA harboring a single mutation that presumptively represent a catalytic shift residue when going from ancestral to modern biocatalyst, show two to ten&#8208;fold improved conversions over its ancestral template while maintaining high thermostability, highlighting ancestral sequence reconstruction as a potent method in protein engineering. Kinetic experiments showed that the engineered ancestral enzyme had 2&#8208;fold higher apparent kcat values in amide formation compared to extant enzyme, concomitant with relaxed substrate inhibition and loss&#8208;of&#8208;dependency on magnesium. Finally, we optimize ATP recycling utilizing a single polyphosphate kinase to showcase how engineered ancestral McbA together with reaction optimization is amenable for pharmacophore synthesis at a preparative scale.

         <title>Enhancing Thermal&#8208;Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 via H2O&#8208;H2 Co&#8208;Feeding in Mg&#8208;Doped Bismuth Catalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
Mg&#8208;doped Bi nanospheres facilitate efficient thermal&#8208;photocatalytic CO2 reduction in a H2O&#63743;H2 atmosphere. In this system, H2O generates active Bi&#63743;OH sites for CO2 adsorption, while H2 drives the reduction by supplying *H species. The synergistic effect achieves a 2.4&#8208;fold enhancement in CO production with 100% selectivity compared to a pure H2 atmosphere.

The rational design of efficient thermal&#8208;photo CO2 reduction catalysts necessitates synergistic integration of structural modulation and reactant activation strategies. Herein, a Mg&#8208;doped Bi nanosphere catalyst is reported, engineered for efficient CO2 reduction under H2O&#8208;H2 co&#8208;feeding conditions. Mg doping not only optimizes the nanostructure by reducing the particle size but also modifies the surface charge distribution and enhances water adsorption, thereby promoting CO2 activation and catalytic performance. Crucially, under H2O&#63743;H2 co&#8208;feeding, H2O interacts with Bi to generate hydroxylated Bi&#63743;OH sites that promote CO2 chemisorption, while H2 supplies hydrogen species (*H) for CO2 reduction. In&#8201;situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy reveals a cooperative mechanism: CO2 adsorbs on Bi&#63743;OH to form *CO32&#8722; intermediates, which undergo sequential reduction facilitated by H2 activation. This synergy achieves a CO production rate of 55.32&#8201;&#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 under 420&#8201;nm illumination with 100% selectivity, which is 2.4 times higher than that under a pure H2 atmosphere. The work highlights the critical role of dopant&#8208;driven active site engineering and reactant synergies (H2O&#63743;H2) in CO2 valorization, providing a scalable strategy for catalytic performance enhancement.

         <title>Phenoxide&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Alkenes from Trifluoromethylated Alkyl Bromides</title>

         <dc:description>
A phenoxide catalyzed elimination reaction enabled by weak interactions.

&#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;substituted alkenes are a class of highly important building blocks. Herein, a new phenol&#8208;based catalytic system is developed that facilitates the elimination of trifluoromethylated alkyl bromides to produce trifluoromethylated alkenes&#8208;a process previously deemed challenging. This method is distinguished by its mild reaction conditions, extensive substrate compatibility, and high chemo&#8208;selectivity and regioselectivity. This facile elimination can be plausibly attributed to phenoxide anion&#8211;secondary trifluoromethylated alkyl bromides weak interactions.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Ketones From &#945;&#8208;Keto Acids Under Mild Conditions</title>

A sustainable photocatalytic strategy for the direct conversion of &#945;&#8208;keto acids to &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones under mild conditions.

A mild and green photocatalytic strategy for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones through N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide (NCS)&#8208;assisted decarboxylation of &#945;&#8208;keto acids, followed by radical coupling and hydrogen atom transfer has been reported. The method operates at room temperature under visible light irradiation without metal catalysts, bases, or oxidants. A wide range of aromatic &#945;&#8208;keto acids were smoothly converted into the expected products. The feasibility of scale&#8208;up and sunlight&#8208;driven reactions further highlighted its practicality. The ultraviolet&#8211;visible absorption spectra experiments ruled out the formation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor complexes, and Stern&#8211;Volmer experiments demonstrated the facilitative role of NCS in the photoinduced generation of acyl radical.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Alkenes from Alcohols or Amines by One&#8208;Pot Laccase&#8208;Mediated Oxidations and Wittig Reaction in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we present a sustainable, one&#8208;pot, chemoenzymatic procedure for the synthesis of alkenes from the corresponding alcohols or amines in aqueous medium. The procedure is based on the laccase&#8208;TEMPO&#8208;mediated oxidation of substrates and subsequent Wittig reaction. The method has a number of advantages in terms of sustainability, such as application of water as the reaction medium, use of molecular oxygen as final oxidant, or formation of water as a byproduct of the oxidation step.

A general, chemoenzymatic one&#8208;pot procedure for the transformation of alcohols or amines to the corresponding alkene products in aqueous media has been reported. The procedure is based on the laccase&#8208;TEMPO&#8208;mediated oxidations of substrates and subsequent Wittig reaction. In this way, a one&#8208;pot sequence of two consecutive reactions has been developed, which has a number of advantages such as (a) no need of purification of the intermediate products, (b) application of water as green solvent and an enzyme&#8208;laccase as natural catalyst, (c) application of molecular oxygen as final green oxidant, and (d) formation of water as a byproduct of the oxidation step.

         <dc:description>
A novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component tandem sulfonylation and carbonylation of 1,6&#8208;enynes has been developed for the rapid construction of functionalized succinimides bearing sulfone and carbonyl motifs.

A novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component tandem sulfonylation and carbonylation of 1,6&#8208;enynes has been developed for the rapid construction of succinimide, sulfone, and carbonyl motifs simultaneously. In the presence of very low palladium catalyst loading, the reaction of 1,6&#8208;enynes with nucleophiles proceeded smoothly to afford a wide range of sulfone&#8208; and carbonyl&#8208;containing succinimide derivatives with high yields and excellent selectivity. Notably, modifications of bioactive molecules were also demonstrated by using this method.

         <title>Revisiting the Role of Intramolecular Proton Donation in ATC Foldamer Catalysts for Asymmetric Nitro&#8208;Michael Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterocyclic &#947;&#8208;peptide foldamers are structurally fine&#8208;tuned to improve the enantioselective nitro&#8208;Michael addition of ketones to nitroolefins. Modifications around the catalytic site enhance transition state organization and proton transfer, leading to significantly improved rates and selectivity. This work underscores the potential of &#947;&#8208;peptidic scaffolds in the rational design of chiral organocatalysts. 

The structural optimization of ATC&#8208;based foldamer catalysts for the enantioselective nitro&#8208;Michael addition of ketones to nitroolefins is reported. Building on the previous work with heteroaromatic &#947;&#8208;peptides, the influence of the spatial arrangement and flexibility around the catalytic site is investigated. A series of modified sequences are designed to fine&#8208;tune transition state preorganization while revisiting the contribution of an intramolecular proton donor function in ATC catalysts. These modifications lead to enhanced catalytic performance, with faster reaction rates and improved enantioselectivities under optimized conditions.

Dearomatization of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles was achieved through a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition. This reaction employed in situ&#8208;generated alkyne 3&#8208;methylene&#8208;3H&#8208;indoles from &#945;&#8208;(3&#8208;indolyl)propargylic alcohols, providing a route to chiral indole imine&#8208;tetrasubstituted allene skeletons. 

This work presents an efficient strategy for the dearomatization of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles to access chiral indole imine&#8208;tetrasubstituted allene skeletons. The transformation is achieved through a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition with alkyne 3&#8208;methylene&#8208;3H&#8208;indoles, generated in&#8201;situ from &#945;&#8208;(3&#8208;indolyl) propargylic alcohols. A series of chiral compounds possessing both axial and central chirality were synthesized in good to high yields with high asymmetric induction. Supported by control experiments, a plausible mechanism is proposed to elucidate the reaction pathway.

         <title>Glycine Synthesis From Methanol by a Cofactor&#8208;Neutral In&#8201;Vitro Multienzyme Cascade</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cofactor&#8208;neutral in&#8201;vitro multienzyme cascade is developed to allow the synthesis of glycine from methanol and NH3, which surpasses traditional &#8220;cell factory&#8221; paradigms, offering a novel and efficient C1&#8208;to&#8208;amino acid transformation.

The global demand for amino acids continues to rise, yet traditional synthesis methods face environmental and safety challenges. To contribute to a sustainable future vision, we herein report a novel cofactor&#8208;neutral in&#8201;vitro multienzyme cascade that directly converts methanol, a renewable C1 feedstock, into glycine under mild conditions. A two&#8208;step strategy achieves 82.2% methanol&#8208;to&#8208;glycolaldehyde and 86.0% glycolaldehyde&#8208;to&#8208;glycine conversion, respectively. At 500&#8201;mM methanol, it yields 18.8&#8201;mM glycine after 6&#8201;h, which represents a 26.8&#8208;fold improvement over the one&#8208;pot approach. These results demonstrate the potential of modular in&#8201;vitro multienzyme catalysis for efficient C1&#8208;to&#8208;amino acid transformation and establish a foundation for the synthesis of many other complex nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Biocatalytic Construction of a Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer Magnetic Resonance Imaging Nucleoside Probe: Synthesis and Evaluation of 5&#8208;Methyl&#8208;5,6&#8208;Dihydrothymidine</title>

Al&#8208;Hilfi et al. present a biocatalytic strategy for synthesizing 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;5,6&#8208;dihydrothymidine (5&#8208;MDHT), a sensitive MRI contrast agent. The study demonstrates that recombinant enzyme catalysis offers an efficient, sustainable, and eco&#8208;friendly alternative to traditional chemical synthesis for producing clinically relevant imaging probes.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a cornerstone of modern clinical diagnostics, often enhanced by contrast agents. Traditionally, these agents are chemically synthesized, which can involve complex, costly, and environmentally unfriendly processes. Here, we report a novel biocatalytic approach for the efficient, safe, and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis of 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;5,6&#8208;dihydrothymidine (5&#8208;MDHT), a potent chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST)&#8208;MRI probe for imaging in&#8201;vivo expression of the Herpes Simplex Virus Type&#8208;1 Thymidine Kinase (HSV1&#8208;TK) reporter gene. We demonstrate that 5&#8208;MDHT can be biosynthesized via one&#8208; or two&#8208;step enzymatic reactions using human purine nucleoside phosphorylase (hPNPase) and the SgvMVAV SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferase. hPNPase catalyzed the base&#8208;exchange reaction with catalytic efficiencies (kcat/KM) between 138 and 316&#8201;s&#8722;1&#183;M&#8722;1, while SgvMVAV methylation of 5,6&#8208;dihydrothymidine yielded 5&#8208;MDHT with a catalytic efficiency of 26&#8201; s&#8722;1&#183;M&#8722;1. Molecular dynamics simulations supported the enzymatic binding and selectivity observed experimentally. The resulting 5&#8208;MDHT was validated using CEST&#8208;MRI, showing a distinct exchangeable imino proton signal at 5.3&#8201;ppm. These findings highlight the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of the biocatalysts and establish biocatalysis as a viable platform for producing clinically relevant MRI contrast agents.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Based Materials for Electrocatalytic Glycerol Oxidation to Value&#8208;Added C1&#8211;C3 Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycerol, a cheap biodiesel byproduct, offers a sustainable path via electrocatalytic oxidation (GOR). Replacing the oxygen evolution reaction, GOR enables energy&#8208;saving coproduction of high&#8208;value chemicals and green hydrogen under mild conditions, reducing emissions. This review focuses on nanostructuring, defect engineering, and single&#8208;atom catalysts for designing efficient and low&#8208;cost transition metal catalysts for GOR to produce C1&#8211;C3 chemicals.

Glycerol, as the primary by&#8208;product in the biodiesel production process, is abundant and cost&#8208;effective. Its efficient conversion into other chemicals offers a promising strategy for alleviating the energy crisis. Electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) holds significant application potential due to its mild reaction conditions and lack of additional oxidants, enabling the production of various value&#8208;added chemicals such as lactic acid (LA), dihydroxyacetone (DHA), glyceric acid (GLA), oxalic acid (OA), and formic acid (FA). When GOR is used to replace the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), it enables the coproduction of high&#8208;value oxidation products and H2 while minimizing energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. This has important research significance and value for the conversion of biomass resources and the energy&#8208;efficient production of &#8220;green hydrogen.&#8221; Consequently, designing efficient and low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts to achieve high activity and selectivity in GOR is a central research objective.

     alt="Transition Metal-Based Materials for Electrocatalytic Glycerol Oxidation to Value-Added C1&#8211;C3 Chemicals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycerol, a cheap biodiesel byproduct, offers a sustainable path via electrocatalytic oxidation (GOR). Replacing the oxygen evolution reaction, GOR enables energy-saving coproduction of high-value chemicals and green hydrogen under mild conditions, reducing emissions. This review focuses on nanostructuring, defect engineering, and single-atom catalysts for designing efficient and low-cost transition metal catalysts for GOR to produce C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycerol, as the primary by-product in the biodiesel production process, is abundant and cost-effective. Its efficient conversion into other chemicals offers a promising strategy for alleviating the energy crisis. Electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) holds significant application potential due to its mild reaction conditions and lack of additional oxidants, enabling the production of various value-added chemicals such as lactic acid (LA), dihydroxyacetone (DHA), glyceric acid (GLA), oxalic acid (OA), and formic acid (FA). When GOR is used to replace the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), it enables the coproduction of high-value oxidation products and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; while minimizing energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. This has important research significance and value for the conversion of biomass resources and the energy-efficient production of &#8220;green hydrogen.&#8221; Consequently, designing efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts to achieve high activity and selectivity in GOR is a central research objective. Among these, transition metal materials demonstrate significant advantages. This review introduces the types of transition metal catalysts used for GOR and discusses recent catalyst design strategies to enhance GOR activity and selectivity, including nanostructure regulation, defects and surface engineering, heterostructure construction, and single-atom catalysts. In addition, the practical applications of GOR as well as sustainability studies are discussed. Finally, we summarize the current challenges facing transition metal catalysts in GOR and discuss future prospects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Demonstrating a Folding Strategy Utilizing Phosphine&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Rauhut&#8211;Currier Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic strategies to access new classes of indanes and dibenzocycloheptanes employing an intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier reaction are outlined. In essence, this work contributes to demonstrating the folding strategy of diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis. The scope and generality of the methods have been rigorously validated.

A folding strategy of the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis (DOS) utilizing nucleophilic organophosphine&#8208;promoted intramolecular Rauhut&#8211;Currier reaction is presented. Besides establishing a DOS variant, the strategy facilitates the rapid synthesis of highly substituted indanones and dibenzocycloheptanones under metal&#8208;free and neutral conditions. Phosphines efficiently catalyze the transformation of various tethered bis&#8208;enones, resulting in the formation of &#946;&#8208;alkylated &#945;&#8208;arylidene/allylidene indanones and dibenzocycloheptanones. These scaffolds are commonly found in numerous bioactive natural products and pharmaceutically relevant compounds. The broad applicability of the method across a wide range of substrates is demonstrated, and further enhances the skeletal and stereochemical diversity through several postsynthetic modifications.

An efficient synthesis of pyridyl&#8208;substituted unsymmetrical ureas has been accomplished by the reaction of 2&#8208;aminopyridines with N&#8208;arylmaleimides in the presence of catalytic copper acetate. Interestingly, the N&#8208;arylmaleimides act as N&#8208;arylcarbamoyl surrogate, and the reaction is endowed with good substrate scope and functional group tolerance.

         <title>Chiral Phosphoric Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Reductive Amination: Accessing 8&#8208;Arylquinoline Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic asymmetric reductive amination is developed for the synthesis of valuable axially chiral 8&#8208;arylquinoline architectures, which features good&#8208;to,&#8208;high enantioselectivities (up to 96:4 er), broad functionality tolerance, and versatile downstream transformations. DFT calculations reveal a unique racemization mechanism involving the formation of quinolinium cation intermediate. Furthermore, a &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; two&#8208;step procedure of asymmetric transfer hydrogenation is found to be capable of increasing the optical purity of quinoline products by a cascade kinetic resolution step(up&#160;to&#8201;&gt;&#8201;99:1 er).

Disclosed here is an atroposelective dynamic kinetic asymmetric reductive amination catalyzed by chiral phosphoric acid, which provides access to a series of axially chiral 8&#8208;arylquinolines in 50&#8211;97% yields with good&#8208;to&#8208;high enantioselectivities (85.5:14.5&#8208;96:4 er). The formation of quinolinium cation intermediate is found to play a key role in facilitating racemization, thereby enabling a dynamic kinetic resolution scenario. The broad functional group tolerance and versatile downstream functionalization demonstrate utility of current methodology. Interestingly, significant enantiomeric enrichment of 8&#8208;arylquinoline products is achieved by &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; two&#8208;step asymmetric transfer hydrogenation thanks to a &#8220;matched&#8221; cascade kinetic resolution step (up to&#8201;&gt;&#8201;99:1 er)

         <title>A Synthetic Approach to Sterically Hindered P&#8208;Chiral Phosphine Ligands and Their Applications for Asymmetric Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deprotonative desymmetrization and asymmetric reduction serve as key steps to enable a concise approach to highly enantiomerically enriched P&#8208;chiral phosphines, which form configurationally stable gold complexes. Application in a [2&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition reaction of a homoallenyl tryptamine demonstrates their promise as catalysts in challenging asymmetric gold catalysis.

In contrast to wide&#8208;ranging applications of axially and planar chiral bidentate phosphine ligands, the development of P&#8208;chiral monophosphine ligands is much less advanced. Here a practical method is outlined for the synthesis of P&#8208;chiral biaryl or ortho&#8208;((diphenyl)methyl)phenyl phosphines by desymmetrizing alkyl(diphenyl)phosphine oxides by directed ortho&#8208;lithiation and electrophilic quenching of the aryllithium intermediates. The biaryl subunit is introduced by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions of ortho&#8208;iodophenyl phosphine oxides in very good yields. Enantiomerically highly enriched phosphine oxides are obtained by crystallization. A widely unsolved problem consists of the asymmetric reduction of P&#8208;chiral phosphine oxides to the corresponding phosphines. Herein, mild and highly selective Ti(OiPr)4/hydrosilane&#8208;mediated stereoretentive reduction reactions of biarylphosphine oxides or stereoinvertive reductions of ortho&#8208;(diphenylmethyl)phenyl phosphine oxides to the corresponding phosphines are described. The mechanism of this reduction method is investigated and most likely proceeds by a Ti(II)&#8208;mediated P&#63743;O bond cleavage in the phosphine oxide. The optically highly enriched P&#8208;stereogenic monophosphine ligands form stable gold(I) complexes. Their initial application in an intramolecular asymmetric [2&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition of an allenyl indole reveals good catalytic activity and promising asymmetric induction.

         <dc:description>The hitherto few explored &#945;&#8208;halomethyl amidine motif has been assembled through the addition of a lithiated (di)&#8208;halomethane (i.e. carbenoid) to easily accessible N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl substituted carbodiimides.

The overall high&#8208;yielding transformation featuring a genuine chemoselective profile &#8211; as documented by employing variously functionalized materials &#8211; is adaptable to the addition of dihalogenated carbenoids. Reaction products could be advantageously employed in nucleophilic substitution sequences, as well as, in further functionalization of the nitrogen atoms due to the constitutive heteroallyl&#8208;type skeleton.</dc:description>

Reaction products could be advantageously employed in nucleophilic substitution sequences, as well as, in further functionalization of the nitrogen atoms due to the constitutive heteroallyl-type skeleton.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>eAmidation: An Electrochemical Amidation of Aldehydes via the Oxidation of N&#8208;Aryl Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the use of electrochemistry has emerged as a powerful yet sustainable means of enabling key transformations. Amidation is one of the most frequently executed transformations in synthetic chemistry, and using an electrochemical approach, the current study has demonstrated the synthesis of amides from aldehydes and amines. Mechanistic work indicates that the reaction proceeds via the oxidation of an intermediate hydrazone to generate an acyl diazene as the acylating species. The protocol developed has enabled the synthesis of a broad range of amides, including access to pharmaceutically relevant products, directly from aldehydes without recourse for hazardous chemical oxidants and activating agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand controlled regio&#8208;divergent [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of alkynes by merging electrochemistry and nickel catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions between three alkynes, a diyne and an alkyne, or a triyne offer a straightforward and typical protocol toward all kinds of polysubstituted benzens. Herein, the synthesis of polysubstituted aromatics through electrochemical nickel catalyzed cyclotrimerization of alkynes is developed. The regio&#8208;divergent cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes was achieved by judicious choice of ligands. And tributylphosphine, sterically hindered bipyridine or &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands delivered 1,2,4&#8208; and 1,3,5&#8208;substituted aromatics with high regioselectivities respectively. Besides, the semi&#8208;intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between	diynes and alkynes are also amenable under this catalytic system. This approach operates without metal reductant, exhibits wide functional groups tolerance, ease of scalability and furnishes 75 examples with moderate to good yields, including some biorelevant compounds. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculation revealed the catalytic pathways of 1,3,5&#8208; and 1,2,4&#8208;cyclotrimerizations, and the origin of the ligand controlled regioselectivity.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydration reactions of diynes to access tetrasubstituted cyclohexenones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;carboalkoxy&#8208;3&#8208;substituted&#8208;cyclohexenones are powerful building blocks for the synthesis of a variety of bioactive target molecules. Their preparations requires multi&#8208;steps sequence involving the use of stoichiometric quantities of various reagents, while the catalytic approaches are limitited to trisubstituted cyclohexenones. We describe here an efficient catalytic approach based on gold(I)&#8208;catalysis starting from unsymmetrical diynyl mono&#8208;ester or symmetrical diynyl di&#8208;ester substrates. The carbon chain linking the two alkyne functions can bear two or one substituent, or even be unsubstituted. Regardless of the nature of the substrates and independently of its substitution, the cyclohexenone derivatives are cleanly produced.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(II) complex dispersed in imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid: Recyclable catalyst system for regioselective and chemoselective hydrobromination and hydrochlorination of alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a recyclable catalyst system combining Cu(II)O and 4,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline in a 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid for the hydrohalogenation of alkynes. The reaction efficiently yields alkenyl bromides and chlorides with good functional group tolerance and regioselectivity across a range of functionalized alkynes. Remarkably, the reaction exhibits unprecedented chemoselectivity for alkyne over alkenes in polyenynes and enables late&#8208;stage modifications to rapidly synthesize brominated polyenes. The catalyst system could be recycled for up to six runs without significant reduction of the reaction yield.</dc:description>

</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Click reactions display many of the goals desired for more sustainable chemical
conversions.  Yet, the solvent used is an often overlooked aspect in determining the
environmental impact of reactions. In the current paper we develop the first
mechanochemical method for the efficient and solvent&#8208;free SuFEx reaction of sulfonyl
fluorides with a wide range of phenols.  After outlining the optimization process, which
yields an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use and robust method, we provide indications of the very wide
scope of this approach, and demonstrate this potential via the application to a range of
natural phenols that also display other functionalities, and several gram&#8208;scale
syntheses.</dc:description>
