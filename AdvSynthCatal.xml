         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Domino Synthesis of Spiropyrazoline Oxindoles via Condensation of Indolin&#8208;2&#8208;One and Phenylhydrazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a straightforward and efficient method for the synthesis of spiropyrazoline oxindoles using CuCl2&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; as the Lewis acid catalyst. This approach involves a one&#8208;pot domino process, consisting of a condensation step between indolin&#8208;2&#8208;one and phenylhydrazine derivatives, followed by a copper&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction. 
The methodology enabled the synthesis of 32 diversely functionalized spiro compounds with yields ranging from moderate to excellent, achieving up to 98%.

         <title>Photo&#8208; or Electrochemical N&#8208;P Cross&#8208;Hetero&#8208;Dehydrogenative Couplings between Amines and Phosphonothioates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a dual synthetic approach utilizing both photochemical and electrochemical strategies for the synthesis of diversely functionalized thiophosphoramidates via N&#8208;P cross&#8208;hetero&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling. Both methods provide a practical and efficient route to access this significant class of biologically relevant thiophosphoramidates. Key advantages of the protocol include mild reaction conditions, the use of visible light and electrochemical cells as sustainable tools, and energy efficiency enabled by a low&#8208;energy visible light source and low&#8208;current operation. Furthermore, the process utilizes low&#8208;cost substrates and a nontoxic photosensitizer, delivers high yields, exhibits broad substrate scope with excellent functional group tolerance, and offers operational simplicity with a strong emphasis on eco&#8208;friendliness.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual HATs&#8208;Mediated Catalyst&#8208;Free sp3 C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization for Regioselective Radical Hydroalkylation of Ynazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Direct hydroalkylation of ynazoles, facilitating the efficient synthesis of linear N&#8208;&#946;&#8208;vinylazoles, is accomplished through the functionalization of sp3 C&#8722;H bonds using trace amounts of dioxygen as an initiator. This catalyst&#8208;free method eliminates the need for exogenous reagents and proceeds through a radical chain mechanism involving dual hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct hydroalkylation of ynazoles, facilitating the efficient synthesis of linear &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-&#946;-vinylazoles, is accomplished through the functionalization of &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; C&#8722;H bonds using trace amounts of dioxygen as an initiator. This catalyst-free method eliminates the need for exogenous reagents and proceeds through a radical chain mechanism involving dual hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes. Its application potential is exemplified through the implementation of scale-up operations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
An operationally simple protocol to access 2,2&#8208;chlorofluoro&#8208;, and 2,2&#8208;bromofluorobicyclopentanes (BCPs) via commercially available, inexpensive, non&#8208;ozone depleting, and bench stable reagents is reported. The resulting BCP products are tolerated in diverse, synthetically relevant post&#8208;functionalization reactions. Gram&#8208;scale reactions to prepare the BCPs are also included.

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of Acyl Fluoride via 1,3&#8208;Chelation&#8208;Assisted Transhalogenation and Its Application in the Valorization of Biomass&#8208;Derived Alcohol in Aqueous System</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed an environmentally friendly method for synthesizing acyl fluorides and achieving the selective mono&#8208;acylation of water&#8208;soluble alcohols using acyl fluorides in green media. Our method offers substantial advantages over the existing technologies for acyl fluoride production, particularly in terms of cost and environmental impact. Notably, our approach is augmented by an unusual 1,3&#8208;chelation via transhalogenation, and the use of an eco&#8208;friendly solvent and a simple base aligns with the principles of sustainable chemistry. We also explored the direct and highly efficient mono&#8208;acylation of biomass&#8208;derived water&#8208;soluble alcohols, such as ethylene glycol and glycerol, in the presence of water. The key arrangements, such as the role of the K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; base and unusual 1,3&#8208;chelation between acyl fluoride and potassium ion, were characterized by HRMS and NMR spectroscopic analysis, and controlled experiments. These findings underscore the effectiveness of this method and provide deeper insights into the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of the multidendate ligand (H2L) with lanthanide metal salts leads to the formation of one&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers (CP). The structural analysis of the molecule suggests the formation of CP with ladder&#8208;type arrangements of ligands with metal centers. The polymers CP&#8208;1 and CP&#8208;2 with europium and terbium were found to be anionic and coordinatively unsaturated with the existence of solvent molecules in the vacant sites. The CPs were found to be suitable catalysts for the regioselective annulation of aza&#8208;MBH adducts with N,N, cyclic azomethine imines that lead to the formation of N,N&#8217;&#8208;bicyclic pyrazolidine scaffolds via [3+2] cycloaddition. The protocol tolerates a wide substrate scope with different functionalities by producing the bicyclic scaffold with better yield and excellent diastereoselectivity. The X&#8208;ray and NMR analysis suggests the formation of cis diastereomer which is stabilized by N&#8208;H&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;O interaction. The synthetic utility of the pyrazolidine scaffolds is attempted for various functional group interconversions.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Alkylation/Cyclization of Isocyanides with Organoboron Reagents for Diversified Synthesis of N&#8208;Heteroaromatics</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utility of alkyl boronic acids as alkyl radical precursors in photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reactions has been limited due to their low reactivity. A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical alkylation/cyclization of functional arylisocyanides with alkyl boronic acids is reported herein. This strategy allows the formation of alkyl radicals from boronic acids containing primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl groups, which are subsequently transformed into structurally diverse alkylated products, including quinoxalines, phenanthridines, benzothiazoles, benzoselenazoles and quinolines. This transformation features readily available radical precursors and a broad substrate scope. The reaction mechanism is investigated by fluorescence quenching, light on/off, and cyclic voltammograms (CV) experiments. The combination of alkyl boronic acids with DBU may lead to the formation of the alkyl radical via a single electron transfer (SET) process, while the arylisocyanides may undergo an energy transfer (EnT) process with photocatalyst under visible light to generate the carbon radical or act as a radical acceptor to react with the alkyl radical.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Oxidative C&#8208;H Esterification of Quinoxalinones with Arylaldehydes under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first example for photo&#8208;induced oxidative C&#8208;H esterification of quinoxalinones with arylaldehydes under benign conditions has been reported. This method is distinguished by its capacity to accommodate a diverse array of quinoxalinones and arylaldehydes, culminating in the synthesis of the corresponding esters with moderate to good yields. The protocol is lauded for its environmental benignity, eschewing the need for hazardous transition metals and costly photocatalysts, and relies solely on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as the oxidant. Moreover, the scalability of the synthesis and the derivative transformations of the products have been demonstrated, underscoring its practical utility in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterogeneously Catalyzed Cascade Oxidative Coupling/Dearomative Spirocyclization of Diarylamines: Facile Access to Spiroacridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spirocyclic compounds, particularly spirocyclohexadienones, are important in pharmaceuticals due to their biological activity. In this study, we develop a catalytic cascade oxidative spirocyclization of diarylamines for the rapid access to highly functionalized spirocyclohexadienones. Using commercially available recyclable heterogeneous metal catalysts, cascade process via oxidative coupling and dearomative spiroannulation proceeds efficiently under mild aerobic conditions, providing spirocyclohexadienones fused with an acridine skeleton in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. This method provides efficient and rapid access to nitrogen&#8208;containing fused spiro compounds in a highly atom&#8208;economical and environmentally friendly manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonenes from Aldehydes and &#945;&#8208;Pinene: Fe(III) Aggregate Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A challenge for the acid&#8208;mediated formation of oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonenes is side product formation. Presented herein is a Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed method towards these structures from aldehydes and &#945;&#8208;pinene, forming the endo diastereomer exclusively. We include a proposal for the stereochemical reassignment of previously reported exo diastereomers supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, 1H NMR, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The reactive system includes a range of aldehyde substrates. Experimental observations along with quantum chemical simulations suggest that an Fe(III)&#8208;aldehyde aggregate functions as the active catalyst.

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of a Cobalt&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework in Carbodiimide Synthesis</title>

Abstract
The synthesis of carbodiimides via nitrene transfer to isocyanides has garnered significant attention in recent years. However, this reaction predominantly relies on homogeneous catalytic systems with high catalyst loadings. In this study, we employed ZIF&#8208;67 MOF as a heterogeneous catalyst for carbodiimide synthesis and conducted an in&#8208;depth analysis of its stability. Our findings reveal the non&#8208;innocent role of catalyst leaching, demonstrating that even as little as 0.04&#8197;mol% of leached cobalt species is sufficient to catalyze this reaction. This result is in contrast with previous reports, where 5&#8211;10&#8197;mol% of homogeneous cobalt&#8208;loading is required. Furthermore, this study highlights that lower catalyst loadings are more efficient, particularly in cases where isocyanides exhibit limited stability.

Abstract
This study investigates the visible&#8208;light&#8208;initiated uranyl(VI)&#8208;catalyzed activation of Si&#8722;H bonds through direct hydrogen atom transfer, which facilitates the formation of silyl radicals from silanes. The silyl radical can abstract a chlorine atom from the sulfonyl chloride, leading to the generation of sulfonyl radicals. These silyl radicals and sulfonyl radicals could react with alkenes and alkynes, achieving the first example of uranyl&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation and hydrosulfonylation of unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds. This method features mild reaction conditions and a broad substrate scope, and exhibits exceptional functional&#8208;group tolerance. Consequently, it is suitable for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug derivatives.

Abstract
Herein, we describe a two&#8208;component methodology developed for the synthesis of pyrimidine derivatives using tertiary alkylamines and amidines. Tertiary alkylamines serve as dual C2 synthons through copper&#8208;catalyzed aerobic difunctionalization of the &#945;,&#946;&#8722;C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. The process operates under mild conditions and uses atmospheric oxygen as the oxidant. Notably, by this methodology yields up to 85% yields are obtained and a broad substrate scope is shown. Mechanistic studies indicate that the annulation proceeds via a radical&#8208;mediated oxidation and C&#8722;N bond coupling process. This approach provides a pathway for synthesizing various heterocycles by employing tertiary alkylamines as dual C2 synthons.

         <title>Arylation of Secondary Phosphines with Diaryliodonium Salts under Metal&#8208;Free and Non&#8208;Photochemical Conditions</title>

Abstract
A metal&#8208; and irradiation&#8208;free approach for the direct arylation of secondary phosphines has been developed. The reaction employs diaryliodonium salts as electrophilic aryl&#8208;transfer reagents, effecting the P&#8722;Ar bond&#8208;formation in a single step, under mild conditions, using t&#8208;BuOK as a base and DMSO as a solvent. The protocol furnishes expedient access to diverse unsymmetrical triarylphosphines and, upon a one&#8208;pot oxidation, the corresponding triarylphosphine oxides. Experimental and computational studies support the inner sphere aryl&#8208;transfer mechanism through a reductive coupling at the hypervalent iodine center. The calculations also point to a key role played by potassium ions, providing extra stabilization to the P&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming transition state by binding the reactants via cation&#8208;&#960; interactions.

Abstract
A ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H acylmethylation of Trp&#8208;containing peptides with &#945;&#8208;chloro ketones is reported here. This reaction features good C&#8208;2 selectivity and chemoselectivity, making it suitable for late&#8208;stage modification of Trp&#8208;containing peptides. Low&#8208;cost metal ruthenium as a catalyst enables the reaction to be conducted on a gram scale. This report also discusses the synthetic applications and presents a method to remove the pyridine directing group.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ruthenium(II)-catalyzed C&#8722;H acylmethylation of Trp-containing peptides with &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-chloro ketones is reported here. This reaction features good C-2 selectivity and chemoselectivity, making it suitable for late-stage modification of Trp-containing peptides. Low-cost metal ruthenium as a catalyst enables the reaction to be conducted on a gram scale. This report also discusses the synthetic applications and presents a method to remove the pyridine directing group. In addition, a plausible mechanism of the C(2)&#8722;H acylmethylation reaction is proposed in this article.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A stepwise copper&#8208;catalyzed boracarboxylation then palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling methodology was developed to access 2,3&#8208;diarylpropionic acid derivatives regioselectively by pre&#8208;setting the position of the carboxylic acid in the boracarboxylation reaction. This method provides access to a wide range of aryl and heteroaryl products in up to 80% isolated yield. Pharmaceutical potential was demonstrated by synthesizing a glucagon receptor antagonist drug in three steps (31% overall yield) from commercially available 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylstyrene.

Abstract
Herein, we present a protocol starting from styrene oxide reacting with o&#8208;acylaniline and o&#8208;alkenylaniline derivatives to obtain 3,4&#8208;disubstituted quinoline and 2&#8208;acylquinoline derivatives, respectively, in 32&#8211;92% yields under specific conditions. Preliminary research outcomes underscore the versatility of our approach, as exemplified by its scalability for large&#8208;scale synthesis, downstream derivatization, and the characteristic properties manifested by the modified molecules.

         <title>Synergistic Palladium/Silver/Ligand Catalysis for C&#8722;H Alkenylation of 2,1,3&#8208;Benzofused Heterodiazoles</title>

Abstract
The combination of palladium and silver complexes has emerged as a bimetallic catalytic system in C&#8722;H activation, frequently outperforming palladium&#8208;only systems. Beyond the conventional roles of silver (I) salts serving as oxidants, halide scavengers, and Lewis acids, Pd&#8722;Ag bimetallic synergism has been shown to facilitate C&#8722;H cleavage. In this study, we explore the incorporation of a pyrazolopyridone (PzPyOH) ligand into a Pd&#8722;Ag bimetallic catalytic system, which together promote both C&#8722;H cleavage and migratory insertion processes. This synergistic approach enables dehydrogenative C&#8722;H alkenylations at the C4 position of 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole, 2,1,3&#8208;benzoxadiazole, and 2,1,3&#8208;benzotriazole with alkenes. These results demonstrate the potential of combining novel ligands with heterobimetallic systems to facilitate other elementary steps beyond C&#8722;H cleavage, suggesting their broader applicability in C&#8722;H functionalization.

Abstract
The functionalization of fullerenes is important for several reasons, primarily related to enhancing their chemical reactivity, solubility, and potential of applications in optoelectronics and biomedicine. In this study, we present a novel approach to functionalize C60 through a cascade process encompassing an unprecedented Rh&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1,6&#8208;allenynes to in&#8197;situ generate a vinylallene that is followed by a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with pristine fullerene, resulting in the formation of 6,6&#8208;fused bicyclic fullerene derivatives. The mechanism governing this process was elucidated by DFT calculations and confirmed by deuterium labelling and control experiments, demonstrating the critical role of traces of water in the reaction medium to mediate the observed reactivity.

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Synthesis of Pyrroles from Nitroarenes with Glycols as Reductants</title>

Abstract
A molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of N&#8208;(hetero)aryl pyrroles directly from inexpensive and commonly available (hetero)nitroarenes via reduction with pinacol and annulation with 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyls or cyclobutane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols has been described. The process does not require an inert atmosphere and tolerates the presence of air and water. This non&#8208;noble catalytic system shows high chemoselectivity, allowing a diverse range of potentially reducible functional groups such as alkynes, alkenes, halogens, cyano, and carbonyls. Moreover, this strategy enables the reuse of a waste byproduct as reactant, facilitating the formation of challenging 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyls from accessible cyclobutane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols used as reducing agents.

Abstract
A methodology to access stereoisomeric sets of products bearing multiple stereogenic centers is still a significant challenge in asymmetric catalysis. We present herein our experimental studies on the stereodivergent synthesis of chiral hydrobenzofuran&#8208;fused pyrrolidines with three stereogenic centers via organocatalytic asymmetric dearomative cyclization and epimerization process. Chiral bifunctional thiourea catalyst could successfully promote the enantioselective dearomatization cyclization of 2&#8208;nitrobenzofurans with o&#8208;hydroxy aromatic aldimines, which enabled the synthesis of (3S,3aR,8bR)&#8208;hydrobenzofuran[3.2]pyrrolidines in 79&#8211;92% yields with &gt;20:1 stereoselectivities and 93&#8211;&gt;99% enantio&#8208;selectivities. While catalytic amount of DBU could induce the direct intramolecular epimerization of (3S,3aR,8bR)&#8208;hydrobenzofuran[3.2] pyrrolidines to its diastereomers (3R,3aR,8bR)&#8208;hydrobenzofuran[3.2] pyrrolidines in 72&#8211;87% yields without loss of stereoselectivities. The mechanistic pathways of the epimerization process were investigated by a series of control experiments study. This work provides an alternative and forward solution for the stereodivergent preparation of functionalized pyrrolidines with potential bioactivities.

&lt;p&gt;A methodology to access stereoisomeric sets of products bearing multiple stereogenic centers is still a significant challenge in asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Nitroalkanes with Aliphatic Grignard/Cerium and Organozinc Reagents for Synthesis of Functionalized Nitrones</title>

Abstract
This study aims to develop a more efficient, functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant approach using stable nitroalkanes and reductive coupling reactions with aliphatic Grignard/cerium and organozinc reagents. The treatment of nitroalkanes with aliphatic Grignard reagents in the presence of a catalytic amount of CuF2 and stoichiometric amount of CeCl3 affords various nitrones in good yields as single isomers. The reaction of tertiary nitroalkanes with organozinc reagents affords various functionalized nitrones without CuF2 or CeCl3. These reductive coupling reactions proceed without the loss of functional groups such as alkene, alkyne, benzyl ether, chlorine, ester, and nitrile moieties. Nitrones can also be used as precursors for [3+2] cyclizations with electron&#8208;withdrawing alkenes and alkynes.

Abstract
The visible light&#8208;induced one&#8208;pot tandem photolysis of areneazo&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;nitro)propanes was achieved to give carbazole and indole derivatives. The aryl azidation followed by an intramolecular C&#8722;H amination smoothly proceeded under visible light irradiation without any photocatalyst, demonstrating the synthetic versatility of areneazo&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;nitro)propanes. The in&#8197;situ generation of aryl azide intermediates was executed under mild visible light photolysis conditions, showcasing the synthetic versatility of areneazo&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;nitro)propanes, a safe alternative of diazonium salts.

Abstract
Herein, we report a conceptually new, general, and efficient approach for the synthesis of valuable ortho&#8208;azido&#8208;1,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole and one&#8208;pot synthesis of ortho&#8208;triazoletetrazole derivatives mainly via PIDA mediated N&#8722;N cleavage of the azole ring of 2H&#8208;indazoles using TMSN3. This current methodology represents an array of unsymmetrical ortho&#8208;azidotetrazole and ortho&#8208;triazoletetrazole derivatives with wide functional group tolerance in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. The practical utility of this reaction was showcased through successful scale&#8208;up synthesis and a variety of subsequent derivatizations of ortho&#8208;azidotetrazole products. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the reaction proceeds through a radical pathway.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition of Alkynes To Form Arenes and Pyridines at Low Catalyst Loadings</title>

Abstract
We report the Ni&#8208;catalyzed cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes at very low loadings of catalysts (0.05&#8197;mol% for all substrates). The nickel catalyst containing a terphenyl phosphine ligand allows carrying out the reactions at room temperature in only 30&#8197;min, providing the arene products as a single regioisomer in most cases. The Ni complex is also competent for the synthesis of polysubstituted pyridines through the cycloadditions of diynes and nitriles at mild temperatures (25&#8201;&#176; or 50&#8201;&#176;C) and low Ni loadings (1&#8197;mol%). Experimental data and computational studies support the involvement of monoligated PNi species in all fundamental steps of the catalytic cycle.

Abstract
This work provides an in&#8208;depth analysis of the factors governing the different reaction pathways in the acid&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of gem&#8208;vinylsilyl alcohols with aldehydes. The study evaluates the impact of both the ligands attached to silicon and the choice of the Lewis acid on the reaction outcome. Additionally, computational studies offer valuable insights into the mechanism that control these distinct pathways.

Abstract
Owing to multiple reactive sites, such as an acidic &#945;&#8208;carbon and an isocyano group, isocyanide esters can successfully participate in the synthesis of various five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles through the cycloaddition reactions under metal&#8208;catalyzed systems. Considering the unique and versatile functionality of this synthon, in this review, we have highlighted silver and copper&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions of isocyanide esters over the last decade.

         <title>Decyanative Arylation via Radical Coupling</title>

Abstract
Arenes, especially heteroarenes, are crucial structural motifs in organic chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, and materials science. The introduction of (hetero)aryl groups using readily available feedstocks to modify organic chemicals is a significant topic. Nitriles are ubiquitous and versatile building blocks in organic synthesis. This review summarizes recent advances in decyanative arylation via radical cross&#8208;coupling reactions. In these transformations, (hetero)aromatic nitriles undergo one&#8208;electron reduction to form persistent radical anion intermediates. Simultaneously, transient carbon centered radicals are generated through cleavage of C&#8722;H, C&#8722;C, C&#8722;X (where X=B, N, Si, S, Br) bonds through single electron transfer or hydrogen atom transfer processes. Finally, a radical&#8208;radical coupling reaction followed by CN elimination leads to the formation of aromatized products.

Abstract
An approach for the synthesis of quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diamines is reported using a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction of o&#8208;phenylenediamines and isocyanides. Various quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diamines could be obtained in 25%&#8211;95% yields at 100&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8197;h. The key to the success of this protocol involves the formation of two C&#8722;N and one C&#8722;C bonds via the double insertion of isocyanide.

Abstract
An enantioselective C&#8208;, O&#8208; and N&#8208; intermolecular allylic reaction of quinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones has been developed. The reaction between 3&#8208;hydroxy quinolone and Boc&#8208;protected MBH adducts with Pd&#8208;catalysis provided a series of 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diones in 20&#8211;95% yield accompanied by 69&#8211;96% enantioselectivity. In addition, the O&#8208;allylic alkylation could occur by varying the organo&#8208;catalyst and Boc&#8208;protected MBH adducts from benzaldehyde. Furthermore, the N&#8208;allylation of 3&#8208;O&#8208;protected quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones with allylic acetates was also realized (40&#8211;92% yield, 78&#8211;97% ee).

         <title>Three&#8208; and Seven&#8208;membered Annulenones as a Lewis Base Catalyst for Enantioselective meso&#8208;Epoxide Opening</title>

Abstract
This is the report on the Lewis base catalysis of annulenones. Additionally, the synthesis of chiral annulenone catalysts and their application in asymmetric ring&#8208;opening reactions of meso&#8208;epoxides is shown. Annulenones, such as cyclopropenones and tropones, function as Lewis bases owing to their inherent polarity caused by aromaticity, resulting in the activation of silicon tetrachloride, which catalyzes the ring&#8208;opening reaction of meso&#8208;epoxides. Moreover, various chiral annulenone catalysts have been designed and synthesized, and microwave irradiation has been shown to improve the synthetic efficiency of chiral tropones. The chiral annulenones successfully catalyzed the asymmetric ring&#8208;opening reaction of meso&#8208;epoxides, resulting in the formation of 1,2&#8208;chlorohydrins in a high yield and high enantioselectivity (up to 90% ee in 96% yield). These results represent the example of three&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered annulenones as a chiral Lewis base catalyst.

Abstract
A variety of structurally diverse spirocyclohexane oxindoles featuring a quaternary carbon centre have been successfully constructed through an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation of isatin&#8208;derived enals with &#945;&#8208;cyano&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methylenones. This domino process exhibits a wide substrate tolerance, operates under mild conditions, and yields products with high enantioselectivities.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Aliphatic &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids by Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Hydroamination&#8208;Hydrodesulfurisation</title>

Abstract
Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) enzymes have been extensively exploited to produce differently substituted arylalanine analogues, but their use in the stereoselective synthesis of aliphatic fatty amino acids has never been addressed. In this work, a two&#8208;step hydroamination&#8208;hydrodesulfurisation process has been investigated for the production of aliphatic L&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids from thienylacrylic acids, easily accessible by condensation from the corresponding arylaldehydes. Wild&#8208;type PALs from Planctomyces brasiliensis and Streptomyces rimosus were selected as the most promising candidates and improved by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, thus unlocking the hydroamination of a broad panel of 10 different thienylacrylic acids bearing aliphatic and aromatic substituents. The subsequent hydrodesulfurisation step, accomplished by means of inexpensive Raney nickel in mild conditions and aqueous medium, afforded the corresponding aliphatic &#945;&#8208;amino acids in 10&#8211;63% overall isolated yield and perfect enantiopurity. This chemo&#8208;enzymatic process represents the first example of aliphatic amino acid production using PALs, circumventing a major limitation of those biocatalysts.

         <title>Photocatalytic C&#8722;I Bond Borylation and Phosphorylation of Diaryliodonium Salts with Excellent Atom&#8208;Economy</title>

Abstract
Highly atom&#8208;economic conversion of diaryliodonium salts represents an underdeveloped but highly desirable domain. Most reactions involving these species only utilize single aryl group of the diaryliodonium salts and produce an equivalent of aryl iodide as waste. Herein, by further transforming the side&#8208;product aryl iodide, we report an overall new two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot strategy that allows photocatalytic C&#8722;I bond borylation of diaryliodonium salts and ensures effective conversion of both aryl groups of the diaryliodonium into the relevant arylboronic esters. Mechanistic investigations suggest that electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor complex is formed between the photocatalyst phenothiazine and diaryliodonium salt substrate. Upon visible light irradiation, this complex produces aryl radical and aryl iodide. With addition of a base in the second step, the reducing ability of the photocatalyst is enhanced via proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process, thereby aryl iodide produced in the first step is reduced to yield aryl radical again. Both aryl radicals generated in the two steps react with B2(OR)4 to produce the corresponding monoarylation product in a quantitative yield. The strategy is also applicable for C&#8722;I bond phosphorylation of diaryliodonium salts, ensuring that both aryl moieties can be phosphorylated with high efficiency.

Abstract
A copper and DMAP relay&#8208;catalyzed strategy has been achieved for the modular synthesis of 2&#8208;alkoxy quinolines from a three&#8208;component coupling of terminal alkynes, anthranils, and alcohols. In this protocol, a novel quinoline pyridine salt is formed and serves as a key intermediate in the formation of 2&#8208;alkoxy quinolines. The reaction has a broad substrate scope of each reaction partners, affording diversified 2&#8208;alkoxy quinoline products in generally good yields.

Abstract
Visible light&#8208;induced site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkylation and alkenylation of 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes with maleimides at room temperature via dual catalysis in an aqueous medium has been disclosed. This operationally simple and mild approach enables the selective formation of alkylation and alkenylation products up to 92% yield under silver&#8208;free conditions with excellent substrate scope. For the mechanistic examination, KIE, H/D labeling experiments, light on&#8208;off experiments, and quantum yield measurements were carried out. Moreover, the present approach for the alkylation and alkenylation of 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes is suitable for scalable synthesis.

Abstract
&#946;&#8208;pyridinyl ketones and &#946;&#8208;pyridinyl thiocyanates are commonly used as an essential organic synthesis intermediate and widely present in various drug molecules and bioactive molecules. Herein, a photoredox catalyzed acyl and thiocyano pyridylation of alkenes with aldehydes and NH4SCN via HAT and SET strategy respectively is described. This protocol employs more readily accessible aldehydes and NH4SCN as radical precursors under redox&#8208;neutral conditions. Moreover, high atom economy, simple and accessible starting materials, late&#8208;stage modification and wide substrate scope including primary, secondary alkyl aldehydes and aromatic aldehydes enable the potential application in the organic synthesis.

Abstract
Development of a mild approach for the highly efficient synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl azoles, which are typically synthesized using high temperature, ligands and preactivated substrates, is highly desirable. Here, we report a mild and efficient photo&#8208;induced Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling to obtain C2&#8208;functionalized azoles using aryl thianthrenium salt (Ar&#8208;TTs). The reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope and an excellent functional group compatibility and serves as an ideal strategy for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals. Additionally, this method enables the efficient synthesis of azole&#8208;based polycyclic compounds.

Abstract
A series of 3,5&#8208;diaryl&#8208;4&#8208;selanylisoxazoles were synthesized in 56&#8211;97% yields (most cases&gt;80% yield), which was first accomplished via bromide&#8208;catalyzed selenylation of 2&#8208;alkyn&#8208;1&#8208;one O&#8208;methyloximes using element Se and boronic acids as the selenyl source. Compared to traditional strategies, this method proceeded under simple catalytic system. Broad substrate scope, good functional group compatibility, metal&#8208;free conditions, and easy operation was showed in this protocol. Additionally, this method was easily amendable to gram&#8208;scale reaction and synthetic transformations. Furthermore, preliminary mechanistic experiments demonstrated that a radical pathway was possibly involved in this work.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;powder&#8208;mediated tandem hydroamination cyclization&#8211;hydrocyanation of alkyne&#8208;tethered ketoximes is described by using TMSCN as a commercially available cyanating reagent. This methodology provides an alternative strategy for the synthesis of a series of structurally important cyano&#8208;substituted cyclic nitrones. The hydrocyanation process exhibits distinct regioselectivity depending on the substituent pattern of the alkyne moiety. Moreover, the synthesized products were shown to be capable of undergoing various derivatization reactions.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a collection of &#8220;selectivity rules&#8221; for the dearomative (3+2) annulation reaction between substituted indoles and oxyallyl cations.  The application of these rules enables us to synthesize four different regioisomeric permutations of the annulation products in a stereoselective fashion.  We demonstrated that these products could be further transformed into hexahydro&#8208; and tetrahydrocarbazoles by nucleophile&#8208;intercepted Beckmann fragmentation (NuBFr) and Beckmann fragmentation (BFr).</dc:description>

This method eliminates the need for pre&#8208;reduction steps or stoichiometric reducing agents by utilizing sacrificial C&#8208;H bonds from organic solvents. The reaction proceeds via FeCl3&#8208;catalyzed single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) cascades. A previously unreported intermediate formed between nitroarenes and N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone (NMP) is discovered, playing a crucial role in facilitating substitution with amides. The method exhibits broad functional group tolerance and achieves yields up to 82%, demonstrating compatibility with a wide range of nitroarenes and amides.</dc:description>

         <title>Double&#8208;sided control of product type preference in the visible&#8208;light initiated reaction of 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds with alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. The demonstrated light&#8208;initiated addition of radicals formed on an active methylene group to styrene derivatives exhibits a product selectivity influenced by the presence of a protic solvent. Under protic conditions, the predominant products are branched compounds with the alkene moiety attached to the methylene group. In the absence of a proton source, an alkene is incorporated between the carbonyl group and the methylene group, forming products known from the De Mayo reaction. The utility of the presented method was confirmed by a broad substrate range of alkenes and compounds bearing active methylene groups. A comprehensive mechanistic study revealed that both types of products can be formed via the radical pathway. This suggests a previously unreported mechanistic path as an alternative to the De Mayo reaction, which gives the same type of products.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Catalytic formal aldol condensation reactions between &#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates and arylaldehydes, in which the C&#8208;C double bond formation occurs at the &#947;&#8208;position of the &#946;&#8208;ketophosphonate, are reported. The reactions were performed in the presence of a catalyst system composed of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;anisidine and trifluoroacetic acid under mild conditions.

         <title>Photoredox assisted net&#8208;neutral radical&#8208;polar crossover &#945;&#8208;acylation of enol acetates with acyl chlorides: Access to 1,3&#8208;diketones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a photoredox assisted &#945;&#8208;acylation of enol acetates with acyl chlorides using catalytic amount of Ir(ppy)3. The reaction proceeds via net&#8208;redox neutral radical&#8208;polar crossover pathway and furnishes 1,3&#8208;diketones in moderate to high yields under mild conditions without an external oxidant. The application of this method is demonstrated in the synthesis of Avobenzone (main ingredient in sunscreens), one&#8208;pot synthesis of anti&#8208;bacterial 4H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzothiazines and organic&#8208;laser dye boron difluoride hemicurcuminoid complex.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this paper, we reported a novel sequential reaction sequence consisting of two processes including domino [3+2]/[2+1] annulation and in situ Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement reaction, which enabled synthesis of a series of structurally complex polycyclic pyrrolizine derivatives in 51&#8208;96% yields and excellent diastereoselectivities. The viability of the existing protocol was additionally illustrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis and further modifications.

         <title>Advances of chiral metal complexes as standalone photocatalyst for asymmetric organic transformations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many enantiopure chiral organic molecules are very important unit for drug discovery. Ready access to a wide range of enantiopure organic compounds, attached with one or more chiral centres significantly enhance the quality and diversity of chemical libraries for screening of drug discovery. The ability to control the stereochemistry of many organic reactions remains an area of interest in organic synthesis to allow the development of novel, structurally diverse 3D molecules. Asymmetric catalysis has been extensively studied for controlling the stereochemistry in modern synthetic organic chemistry. Recently, the use of light as the energy source with a chiral photocatalysts for photocatalytic asymmetric organic reactions has drawn much attentions but limited in numbers.  The short lifetime of excited chiral photocatalysts and very fast reactions make the stereocontrol difficult in many reactions. However, by making a chiral photoactive metal complex with a suitable metal and ligands, this problem could be solved. As these chiral metal complexes are stable under light irradiation, versatile, having easy tuneable properties, these can provide more chiral inductions in many asymmetric organic reactions. So, in this review, we have focused on the recent development on chiral metal complexes as the standalone chiral photocatalysts for asymmetric organic reactions. We hope this review will help to understand the scopes and limitations to the research community in the field of asymmetric synthesis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Despite the formidable challenge of concurrently managing both the regiochemistry and stereochemistry of the process, organocatalytic remote stereocontrol has emerged as an appealing approach to establish stereocenters at specified locations distant from reactive functional groups. Herein, we achieved the first organocatalyzed remote stereocontrolled (4+2) annulation of 2&#8208;(4H&#8208;benzo[d][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)acrylates with 4&#8208;methyleneisoxazol&#8208;5(4H)&#8208;ones. The nucleophilic attack of a suitable chiral amine to 2&#8208;(4H&#8208;benzo[d][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)acrylates generated the key amine&#8208;dipole intermediate, followed by the enantioselective aza&#8208;1,4&#8208;addition of 4&#8208;methyleneisoxazol&#8208;5(4H)&#8208;ones and intramolecular annulation cascade reaction to construct spiro[isoxazole&#8208;4,3&#8217;&#8208;quinolin]&#8208;5&#8208;one frameworks bearing continuous three stereocenters. More importantly, different from the well&#8208;established reactions of MBH carbonates, this work successfully established a novel platform for the direct enantioselective synthesis of continuous three stereocenters, inclusive of an &#949;&#8208;stereocenter.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Iodine&#8208;Mediated Radical Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Over the past two decades, iodine&#8208;mediated free radical reactions have been extensively explored and employed in chemical transformations that complement traditional ionic reactions. In this review, we have updated the progress of the iodine&#8208;mediated radical reactions in organic synthesis reported between 2015 and mid&#8208;2024, and organized the reactions according to their mechanistic pathways. In general, the proposed mechanisms can be divided into four categories based on the radical initiation or its preceding steps, namely, (1) formation of a covalent X&#8722;I (X=C, N, S, Se) bond, which subsequently participates in a radical reaction; (2) formation of a noncovalent N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I bond, which assists the homolysis of the I&#8722;I bond; (3) formation of the key iodine radicals by visible&#8208;light or heat induced homolysis of I2 or by electrochemical oxidation of iodide; (4) iodine induced peroxide decomposition via single electron transfer (SET) mechanism to generate alkoxy or alkyl peroxy radicals. We hope this review will provide readers with a comprehensive update on the iodine&#8208;mediated radical reactions, thereby further inspiring more exciting advances in this emerging field.

Abstract
We describe a novel cobalt/salicyloxazoline (Salox) catalytic system for enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization, enabling the synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic and axially chiral cyclic phosphinic amides. Chiral Salox ligands, conveniently prepared in a single step from salicylonitriles and chiral amino alcohols, facilitated this transformation with excellent enantioselectivities (92&#8208;99% ee) and moderate to good yields (31 examples, 45&#8211;89%). Mechanistic studies implicate a cobalt (III/IV/II) catalytic cycle in the C&#8722;H annulation process, providing valuable insights into the stereoselective reaction pathway.

         <dc:description>We report the direct and selective synthesis of oxadendralenes starting from readily available bis(&#945;&#8208;hydroxyallenes). The designed sequence involves a hitherto unknown oxy&#8208;Cope rearrangement of allenols by supplying a site for the migration of the 1,2&#8208;diene moiety. Moreover, the so&#8208;prepared oxadendralenes were converted into valuable polyfunctionalized scaffolds through effective late&#8208;stage diversification.</dc:description>

         <title>Lithium Chloride&#8208;Promoted Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts Alkylation Reaction of Indoles with Aldehydes and Ketones "on Water"
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction between indoles and ketones poses a significant challenge. In this study, we developed an efficient and environmentally friendly approach for the synthesis of bis(indolyl)methanes bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary and tertiary centers at room temperature under "on water" conditions. Notably, the utilization of saturated lithium chloride as a solvent greatly enhances the Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed double additions of indoles to ketones and aldehydes by promoting hydrophobic interactions. Additionally, LiCl acts as a Lewis acid catalyst for carbonyl activation and facilitates dehydration. This methodology demonstrates compatibility with various ketone substrates such as alkyl alkyl ketones and aryl alkyl ketones, along with aldehyde substrates. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale productions were successful, and the LiCl solutions demonstrate reusability.

This K&#8322;CO&#8323;&#8208;promoted method offers a simple and efficient approach for achieving highly regioselective products through cascade bond formation and cyclization. Post functionalization of resulting products into various valuable trifluoromethylated heterocycles including triazoles, isoxazoles, Mannich bases and the products from Sonogashira coupling reactions has also been reported. Additionally, a straightforward and scalable protocol for synthesis of 4&#8208;trifluoromethylpyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxamide derivatives without K&#8322;CO&#8323;, utilizing diverse 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds has been established.

         <title>CuF2&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;N Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Silanes: Expanding the Scope of Chan&#8208;Lam Type Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8211;Lam type N&#8208;arylation of various amides, sulfonamides, urea, azoles, and amines has been demonstrated using a CuF2/DMSO catalytic system with structurally diverse aryl(trimethoxy)silanes under base and ligand&#8208;free conditions. This approach facilitates effective C&#8208;N cross&#8208;coupling with user&#8208;friendly organosilicon reagents without requiring an external fluoride source. CuF2 serves a dual function as both a catalyst and a desilylating agent, facilitating the cleavage of the aryl&#8208;silane 	bond. The process is compatible with a broad range of substrates, ensuring high efficiency and excellent functional group compatibility. Moreover, this protocol is proven to be valuable for late&#8208;stage modification of amide and sulfonamide&#8208;containing drug molecules, as well as for synthesizing agrochemicals.

         <title>Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis: A Modular In Situ Vicinal Functionalization Strategy for Recent Developments of Carbohydrate Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis, first identified by Catellani in 1997, provides an efficient approach for synthesizing highly functionalized aromatic compounds that are challenging to obtain through conventional methods. The developed synthetic approach integrates selective C&#8208;H bond activation with sequential reactions, allowing for the targeted functionalization of both the ortho and ipso positions of aryl halides via aryl&#8208;norbornadiene&#8208;palladacycle (ANP), which in turn ensures high chemoselectivity and regioselectivity of the products. 
It is estimated that approximately 20% of all natural products are glycosylated, with the carbohydrates linked to these compounds frequently playing a critical role in their biological activity. Currently, research in carbohydrate chemistry predominantly concentrates on polysubstitutional derivatization or vicinal functionalization strategies. However, the limited availability of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted compounds has been scarcely investigated, and previous studies often relied on directional group assistance to achieve disubstitution.
	Recently, significant advancements have been achieved with Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis, an area that has gained considerable importance in carbohydrate chemistry, presenting an opportunity to inspire further research interest in Catellani reactions. In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the Pd/NBE strategy within the realm of sugar chemistry, encompass early research and advancement in catalytic reactions, outline synthetic potential, highlight the significant progress made, and emphasize the most recent developments and their applications in situ vicinal functionalization of carbohydrate derivatives.

         <title>Amide synthesis via transaminative amidation of aromatic aldehydes/ketones: An entry to 15N isotopologs</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we develop the first one&#8208;pot amide synthesis from aldehyde/ketone and amino acids via transaminative amidation reaction and the method requires no catalyst or promoters, by allowing a concise access to structurally diverse amides and lactams with good efficiency. This transformation could also proceed smoothly by direct use of ether solvent as the formylated reagent in stead of formylic acid, thus furnishing an unique synthesis of formamides. The underlying principles of this unique amide synthesis was rationalized by a series of mechanistic studies, which involved a concerted decarboxylatively structural isomerization/acylation process as the key for amidation and a transamination/imine formation/aerobic oxidation cascade for formamidation. The potential utility of this strategy has been demonstrated by the readily accessible late&#8208;stage transformation of &#8203; biologically active molecules by 15N incorporating. This protocol was also applied to the total synthesis of a kind of drug Butenafine with 15N&#8208;enrichment.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective and Practical Stereoselective Synthesis of Nutlins Precursors by Immobilization of Privileged Chiral Mono&#8208;Amidine Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A strategy for the immobilization of Johnston's Mono(AMidine) catalyst (MAM) onto polystyrene, silica and hybrid silica&#8208;polystyrene nanoparticles is presented. The catalyst activity was evaluated in the stereoselective aza&#8208;Henry reaction leading to the pivotal &#946;&#8208;amino nitroalkane precursors of the anti&#8208;cancer agents Nutlins (with Nutlin&#8208;3a as the most active drug). The effect of the support and the linker on the catalytic performance was investigated, observing an interesting match/mismatch effect when using a chiral linker. The polystyrene&#8208;supported 3&#8208;pyrrolidinol&#8208;linked PS&#8208;(S)&#8208;Pyr&#8208;MAM organocatalyst showed the best activity among the tested catalysts, behaving very similarly to the homogeneous counterpart in the synthesis of a library of Nutlins precursors: yield up to 95%, ee up to 99%, and dr up to &gt;99:1. The catalyst recyclability was also assessed through simple filtration, yielding a satisfactory 93% ee after 5 cycles, showing only a moderate decrease in conversion efficiency (ca. 5% after each cycle), which resulted in an accumulated turnover number (TON) of 69.7.

         <title>Second&#8208;Generation One&#8208;Pot Enantioselective Heck&#8208;Matsuda Arylations of Unactivated Olefins Directly from Anilines and Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A highly improved second generation of the one&#8208;pot enantioselective Heck&#8208;Matsuda reaction directly from anilines and nitroarenes is reported. This practical arylation method, featuring 56 examples, relies on the in&#8197;situ diazotization of anilines and 3&#8208;aminothiophenes, or from the in&#8197;situ reduction&#8208;diazotization of nitrobenzene derivatives. The in&#8197;situ diazotization of the aniline, directly or from the in&#8208;situ reduction of the nitroarene, synchronizes smoothly with the enantioselective Heck&#8208;Matsuda reaction under mildly acidic conditions, bypassing the synthesis and handling of some unstable and/or difficult&#8208;to&#8208;prepare arenediazonium salts. The protocol was applied to the desymmetrization of unactivated olefins leading to the synthesis of functionalized spirocyclopentenyl hydantoins, aryl cyclopentenes, and &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones, in high yields (up to 99%) and er (up to 99:1). The efficiency of the method is showcased by the formal total synthesis of the bioactive compound VPC01091, a potential drug candidate for multiple sclerosis treatment at the gram scale in excellent yield (94%), in 97:3 er and 20&gt;1 dr.

&lt;p&gt;A highly improved second generation of the one-pot enantioselective Heck-Matsuda reaction directly from anilines and nitroarenes is reported.

Abstract
A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bond activation reaction of aryl oximes and CF3&#8208;substituted imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides (TFISYs) has been described, producing a wide variety of N&#8208;(2&#8208;cyanoaryl)&#8208;3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)isoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;imines in moderate to excellent yields. The transformation might involve a consecutive C(sp2)&#8211;H bond activation, intramolecular spiro&#8208;cyclization, C&#8722;C bond activation and N&#8722;O bond cleavage sequence. This developed protocol provides a direct entry to diverse trifluoromethyl and nitrile&#8208;containing heterocycles with the generation of water and dimethyl sulfoxide as by&#8208;products.

Abstract
Described herein is the discovery of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed chlorocylization strategy for the synthesis of 3&#8208;chloroindoles tolerated with a wide range of functional groups in moderate to excellent yields. In this transformation, the solvent effect is so important that only THF presents the positive effect. Furthermore, the present method provides an essay access to the N&#8208;unprotected 3&#8208;chloroindoles. A mechanism study showed that 2&#8208;alkynlanilines were catalyzed by palladium to from corresponding indoles, followed by copper&#8208;mediated oxidation chlorination to deliver the 3&#8208;chloroindoles products.

Abstract
Herein, we present a Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective C7&#8208;H dienylation of indolines at room temperature employing allenyl carbinol acetate as an efficient dienylating reagent. The reaction proceeds via C&#8722;H activation, regioselective 2,1&#8208;migratory insertion of the allene followed by &#946;&#8208;acetate elimination, resulting in a diverse array of C7&#8208;dienylated indolines. The methodology was further extended to C2&#8208;H dienylation of indoles, affording either branched or linear dienes, contingent on the nature of the substituent present at the allenylic carbon. In addition, hydroarylation of allenes was also successfully achieved with tri&#8208;substituted allenes, which was elusive so far under cobalt catalysis.

Abstract
The electrochemical catalyst&#8208;free generation of carbon radicals bearing three electron&#8208;withdrawing groups from the corresponding C&#8722;H nucleophiles remains unexplored. To this end, we report a direct electro&#8208;oxidation strategy to access these electrophilic carbon radicals under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. Enabled by this strategy, the radical 1,2&#8208;alkylarylations of allylic alcohols was realized, affording &#946;&#8208;quaternary ketones with high functional group compatibility. This protocol is operationally simple and also easy to scale up.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Analysis of Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Semihydrogenations of Alkynes</title>

Abstract
The semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes has historically been an essential technique in organic chemistry. In this context, researchers often employ transition metal complexes to achieve this conversion. Given the pronounced polarization of results, often yielding either very high or very low values, it remains challenging to discern the factors influencing reactivity and selectivity in many cases. In this work, we combine different sub&#8208;disciplines of digital chemistry with experimental outcomes to rationalize the results of a model Ni&#8208;catalyzed semihydrogenation that leads to E&#8208;alkenes. First, we analyze the main factors behind successful reactions using a machine learning classification model. The descriptors are computed directly from the SMILES strings of the reacting alkynes using an automated protocol that relies on structural features, molecular mechanics, and semi&#8208;empirical techniques. This workflow requires minimal human intervention and provides a fast and effective approach. Next, we couple the same descriptors with activation barriers calculated with density functional theory, generating a regression model that explains reactivity based on the properties of the alkyne substrates. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of using a combination of digital chemistry techniques to uncover reaction trends in Ni&#8208;catalyzed semihydrogenations of alkynes, an area where human intuition proves limited in application.

Abstract
Replacing hydrogen with deuterium raises the activation energy for C&#8722;D bond cleavage. This approach has gained attention in drug design, especially to protect the ortho&#8208;position of pyridines, which are susceptible to enzymatic oxidation. Until now, direct hydrogen isotope exchange has been largely restricted to the use of reactive organolithium reagents or metal&#8208;catalysed deuteration methods. In this work, we present a metal&#8208;free, selective ortho&#8208;deuteration of N&#8208;heterocycles starting from their N&#8208;oxides, proceeding at room temperature in just 5 minutes. This method achieves high deuterium incorporation across a broad range of N&#8208;heterocycles, including bioactive compounds. Experimental and computational studies have elucidated the mechanism of the reaction, showing that regioselectivity is driven by a successful increase in acidity at the ortho&#8208;position, enabling deprotonation by the in&#8208;situ generated dimsyl anion.

         <title>Biomimetic Orthogonal Removal of Arylacyl Protecting Groups from the C&#8208;Terminus of Substituted Amino Acids and Oligopeptides via Flavin N(5)&#8208;iminium Covalent Adducts</title>

Abstract
Flavin co&#8208;factors and other flavin derivatives are traditionally associated with one&#8208; or two&#8208;electron redox reactions. Flavins also form covalent intermediates with a variety of substrates. While extensive attention has focused on reactions at the C(4a) position of the flavin ring, recent interest has shifted toward the dynamic potential of the N(5) atom. In our study, we demonstrate the formation of artificial flavin N(5)&#8208;iminium covalent adducts via nucleophilic attack by enolates derived from arylacyl esters at the flavin N(5) position. This interaction mimics the biosynthesis of ether phospholipids catalysed by alkyl&#8208;dihydroxyacetone phosphate synthase via an N(5)&#8208;FAD iminium adduct formation and fatty acid release. Accordingly, we developed a method for the selective removal of phenacyl and 2&#8208;naphthylacetyl protecting groups from the C&#8208;terminus of &#945;&#8208;amino acids and di&#8208; and tripeptides using biomimetic flavin organocatalysis. Although many approaches are currently available for protection of C&#8208;terminus of peptides, their removal often requires harsh conditions, which cause racemization and the loss of optical purity, together with other side reactions. Our method is versatile, mild, orthogonal to most functional and protecting groups and maintains optical purity of &#945;&#8208;amino acids. From general point of view, the method signifies the groundbreaking application of the non&#8208;canonical reactivity of flavins in organic synthesis.

         <title>Aldehyde Dehydrogenase from Klebsiella pneumoniae: A Robust Biocatalyst for Preparing Heteroatom&#8208;Containing Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterocyclic scaffolds have broad applications in organic synthesis, resulting in the
production of essential compounds utilized in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and
dietary products. In this study, we present the characterization of a discovered succinic
semialdehyde dehydrogenase from Klebsiella pneumoniae (KpSSADH) and elucidate
its crystallographic structure. Further investigation into the catalytic performance of
KpSSADH reveals its remarkable efficiency in converting various heteroatomcontaining
(including N, S, O, and their combinations) cyclic aldehydes into the
corresponding acids with conversions reaching up to 99%. To expand the range of
available substrates, we designed cascade reactions by integrating thiol oxidase from
Methylovorus sp. MP688 or unspecific peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita with
KpSSADH. Through this approach, the desired acids via alcohol oxidation and C&#8208;H
bond oxyfunctionalization were obtained, respectively. The discovery of KpSSADH and
the envisioned cascade reactions have significantly broadened the biocatalytic toolbox
for synthesizing heteroatom&#8208;containing carboxylic acids, thereby holding potential for
applications in the modern pharmaceutical industry.</dc:description>

Abstract
Gem&#8208;difluoroethylene moiety holds pivotal roles in drug research owing to its unique ability as a bioisostere of the carbonyl group. Here, magnesium&#8208;mediated reductive defluorinative cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrene with carbon&#8208;centered electrophiles was developed. This method featured readily accessible reagents, mild conditions, and wide substrate scope, enabling the efficient production of gem&#8208;difluoroallyl carboxylic acid and ketones. The establishment of this protocol will offer a general alternative for the acquisition of gem&#8208;difluoroethylene compounds.

         <title>Synthesis of Layered Copper&#8208;Based 2D&#8208;MOFs for Enhanced Catalytic Regioselective Phosphorylation of Alkynes and P&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A functionalized heterogeneous Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Cu&#8208;2D&#8208;MOF) was synthesized through the reaction of Cu(NO3)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O with 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoroterephthalic acid and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine. The synthesized material underwent comprehensive characterization using various techniques, including FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy, N2 physical adsorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Subsequently, the catalytic performance of Cu&#8208;2D&#8208;MOFs was assessed in the hydrophosphorylation and aerobic oxidative dehydrogenative coupling reactions involving alkynes and P&#8722;H bonds. The catalyst demonstrated remarkable catalytic activity in both transformations, effectively yielding a wide variety of (E)&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;phosphoryl and alkynyl&#8208;phosphoryl compounds, respectively. Notably, the incorporation of this MOF material facilitated the phosphorylation reaction to proceed seamlessly, eliminating the necessity for supplementary small molecular organic ligands. Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrated ease of recovery and recyclability through a simple recovery process. Employing a systematic approach of sequential control experiments, we have delineated the potential transformation pathway of the reaction and consequently hypothesized a probable reaction mechanism for the observed transformation.

Subsequently, the catalytic performance of Cu-2D-MOFs was assessed in the hydrophosphorylation and aerobic oxidative dehydrogenative coupling reactions involving alkynes and P&#8722;H bonds. The catalyst demonstrated remarkable catalytic activity in both transformations, effectively yielding a wide variety of (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-alkenyl-phosphoryl and alkynyl-phosphoryl compounds, respectively. Notably, the incorporation of this MOF material facilitated the phosphorylation reaction to proceed seamlessly, eliminating the necessity for supplementary small molecular organic ligands. Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrated ease of recovery and recyclability through a simple recovery process. Employing a systematic approach of sequential control experiments, we have delineated the potential transformation pathway of the reaction and consequently hypothesized a probable reaction mechanism for the observed transformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
This article presents a method for asymmetric formal cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of benzylic alcohols with ketones through combined electrooxidation and organocatalysis. Employing inexpensive and environmentally friendly proline as a chiral organocatalyst, various benzylic alcohols and simple ketones serve as substrates to directly obtain diverse chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxycarbonyl compounds with moderate to good yields (up to 85%) and excellent stereoselectivity (up to 99% ee and 99:1&#8197;dr). The reaction proceeds under mild conditions at room temperature in air, without oxidants or additives, demonstrating robust functional group tolerance and atom efficiency. Hydrogen gas released at the cathode is the sole byproduct. Using L&#8208; or D&#8208;proline allows straightforward access to both chiral configurations of &#946;&#8208;hydroxycarbonyl compounds.

Abstract
Functionalized pyridines and 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines are crucial organic entities in natural products, organic materials, drugs and catalysts. Despite progress, a facile and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis remains desirable so far. In this context, we disclose a novel visible light&#8208;promoted radical cascade sulfonylation&#8208;cyclization&#8208;aromatization of N&#8208;propargyl enamides with selenosulfonates. This approach avoids the use of metal&#8208; or photocatalyst, bases and external oxidants, marking a significant advance in sustainable and green chemistry accords. Utilizing this protocol, we successfully synthesized a diverse range of sulfonated 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines and pyridines, featuring good functional group compatibility, simple operation and mild condition.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced 3&#8208;Alkylation of Coumarins with Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A method for the direct 3&#8208;alkylation of coumarins utilizing alkyl halides as the alkylating agents has been achieved. This versatile reaction is compatible with a range of alkyl halides, including activated alkyl bromides, perfluoroalkyl iodides, and unactivated alkyl iodides. We propose a mechanism involving photoinduced electron transfer between alkyl halides and coumarins in the first singlet excited (S1) state, which generates alkyl radicals essential for the 3&#8208;alkylation process.

         <title>The Latest Insights into Multiply Selective Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions Using a Chiral&#8208;Cavity&#8208;Structured Lewis&#8208;Acidic Boron Catalyst</title>

Abstract
The latest insights into multiply selective Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) reactions is presented, where a chiral&#8208;cavity&#8208;structured Lewis&#8208;acidic boron catalyst is employed. The catalyst ((R)&#8208;1) is capable of recognizing both dienes and dienophiles, primarily due to the influence of the suitable steric factors of its cavity. By taking advantage of the structural and exo&#8208;product&#8208;inducing properties of (R)&#8208;1, even in the presence of a mixture of inseparable dienes, the target products were successfully obtained in high yield with high enantioselectivity. As (R)&#8208;1 exhibited the capacity to differentiate between three&#8208;dimensional isomeric transition&#8208;state structures in DA reactions, this work contributes to the advancement of artificial enzyme&#8208;like catalysis, which has so far remained elusive.

         <title>Scalable Electrochemical Dehalogenative Carboxylation without a Sacrificial Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A scalable electrochemical procedure for the synthesis of carboxylic acids from organic halides has been developed using a spinning cylinder electrode electrochemical reactor. The electrochemical process is based on the reductive dehalogenation of the starting material followed by trapping of the resulting carbanion with CO2. The protocol is compatible both with organic chlorides and bromides and uses inexpensive graphite and stainless steel as electrode materials. As sacrificial metal anodes are avoided, the method can be readily scaled up in flow mode. The procedure is compatible with a wide range of substrates (24 examples), including aryl and alkyl halides as well as heterocyclic compounds. Multigram scale preparations in flow mode have been demonstrated by processing 600&#8197;mL of reaction mixture in an electrolyte recirculation setup.

Abstract
A molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenation of sulfoxides, pyridine and quinoline N&#8208;oxides, N&#8208;hydroxybenzotriazoles, as well as the reduction of nitroarenes to anilines, has been developed using monocyclic terpenes such as &#947;&#8208;terpinene as an environmentally benign hydrogen surrogate. The only byproducts generated are water and p&#8208;cymene, under neat reaction conditions in which the terpene acts as both solvent and reducing agent. These features make this approach a highly attractive and sustainable alternative for the reduction of S&#8208;O and N&#8208;O containing compounds. Additionally, the reaction exhibited excellent chemoselectivity, tolerating a wide variety of functional groups.

These features make this approach a highly attractive and sustainable alternative for the reduction of S-O and N-O containing compounds. Additionally, the reaction exhibited excellent chemoselectivity, tolerating a wide variety of functional groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A method has been developed for the synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical aryl 1, 2&#8208;diketones at room temperature, without the need for transition metals or photocatalysts. This protocol employs aromatic terminal alkynes or alkenes to react with aryl iodides under conditions involving formate, air, and DMSO. Mechanistic studies indicate that formate, air, and DMSO are all necessary conditions, and that the highly reactive carbon dioxide radical anion (CO2&#8901;&#8722;) generated under these conditions plays a key role in the reaction.

         <title>NFSI&#8208;TEMPO Catalysed Stereoselective Synthesis of 2&#8208;Deoxyglycosides from Glycals</title>

Abstract
2&#8208;deoxyglycosides are prominent constituents of diverse naturally occurring glycans and are known to participate in crucial biological pathways. We herein demonstrate NFSI&#8208;TEMPO as an efficient organocatalyst for the formation of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glycosides from glycals. For the first time a catalytic behaviour of NFSI&#8208;TEMPO combination has been observed. The reaction conditions have been found suitable for the generation of glycosides from commercial alcohols, amino acid, sterol, phenols and monosaccharide derived alcohols. Broad range of protecting groups on both glycal and glycosyl acceptors as well as alcohols of varied reactivity were found to be compatible for the generation of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glycosides in moderate to good yields. The synthetic potential of the newly established transformation was illustrated by application in trisaccharide synthesis and gram&#8208;scale reaction.

Abstract
A base&#8208;mediated one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step, four&#8208;component reaction has been developed to synthesize imidazole&#8208;4(2H)&#8208;ones, utilizing commercially available amino acid esters, aldehydes, alkynes, and amino alcohols. Control experiments and isolation of the intermediate revealed the mechanistic details. This four&#8208;component reaction proceeds via imine formation, followed by the nucleophilic addition of alkyne to form a propargylamine precursor. Subsequently, the propargylamine precursor under undergoes base&#8208;mediated conversion into 1&#8208;azadiene, followed by in situ ketene formation to generate (allylideneamino)prop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;one. The nucleophilic addition of amino alcohol and subsequent intramolecular cyclization provides imidazole&#8208;4 (2H)&#8208;ones exclusively.

         <title>Imidazolium&#8208;Dithiocarboxylate Zwitterions Catalysed Ring&#8208;Opening Additions of Cyclopropenones</title>

Abstract
Imidazolium&#8208;dithiocarboxylate zwitterions (NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2), a novel organocatalyst that derived from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC), was used to activate cyclopropenones. Under the catalysis of 10&#8197;mol% NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2, a range of phenols, alcohols, primary and secondary amines react with cyclopropenones to produce trisubstituted &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters and amides in 46&#8211;95% yield. More than 68 products, including 7 natural product derivatives have been synthesized through this method. Mechanism study showed NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2 act as a Lewis base to activate the C=C double bond of cyclopropenones and trigger the ring&#8208;opening reaction. HRMS analysis indicated the formation of the key adduct of NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2 and cyclopropenone. More importantly, this study demonstrated completely different catalytic activity of NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2 and NHC catalysts, the latter one cannot catalyse these reactions.

         <title>Au(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Hydroarylation of Allenes for the Synthesis of Tetrahydrodiazepines or Tetrahydrodiazonines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Allenes tethered to pyrroles undergo Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation leading to tetrahydrodiazepines or tetrahydrodiazonines. The regioselectivity of the reaction is governed by both the substitution pattern of the allene and the nature of the Au(I) ligand. Hence, alkyl&#8208;gem&#8208;disubstituted allenes preferentially lead to tetrahydrodiazepines via 7&#8208;exo&#8208;cyclizations, while aryl&#8208;substituted allenes preferentially lead to tetrahydrodiazonines via 9&#8208;endo&#8208;cyclization when a phosphite ligand is used. Enantioselective reactions have been developed with the SEGPHOS chiral ligand, leading to chiral heterocycles with high enantioselectivity (up to 96% ee). In addition, DFT calculations have streamlined the regioselectivity (7&#8208;exo vs 9&#8208;endo) of these gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations.

Abstract
A chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of axially chiral alkenes was developed via an enantioselective and para&#8208;selective Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction between phenols and 1&#8208;alkynylnaphth&#8208;2&#8208;ols. This methodology features an efficient hydroarylation with high functional group tolerance, complete para&#8208;selectivity, excellent yields (up to 99%), and enantioselectivities (up to 94% ee) in the presence of a N&#8208;triflylphosphoramide catalyst. DFT calculations were performed to investigate para&#8208;selectivity and results indicate that both kinetics and thermodynamics parameters are more favorable compared to ortho&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Controlling Catalyst Speciation to Achieve Room Temperature Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Aminations with Aryl and Heteroaryl Chlorides</title>

Abstract
The amination of aryl halides with palladium catalysts (Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination) is a widely used transformation in synthetic and drug discovery chemistry. In this report, we demonstrate that a monometallic 2&#8208;phosphinoimidazole Pd catalyst exhibits comparable or enhanced reactivity when compared to all ligands screened for room temperature amination of aryl chlorides with secondary amines. The di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine derivative showed extremely high reactivity while the di&#8208;isopropyl variant led to almost complete loss of catalytic activity. Computational and experimental mechanistic and kinetic studies indicate that a monometallic Pd structure rather than a bimetallic Pd structure is key to fast catalysis. The di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine ligand has fast catalysis because it thermodynamically disfavors the formation of a much less active bimetallic Pd complex. A wide substrate scope is demonstrated for the arylation of secondary amines with aryl chlorides using our new catalyst system.

Abstract
A general protocol for the efficient synthesis of a variety of highly functionalized pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ones has been developed through a sequential Wolff rearrangement and [3+3] annulation reaction of enaminones and diazo compounds. This straightforward approach features wide substrate applicability, good substrate tolerance, moderate to excellent yields, and without any catalyst, and enables access to structurally diverse pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;one skeletons. Additionally, scale&#8208;up experiments and synthetic derivatizations demonstrated the potential synthetic utility of the transformations.

         <title>Alkylation of Imines with Alkyl Halides under Electrochemical Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An electrochemical protocol for the alkylation of imines was developed by using easily available alkyl halides as the alkyl sources, graphite felt (GF) as anode and zinc plate as cathode. Various substituted imines, alkyl bromides and alkyl iodides were suitable for this reaction and a series of &#945;&#8208;branched amines were obtained in moderate to good yields. This method provides a green way for the addition of imines to avoid the need for metal reagents, chemical oxidants and reductants, which makes it has a good application prospect in drug synthesis.

Abstract
A cascade reaction involving 2&#8208;isocyanophenyl propargylic ester and 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2H&#8208;chromen&#8208;2&#8208;one has been documented. This reaction leads to the formation of a highly strained cyclopropen&#8208;imine species, thereby offering an efficient route to synthesize quinoline&#8208;fused polycyclic skeletons.

         <title>Organic Photoredox Catalytic Sulfonylation of Enaminones to Access 3&#8208;Sulfonyl Chromones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we disclose a readily available phenothiazine derivative as an oxidizing organic photocatalyst, that serves to induce radical cascade sulfonylation/cyclization reaction of enaminones. A variety of 3&#8208;sulfonyl chromones have been obtained with moderate to excellent yields. This catalytic platform proceeds under metal&#8208;free conditions with a wide substrate scope and broad functional group compatibility, which unlocks the new reactivity of phenothiazine derivatives and adds significant synthetic values to O&#8208;heterocycles.

A 1,3&#8208;iodoesterification of 2&#8208;substituted indoles with trihaloacetic acid, iodination reagent, and hypervalent iodine(III) compound was developed as an acid&#8208;promoted Csp2&#8722;H/Csp3&#8722;H dual functionalization reaction to furnish 3&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8208;trihaloacetoxymethyl indoles. The one&#8208;pot 1,3&#8208;iodoesterification/hydrolysis of the trihaloester group provided 3&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8208;pivaloylmethyl indoles via the rearrangement of the pivaloyl group. The reaction proceeded through a trihaloacetic acid&#8208;assisted electrophilic activation of the iodination reagent after the formation of an indolyl(mesityl)iodonium trihaloacetate.

         <title>Photoinduced Catalytic Alkylation of Active Methine Compounds with Nonactivated Alkenes Using Yttrium Triflate as a Lewis Acid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Photoinduced catalytic alkylation reactions of active methine compounds with nonactivated alkenes have been developed using an organophotocatalyst, a metal Lewis acid, an arylthiol, and an amine base catalyst system. The alkylation reactions proceeded smoothly under ambient conditions with blue light irradiation, affording the desired products bearing quaternary carbon centers in high yields. Furthermore, enantioselective alkylation with an nonactivated alkene was achieved using a chiral Lewis acid.

         <title>Mg(SPh)2 as a Catalyst for Efficient Photocatalytic Alkylation Reactions of Active Methylene Compounds with Nonactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Mg(SPh)2 has been found to be a highly active catalyst in photocatalytic alkylation reactions of active methylene compounds with nonactivated alkenes. The desired reactions proceeded smoothly to afford the corresponding alkylated products in high yields with low catalyst loadings (0.2&#8211;0.3&#8197;mol%). This protocol is applicable to a continuous&#8208;flow system. Notably, magnesium is an earth&#8208;abundant metal, and Mg(SPh)2 exhibits higher catalytic activity than the previously reported LiSPh.

         <title>2&#8208;Aminoindoles and 2&#8208;Iminoindolines as Viable Precursors of Indole&#8208;Fused Nitrogenated Polyheterocycles</title>

Abstract
The synthesis of architecturally complex polyheterocyclic structures embedding the indole ring represents a growing field of interest. Carbolines and their partially dehydro derivatives, pyrazinoindoles, indoloindoles, azepinoindoles and other medium&#8208;sized derivatives are only some examples of indole&#8208;containing polycyclic compounds featured by enhanced pharmacological and photophysical properties. Among various synthetic protocols to prepare these important target compounds those based on the utilization of 2&#8208;aminoindoles and 2&#8208;iminoindolines are gaining increasing interest because of the ease of their preparation. The presence of a couple of reactive sites in these derivatives is instrumental for the assembling of polyheterocyclic structures exploiting single step operations featured by efficient cascade or tandem processes. Several of these methods employ catalyzed reactions which can be developed for the asymmetric synthesis of enantiopure compounds. This review provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date report on the currently available methods for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aminoindoles and 2&#8208;iminoindolines and their application to the preparation of polyheterocyclic derivatives.

         <title>Preparation of Mesoporous Cu2O Nanospheres for Green Synthesis in the Enantioselective Boron Conjugate Addition of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Chiral Compounds in Aqueous Phase</title>

Abstract
Chiral organoboron compounds are essential intermediates in various significant reactions. However, there are still few efficient catalysts for their synthesis. This paper reports a novel catalytic material for chiral asymmetric boron conjugate addition reactions: mesoporous Cu2O nanospheres (M&#8722;Cu2O). M&#8722;Cu2O is approximately 0.55&#8197;&#956;m, exhibiting dense and uniformly distributed worm&#8208;like pores. It features a specific surface area of 15.7&#8197;m2/g and an average pore size of 14.3&#8197;nm. Under the conditions of Toluene:H2O=9:1, with a chiral ligand amount of 3.6&#8197;mol% and no additional base, it achieves a high yield (98% yield) and impressive enantioselectivity (99% ee) for the template substrate chalcone using only 3.0&#8197;mol% of the catalyst. Notably, the catalyst can be easily recovered and maintains robust catalytic performance after seven cycles, yielding 92% and an ee value of 90%. This work presents a mild and effective method for synthesizing chiral boron compounds in an aqueous phase, significantly enhancing the application potential of mesoporous copper oxide nanospheres.

         <dc:description>We reported an electrochemical oxidative carbonylation of N&#8208;phenylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amine derivatives under mild condtions without an external oxidant. Our approach demonstrated a novel electrochemical oxidative carbonylation reaction mode in which the simultaneous reaction of catalyst and substrate with the anode has been developed. Furthermore, an electrochemical C&#8208;H activation for the synthesis of cyclized pyridinium ion has also been realized. Mechanistic investigations suggested that the process involved a &#8220;PdII/PdIII/PdI/PdII&#8221; catalytic cycle, and H2 was generated at the cathode.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative and Deconstructive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Acrylic Acids with Ketone&#8208;Derived Dihydroquinazolinones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, an iron&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the aromatization&#8208;driven deconstruction and decarboxylation of ketone&#8208;derived dihydroquinazolinones in reaction with unsaturated carboxylic acids is reported. A diverse range of fluoroacrylic acids and cinnamic acids reacted effectively with dihydroquinazolinones, yielding essential monofluoroalkenes and alkenes with excellent stereoselectivity. Additionally, spiro&#8208;dihydroquinazolinones served as suitable substrates, facilitating the synthesis of valuable quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones featuring alkene motifs. This protocol is notable for its operational simplicity and versatility, enabling the chemical diversification of active molecules.

Additionally, spiro-dihydroquinazolinones served as suitable substrates, facilitating the synthesis of valuable quinazolin-4(3H)-ones featuring alkene motifs. This protocol is notable for its operational simplicity and versatility, enabling the chemical diversification of active molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Deoxygenation of Nitroarenes to Access N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we present the example of iron&#8208;catalyzed reductive amination of nitroarenes under the iron/borane system, providing diverse N&#8208;heterocycles in moderate to good yields. This transformation has high efficiency, broad substrate scope, and good functional group compatibility. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that hydroxylamines derived from nitrosoarenes may serve as crucial intermediates rather than anilines, and free organic radicals may not participate in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Intramolecular Crossed [2+2] Cycloaddition through Visible&#8208;Light Triplet Sensitization: Expedient Access to Bridged Bicyclic Alkene</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced intramolecular crossed [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of allene&#8208;tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes was reported in this paper. The reactions were conducted under mild conditions using Iridium(III) catalyst FirPic as a photosensitizer for energy transfer, affording bridged bicyclic alkenes in moderate to good yields with excellent regioselectivity and stereoselectivity through the regulation of substituents at the olefin's terminal position. Meanwhile, the computational study explained the special region control assisted by sulfonyl radicals in detail.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization Amination of Propargylamine and 1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A novel and efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization amination of propargylamines and 1,3&#8208;dienes is reported for the first time, yielding a series of chloromethylene pyrrolidines with high efficiency and excellent selectivity. This method was successfully applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and drug molecules, providing molecular backbones with potential applications. The reaction was shown to achieve regioselective modulation of the product molecules through the resonance between the solvent and allylpalladium. Additionally, the E&#8208;form products were found to be thermodynamically stable.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Cascade Synthesis of 5&#8208;Alkylidene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;Lactams via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Hydro&#8208;Oxycarbonylation</title>

Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrofunctionalization of alkynes and, more precisely, the intramolecular hydro&#8208;oxycarbonylation (cycloisomerization) of acetylenic acids, has been widely employed as a key step in cascade processes for the construction of valuable and complex molecules. However, in contrast with other aminonucleophiles, no method has been reported for the reaction between primary monoamines and non&#8208;activated alkynoic acids. Hence, a procedure has been devised for the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective preparation of 5&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams via a copper&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction between alkynoic acids and amines. The developed protocol proves to be scalable and demonstrates significant tolerance to a wide range of structurally diverse alkynoic acids and amines bearing various functional groups, as evidenced by 60 high&#8208;yielding examples. An exhaustive experimental and computational analysis of the reaction is also provided to unravel the nature and role of the copper catalyst, the observed regioselectivity and the mechanism of the reaction.

         <title>Divergent Hydroelementation of Unsaturated C&#8722;C Bonds Using 3d Transition Metal Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Divergent hydroelementation reactions offer a cost&#8208;effective synthetic protocol to prepare two or more products starting from same set of reactant molecules by altering one or more reaction parameters. This strategy is quite helpful in functionalizing unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds into several value&#8208;added chemical compounds by using various organic and metal&#8208;based catalysts. In this regard, catalysts derived from 3d metals have come to the fore, providing an alternative to heavier transition metals and rare&#8208;earth elements. In this review, we summarize and elucidate the recent developments of divergent hydroelementation of alkenes and alkynes using the first&#8208;row transition metal complexes by categorizing them into three classes: (1) Catalyst and ligand&#8208;controlled; (2) Reaction component&#8208;controlled and (3) Substrate&#8208;controlled. Given the importance of hydroelementation reactions, we hope this review will be helpful to the organic chemistry community.

         <title>Multifunctionalization of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Boranes by a Single Metal&#8208;free Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Selective access to densely functionalized boranes, with identical or distinct functional groups at the boron center, has great potentials in materials science, organic synthesis and drug discovery. However, assembling multifunctional boranes was heavily dependent on hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (HAT) at high temperatures, hazardous radical initiators, metal photocatalysts and HAT reagents, respectively. Simultaneously, competitive side reactions such as polymerizations and regioisomers formation remain highly challenging. Herein, a programmable multifunctionalization of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) boranes is developed for the first time powered by a single, metal&#8208;free photocatalyst, in which boryl radicals from sequential substituted boranes are generated instead of polymerizations. This robust and versatile catalytic system leads to an extremely broad variety of boranes incorporated with diverse alkyl or alkenyl groups in high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities.

Abstract
Chiral, vicinal diols are of high interest for academic research and industrial applications. For synthesizing chiral diols, enzymes are important catalysts due to their high selectivity and ability to work under tolerable temperature and no pressure. In this study, two consecutive enzyme&#8208;catalyzed steps were used for the asymmetric synthesis of aliphatic, vicinal diols with high product concentrations and chiral purity. The reaction comprised a ligation step employing lyases and a subsequent reduction step using oxidoreductases. Either in an aqueous buffer or an organic solvent, the potentially biobased aldehydes acetaldehyde, propanal, butanal, and pentanal were used as substrates. Here, all possible stereoisomers of 2,3&#8208;butanediol, 3,4&#8208;hexanediol, 4,5&#8208;octanediol, and 5,6&#8208;decanediol were produced with isomeric content values between 72% and &gt;99%, and concentrations between 4.1 and 115&#8197;mM. This work shows how four symmetric, chiral, vicinal diols can be synthesized by combining enzymes in a modular way, including exemplarily scaling.

         <title>Photoinduced Hydrogen Atom Transfer Activation of Benzylic C&#8722;H Bonds Functionalization</title>

Abstract
Visible light, as an efficient and renewable resource, has gained significant attention in organic synthesis due to its mild, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly nature. Among the various photocatalytic processes, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) has become a crucial mechanism for the activation of C&#8722;H bonds, with a particular focus on the functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. This review shows recent developments in the area of photoinduced HAT and its use in benzylic C&#8722;H bonds functionalization. We discuss halogen atom radicals, N&#8208;centered radical, O&#8208;centered radical, S&#8208;centered radical and C&#8208;centered radical in HAT processes, and influence on reaction selectivity and substrate versatility. The potential of photoinduced HAT to bypass the need for transition metal catalysts and directing groups positions it as a promising approach for constructing intricate organic molecules with high atom economy and sustainability. This review aims to offer a detailed summary of the current state of photoinduced HAT, providing insights into its potential uses in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aminoquinazolines through I2&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of 2&#8208;Aminoaryl Ketone Oximes and Isocyanides</title>

Abstract
An I2/cumene hydroperoxide (CHP)&#8208;mediated tandem cyclization of 2&#8208;aminoaryl ketone oximes with isocyanides has been developed. Various 2&#8208;aminoquinazolines were obtained in 49&#8211;96% yields under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, and the resulting 4&#8208;phenylquinazolin&#8208;2&#8208;amines show typical fluorescent emission properties. The key to the success of this strategy involves the formation of iminyl radical via the N&#8722;O bond cleavage of hydroxy oxime.

Abstract
Phosphorus Fluoride Exchange (PFEx) is a new click chemistry technology that hinges on the creation of innovative hubs to unlock its potential and broaden its applications. In this study, we outline some guiding principles for PFEx hub development and validate these principles by developing a new hub, 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyclotriphosphazenes (SACPs). These SACPs serve as versatile PFEx hubs with stable functionality and orthogonal reactivity, exemplifying their utility within the Diversity Oriented Clicking (DOC) framework. We demonstrate that SACPs interact with various 1,3&#8208;dipoles, enabling the synthesis of phosphorus&#8208;rich compounds through sequential cycloaddition and PFEx reactions, thus pioneering new synthetic routes for wide application of click chemistry.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Engineering of Oleate Hydratase for the Synthesis of Small Chiral Alcohols without Decoy Molecule</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Small and chiral secondary alcohols are sought&#8208;after compounds that are frequently used in the synthesis of biologically active compounds. However, their stereochemically correct synthesis remains a challenge for the chemical industry. Synthetic routes are restrained by multiple steps and thus low atom efficiency. Here we employ engineered variants from the oleate hydratase from E. meningoseptica to produce chiral C5&#8208;C8 secondary alcohols within a single step. First, we established a two&#8208;phase system (2&#8208;PS) to trap the volatile substrates/products which facilitated semi&#8208;rational mutagenesis in the active site and tunnel of the enzyme. These efforts led to variants with an up to 20&#8208;fold increase in catalytic activity and &gt;99% ee, notably, without the use of a decoy molecule. Computational analysis indicated structural changes in the tunnel radius, ligand transport and energy profiles, which gave us hints to explain the enhanced performance of the variants. Interestingly, scaling up the reaction volume demonstrated significant increases in product concentrations, leading up to a 100&#8208;fold increase in comparison to the current benchmark. This new 2&#8208;PS and the engineered enzyme variants offer a promising approach for a scalable, asymmetric hydration of small unactivated alkenes, which would drastically ease the access to chiral alcohol&#8208;based pheromones or drugs.

         <title>Organophotocatalytic Site&#8208;Selective Radical Deuteration at Sterically Hindered Benzylic Positions by Consecutive Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond activation or exchange labeling with hydrogen isotope are of vital importance, in particular for high&#8208;specific&#8208;selectivity deuteration of pharmaceuticals. While catalytic approaches relying on closed&#8208;shell manifolds have been well documented for efficient delivery of deuterium at sterically less hindered benzylic positions, complementary strategies target sterically bulky benzylic positions remain a long&#8208;standing challenge. We herein disclose a mild, versatile approach to achieve efficient and selective radical deuteration by merging organophotoredox catalysis and bromine radical catalysis. This open&#8208;shell strategy provides the unparalleled ability of the convergent unification of readily available quinoxalinones and para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) and D2O through a simultaneous highly cross&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and chem&#8208;selective radical coupling&#8208;H/D exchange approach. Furthermore, the long&#8208;standing challenge of the incorporation of deuterium to sterically bulky benzylic positions has been addressed through this approach.

         <title>Photoredox Hydroacylative Dearomatization of Indoles with Aromatic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein we reported for the first time a photocatalytic dearomative hydroacylation reaction of electron&#8208;deficient indoles with readily available aromatic acids through a phosphoranyl radical&#8208;assisted deoxygenative process. A range of racemic and optically active 2&#8208;acylindoline derivatives were obtained in good yields (up to 94%) with good diastereoselectivity. The synthetic robustness is highlighted by the enantioselective dearomatization of indoles and the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and pharmaceutical molecules. This protocol features broad substrate scope and mild reaction conditions, providing a reliable entry to developing deoxygenative strategies in dearomatization reactions. Preliminary mechanistic studies and DFT calculations suggest that a Giese&#8208;type radical addition pathway should be involved.

         <title>Disclosing the Intra&#8208;Catalyst Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in Tetrahydropyran&#8208;Based Dipeptidic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we describe how minor structural modifications to our bifunctional organocatalysts based on sugar amino acids (SAAs) can alter the network of non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) within the catalyst, leading to significant changes in their catalytic activity. This is attributed to the intra&#8208;catalyst NCIs, which induce conformational changes that are reflected in the transition state of the rate&#8208;determining step of the Michael addition of aldehydes to trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes. Through kinetic experiments, conformational analysis, and DFT calculations, we found that the presence of a methoxy group at the C4 position of the tetrahydropyran ring reduces the catalytic activity by a factor of five compared to the catalyst without the methoxy group. Additionally, we have identified the different intra&#8208;catalyst NCIs, both attractive and repulsive, that drive the conformational changes, ultimately modifying the energy levels of the transition states of the rate&#8208; and enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step of the reaction.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;C Coupling of Alkenyl Boronates and Bromodifluoroacetates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The reaction of alkenyl boronates and bromodifluoroacetates in the presence of copper powder and TMEDA as the catalytic system was developed. The corresponding C&#8722;C coupling products were obtained in 35&#8211;93% yield. The method tolerated a variety of functional groups, namely, phenol, (thio)ether, protected amino&#8208;, hydroxy&#8208;, ketone, and carboxylic acid moieties, as well as various saturated carbo&#8208; and heterocycles, and was compatible with multigram scale&#8208;up (to 76&#8197;g). The diastereoselectivity of the process was typically low so that ca. 1:1 E/Z isomeric mixtures were formed from pure E or Z alkenyl boronates. Further functional group transformations demonstrated the utility of the prepared compounds as valuable building blocks for synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Based on the obtained results and the literature data, a plausible reaction mechanism was proposed involving the formation of radical and organocopper intermediates.

Abstract
An iodine&#8208;catalyzed C3&#8208;arylation of indoles with cyclohexanones to selectively synthesize 2&#8208;(indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenols has been described. Mechanism studies indicate that the oxygen atom in 2&#8208;(indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenols is originally from DMSO. This cascade involving dehydration condensation, selective oxygenation, dehydrogenation, and aromatization was achieved in one pot under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Organoselenyl Quinolines through the Reduction of Alkynes Mediated by Electrophilic Organoselenium Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A methodology for the synthesis and functionalization of quinolines was developed. This approach involves the cyclization of 2&#8208;amino arylalkynyl ketones to 3&#8208;(organoselanyl)&#8208;4&#8208;iodoquinolines through a sequential reaction pathway. The process includes: (i) in&#8197;situ formation of an electrophilic organoselenyl species, (ii) activation of the alkyne&#8216;s carbon&#8208;carbon bond via a seleniranium ion intermediate, (iii) anti&#8208;nucleophilic attack of iodide on the activated triple bond, and (iv) subsequent condensation. The resulting 3&#8208;(organoselanyl)&#8208;4&#8208;iodoquinolines were demonstrated to be versatile substrates, efficiently undergoing Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling to produce 4&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;quinolines and Ullmann&#8208;type reactions to yield the corresponding sulfides. Furthermore, the 4&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;quinolines were readily converted into selenophene derivatives via halogen&#8208;promoted electrophilic cyclization, highlighting the broad applicability of the developed method.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Difluoroalkylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds with Trimethylsilyl Chloride as a Dual&#8208;Function Reagent</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a mild, operationally simple method for synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroketones through selective single defluorination of trifluoroketones and subsequent difluoroalkylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds at room temperature within a single step. By successfully difluoroalkylating unfunctionalized ethers and benzyl radical precursors, we demonstrated the broad applicability of this method. The mechanistic study supports that the success of the reaction is probably attributed to the dual roles of trimethylsilyl chloride under the photocatalyzed conditions: 1) fluoride anion scavenger; and 2) chlorine radical source which promote hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction.

         <dc:description>Deuterium&#8208;labeled compounds play a pivotal role in physical organic chemistry, life sciences, and materials science. This has resulted in a surge of interest in deuterium&#8208;labeled active pharmaceutical ingredients in recent years. In this study, we present a continuous flow Raney nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange process that boasts compatibility with a wide spectrum of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles and pharmaceutical compounds. The broad applicability of the developed method was demonstrated through successful labeling of various purine bases, imidazoles, pyridines, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including complex structures like abacavir and remdesivir. Control experiments revealed Raney nickel's crucial role in the exchange process, showcasing the superiority of the continuous flow approach over batch reactions. Furthermore, a scaled&#8208;up experiment demonstrated the robustness of the catalyst.</dc:description>
