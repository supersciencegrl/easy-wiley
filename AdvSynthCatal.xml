         <title>Diboron Reagents in Modern Reduction Chemistry: A Versatile Tool for Reduction of Various Functional Groups</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of diboron compounds as new greener reducing agents in organic synthesis. It will cover their unique properties, mechanisms of action, and versatility in reducing various functional groups, such as carbonyls, nitro groups, alkenes, and alkynes. By highlighting their advantages over traditional hydride&#8208;based reagents and catalytic hydrogenation, the review emphasizes their role in advancing sustainable and safe chemical practices. Additionally, practical guidelines for employing diboron compounds in laboratory and industrial settings will be included, along with comparisons to alternative methodologies. This review intends to serve as an educational and practical resource for chemists, researchers, and industries adopting greener reduction strategies.

Reduction of various organic functionality including aldehyde, ketone, nitro, imine, and alkyne has gained noteworthy attention due to its vast application of products in organic transformation reactions. To attempt hydrogenation several approaches have been reported by using molecular hydrogen as a reducing source. Besides, this diboron (tetrahydroxy diboron, bispinacolato diboron, neoglycolato diboron) has shown a promising and alternative approach for the reduction of the reducible functional group without using any molecular hydrogen. The ligand&#8208;free reduction approach of commercially available diboron reduces the organic compound by using water or organic solvent and metal salt making it an attractive protocol in the recent era of reduction as well as hydrogenation. Herein, we provide an extensive and collective overview of the diboron&#8208;mediated reduction approach of various organic compounds.

         <title>DBU&#8208;Triggered One&#8208;Pot Domino Transformation of Trifluoromethyl Ketones and Dicyanoalkenes into gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenyl &#947;&#8208;Lactams</title>

         <dc:description>
A base&#8208;catalyzed, one&#8208;pot domino reaction of trifluoromethyl ketones with &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dicyanoalkenes has been developed to access gem&#8208;difluoroalkenyl unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams. The proposed mechanism involves sequential C&#8211;C, C&#8211;O, and C&#8211;N bond formation, followed by C&#8211;F bond cleavage.

The direct conversion of trifluoromethyl ketones to valuable gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes remains a synthetically useful but underexplored transformation. Herein, we report a base&#8208;catalyzed, one&#8208;pot domino reaction of trifluoromethyl ketones with dicyanoalkenes, enabling formal dual deoxygenation and defluorination. This protocol affords a diverse range of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenyl unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams in yields of 62&#8211;95% under mild and operationally simple conditions. A proposed mechanism involves a sequential vinylogous aldol reaction, cyclization, rearrangement, and defluorination.

         <title>Bifunctional Organocatalysts and Br&#248;nsted Bases in Cooperative Catalysis for the Asymmetric [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] Cycloaddition of In Situ&#8208;Generated Dienes from Isochromane&#8208;3,4&#8208;Diones with Nitroalkenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, the first asymmetric [4+2] cycloaddition is reported, utilizing in&#8201;situ&#8208;generated dienes from isochromane&#8208;3,4&#8208;diones and nitroalkenes, catalyzed by a bifunctional thiourea organocatalyst and Br&#248;nsted base cocatalysts, yielding highly enantioselective bridged and spiro lactones, with further investigations into novel reactivity and product formation, offering a new approach to natural product synthesis.

Herein, the first asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reaction involving in&#8201;situ&#8208;generated dienes from readily available isochromane&#8208;3,4&#8208;diones is reported, using nitroalkenes as dienophilic counterparts. The reaction is catalyzed by a bifunctional thiourea&#8208;epi&#8208;quinine organocatalyst, cooperatively assisted by readily available Br&#248;nsted base cocatalysts. This strategy enables highly enantio&#8208; and exo&#8208;diastereo&#8208;selective [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition with a wide range of nitroalkenes, leading to the formation of valuable bridged lactones, a motif found in many natural products. The method applies not only to &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes, but also to aliphatic nitroalkenes such as (nitromethylene)cyclohexane, leading to an unusual bridged spiro lactone. The reaction proceeds with complete regioselectivity, furnishing the products in high yields and achieving enantiomeric ratios (e.r.) ranging from 90:10 to 98:2. The use of Br&#248;nsted base as a cocatalyst not only enhances the turnover and promotes diene formation by vinylogous dienolization, leading to a higher yield in shorter reaction times, but also improves the enantioselectivity. In addition, follow&#8208;up reactivity is investigated, furnishing interesting novel bridged amino ester and tetraline motifs.

         <title>Axial&#8208;to&#8208;Point Chirality Transfer: Chromium(VI)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroxylative Dearomatization of 2&#8208;Naphthols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first chromium(VI)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroxylative dearomatization of axially chiral 2&#8208;naphthols has been developed, via an efficient axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality transfer. This method affords hydroxylative dearomatized products in good yields (up to 85%) with outstanding enantioselectivities (up to &gt; 99% ee) and enantiospecificity (up to &gt; 99% es) under mild reaction conditions.

Axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality transfer is an important strategy for the construction of chiral centers, where the axial chiral reagents are mostly limited to atropomerically stable ones. In this work, a Cr(VI)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroxylative dearomatization (via axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality transfer) of axially chiral 2&#8208;naphthols is presented. This transformation proceeds efficiently across a broad range of axially chiral 2&#8208;naphthols, yielding hydroxylative dearomatized products in good yields (up to 85%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to&#8201;&gt;&#8201;99% ee) and enantiospecificity (up to&#8201;&gt;&#8201;99% es).

         <title>CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Cyclic Carbonate Transformation at Ambient Pressure Using a Mechanochemically Prepared Ti(III) Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ti(III) complex synthesized mechanochemically catalyzes the cycloaddition of CO2 (1&#8201;bar) with terminal, internal, and trisubstituted epoxides. Mechanistic studies by density functional theory calculations reveal that the superior activity of Ti(III) compared to Ti(IV) arises from its lower oxophilicity, facilitating CO2 insertion into Ti&#8211;O bonds, as supported by EPR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography.

A readily accessible Ti(III) complex, [Li(thf)4][Ti(MesPDA)2] (4) (MesPDA = N, N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;o&#8208;phenylenediamide), has been synthesized mechanochemically, offering a sustainable route to Ti(III) species. Complex 4, combined with [NBu4I] (TBAI), efficiently catalyzes the cycloaddition of CO2 (1 bar) with terminal and internal epoxides, bio&#8208;resourced diepoxides, and the tri&#8208;substituted limonene oxide. This work represents the first example of a Ti(III)&#8208;based catalyst capable of efficiently synthesizing cyclic carbonates from CO2 and epoxides under atmospheric pressure, and demonstrates the superior catalytic activity of Ti(III) compared to its Ti(IV) analog [Ti(MesPDA)2] (3). A detailed mechanistic study is conducted through density functional theory analysis to explore the catalytic pathways mediated by Ti(III) and Ti(IV). Key steps include epoxide coordination to Ti, iodide&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening to form a Ti&#8208;alkoxide species, and CO2 insertion into the Ti&#8211;O bond. The superior performance of Ti(III) arises from its lower oxophilicity, which weakens Ti&#8211;O interactions, enhancing CO2 insertion. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy confirms epoxide coordination and supports the formation of a Ti(III)&#8208;alkoxide intermediate. Further evidence for the latter species comes from X&#8208;ray crystallography of the Ti(IV)&#8208;alkoxide analog [Li(4&#8208;crown&#8208;12)2][Ti(MesPDA)2(OiPr)] (17), providing indirect structural evidence.

&lt;p&gt;A Ti(III) complex synthesized mechanochemically catalyzes the cycloaddition of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (1&#8201;bar) with terminal, internal, and trisubstituted epoxides. Mechanistic studies by density functional theory calculations reveal that the superior activity of Ti(III) compared to Ti(IV) arises from its lower oxophilicity, facilitating CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; insertion into Ti&#8211;O bonds, as supported by EPR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A readily accessible Ti(III) complex, [Li(thf)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;][Ti(&lt;sup&gt;Mes&lt;/sup&gt;PDA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) (&lt;sup&gt;Mes&lt;/sup&gt;PDA = N, N&#8242;-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-phenylenediamide), has been synthesized mechanochemically, offering a sustainable route to Ti(III) species. Complex &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, combined with [NBu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I] (TBAI), efficiently catalyzes the cycloaddition of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (1 bar) with terminal and internal epoxides, bio-resourced diepoxides, and the tri-substituted limonene oxide. This work represents the first example of a Ti(III)-based catalyst capable of efficiently synthesizing cyclic carbonates from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and epoxides under atmospheric pressure, and demonstrates the superior catalytic activity of Ti(III) compared to its Ti(IV) analog [Ti(&lt;sup&gt;Mes&lt;/sup&gt;PDA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;3)&lt;/b&gt;. A detailed mechanistic study is conducted through density functional theory analysis to explore the catalytic pathways mediated by Ti(III) and Ti(IV). Key steps include epoxide coordination to Ti, iodide-mediated ring-opening to form a Ti-alkoxide species, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; insertion into the Ti&#8211;O bond. The superior performance of Ti(III) arises from its lower oxophilicity, which weakens Ti&#8211;O interactions, enhancing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; insertion. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy confirms epoxide coordination and supports the formation of a Ti(III)-alkoxide intermediate. Further evidence for the latter species comes from X-ray crystallography of the Ti(IV)-alkoxide analog [Li(4-crown-12)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;][Ti(&lt;sup&gt;Mes&lt;/sup&gt;PDA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;Pr)] (&lt;b&gt;17&lt;/b&gt;), providing indirect structural evidence. These findings advance the development of Ti(III) systems in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; valorization and highlight the key role of oxidation state in catalytic efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A series of 5,7&#8208;membered cyclometallated gold(III) complexes with N^C^N tridentate ligands are prepared via transmetalation of pyridine&#8208;phenyl&#8208;oxazoline ligand&#8208;containing organomercury compounds with potassium gold(III) chloride (KAuCl4) for catalysis.

A series of 5,7&#8208;membered cyclometallated gold(III) complexes with N^C^N tridentate ligands are developed as catalysts, which are prepared via transmetalation of pyridine&#8208;phenyl&#8208;oxazoline ligand&#8208;containing organomercury compounds with potassium gold(III) chloride (KAuCl4) with up to 86% yields. Investigation on the synthesis and catalytic activity of the newly developed gold(III) complexes under silver&#8208;free conditions results in &gt;90% conversion for propargylamines and up to &gt;99% conversion for bifunctional modification of oligosaccharides via three&#8208;component&#8201;(A3)&#8208;coupling reactions. Employment of the tridentate gold(III) complexes also successfully catalyzes the carboalkoxylation reaction of acetal alkynes. These results reveal potential applications of such 5,7&#8208;membered tridentate gold(III) complexes as catalysts for organic transformation reactions and modification of biomolecules.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Dependent Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation of Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Carbonates with 3&#8208;Alkylidene Oxindoles</title>

         <dc:description>
A divergent enantioselective synthesis of chiral &#947;&#8208;substituted alkylidene oxindoles and 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles from 3&#8208;alkylidene oxindoles and racemic Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates has been achieved using chiral Lewis base catalysts.

A substrate&#8208;dependent, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;controlled asymmetric allylic alkylation of 3&#8208;alkylidene oxindoles and racemic Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates has been achieved using chiral cinchona alkaloid&#8208;derived catalysts. This present methodology enables the divergent synthesis of chiral &#947;&#8208;substituted alkylidene oxindoles and 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles in a highly selective manner. Plausible catalytic pathways for the formation of these biologically interesting compounds are proposed. Density functional theory calculations have clarified the high diastereoselectivity of allylic alkylation of 1a with 2a and have confirmed that the chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles 6 are from an asymmetric allylic alkylation/Cope rearrangement sequence.

         <title>Synthesis of Polycyclic Oxazolinium Compounds from Aryloxazolines and Alkynes via Dual Photoredox/Gold Catalysis and Rhodium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of polycyclic oxazolinium compounds is synthesized from various aryloxazolines with silyl&#8208;substituted alkynes and internal alkynes via dual photoredox/gold catalysis and Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H bond functionalization, and affords silyl&#8208;substituted polycyclic oxazoliniums and polycyclic oxazoliniums, respectively.

A series of polycyclic oxazolinium compounds is synthesized from various aryloxazolines with silyl&#8208;substituted alkynes and internal alkynes via two synthetic pathways. By using dual photoredox/gold catalysis, the coupling of 2&#8208;aryloxazoline diazonium compounds with silyl&#8208;substituted alkynes affords silyl&#8208;substituted polycyclic oxazoliniums in 20%&#8211;36% yield. The coupling of 2&#8208;aryloxazolines with internal alkynes affords polycyclic oxazoliniums with up to 81% yield by Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H bond functionalization. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and circular dichroism reveal the successful coupling of chiral (R)&#8208;2&#8208;aryloxazolines with internal alkynes and affording the corresponding chiral (R)&#8208;oxazoliniums. Cytotoxicity analysis of the polycyclic oxazolinium compounds reveals cytotoxic activity on cancerous HeLa cells in micromolar dosage, with the lowest IC50 of 6.4&#8201;&#956;M.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Dearomatization for The Construction of Imidazole Scaffolds</title>

Lighting up flat aromatics: a visible&#8208;light photocatalytic dearomative acylation of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines using &#945;&#8208;keto acids as sustainable acyl radical precursors is reported, leading to dual fluorescent imidazoles.

Dearomatization is a powerful strategy for constructing complex carbocycles and heterocycles, though it typically relies on harsh conditions due to aromatic stability. Herein, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic dearomatization strategy for electron&#8208;poor imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines is reported, addressing a key limitation of current methods, which predominantly target electron&#8208;rich aromatic systems. Using &#945;&#8208;keto acids as acyl radical precursors, this mild method enables the efficient synthesis of structurally diverse and functionalized imidazole derivatives, a privileged scaffold in pharmaceuticals and advanced materials. Some of the synthesized imidazoles display noteworthy photophysical properties. Some of the synthesized imidazoles show dual fluorescence from deep violet to greenish&#8208;cyan, highlighting potential as innovative fluorescent probes. This work expands the scope of dearomatization and provides a valuable tool for accessing new chemical space in drug discovery and materials science.

         <title>Barbier Reactions with Gaseous CO2 via Electromagnetic Milling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manuscript describes the gas&#8208;involved Barbier reaction (Grignard reaction is the Barbier variant) in one step to synthesize carboxylic acids under electromagnetic mill condition, which is a supplement to the classic Barbier reaction. This strategy allowed CO2 under ordinary pressure, which is more valuable for the labeling chemistry, and a variety of 13C labeled carboxylic acids are achieved efficiently.

The Barbier reaction has been utilized in the construction of C&#63743;X (X&#8201;=&#8201;C, Si, B, N, etc.)bondsin organic chemistry for over a century. However, all reported strategies have been carried out in organic solvents or solvent&#8208;free conditions involving solid&#8211;liquid or solid&#8211;solid phases, and gas&#8208;phase Barbier reactions in one step are rare. In this work, a one&#8208;step gas&#8208;involved Barbier reaction for the synthesis of carboxylic acids under electromagnetic mill conditions is presented. This approach utilizes gas CO2 at ambient pressure, which holds significant promise for isotope&#8208;labeling chemistry. A variety of 13C&#8208;labeled carboxylic acids is synthesized efficiently using this method. This gas&#8208;involved, liquid&#8208;assisted grinding transformation could accelerate the advancement of this field.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced Oxygen&#8208;Doped g&#8208;C3N4 Catalyzed Aryltrifluoromethylation of Unactivated Alkenes with CF3SO2Na: A Heterogeneous and Recyclable Approach Without Metals or Oxidants</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, by using low&#8208;cost and recyclable oxygen&#8208;doped graphitic carbon nitride (O&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4) as a heterogeneous photocatalyst, trifluoromethylated dihydroisoquinolinones and indolines are synthesized in good to excellent yields without the need for metals, strong oxidants, or additives under blue light irradiation at room temperature. Recycle tests and gram&#8208;scale experiments demonstrate the practicability of the heterogeneous O&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4 photoredox system.

Utilizing metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalysts to convert solar energy into chemical energy and achieve efficient organic transformations through redox processes remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. With visible light&#8208;responsive oxygen&#8208;doped g&#8208;C3N4 as a heterogeneous photocatalyst, a metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free trifluoromethylation/cyclization methodology has been developed to synthesize a series of new trifluoromethylated dihydroisoquinolinones and indolines. In this system, the aryltrifluoromethylation of N&#8208;allylbenzamides or N&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;allylamides with CF3SO2Na proceeds smoothly in one pot under blue light irradiation at room temperature, affording the desired products in moderate to good yields. This semiconductor&#8208;based photoredox system allows for trifluoromethylation/cyclization free of any metals, strong oxidants, and additives. It is applicable to gram&#8208;scale experiments and recyclability tests without significant loss of reactivity. This methodology demonstrates great potential for constructing CF3&#8208;containing heterocycles in a green and sustainable manner.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Cyclizations of 1,2&#8208;Diarylalkenols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dehydrative cyclisation of alcohols with alkenes is employed to construct medium&#8208;sized carbocycles efficiently. Catalyzed by main&#8208;group or metal Lewis acids, these reactions proceed in the presence of water and extend to tandem sequences. The methodology furnishes 26 new polysubstituted carbocycles with excellent diastereoselectivity and up to 97% yield, providing a versatile strategy for building complex cyclic frameworks from simple linear precursors.

The synthesis of medium&#8208;sized carbocycles from linear chains is challenging in organic chemistry. Among the effective methods for the synthesis of polysubstituted carbocycles with contiguous stereogenic centers, the dehydrative cyclization of alcohols with alkenes is an attractive protocol as it uses readily available substrates, without requiring unnecessary prefunctionalization, and generates water as the sole byproduct. Herein, a dehydrative cyclization reaction is explored, as well as two tandem reactions initiated by this cyclization. These reactions are allowed by metal&#8208;based or organic Lewis acids as catalysts containing only main group elements, which proved compatible with the formation of water during the reaction. This approach allowed the synthesis of 26 new carbocycles with yields up to 97% and high diastereoselectivity.

         <dc:description>
As a next step to click chemistry, the current paper introduces solvent&#8208;free, mechanochemical SuFEx reactions. The reaction is shown to be highly effective, allows gram&#8208;scale syntheses, and works with a very wide scope of phenols, thus marking a significant advancement in green chemistry.

Click reactions display many of the goals desired for more sustainable chemical conversions. Yet, the solvent used is an often overlooked aspect in determining the environmental impact of reactions. In the current paper, the first mechanochemical method is developed for the efficient and solvent&#8208;free SuFEx reaction of sulfonyl fluorides with a wide range of phenols. After outlining the optimization process, which yields an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use and robust method. The broad scope of this approach is evidenced, and demonstrate this potential via the application to a range of natural phenols that also display other functionalities, and several gram&#8208;scale syntheses.

         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot, sequence&#8208;controlled di&#8208;functionalization enables diverse sulfonamide synthesis under mild conditions using DABCO&#8226;(SO2)2 (1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane&#8208;(SO2)2) as a sulfur dioxide surrogate. Two amines, potassium iodide as reductant, and isoamyl nitrite under nitrogen in acetonitrile produce symmetrical or unsymmetrical sulfonamides. This scalable method delivers high yields, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance with operational simplicity.

A streamlined one&#8208;pot, sequence&#8208;controlled di&#8208;functionalization strategy has been developed for the synthesis of structurally diverse sulfonamides under mild conditions. The reaction utilizes DABCO&#8226;(SO2)2 as an SO2&#8208;surrogate and engages two amines&#8212;either identical or different&#8212;in a stepwise manner. Potassium iodide (KI) acts as a stoichiometric reductant, while isoamyl nitrite facilitates the in situ generation of reactive intermediates under a nitrogen atmosphere in acetonitrile at room temperature. The transformation proceeds via a sulfinamide intermediate, enabling the efficient construction of sulfonamides with broad substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and excellent yields. The method features clean reaction profiles, operational simplicity, and scalability, making it a practical and mechanistically informed approach to sulfonamide synthesis.

         <title>Direct Photoinitiated Bromosulfonylation of Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct bromosulfonylation of alkynes and alkenes with sulfonyl bromides photoinitiated by 400 nm LED light proceeds under mild conditions, without transition metals and photocatalysts. The reaction is scalable, has good tolerance to functional groups and high yields of products. The use of bisimine additive allows to significantly increase the stereoselectivity of the alkyne bromosulfonylation reaction.

The reaction of direct photoinitiated bromosulfonylation of alkynes and alkenes with p&#8208;tolylsulfonyl bromide is reported. Low&#8208;power radiation with a maximum wavelength of 400&#8201;nm is used for the reaction. The reaction proceeds at room temperature under metal&#8208;free conditions. A photocatalytic bisimine additive is proposed that significantly increases the stereoselectivity of the alkyne bromosulfonylation reaction and increases the yield of products. The reaction scope is demonstrated with 49 examples. Methods for the subsequent functionalization of &#946;&#8208;bromovinylsulfones to obtain valuable products are proposed.

1,2&#8208;Diketone intermediate generated in visible light via a metal&#8208;free, photooxidative activation of 2&#8208;alkynylarylnitriles with pyrylium salt, demonstrates base&#8208;assisted orthogonality toward cyclization, furnishing 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyisoquinoline&#8208;1,3&#8208;(2H,4H)&#8208;dione and 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroazanaphthoquinone derivatives in good yields.

A metal&#8208;free, photooxidative activation of 2&#8208;alkynylarylnitriles in presence of pyrylium salt as a photocatalyst is reported. The 1,2&#8208;diketone intermediate generated in visible light demonstrates base&#8208;assisted orthogonality toward cyclization, furnishing 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyisoquinoline&#8208;1,3&#8208;(2H,4H)&#8208;dione and 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroazanaphthoquinone derivatives. The reaction has a wide substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, uses an organic photocatalyst, and takes place at room temperature. Preliminary biological screening of synthesized molecules reveals their potential as anticancer agents.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Mechanocatalytic Reduction of Nitro Compounds with Hydrogen Gas and its Application in the Synthesis of Drugs and their Intermediates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical reduction of nitro compounds using hydrogen gas is presented. In addition to enabling the synthesis of a variety of functionalized aniline derivatives, the method has been scaled up to gram quantities, evaluated for trace metal impurities, and applied to the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds and their precursors.

A solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical method for the catalytic hydrogenation of nitro compounds is reported, requiring only the substrate, low catalyst loading, and molecular hydrogen. The approach avoids the use of additional base additives or solvents for liquid&#8208;assisted grinding. The transformation proceeds under mild conditions using palladium on carbon and hydrogen gas in pressurizable stainless steel jars operated in a planetary ball mill. A variety of functionalized nitro compounds are converted to the corresponding anilines and amines in good to excellent yields. The method displays chemoselectivity, tolerating functional groups such as halogens, benzylic ketones, and nitriles. In addition, scale&#8208;up to multigram quantities is achieved, and an analysis of trace metal impurities from abrasion revealed only minor concentrations, all below the limits established by ICH guidelines. The protocol's practicality is demonstrated by synthesizing intermediates and active ingredients used in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. To quantify the sustainability of the protocol, green metrics are calculated and compared with those of other mechanochemical and solution&#8208;phase nitro compound reduction methods.

This redesigned Mannich&#8208;type reaction that exploits a carbene&#8208;like activity of 1,2&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes (realized by &#8220;umpolung&#8221; reactivity of carbonyl compound) occurs readily under mild reaction conditions, exhibits broad functional group tolerance, and provides flexible access to valuable N&#8208;heterocyclic scaffolds.

Herein, the development of an effective 3 starting materials&#8211;5 component reaction (3SM&#8208;5CR) strategy is reported to assemble imidazolidine motifs from 1,2&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes, amines, and formaldehyde. In comparison with the classical Mannich&#8208;type reactions (3SM&#8208;6CR) for the construction of hexahydropyrimidines, this approach that uses azoalkene substrate (umpolung of carbonyl compound) as a donor/acceptor C1 synthon (carbene equivalent) enables practical construction of a library of previously inaccessible, structurally diverse imidazolidine derivatives with unprecedented ease. Inexpensive and easily available Lewis acid ZnCl2 is an effective catalyst for these transformations, making this methodology flexible for the guided introduction of the amine components into the final N&#8208;heterocycles.

         <title>Synthesis of 3,4&#8208;Dihydroquinazolinones via Base&#8208;Promoted Formal [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] Cycloadditions</title>

         <dc:description>
In this work a straightforward, metal&#8208;free and general protocol for the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydroquinazolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones is described. From 2&#8208;chloromethyl anilines upon treatment with a base an aza&#8208;o&#8208;quinone methide is in situ generated. This highly reactive intermediate readily reacts through [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition with isocyanates affording 32 derivatives in up 98% yields. Scale&#8208;up experiments and further derivatizations show the utility of this transformation.

3,4&#8208;dihydroquinazolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one (3,4&#8208;DHQ) is a key structural motif found in many biologically active molecules. Although several synthetic methods have been developed to date, harsh reaction conditions, and/or metal toxic reagents are often required. In this work, a general, metal&#8208;free methodology for the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;DHQs is described. This novel protocol relies on a formal [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition of in situ formed aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methides and isocyanates leading to a wide variety of 3,4&#8208;DHQs in yields up to 98%.

The iridium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular &#945;&#8208;C&#8211;H addition to alkynes gives enamines. The intramolecular cyclization also proceeds to give cyclic enamines, which can be converted into cyclic ketones by hydrolysis.

The iridium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular &#945;&#8208;C&#8211;H alkenylation of N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;aminopyridine derivatives proceeds via alkene isomerization to give the corresponding enamines. The reaction is efficiently catalyzed by a cationic iridium catalyst under mild reaction conditions. The same catalytic system can also be applied to the intramolecular C&#8211;H addition to alkynes to give cyclic ketones after hydrolysis of the corresponding enamines.

The photochemical approach for [4+2] annulation of 1,6&#8208;dieneynes to 3,4&#8208;disubstituted fluorenones via triplet states by energy transfer (EnT) process under visible light irradiation is presented. These EnT process and radical pathway process are confirmed by Stern&#8211;Volmer experiments, and radical scavenging studies to understand the reaction mechanism. This mild photochemical methodology showed high functional group tolerance and high atom economy.

This process utilizes readily available sodium chloride (NaCl) as an efficient activator, enabling the cleavage of the C&#63743;N bond in aryldiazonium salts to generate aryl radicals.

         <title>Engineering Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase with Improved Activity and Stability for High&#8208;Efficiency Carbon Dioxide Fixation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel CO2&#8208;fixing enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from Cannabis sativa, shows 146.8&#8201;U&#8201;mg&#8211;1 activity. Protein engineering improves its activity twofold and stability 31&#8208;fold, yielding a total turnover number of 1.44&#8201;&#215;&#8201;105&#8201;mol&#8201;mol&#8211;1, making it a highly efficient CO2 fixation catalyst.

The extraction of excess CO2 from the environment requires favorable carbon sequestration methods, among which biochar sequestration is one of the most effective approaches. Therefore, to meet the growing demand for high&#8208;efficiency carbon fixation and enhanced metabolic flux in biological carbon sequestration, the development of high&#8208;performance phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is of significant importance. In this study, a high&#8208;activity PEPC from Cannabis sativa (CsPEPC) is identified. However, the enzyme exhibits poor thermal stability, with a half&#8208;life of only 13&#8201;min at 50&#8201;&#176;C. To improve CsPEPC performance, diverse strategies, including molecular dynamics, FoldX energy calculations, and PROSS&#8208;based prediction, are integrated to screen beneficial variants. The resulting mutant CsPEPCC886R shows a twofold increase in activity (249.2&#8201;U&#8201;mg&#8211;1 at 50&#8201;&#176;C) and fivefold greater stability. Furthermore, the addition of 25% glycerol as a protein stabilizer significantly extends the half&#8208;life of CsPEPCC886R by 31&#8208;fold, ultimately increasing the half&#8208;life to 2178&#8201;min. In&#8201;vitro production experiments show that the optimal mutant CsPEPCC886R generates 116.8&#8201;mM oxaloacetate within 270&#8201;min. This work provides a promising PEPC variant for biological CO2 fixation, which holds great potential for improving carbon assimilation and supports the development of efficient, carbon&#8208;neutral biosynthetic pathways.

Therefore, to meet the growing demand for high-efficiency carbon fixation and enhanced metabolic flux in biological carbon sequestration, the development of high-performance phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is of significant importance. In this study, a high-activity PEPC from &lt;i&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/i&gt; (CsPEPC) is identified. However, the enzyme exhibits poor thermal stability, with a half-life of only 13&#8201;min at 50&#8201;&#176;C. To improve CsPEPC performance, diverse strategies, including molecular dynamics, FoldX energy calculations, and PROSS-based prediction, are integrated to screen beneficial variants. The resulting mutant CsPEPC&lt;sup&gt;C886R&lt;/sup&gt; shows a twofold increase in activity (249.2&#8201;U&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 50&#8201;&#176;C) and fivefold greater stability. Furthermore, the addition of 25% glycerol as a protein stabilizer significantly extends the half-life of CsPEPC&lt;sup&gt;C886R&lt;/sup&gt; by 31-fold, ultimately increasing the half-life to 2178&#8201;min. In&#8201;vitro production experiments show that the optimal mutant CsPEPC&lt;sup&gt;C886R&lt;/sup&gt; generates 116.8&#8201;mM oxaloacetate within 270&#8201;min. This work provides a promising PEPC variant for biological CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation, which holds great potential for improving carbon assimilation and supports the development of efficient, carbon-neutral biosynthetic pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Haloaminative Cyclization of Aminoallenes via C&#63743;N Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;catalyzed haloaminative cyclization of tertiary amine&#8208;tethered allenes with electrophilic halogen sources via C&#63743;N bond activation is reported, which provides rapid access to halogenated N&#8208;heterocycles. The formation of quaternary ammonium salt is identified as key intermediate for the benzylic C&#63743;N bond cleavage.

The selective cleavage and efficient transformation of C&#63743;N bonds in tertiary amines remain a significant challenge due to their high bond dissociation energy and inherent stability. Herein, an iron&#8208;catalyzed haloaminative cyclization of tertiary amine&#8208;tethered allenes with electrophilic halogen sources is reported, in which the benzylic C&#63743;N bond is selectively broken by the in&#8201;situ formation of quaternary ammonium salts. This method features concise reaction protocols, broad substrate scopes, enabling the rapid acquisition of diverse N&#8208;heterocyclic derivatives containing the vinyl halide moieties. What's more, the presence of vinyl halide groups facilitates late&#8208;stage diversification through a series of downstream cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

         <title>Acridinium Photocatalyzed Monofluoromethyl Radical Cascade Reaction of Alkenes with Iodine(III) Reagent: A Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acridinium salts are effective organic photoredox catalysts with strong oxidizing properties, but their potential as photoreductants in photocatalysis is underexplored. This study investigates their use for the reductive activation of iodine(III) reagent with monofluoroacetoxy ligands, enabling the synthesis of oxindoles and related N&#8208;heterocycles containing monofluoromethyl groups from alkenyl N&#8208;arylamides.

Acridinium salts are well&#8208;known and highly effective organic photoredox catalysts, particularly recognized for their strong oxidizing properties. While they are widely used as photo&#8208;oxidants, their potential as photoreductants, formed easily through interactions with electron donors, has been largely overlooked and underexplored in photocatalysis. In this study, the application of an acridinium salt as a photocatalyst for the reductive activation of iodine(III) reagent containing monofluoroacetoxy ligands is described. This process allows for the synthesis of oxindoles and related N&#8208;heterocycles with monofluoromethyl groups, starting from alkenyl N&#8208;arylamides. Detailed mechanistic studies are conducted to gain insight into the in&#8201;situ formation of the active acridine radical species, catalyst species interconversion, and the photocatalytic mechanism underlying the monofluoromethyl radical cascade reaction of alkenyl N&#8208;arylamides. A wide range of mechanistic tools is employed, including radical trapping experiments, UV&#8211;Vis absorption spectroscopy, time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence quenching experiments, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations. The synthetic utility of this protocol is demonstrated through a substrate scope study, which highlights the efficient access to oxindoles and other polycyclic heterocycles featuring monofluoromethyl units which are widely recognized for their biological significance.

Sustainable Photoelectrochemical Geminal &#945;&#8208;Fluorosulfenylation of Diazo Compounds through Carbene Radical Anion Intermediate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A milder photoelectrochemical method is presented for obtaining a wide range of &#945;&#8208;fluorosulfenyl derivatives from readily available thiol and diazo compounds. Several mechanistic studies reveal the synergistic role of photochemistry and electrochemistry in generating carbene radical anion at the cathode.

&#945;&#8208;Fluorosulfenyl compounds are privileged building blocks found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. While the geminal difunctionalization of diazo compounds with two different nucleophiles under mild and sustainable conditions can be envisioned as a versatile method for constructing &#945;&#8208;fluorosulfinyl molecules, it remains a significant unmet challenge. Herein, geminal &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difunctionalization of diazo compounds by merging sustainable photo&#8208; and electrocatalysis is presented. A wide range of &#945;&#8208;fluorosulfinyl products are synthesized using commercial ionic liquid as a fluorine source with moderate to good yields and excellent selectivities. Several experiments are performed to detail the reaction mechanism and elucidate the cooperativity of photo&#8208; and electrocatalysis in facilitating the reaction under milder, safe, and green conditions.

         <title>Biobased Ligands Enable Catalysis with Base Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biobased ligands unlock versatile catalytic transformations, including Cu&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of olefins and borylation of alkyl halides, Fe&#8208;catalyzed ketone hydrogenation, and Ni&#8208;catalyzed terminal alkyne dimerization.

First&#8208;row transition metal catalysis has already reshaped organic synthesis, offering more abundant and cost&#8208;effective alternatives to precious metals. However, the design of sustainable alternatives for the ligands that dictate metal reactivity remains an unresolved issue. In this work, we demonstrate that phosphines and phosphinites assembled from renewable building blocks can enable catalytic transformations mediated by base metals such as Cu, Ni, and Fe. Hydroboration of olefins, borylation of alkyl halides, hydrogenation of ketones, and dimerization of terminal alkynes are now achievable using homogeneous catalysts based on 3d metals and biobased ligands. The mild reaction conditions established in this study facilitate, among other applications, the late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals, such as bexarotene, estrone, and nabumetone.

GA: Strained small motifs and SuFEx hubs are of increasing importance in drug discovery to enable efficient late&#8208;stage functionalization. Here, the synthesis of bench&#8208;stable azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl&#8208;substituted sulfonimidoyl fluoride as an electrophilic hub with dual activation mode is reported. Incorporation of complex drug motifs is enabled through either selective ABB strain&#8208;release reaction to access substituted azetidines, or selective SuFEx activation.

The development of electrophilic strained small motifs is of increasing importance for chemical biology and drug discovery, enabling precise, late&#8208;stage functionalization and targeted covalent inhibition. In this work, we report the efficient synthesis of a novel azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl&#8208;substituted sulfonimidoyl fluoride, a bench&#8208;stable electrophilic hub combining strain&#8208;release reactivity and SuFEx chemistry. The dual reactivity of this motif was demonstrated through selective ABB ring&#8208;opening reactions, and SuFEx&#8208;mediated ligations with diverse nucleophiles, including pharmaceutically relevant derivatives. Further derivatization of the resulting sulfonimidates and sulfonimidamides showcased the synthetic versatility of this system. These findings open avenues for the development of modular, multifunctional platforms in drug discovery.

         <title>Regioisomeric Tuning of Intermolecular Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction by Electrostatic Field&#8208;Dipole Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores how electric fields influence Diels&#8208;Alder reaction regioselectivity using a zwitterionic iminium ion as both dienophile and electric field source. Head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dipolar orientation is favored in less&#8208;polar solvents and higher temperatures where internal electric fields are preserved. Computational studies validate experimental findings through transition dipole moment, reactant complexation, and transition energy analyses.

The effect of an electric field on the regioselectivity of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction is explored using a zwitterionic iminium ion species as both the dienophile and the source of the electric field. The head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dipolar orientation of the substrates becomes favored in less&#8208;polar solvents and at higher temperatures where the internal electric field is conserved. Computational studies validate the electric field effect on the experimental regioisomeric preferences, in terms of the transition dipole moment, reactant complexation, and transition energy. This work offers deeper insight into the effects of electrostatic fields on chemical reactions, suggesting new directions for controlling reaction selectivity.

         <title>Pd/BINAP/Peroxide&#8208;Enabled Relay Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a Pd/BINAP/peroxide&#8208;enabled multicomponent reaction (MCR) from readily accessible substrates to indole derivatives with aza&#8208;quaternary carbons. The protocol achieves a concise 4&#8208;step synthesis of a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist. Through mechanistic experiments, we believe the addition of H2O2 effectively decreases the initial concentration of [Pd0(BINAP)] species, avoiding the formation of indole N&#8208;allylation by&#8208;products.

In recent years, multicomponent reactions have attracted considerable attention due to their efficiency in constructing complex molecules from simple starting materials. Herein, we report a BINAP/peroxide&#8208;controlled Pd&#8208;catalyzed multicomponent reaction involving readily accessible indoles, diazo compounds, and allylic electrophiles, enabling the efficient synthesis of structurally diverse N&#8208;functionalized indoles bearing aza&#8208;quaternary carbon centers, which are prevalent in bioactive molecules and pharmaceuticals. This approach exhibits broad functional group tolerance and excellent regioselectivity for N&#8211;H sites, especially applicable to unsubstituted indoles. We have further demonstrated the synthetic utility of the resulting products through various derivatizations, including a concise four&#8208;step synthesis of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist to treat aldosterone&#8208;mediated diseases. Mechanistic experiments indicated that this reaction was enabled by a relay catalysis based on PdII/PdII non&#8208;redox and Pd0/PdII redox catalytic cycles, which was found to facilitate the activation of carbene and allylic substrates, respectively. The addition of peroxide was found to suppress the premature formation of [Pd0(BINAP)] species and keep palladium in the [PdII(BINAP)(OAc)2] form at the beginning of the reaction, thereby avoiding the formation of undesired indole allylation by&#8208;products and significantly increasing the overall yields of the target products.

         <title>Merging Cu2O Photo&#8208;Thermo&#8208;Catalyst with Lignosulfonate&#8208;Supported Tempo for Aerobic Oxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural into 2,5&#8208;Diformylfuran</title>

GA: A highly efficient photo&#8208;thermo catalytic system for the selective oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran using O2 under purple light&#8208;emitting diode light (&#955;&#8201;=&#8201;400&#8201;nm) and heat irradiation without dye sensitizers. The surface of synthesized octahedral Cu2O particles acts as the photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;catalytic platform, facilitating O2 activation with conduction band electrons. Additionally, a novel series of 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl&#8208;lignosulfonate supported catalysts are explored, which, in combination with octahedral Cu2O particles, effectively catalyze HMF oxidation.

The selective oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF) represents a critical step in the sustainable synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals from renewable biomass. A significant challenge in achieving this transformation lies in developing an effective visible light&#8208;driven heterogeneous photocatalytic method that excludes the use of dye&#8208;based sensitizers. While solar energy presents an exceptionally promising renewable energy source for extensive future applications, its overall utilization remains suboptimal. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;catalyst system comprising octahedral Cu2O particles, which, when combined with lignosulfonate (LS)&#8208;supported 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO), demonstrates decent catalytic performance for the selective oxidation of HMF into DFF under the illumination of a 400&#8201;nm light&#8208;emitting diode light. This system achieves a remarkable 95% DFF yield at 60&#8201;&#176;C under ambient oxygen conditions. This study successfully demonstrates the effective integration of a non&#8208;noble metal photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;catalyst with a supported TEMPO system, which enables the efficient HMF&#8208;to&#8208;DFF transformation driven by visible light, eliminating the need for dye sensitizers in the process.

A powerful platform for the efficient synthesis of 2,4&#8208;disubstituted thiophenes and 2,5&#8208;disubstituted thiophenes via acid&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component cyclization of 2&#8208;methylquinoline, elemental sulfur, and chromone&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehyde or cinnamaldehyde under metal&#8208;free conditions is disclosed. This approach stands out due to its readily available starting materials, broad substrate scopes, simple operation, and the efficient formation of multibonds in one&#8208;pot.

Bisheteroaryls and its derivatives, as a privileged motifs, are commonly found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, ligands, and other bioactive molecules. Herein, a novel and efficient method for the divergent synthesis of functional 2&#8208;quinolinyl&#8208;bearing thiophenes via acid&#8208;mediated three&#8208;component cyclization of 2&#8208;methylquinolines, S powder, and chromone&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehydes or enals is reported. This approach stands out due to its metal&#8208;free conditions, readily available starting materials, broad substrate scopes, simple operation, and the efficient formation of multibonds in one&#8208;pot. The Gram scale reaction and useful derivatizations are performed to showcase the potential synthetic utility of this strategy. This acid&#8208;promoted cyclic strategy provides a straightforward pathway toward diversely valuable thiophenes, which possibly exhibit good applications in medicinal chemistry and materials science.

         <title>Organophotoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Functionalization of Spiro&#8208;Dihydroquinazolinones with Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hilman Adducts</title>

         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free approach for the synthesis of quinazolinone&#8208;containing alkenes is reported under organophotoredox conditions. In this approach, spiro&#8208;dihydroquinazolinones undergo aromaticity&#8208;driven deconstructive functionalization with Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hilman adducts in a chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective manner.

An organophotoredox&#8208;catalyzed, chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective C&#8211;C bond formation between spiro&#8208;dihydroquinazolinones and Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hilman adducts has been reported. This transformation proceeds via an aromatization driven deconstructive formation of an alkyl radical and its subsequent selective addition at SN2&#8242; position of MBH acetates, resulting in alkene&#8208; containing quinazolinones. Mild reaction conditions, good substrate&#8208;scope and further modification of resultant products are the noteworthy accomplishments of this methodology.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Enantiopure (R)&#8208;Citronellal from Geraniol via a Short&#8208;Chain Dehydrogenase and Ene Reductase</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 14, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic cascade with two consecutive biocatalytic steps consisting of a short&#8208;chain alcohol dehydrogenase and an ene reductase in a biphasic system provides (R)&#8208;citronellal with &gt;90% conversion and &gt;99% enantiomeric excess from inexpensive geraniol.

The development of synthetic routes to produce enantiopure (R)&#8208;citronellal as a key intermediate for the synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;menthol and other valuable terpenoids is highly relevant in the pharmaceutical, flavor, and fragrance industries. Herein, we showcase a cascade with two consecutive biocatalytic steps performed separately using the inherent selectivity of a short&#8208;chain alcohol dehydrogenase (SDR) and an ene reductase (ERED) from the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) family. The first reaction involves the AaSDR1&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of relatively inexpensive geraniol in a biphasic system, providing geranial as an intermediate. The organic phase containing geranial is then extracted and transferred to the second step, where the ERED variant OYE2_Y83V catalyzes the asymmetric reduction of geranial to produce (R)&#8208;citronellal, achieving &gt;90% conversion and &gt;99% enantiomeric excess. The use of n&#8208;heptane in a two&#8208;liquid phase system not only facilitates substrate and product solubilization but also minimizes geranial isomerization. This biocatalytic cascade therefore enables the synthesis of enantiopure (R)&#8208;citronellal.

         <title>Borane&#8208;Catalyzed Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Ring Opening of 2&#8208;Substituted Aziridines with Phenols for Direct Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines</title>

Boron&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208; and ortho&#8208;selective C&#63743;H bond substitution of phenols with 2&#8208;alkyl/aryl aziridines to access the branched selective ortho&#8208;phenolic&#8208;&#946;&#8208;arylethylamines is achieved. N&#8208;heterocyclic arenes can also act as carbon nucleophiles to open the aziridine ring selectively to afford the branched products. This protocol is demonstrated for the synthesis of serotonin and tryptamine.

A metal&#8208;free chemo&#8208; and regioselective nucleophilic ring opening of 2&#8208;substituted aziridines with ortho&#8208;C(sp2) atom of phenols enables facile access to medicinally relevant &#946;&#8208;arylethylamine derivatives. In this approach, phenols act as aryl nucleophiles that favor C&#63743;C bond formation selectively at the ortho&#8208;C(sp2) position with the more substituted carbon of aziridines to generate branched, selective arylated products. Despite the significant advancement of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling and nucleophilic ring opening of 2&#8208;substituted azirines, only linear arylated products are widely demonstrated. The first metal&#8208;free branched selective nucleophilic ring opening of 2&#8208;alkyl and 2&#8208;aryl aziridines with phenols is reported to address this challenge. Furthermore, the diversity of the substrate scope by using N&#8208;heterocycles as nucleophiles empowers the generation of &#946;&#8208;heteroarylethylamine derivatives. A combination of computational and experimental investigation reveals that the reaction proceeds via a borane&#8208;promoted proton transfer, followed by aziridine ring opening and Fridel&#8211;Crafts alkylation involving a &#960;&#8208;complex of carbocation&#8208;anion ion pair. This protocol is further applicable for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant compounds like serotonin and tryptamine.

A metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free, sustainable oxidative rearrangement of 3&#8208;azo indoles in water is described to C3&#8208;oxo&#8208;C2&#8208;amino indoles, which are used as fluorescent probes to detect lipid droplets.

A novel oxidative rearrangement of the diazene moiety in 3&#8208;aryl azo indoles is reported, leading to the formation of C3&#8208;oxo&#8208;C2&#8208;amino indoles with excellent regioselectivity. This transformation, achieved using oxone in water at ambient temperature, proceeds in good yields with broad functional group tolerance, including toward azaindoles. Mechanistic insights are gained through control experiments, crystal structures, and density functional theory calculations. Experimental and theoretical photophysical studies, along with cellular uptake and colocalization experiments, demonstrate that the resulting compounds selectively bind to lipid droplets (LDs), highlighting their potential as fluoroprobes for LD detection.

An efficient, metal&#8208;free method for synthesizing C3&#8208;alkylated indoles via B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed reductive C&#63743;C bond cleavage of bisindolylmethanes (BIMs) under mild conditions is reported, offering broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance.

In this study, B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed reductive C&#63743;C bond cleavage of bisindolylmethanes (BIMs) is reported as an efficient strategy for preparing C3&#8208;alkylated indoles. In the presence of silane, B(C6F5)3 selectively activates Csp2&#8208;Csp3 bonds of BIMs under mild conditions. Moreover, this sustainable process exhibits a broad substrate scope, highly functional group tolerance, and excellent regioselectivity. Preliminary mechanistic studies disclose that the formation of stabilized ion&#8208;pair intermediates is crucial to achieving the desired transformation. Notably, the strategy provides a metal&#8208;free alternative to transition metal catalysis, enabling the sustainable synthesis of valuable indole derivatives.

&lt;p&gt;In this study, B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed reductive C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C bond cleavage of bisindolylmethanes (BIMs) is reported as an efficient strategy for preparing C3-alkylated indoles. In the presence of silane, B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; selectively activates Csp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-Csp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bonds of BIMs under mild conditions. Moreover, this sustainable process exhibits a broad substrate scope, highly functional group tolerance, and excellent regioselectivity. Preliminary mechanistic studies disclose that the formation of stabilized ion-pair intermediates is crucial to achieving the desired transformation. Notably, the strategy provides a metal-free alternative to transition metal catalysis, enabling the sustainable synthesis of valuable indole derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Photoredox Synthesis of Sulfonylated Benzimidazoisoquinolines via 10 H&#8208;Phenothiazine&#8208;Catalyzed Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free photocatalytic strategy using unmodified 10 H&#8208;phenothiazine is presented for the synthesis of sulfonylated benzimidazoisoquinolines. Visible light activates catalytic electron donor&#8211;acceptor complexes between phenothiazine and sulfonyl chlorides, driving a sulfonation/cyclization cascade with broad substrate scope, high efficiency, and mild conditions.

An unmodified 10 H&#8208;phenothiazine is directly utilized as an efficient photocatalyst to enable ready access to sulfonylated benzo[4,5]imidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives from N&#8208;allyl benzimidazoles and sulfonyl chlorides. The reaction involves the formation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor complexes between phenothiazine and sulfonyl chloride, which, upon visible light irradiation, undergo single&#8208;electron transfer to generate sulfonyl radicals. The reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and high efficiency.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;Oxokolavenol: A Natural Neoclerodane Diterpene with Farnesoid X Receptor Transcriptional Activity</title>

The natural neoclerodane diterpene (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol shows significant Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) transcriptional activity. Herein, the first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol is reported. The synthetic route takes a 15&#8208;step sequence from the known Wieland&#8211;Miescher ketone with 0.85% overall yield. In addition, the synthesis allows (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol with 12 synthetic intermediates for biological evaluations of FXR transcriptional activity.

The natural neoclerodane diterpene (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol is isolated from the twigs of Amoora stellato&#8208;squamosa, and exhibited significant Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) transcriptional activity with an EC50 value of 1.877 &#956;M. However, the scarcity of its natural sources poses a considerable challenge for further biological studies. To address this limitation, herein, the first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol is reported. This synthesis features stereoselective alkylation, regioselective redox transformations (including late&#8208;stage allylic oxidation), and strategic installation of methyl groups. The overall synthesis delivers (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol in 15 steps from the cheap and readily available Wieland&#8211;Miescher ketone. In addition, this approach allows (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol with 12 synthetic intermediates for biological evaluations by using dual&#8208;luciferase reporter assay. Preliminary investigations confirm the nuclear receptor selectivity of (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol as a FXR agonist, underscoring its potential for further bioactivity studies.

         <title>eAmidation: An Electrochemical Amidation of Aldehydes via the Oxidation of N&#8208;Aryl Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 14, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The indirect electrochemical oxidation of N&#8208;aryl hydrazones offers an efficient approach to access amides from aldehydes and amines. The AZADO&#8208;mediated reaction enables the selective synthesis of a broad range of valuable amides using readily available aldehydes.

In recent years, the use of electrochemistry has emerged as a powerful yet sustainable means of enabling key transformations. Amidation is one of the most frequently executed transformations in synthetic chemistry, and using an electrochemical approach, the current study has demonstrated the synthesis of amides from aldehydes and amines. Mechanistic work indicates that the reaction proceeds via the oxidation of an intermediate hydrazone to generate an acyl diazene as the acylating species. The protocol developed has enabled the synthesis of a broad range of amides, including access to pharmaceutically relevant products, directly from aldehydes without recourse for hazardous chemical oxidants and activating agents.

         <dc:description>
An efficient C&#8208;H homocoupling of arenes via Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand catalytic system is reported. This method can be applied to a series of arenes using O2 as oxidant under room temperature and is also applicable for late&#8208;stage homocoupling of pharmaceutical derivatives. Homocoupling of o&#8208;xyleneexhibits near&#8208;perfect chemoselectivity, offering an industrially favorable route to a Upilex&#174; monomer precursor .

Non&#8208;directed Pd&#8208;catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenative homocoupling of arenes is achieved in the presence of an S,O&#8208;ligand. The reaction proceeds under aerobic and mild reaction conditions with a wide range of anisole derivatives, providing direct access to symmetric biaryls with excellent ortho&#8208;ortho or para&#8208;para regioselectivity. Notably, the use of the arene as the limiting reagent enables late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex pharmaceutical molecules. The industrial applicability of this methodology is demonstrated through the synthesis of the Upilexmonomer via the homocoupling of unactivatedo&#8208;xylene.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Ring&#8208;Opening Hydrosulfonylation of Methylenecyclopropanes for Branched Allylic Sulfones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 14, July 29, 2025. </description>

A Pd&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and stereoselective ring&#8208;opening hydrosulfonylation reaction of sulfonyl hydrazides with methylenecyclopropane derivatives was developed, which produced a series of branched (E)&#8208;allylic sulfones in good yields. Meanwhile, the corresponding asymmetric reactions provided the optically active products in moderate yields with good enantioselectivity.

A Pd&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydrosulfonylation reaction of methylenecyclopropanes with sulfonyl hydrazides was developed, which produced a series of branched (E)&#8208;allylic sulfones in 52&#8722;91% yields. In addition, the asymmetric variant was also investigated, and the optically active products were obtained in moderate yields with good enantioselectivities (up to 94:6 er). Mechanistic studies suggested that the reaction proceeds through the formation of an allyl hydrazine intermediate and subsequent rearrangement to the branched (E)&#8208;allylic sulfone products.

&lt;p&gt;A Pd-catalyzed regio- and stereoselective ring-opening hydrosulfonylation reaction of sulfonyl hydrazides with methylenecyclopropane derivatives was developed, which produced a series of branched (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-allylic sulfones in good yields. Meanwhile, the corresponding asymmetric reactions provided the optically active products in moderate yields with good enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Pd-catalyzed ring-opening hydrosulfonylation reaction of methylenecyclopropanes with sulfonyl hydrazides was developed, which produced a series of branched (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-allylic sulfones in 52&#8722;91% yields. In addition, the asymmetric variant was also investigated, and the optically active products were obtained in moderate yields with good enantioselectivities (up to 94:6 er). Mechanistic studies suggested that the reaction proceeds through the formation of an allyl hydrazine intermediate and subsequent rearrangement to the branched (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-allylic sulfone products. Generally, the reaction was completed in one pot under mild reaction conditions, which also featured in good functional group tolerance, broad substrate scope, high regiospecificity, branched selectivity, as well as atom and step economy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A simple photoredox system comprising Hantzsch ester, Cs2CO3, and 4DPAIPN that enables direct and site&#8208;selective deoxygenation of benzyl alcohol derivatives is described. Mechanistic studies reveal that in&#8201;situ reversible acylative activation of hydroxy groups plays a pivotal role in achieving the unique selectivity, highlighting the importance of reversible activation strategies in selective molecular transformations.

A simple yet efficient method is presented for direct and site&#8208;selective deoxygenation of benzyl alcohol derivatives, including polyols, without requiring preactivation. This reaction system, consisting of Hantzsch ester, Cs2CO3, and a photocatalyst under photoirradiation, enables direct and site&#8208;selective deoxygenation. Mechanistic studies reveal that in&#8201;situ reversible acylative activation of hydroxy groups plays a pivotal role in achieving unique selectivity. This approach offers a general and practical strategy for the selective transformation of polyols.

         <title>Electrochemical Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Heterofunctionalization of Tropones via C(sp2)&#63743;H Derivatization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 14, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and selective. The electrochemical heterofunctionalization of activated tropones is achieved using readily available inorganic salts. A theoretical model, based on cyclic voltammetry and quantum chemistry calculations, predicts both reactivity trends and site selectivity. This model is supported by the rapid synthesis of densely functionalized tropones and tropolones (35 examples, with yields up to 95%).

A general electrochemical synthetic procedure for the site&#8208;selective heterofunctionalization of activated tropones is documented. Detailed voltametric analysis and quantum chemistry calculations enabled&#160;the development of a predictive model for the process efficiency, accounting for both reactivity and regioselectivity. Mono&#8208; and poly&#8208;halogenation, nitration, sulfonation, and thiocyanation protocols are successfully executed starting from inexpensive sodium salts under oxidative electrolytic conditions (35 examples, isolated yields up to 95%, faradaic efficiencies up to 95%). The implementation of an iterative electrochemical/metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling synthetic strategy, along with the adaptation of the protocol for the preparation of biologically relevant tropolone derivatives, underscores the generality and robustness of the methodology.

Herein an electrochemical radical cation&#8208;mediated dearomative 2,3&#8208;difunctionalization of indoles with carboxylic acids for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;diesterified indolines with excellent trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity is reported.

An electrochemically driven radical cation&#8208;mediated dearomative 2,3&#8208;difunctionalization of indoles with carboxylic acids is described, which provides an efficient and straightforward route for the construction of a range of 2,3&#8208;diesterified indolines with excellent trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields. This metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free electrochemical protocol proceeds in an undivided cell, exhibiting broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies reveal that the anodic single&#8208;electron oxidation of indoles is the initial step and oxocarbenium ion formation is the key to controlling trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity.

Solvent&#8208; and transition metal&#8208;free synthetic pathways for obtaining 2&#8208;thiazolines and S&#8208;thiocarbamates, based on the mechanochemical process of addition of chloroalkyl iso(thio)cyanates to thiols catalyzed by cheap and commercially available K2CO3, are designed and optimized. This approach has been successfully applied to obtain 39 materials with significant medicinal potential in yields above 95%.

For the first time, the mechanochemical synthesis of five&#8208;membered N,S&#8208;heterocyclic 1,3&#8208;thiazolines and S&#8208;thiocarbamates has been performed starting from chloroalkyl iso(thio)cyanates, thiols, as well as dithiols, in the presence of cheap and commercially available potassium carbonate (K2CO3) as a catalyst. The experimental conditions are optimized to allow the effective formation of attractive materials with significant medicinal potential in yields above 95% in transition metal&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free conditions. The reactions are efficient and easily scalable to gram quantities, offering substantial benefits for practical applications.

A concise and effective synthesis of carbocycle&#8208;fused &#947;&#8208;carbolinone derivatives via the regio&#8208; and chemoselective cascade reactions of indole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxamides with cyclic diazo compounds is presented. In this cascade process, the amide group plays a dual role by acting as first a directing group for the C&#8722;H bond functionalization and subsequently N&#8208;nucleophilic site for the pyridone ring formation.

&#947;&#8208;Carboline and &#947;&#8208;carbolinone are privileged structural scaffolds for the development of new pharmaceuticals and functional materials. A concise and effective synthesis of carbocycle&#8208;fused &#947;&#8208;carbolinone derivatives via the regio&#8208; and chemoselective cascade reactions of indole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxamides with cyclic diazo compounds is presented. The formation of product is initiated by the regioselective C2&#63743;H bond metalation of the indole moiety and carbene formation with the diazo coupling partner (CP), followed by migratory insertion, protodemetallation, chemoselective intramolecular aza&#8208;nucleophilic addition, and water elimination. In this cascade process, the amide group plays a dual role by acting as a directing group for the C&#63743;H bond functionalization and N&#8208;nucleophilic site for the pyridone ring formation. In general, this newly developed protocol features simple and affordable substrates, concise one&#8208;pot procedure without using redundant additives, excellent regio&#8208;/chemoselectivity, and step&#8208;/atom&#8208;economy, as well as ready scalability.

A concise and effective synthesis of carbocycle-fused &#947;-carbolinone derivatives via the regio- and chemoselective cascade reactions of indole-3-carboxamides with cyclic diazo compounds is presented. The formation of product is initiated by the regioselective C2&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H bond metalation of the indole moiety and carbene formation with the diazo coupling partner (CP), followed by migratory insertion, protodemetallation, chemoselective intramolecular aza-nucleophilic addition, and water elimination. In this cascade process, the amide group plays a dual role by acting as a directing group for the C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H bond functionalization and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-nucleophilic site for the pyridone ring formation. In general, this newly developed protocol features simple and affordable substrates, concise one-pot procedure without using redundant additives, excellent regio-/chemoselectivity, and step-/atom-economy, as well as ready scalability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An electrochemical oxidative [3 + 2] annulation of p&#8208;methoxy anilines with enaminones is reported for the synthesis of 3&#8208;acyl indoles in a moderate to good yields under mild conditions, which features excellent functional group tolerance, operational simplicity, and gram&#8208;scale scalability.

An electrochemical oxidative [3&#8201;+&#8201;2] annulation of p&#8208;methoxy anilines with enaminones is reported. This protocol enables facile synthesis of 3&#8208;acyl indoles in moderate to good yields under mild conditions, featuring excellent functional group tolerance, operational simplicity, and gram&#8208;scale scalability. Based on the cyclic voltammetry and control experiments, a plausible mechanism involving the aniline radical pathway is proposed.

         <title>Noncovalent&#8208;Interaction&#8208;Dictated Product Selectivity in Intermolecular and Intramolecular Controllable Oxidation of Aromatic Amines Using 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Diperoxyphenic Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 14, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving controllable generation and effective interception of relevant intermediates during intermolecular and intramolecular oxidation of aromatic amines by noncovalent interactions is an attractive objective. It has been reported herein the means to enable a family of intermolecular and intramolecular controllable selective oxidation of aromatic amines that create opportunities for the synthesis of symmetric or unsymmetric nitrosobenzenes, nitrobenzenes, azoxybenzenes, and azobenzenes.


Selective oxidation of aromatic amines is a valuable transformation in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry as well as materials science. However, the efficient means to reach its full potential remain a formidable challenge because meticulous perturbations on the oxidation states can potentially lead to dramatically different product selectivity and efficacy profiles. Herein, by identifying bench&#8208;stable and easily prepared 2,2&#8242;&#8208;diperoxyphenic acid as oxidant and/or I2 as additive, a general and divergent oxidation is developed to reliably form a wide assortment of nitrosobenzenes, nitrobenzenes, azobenzenes, and azoxybenzenes in an intermolecular and intramolecular controllable manner, avoiding the use of stoichiometric metal oxidants and transition metal&#8208;based catalysts. Mechanistic studies reveal that the imposing of noncovalent interactions enables the achievement of reagent&#8208; and additive&#8208;dependent reordering of N&#63743;H bond reactivity and the rate of corresponding elementary steps.

Cu/Ru sequential catalysis enables in situ formation of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles as directing groups for site&#8208;selective C&#63743;H arylation.Combining click chemistry with Ru&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H activation bypasses prefunctionalization, ensures high regioselectivity, and accommodates diverse substrates.Applications include late&#8208;stage drug modification and functional material synthesis.

A Cu/Ru bimetallic sequential catalytic strategy combining copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) with Ru&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H activation is developed, enabling the in&#8201;situ formation of nitrogen&#8208;containing triazoles and their ortho C&#63743;H arylation in a one&#8208;pot dual&#8208;functional transformation. This system innovatively employs the 1,2,3&#8208;triazole formed via CuAAC as an endogenous directing group, facilitating sequential [3+2] cycloaddition and Ru&#8208;mediated C&#63743;H functionalization through a stepwise catalytic approach. The strategy overcomes the limitations of traditional preactivation and exhibits excellent regioselectivity and broad substrate compatibility. This approach has been successfully applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceutical molecules, offering a new paradigm for the modular synthesis of complex compounds.

         <dc:description>
This article introduces an electrochemical method for multi&#8208;component hydroxy&#8208;thiocarbamation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, using (hetero)aryl alkenes, KSCN, and H2O to produce &#946;&#8208;hydroxy primary S&#8208;thiocarbamates. The process is highly atom&#8208;economical, and demonstrates excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, enabling diverse product synthesis and late&#8208;stage natural product modification.

This article reports the first example of multi&#8208;component hydroxy&#8208;thiocarbamation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes in an electrochemical undivided cell. Simple and readily available electron&#8208;deficient (hetero)aryl alkenes, KSCN and H2O are used as starting materials to produce &#946;&#8208;hydroxy primary S&#8208;thiocarbamate derivatives in moderate to good yields. H2O is involved in the formation of carbamoyl and hydroxyl groups, making the method highly atom&#8208;economical. The reaction introduces multiple functional groups under mild and environmentally friendly conditions, without the need for metals or external oxidants. The reaction exhibits good functional&#8208;group tolerance and excellent product diversity. The procedure is operationally simple, and late&#8208;stage modification of natural products further demonstrates the practical application of the method.

         <title>High&#8208;Order Cascade Transformations on Tertiary &#946;&#8208;Enaminones for Step&#8208;Economical Construction of Molecular Diversity and Complexity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 14, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the recent development of enaminone&#8208;based high&#8208;order cascade single cyclization reaction and bicyclic annulation reaction via the formation of four or more new chemical bonds are summarized.

The generation of molecular diversity and complexity constitutes the major task of synthetic organic chemistry. In contrast, to achieve the maximum complexity and/or diversity of organic compound with minimum operational steps is of high significance by saving consumption of both the chemicals and the time for synthesis, enhancing the synthetic efficiency and sustainability. Based on our longstanding interest in the enaminone&#8208;based organic synthesis, herein, the research advances in high&#8208;order cascade reactions are reviewed, which involve in the formation of at least four new chemical bonds, including sigma&#8208;, pi&#8208;bonds and C&#63743;H bond, in one reaction of enaminones, showing how the high&#8208;step economy is achieved in the enaminone&#8208;based synthetic reactions. Since the known results all involves in the cyclization, the contents of the current manuscript are divided into two main sections: the single cyclization reaction and bicyclic annulation reaction.

Based on our longstanding interest in the enaminone-based organic synthesis, herein, the research advances in high-order cascade reactions are reviewed, which involve in the formation of at least four new chemical bonds, including &lt;i&gt;sigma&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;pi&lt;/i&gt;-bonds and C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H bond, in one reaction of enaminones, showing how the high-step economy is achieved in the enaminone-based synthetic reactions. Since the known results all involves in the cyclization, the contents of the current manuscript are divided into two main sections: the single cyclization reaction and bicyclic annulation reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bifunctional Reagents for Photochemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 14, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively explores bifunctional reagents in photocatalysis, which integrate radical activation sites and coupling modules within a single molecule. It systematically categorizes them (radical precursor&#8208;radical precursor/nucleophile/electrophile/acceptor) based on reaction modes and active sites, detailing mechanisms like energy/electron transfer. Emphasis is placed on their advantages for precise, efficient, and selective molecular construction under mild conditions.

Bifunctional reagents in photochemistry integrate radical activation sites with coupling modules within a single molecular framework, enabling precise construction of sophisticated moleculars. This review systematically summarizes recent advancements and reaction mechanisms of these reagents in photocatalysis regulated by energy transfer or photoinduced electron transfer. It emphasizes how kinetic matching and electronic modulation achieve selective activation of radical precursors. Cutting&#8208;edge developments, including diverse metal&#8208;based and metal&#8208;free systems, and innovative mechanisms like strain&#8208;release and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, have expanded complex molecular synthesis. The review categorizes progress based on active sites and reaction modes into four classes: radical precursor&#8208;radical precursor, radical precursor&#8208;nucleophile, radical precursor&#8208;electrophile, and radical precursor&#8208;radical acceptor. Subclassifications are defined by the central atom type of radicals and transformation patterns, revealing intrinsic correlations between reagent parameters (e.g., bond dissociation energy, electronic distribution, steric effects) and reaction pathways. This review aims to establish precise yet universal methodologies for guiding drug synthesis and functional material development.

Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;thiocarboxylic acids featuring C&#8211;S chirality are valuable targets in organic synthesis. This review outlines recent progress in their asymmetric synthesis, including chiral pool approaches, metal&#8208; /organo&#8208;catalysis, and emerging biocatalytic strategies.

Enantiomerically pure &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;thiocarboxylic acids bearing a stereocentre at the C&#8211;S bond represent a class of compounds of notable significance in organic and medicinal chemistry. The chirality at the C&#8211;S bond presents both challenges and opportunities in synthetic chemistry. Traditionally, the enantioselective synthesis of these &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;thiocarboxylic acids has relied on chiral pool strategies using naturally derived precursors such as amino acids and hydroxycarboxylic acids. In recent years, the expansion of organo&#8208; and metal&#8208;catalysed methodologies, employing catalysts such as cinchona alkaloids, copper, and rhodium complexes, has led to strategies with improved efficiency and stereocontrol. Additionally, advances in biocatalysis have enabled more sustainable routes toward s these valuable compounds, using enzymes such as hydrolases and nitrilases. Given the growing academic and industrial interest in these compounds, this review provides an overview of the methods developed and the progresses made over the past two decades in the asymmetric synthesis of thiocarboxylic acids bearing a stereocentre at C&#8211;S bond.

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Interrupted Cycloaddition Between Azides, Ag(I)&#8208;Acetylides, and Diorganoyl Dichalcogenides</title>

Unleashing the power of Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides with LiCl/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The LiCl/DMSO mixture have an unexplored ability to dramatically increase the solubility of Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides regardless of their molecular structure, which is explored to achieve high chemoselectivity in the Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed interrupted cycloaddition between organic azides, Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides, and diorganoyl dichalcogenides. Insights into this effect and its interplay with the reaction mechanism are discussed.

Herein, an efficient and mild Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed interrupted cycloaddition is described between organic azides and Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides, using diorganoyl dichalcogenides as trapping reagents of the Cu(I) triazolide intermediate to prepare fully substituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles containing an organochalcogen (S, Se, Te) group at C5 position. It is found that chalcogenoacetylenes and 1,4&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles are competitive side products in this reaction, but the use of Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides and LiCl as an additive in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) significantly increased the yields and selectivity for 1,4&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;5&#8208;organochalcogen&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides are well&#8208;known for their low solubility in organic solvents. However, the LiCl/DMSO mixture exhibits an interesting, unexplored ability to dramatically increase the solubility of Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides regardless of their molecular structure. The complete solubilization of Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides is the key to controlling the reaction chemoselectivity, and insights on this effect and its interplay with the reaction mechanism are discussed.

         <title>Harnessing Vinylogy with Radicals: Photoinduced &#947;&#8208;Benzylation Reactions of 2&#8208;Silyloxyfurans</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two radical&#8208;mediated benzylations of 2&#8208;silyloxyfurans, promoted by visible light and suitable photoredox catalysts have been disclosed. A broad scope of &#947;&#8208;benzyl butenolides was obtained in one step, some of which were used as strategic precursors to bio&#8208;valuable chiral butanolides. Notably, harnessing vinylogy with radicals brings new &#8220;chemical&#8221; life to silyloxyfurans, one of the most exploited vinylogous nucleophile in synthesis.

2&#8208;Silyloxyfurans are among the most exploited Mukaiyama&#8208;type vinylogous nucleophiles from which a myriad of bioactive &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones have been accessed. Although a plethora of &#8220;polar&#8221; reactions featuring this scaffold as a key player have been developed so far, its behavior in radical chemistry is still in its infancy. Herein, the development of two complementary vinylogous, radical&#8208;mediated benzylations of 2&#8208;silyloxyfurans, promoted by visible light and suitable photoredox catalysts, is described. Common to both photocatalytic cycles is the reduction of a suitable redox active ester forging a key benzyl radical intermediate, which undergoes two different fates. First, the photoinduced oxidation of the silyloxyfuran generates an unprecedented silyl&#8208;radical cation species able to trap the nucleophilic benzyl radical. Alternatively, with specific electron&#8208;rich substrates, the benzyl radical can be converted to the corresponding benzyl carbocation intermediate via a net&#8208;neutral radical&#8208;polar crossover pathway, enabling a vinylogous, polar benzylation reaction. A broad scope of chiral, &#947;&#8208;benzyl butenolides is obtained in one step, some of which are used as strategic precursors to access bioactive phenyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;valerolactone metabolites.

         <title>Heterogeneous Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 1,4&#8208;Conjugate Additions of Grignard Reagents to Cyclic and Linear Enones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition of Grignard reagents to various cyclic and linear enones using a heterogeneous catalyst is reported. Recyclable copper nanoparticles immobilized on polysaccharide support (e.g., cellulose, chitosan) enable high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. Integrated with asymmetric tandem reactions involving enals and &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, the method produces chiral &#946;,&#948;&#8208;disubstituted ketones with excellent stereoselectivity.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes (NHCs): An Emerging Efficient Catalyst in Amide Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents recent breakthroughs in N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed amide bond formation, covering metal&#8211;NHC and metal&#8208;free NHC systems. It emphasizes sustainable, mild, and atom&#8208;economical strategies, offering new mechanistic insights and broad substrate scope for green and efficient amide synthesis.

Since the discovery of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), their role as ligands and organocatalysts has grown significantly due to their unique umpolung reactivity and strong &#963;&#8208;donor capabilities. In recent years, the field of amide bond formation has seen notable advancements through NHC catalysis. Given the wide application of amides in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science, several NHC&#8208;based strategies have emerged for synthesizing amides from substrates such as aldehydes, alcohols, esters, and nitriles. This review highlights the sustainable and efficient nature of NHC&#8208;catalyzed amide bond formation. Both metal&#8211;NHC complexes and metal&#8208;free NHCs offer diverse catalytic pathways, with Ru&#8211;NHC systems proving especially effective in redox&#8208;neutral amidations. NHCs promote reactions through mechanisms involving acyl azolium, hemiaminal, and Breslow intermediates, enabling high selectivity under mild conditions. Many of these methods align with green chemistry principles, featuring high atom economy and minimal waste generation. The versatility and tunability of NHC catalysts allow broad substrate compatibility, and recent innovations include metal&#8208;free organocatalysis, continuous flow processes, and electrochemical amidation strategies. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of NHC&#8208;catalyzed amide formation, summarizing key mechanisms, substrate scope, and catalyst design, emphasizing their dual role in metal&#8208;based and organocatalytic sustainable amidation methods.

         <title>Perdeuteration of (Hetero)arenes in Flow Enabled by Defective Porous Carbon</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose, which is widely present in nature, is utilized as a precursor to prepare defective porous carbon materials and developed a general system for the perdeuteration of (hetero)arenes in flow.

Deuterium incorporation in organic compounds has been widely applied in medicinal chemistry and materials science. Specifically, fully deuterated aromatic compounds are frequently applied in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. For this application, there is a growing interest in the development of methods for perdeuteration. Herein, a general and scalable method for constructing perdeuterated (hetero)arenes using carbon materials via hydrogen isotope exchange reaction is described. Defective porous carbon material is generated by pyrolyzing cellulose, which permits perdeuteration of arenes and heteroarenes using inexpensive and easy&#8208;handling D2O as the deuterium source. Materials characterization and mechanistic studies reveal that vacancy&#8208;defect O&#8208;doped porous&#8208;carbon is generated after pyrolyze cellulose and D species in pores could be formed under continuous flow. This methodology represents a cost&#8208;effective methodology for scalable deuteration and enables efficient labeling in a straightforward manner.

         <title>Asymmetric C&#63743;H Functionalization Enabled by a Traceless Oxidizing Chiral Auxiliary</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#63743;H bond transformation by using a novel traceless oxidizing chiral directing group (CDGOX), which offers a general access chiral N&#8208;heterocycles with diverse chiral elements.

Chiral directing group strategy has long been utilized in the asymmetric C&#63743;H bond functionalization to access the complex molecules with different chiral elements. However, this strategy often encounters synthetic challenges such as the removal of preinstalled chiral auxiliaries. Reported herein is the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#63743;H bond transformation by using a novel oxidizing chiral directing group strategy (CDGOX). N&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;menthoxyl amide is designed and used as an oxidizing chiral auxiliary, which not only enables the stereoselective C&#63743;H bond transformation with diverse hydrocarbons but also be self&#8208;removed in situ through the intramolecular oxidation, constituting a traceless directing group for the asymmetric C&#63743;H bond transformation. Notably, the current strategy is capable of forming diverse chiral elements, e.g., axial chirality, planar chirality, and point chirality, providing a novel and complementary strategy for the construction of chiral N&#8208;heterocycles with good enantioselectivity.

A mild and an efficient metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free electrochemical protocol for the synthesis of 3&#8208;selenylated benzothiophene derivatives is described.

A mild and highly efficient metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free electrochemical approach for the synthesis of 3&#8208;selenylated benzothiophene derivatives is described. In this innovative electrochemical cascade cyclization reaction, the selenylated benzothiophene skeletons can be constructed along with the formation of C&#63743;Se and C&#63743;S bonds in a single step. Moreover, this electrochemical protocol exhibits good functional group compatibility, paving the way for the construction of diverse selenylated benzothiophene compounds with various functional groups from readily available starting materials under an aerobic reaction condition. Meanwhile, a series of control experiments are carried out, and a reasonable reaction mechanism is proposed. Finally, the scaled&#8208;up reactions are performed, and then the photochemical and bioactive properties of the synthesized compounds are elaborately discussed.

         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;controlled divergent access to 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;pyrones and enamine derivatives starting from ketenimines with acylacetonitriles is reported.

A DABCO&#8208;mediated Mannich&#8208;type reaction of ketenimines with acylacetonitriles toward the stable &#946;&#8208;aminoacrylates is reported. The multifunctional properties of &#946;&#8208;aminoacrylates led to the discovery of a solvent&#8208;controlled divergent access to 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;pyrones and enamine derivatives. In addition, the selective reduction and dihalogenation of &#946;&#8208;aminoacrylates are also achieved, which greatly increased the structural diversity of the products.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A groundbreaking advancement in asymmetric catalysis is achieved with the development of a novel P&#8208;chiral PNN ligand for manganese(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation. This innovative ligand enables highly efficient asymmetric hydrogenation and asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones, delivering chiral alcohols in great reactivity (1560 TON) and high enantioselectivities (up to 92% ee) across 42 diverse substrates.

A novel chiral P*NN ligand featuring a P&#8208;chirality has been synthesized, and its catalytic properties in Manganese(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation and asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones are investigated. A broad range of substrates (42 examples) are hydrogenated, delivering a series of chiral alcohols with outstanding yields (&gt;90%) and good enantioselectivities (up to 92% ee). In addition, a plausible catalytic cycle is performed through deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry analysis.

         <dc:description>
The photocatalyzed hydroxydifluoromethylation of styrenes is described using readily available, easily&#8208;to&#8208;handle, and low&#8208;cost difluoroacetic anhydride as CF2H source in the presence of simple acetoxime as the activator, providing a practical and efficient approach to &#946;&#8208;difluoromethylated alcohols. This reaction occurs under white light, even sunlight irradiation, and can be easily scaled up to gram scale.

Herein, a practical photocatalytic method is described for the hydroxydifluoromethylation of styrenes using readily available, easily&#8208;to&#8208;handle, and low&#8208;cost difluoroacetic anhydride as CF2H source in the presence of simple acetoxime as the activator. The optimized conditions enable the reaction to proceed under mild white light, or even natural sunlight irradiation, yielding a range of &#946;&#8208;difluoromethylated alcohols in good yields.

         <title>Photocatalytic Polyene Cyclization to Cyclopentyl Thioethers with Consecutive Quaternary Centers in Fluorinated Alcohols</title>

         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic strategy enables efficient cyclization of polyenes to cyclopentyl thioethers with consecutive all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers. Using 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate in 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol, the method proceeds via a thiyl radical mechanism, offering high yields and good diastereoselectivities.

The synthesis of carbocycles bearing consecutive all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers remains a formidable challenge in organic chemistry due to their steric congestion and synthetic inaccessibility. Herein, an efficient and sustainable photocatalytic strategy for the cyclization of polyenes to cyclopentane thioethers using 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate (TPT+) as a photocatalyst in 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) is reported. The transformation proceeds via a thiyl radical&#8208;initiated mechanism, forming multiple Csp3&#63743;Csp3$\left(\text{C}\right)_{\left(\text{sp}\right)^{3}} &amp;#x00026;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;bond; \left(\text{C}\right)_{\left(\text{sp}\right)^{3}}$ bonds and quaternary centers in a single step under mild conditions. The method tolerates a broad range of aliphatic and functionalized thiols and exhibits high yields and good diastereoselectivities, the latter strongly depending on the addressed mechanism of the transformation. Mechanistic investigations support a radical pathway initiated by thiol oxidation. This work highlights the potential of combining photocatalysis with microstructured solvent systems to facilitate polyene cyclizations. Overall, it provides a versatile platform for synthesizing sterically congested, biologically relevant carbocyclic frameworks.

         <title>Recent Advances in Catalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of Seven&#8208; and Eight&#8208;Membered Rings with Inherent Chirality</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review mainly highlights recent advancements in asymmetric catalytic synthesis of seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings with inherent chirality. It will provide a stepping stone for further investigations by summarizing and discussing the recent developments in the area of synthesis of inherently chiral cycles.

Inherently chiral seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered cyclic frameworks constitute privileged structural motifs in natural products and bioactive compounds. While remarkable achievements have been made in enantioselective synthesis of centrally and axially chiral seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings, the catalytic atroposelective construction of inherent chiral systems remains a significant challenge in modern organic synthesis. Current methodologies predominantly focus on calix[n]arene assemblies, particularly enantioenriched calix[4]arenes, whose success in materials science applications has been well&#8208;documented in recent reviews. This review systematically summarizes emerging strategies for catalytic asymmetric access to seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings, encompassing both direct asymmetric functionalization of preformed rings and de&#8201;novo ring&#8208;forming approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on catalytic asymmetric annulation methodologies and stereoselective functional group transformations that induce inherent chirality. By critically analyzing the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art and existing limitations, this review aims to inspire innovative catalytic systems and unconventional disconnection strategies for constructing these biologically relevant yet synthetically challenging architectures.

A one&#8208;step regioselective access to T&#8208;Shaped and Z&#8208;Shaped polyaromatics s&#8208;tetrazines by a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#63743;H o&#8208;functionalization is reported. Electron&#8208;rich aryl coupling partners display a higher reactivity than electron&#8208;poor aryl, and allow the formation of poly(hetero)aromatic derivatives while avoiding 1,4&#8208;azaphilic addition of the organometallic reagents that may occur with organometallic nucleophiles such as aryl cuprates.

The N&#8208;directed rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H bond arylation of s&#8208;aryltetrazine is reported using arylboronic acids as coupling partners. Convenient synthetic conditions are identified that avoid the 1,4&#8208;azaphilic addition of the organometallic reagents on the tetrazine core, that may occur with organometallic nucleophiles, such as aryl cuprates. Thus, using [RhCl2Cp*]2 and Cu(OAc)2 in trifluoromethylbenzene favors the C&#63743;H activation and direct arylation of the s&#8208;tetrazine. This setup tolerates both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the (hetero)aryl boronic acids. Electron&#8208;rich aryl coupling partners display a higher reactivity, and allow the formation of polyaromatic derivatives. This methodology provides a facile and straightforward route to diversely structured polyaromatics incorporating the valuable s&#8208;tetrazine core, with so&#8208;called T&#8208;shaped and Z&#8208;shaped architectures.

         <title>TBHP/Ammonium/Iodide&#8208;Promoted Ring&#8208;Opening of Cyclobutanones toward &#947;&#8208;Iodo Nitriles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TBHP/ammonium/iodide&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;opening reaction of a variety of cyclobutanones is developed to access &#947;&#8208;iodo nitriles. The key intermediate of this transformation is a C&#8208;centered radical formed by undergoing &#946;&#8208;scission from iminyl radical. As such, this mild transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free procedure provides a direct, facile, and efficient pathway toward diverse &#947;&#8208;iodo functionalized nitriles.

A TBHP/ammonium/iodide&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;opening of a variety of cyclobutanones is developed to access &#947;&#8208;iodo nitriles in DCM under N2 at 40&#8201;&#176;C. This transformation initiated with in&#8201;situ imination, forming an iminyl radical that underwent &#946;&#8208;scission to yield a ring&#8208;opening C&#8208;centered radical. The latter successively underwent a single electron transfer followed by nucleophilic substitution, or alternatively proceeded via a halogen&#8208;atom transfer process to generate &#947;&#8208;iodo nitrile. As such, this mild transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free procedure provides a direct, facile, and efficient pathway toward diverse &#947;&#8208;iodo functionalized nitriles.

         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical cascade cyclization method for unactivated olefins with perfluoroalkyl iodides (IRf), constructing diverse perfluoroalkylated ortho&#8208;diazaheterocyclic compounds was developed. This catalytic strategy demonstrates broad substrate scope and has been successfully applied to 34 examples. Moreover, the reaction is initiated through the formation of an electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex between IRf and TMEDA.

An efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven strategy for the radical perfluoroalkylation/tandem cyclization of unactivated alkenes with perfluoroalkyl iodides (IRf) has been developed, enabling efficient synthesis of perfluoroalkylated heterocyclic derivatives, including pyrazoles, pyridazines, and benzodiazepines. This methodology features broad substrate compatibility with 34 examples, affording the desired products in yields up to 81%. Results of mechanistic studies indicate that the formation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex between perfluoroalkyl iodides and TMEDA greatly initiates the reaction, avoiding the use of extra catalysts and oxidants.

         <title>Facile Access to 2&#8208;Substituted&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrahydroquinoxalines via Borane&#8208;Catalyzed One&#8208;Pot Tandem Cyclization/Hydrosilylation</title>

The B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation of 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes and glyoxals with PMHS affords 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines in high yields. The asymmetric variant can be achieved by using the chiral borane catalyst formed in&#8201;situ from HB(C6F5)2 and a binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral diene and PhSiH3, affording chiral products with excellent enantioselectivities.

Borane&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation of 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes and glyoxals for step&#8208;economic synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines has been developed. The use of B(C6F5)3 catalyst and polymethylhydrosiloxane provides convenient access to various 2&#8208;aryl&#8208; and 2&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxaline products in good to excellent yields with wide substrate scope and broad tolerance of functional groups. The asymmetric variant of this reaction can be achieved by using the enantioenriched borane catalyst generated in&#8201;situ from HB(C6F5)2 and a binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral diene and PhSiH3, affording a variety of chiral 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines with enantioselectivities ranging from 90% to &gt;99% ee. The judicious selection of borane catalyst and hydrosilane has been demonstrated to be crucial for catalysis. This cascade reaction proceeds with simple operation, and can be easily scaled up. Preliminary mechanistic studies have been performed to elucidate the catalytic pathway.

         <dc:description>The hitherto few explored &#945;&#8208;halomethyl amidine motif has been assembled through the addition of a lithiated (di)&#8208;halomethane (i.e. carbenoid) to easily accessible N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl substituted carbodiimides. Despite the inherent low electrophilicity of these heterocumulenes &#8211; as quantitatively determined in Mayr&#8217;s previous studies &#8211; their sp&#8208;hybridized carbon atom acts as a competent site of attack for these tamed nucleophiles. The overall high&#8208;yielding transformation featuring a genuine chemoselective profile &#8211; as documented by employing variously functionalized materials &#8211; is adaptable to the addition of dihalogenated carbenoids.

         <title>eAmidation: An Electrochemical Amidation of Aldehydes via the Oxidation of N&#8208;Aryl Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the use of electrochemistry has emerged as a powerful yet sustainable means of enabling key transformations. Amidation is one of the most frequently executed transformations in synthetic chemistry, and using an electrochemical approach, the current study has demonstrated the synthesis of amides from aldehydes and amines. Mechanistic work indicates that the reaction proceeds via the oxidation of an intermediate hydrazone to generate an acyl diazene as the acylating species. The protocol developed has enabled the synthesis of a broad range of amides, including access to pharmaceutically relevant products, directly from aldehydes without recourse for hazardous chemical oxidants and activating agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand controlled regio&#8208;divergent [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of alkynes by merging electrochemistry and nickel catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions between three alkynes, a diyne and an alkyne, or a triyne offer a straightforward and typical protocol toward all kinds of polysubstituted benzens. Herein, the synthesis of polysubstituted aromatics through electrochemical nickel catalyzed cyclotrimerization of alkynes is developed. The regio&#8208;divergent cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes was achieved by judicious choice of ligands. And tributylphosphine, sterically hindered bipyridine or &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands delivered 1,2,4&#8208; and 1,3,5&#8208;substituted aromatics with high regioselectivities respectively. Besides, the semi&#8208;intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between	diynes and alkynes are also amenable under this catalytic system. This approach operates without metal reductant, exhibits wide functional groups tolerance, ease of scalability and furnishes 75 examples with moderate to good yields, including some biorelevant compounds. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculation revealed the catalytic pathways of 1,3,5&#8208; and 1,2,4&#8208;cyclotrimerizations, and the origin of the ligand controlled regioselectivity.

         <dc:description>Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;carboalkoxy&#8208;3&#8208;substituted&#8208;cyclohexenones are powerful building blocks for the synthesis of a variety of bioactive target molecules. Their preparations requires multi&#8208;steps sequence involving the use of stoichiometric quantities of various reagents, while the catalytic approaches are limitited to trisubstituted cyclohexenones. We describe here an efficient catalytic approach based on gold(I)&#8208;catalysis starting from unsymmetrical diynyl mono&#8208;ester or symmetrical diynyl di&#8208;ester substrates. The carbon chain linking the two alkyne functions can bear two or one substituent, or even be unsubstituted.

         <title>Copper(II) complex dispersed in imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid: Recyclable catalyst system for regioselective and chemoselective hydrobromination and hydrochlorination of alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a recyclable catalyst system combining Cu(II)O and 4,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline in a 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid for the hydrohalogenation of alkynes. The reaction efficiently yields alkenyl bromides and chlorides with good functional group tolerance and regioselectivity across a range of functionalized alkynes. Remarkably, the reaction exhibits unprecedented chemoselectivity for alkyne over alkenes in polyenynes and enables late&#8208;stage modifications to rapidly synthesize brominated polyenes. The catalyst system could be recycled for up to six runs without significant reduction of the reaction yield.</dc:description>

         <title>SuFEx reactions when shaken not stirred
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Click reactions display many of the goals desired for more sustainable chemical
conversions.  Yet, the solvent used is an often overlooked aspect in determining the
environmental impact of reactions. In the current paper we develop the first
mechanochemical method for the efficient and solvent&#8208;free SuFEx reaction of sulfonyl
fluorides with a wide range of phenols.  After outlining the optimization process, which
yields an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use and robust method, we provide indications of the very wide
scope of this approach, and demonstrate this potential via the application to a range of
natural phenols that also display other functionalities, and several gram&#8208;scale
syntheses.</dc:description>
