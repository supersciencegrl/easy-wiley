         <title>Controlling Catalyst Speciation to Achieve Room Temperature Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Aminations with Aryl and Heteroaryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The amination of aryl halides with palladium catalysts (Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination) is a widely used transformation in synthetic and drug discovery chemistry. In this report, we demonstrate that a monometallic 2&#8208;phosphinoimidazole Pd catalyst exhibits comparable or enhanced reactivity when compared to all ligands screened for room temperature amination of aryl chlorides with secondary amines. The di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine derivative showed extremely high reactivity while the di&#8208;isopropyl variant led to almost complete loss of catalytic activity.  Computational and experimental mechanistic and kinetic studies indicate that a monometallic Pd structure rather than a bimetallic Pd structure is key to fast catalysis. The di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine ligand has fast catalysis because it thermodynamically disfavors the formation of a much less active bimetallic Pd complex. A wide substrate scope is demonstrated for the arylation of secondary amines with aryl chlorides using our new catalyst system.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;free Sequential Wolff Rearrangement and [3+3] Annulation of Enaminones and Diazo compounds Enabling the Assembly of Highly Functionalized Pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general protocol for the efficient synthesis of a variety of highly functionalized pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ones has been developed through a sequential Wolff rearrangement and [3+3] annulation reaction of enaminones and diazo compounds. This straightforward approach features wide substrate applicability, good substrate tolerance, moderate to excellent yields, and without any catalyst, and enables access to structurally diverse pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;one skeletons. Additionally, scale&#8208;up experiments and synthetic derivatizations demonstrated the potential synthetic utility of the transformations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A 1,3&#8208;iodoesterification of 2&#8208;substituted indoles with trihaloacetic acid, iodination reagent, and hypervalent iodine(III) compound was developed as an acid&#8208;promoted C&lt;sub&gt;sp2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;H/C&lt;sub&gt;sp3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;H dual functionalization reaction to furnish 3&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8208;trihaloacetoxymethyl indoles. The one&#8208;pot 1,3&#8208;iodoesterification/hydrolysis of the trihaloester group provided 3&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8208;pivaloylmethyl indoles via the rearrangement of the pivaloyl group. The reaction proceeded through a trihaloacetic acid&#8208;assisted electrophilic activation of the iodination reagent after the formation of an indolyl(mesityl)iodonium trihaloacetate.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver and Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloaddition Reactions of Isocyanide Esters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Owing to multiple reactive sites, such as an acidic &#945;&#8208;carbon and an isocyano group, isocyanide esters can successfully participate in the synthesis of various five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles through the cycloaddition reactions under metal&#8208;catalyzed systems. Considering the unique and versatile functionality of this synthon, in this review, we have highlighted silver and copper&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions of isocyanide esters over the last decade.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative and Deconstructive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Acrylic Acids with Ketone&#8208;Derived Dihydroquinazolinones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, an iron&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the aromatization&#8208;driven deconstruction and decarboxylation of ketone&#8208;derived dihydroquinazolinones in reaction with unsaturated carboxylic acids is reported.  A diverse range of fluoroacrylic acids and cinnamic acids reacted effectively with dihydroquinazolinones, yielding essential monofluoroalkenes and alkenes with excellent stereoselectivity. Additionally, spiro&#8208;dihydroquinazolinones served as suitable substrates, facilitating the synthesis of valuable quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones featuring alkene motifs.  This protocol is notable for its operational simplicity and versatility, enabling the chemical diversification of active molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Au(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Hydroarylation of Allenes for the Synthesis of Tetrahydrodiazepines or Tetrahydrodiazonines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allenes tethered to pyrroles undergo Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation leading to tetrahydrodiazepines or tetrahydrodiazonines. The regioselectivity of the reaction is governed by both the substitution pattern of the allene and the nature of the Au(I) ligand. Hence, alkyl&#8208;gem&#8208;disubstituted allenes preferentially lead to tetrahydrodiazepines via 7&#8208;exo&#8208; cyclizations, while aryl&#8208;substituted allenes preferentially lead to tetrahydrodiazonines via 9&#8208;endo cyclization when a phosphite ligand is used. Enantioselective reactions have been developed with the SEGPHOS chiral ligand, leading to chiral heterocycles with high enantioselectivity (up to 96% ee). In addition, DFT calculations have streamlined the regioselectivity (7&#8208;exo vs 9&#8208;endo) of these gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations.</dc:description>

Hence, alkyl-gem-disubstituted allenes preferentially lead to tetrahydrodiazepines via 7-exo- cyclizations, while aryl-substituted allenes preferentially lead to tetrahydrodiazonines via 9-endo cyclization when a phosphite ligand is used. Enantioselective reactions have been developed with the SEGPHOS chiral ligand, leading to chiral heterocycles with high enantioselectivity (up to 96% ee). In addition, DFT calculations have streamlined the regioselectivity (7-exo vs 9-endo) of these gold(I)-catalyzed cyclizations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intramolecular Crossed [2 + 2] Cycloaddition through Visible&#8208;light Triplet Sensitization: Expedient Access to Bridged Bicyclic Alkene</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced intramolecular crossed [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of allene&#8208;tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes was reported in this paper. The reactions were conducted under mild conditions using Iridium(III) catalyst FirPic as a photosensitizer for energy transfer, affording bridged bicyclic alkenes in moderate to good yields with excellent regioselectivity and stereoselectivity through the regulation of substituents at the olefin&#8217;s terminal position. Meanwhile, the computational study explained the special region control assisted by sulfonyl radicals in detail.</dc:description>

Abstract
A variety of structurally diverse spirocyclohexane oxindoles featuring a quaternary carbon centre have been successfully constructed through an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation of isatin&#8208;derived enals with &#945;&#8208;cyano&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methylenones. This domino process exhibits a wide substrate tolerance, operates under mild conditions, and yields products with high enantioselectivities.

         <title>2&#8208;Aminoindoles and 2&#8208;Iminoindolines as Viable Precursors of Indole&#8208;fused Nitrogenated Polyheterocycles.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of architecturally complex polyheterocyclic structures embedding the indole ring represents a growing field of interest. Carbolines and their partially dehydro derivatives, pyrazinoindoles, indoloindoles, azepinoindoles and other medium&#8208;sized derivatives are only some examples of indole&#8208;containing polycyclic compounds featured by enhanced pharmacological and photophysical properties. Among various synthetic protocols to prepare these important target compounds those based on the utilization of 2&#8208;aminoindoles and 2&#8208;iminoindolines are gaining increasing interest because of the ease of their preparation. The presence of a couple of reactive sites in these derivatives is instrumental for the assembling of polyheterocyclic structures exploiting single step operations featured by efficient cascade or tandem processes. Several of these methods employ catalyzed reactions which can be developed for the asymmetric synthesis of enantiopure compounds. This review provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date report on the currently available methods for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aminoindoles and 2&#8208;iminoindolines and their application to the preparation of polyheterocyclic derivatives.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of 3,5&#8208;diaryl&#8208;4&#8208;selanylisoxazoles were synthesized in 56&#8208;97% yields (most cases &gt;80% yield), which was first accomplished via bromide&#8208;catalyzed selenylation of 2&#8208;alkyn&#8208;1&#8208;one O&#8208;methyloximes using Se element and boronic acids as the selenyl source. Compared to traditional strategies, this method proceeded under simple catalytic system. Broad substrate scope, good functional group compatibility, metal&#8208;free conditions, and easy operation was showed in this protocol. Additionally, this method was easily amendable to gram&#8208;scale reaction and synthetic transformations. Furthermore, preliminary mechanistic experiments demonstrated that a radical pathway was possibly involved in this work.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrofunctionalization of alkynes and, more precisely, the intramolecular hydro&#8208;oxycarbonylation (cycloisomerization) of acetylenic acids, has been widely employed as a key step in cascade processes for the construction of valuable and complex molecules. However, in contrast with other aminonucleophiles, no method has been reported for the reaction between primary monoamines and non&#8208;activated alkynoic acids. Hence, a procedure has been devised for the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective preparation of 5&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams via a copper&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction between alkynoic acids and amines. The developed protocol proves to be scalable and demonstrates significant tolerance to a wide range of structurally diverse alkynoic acids and amines bearing various functional groups, as evidenced by 60 high&#8208;yielding examples. An exhaustive experimental and computational analysis of the reaction is also provided to unravel the nature and role of the copper catalyst, the observed regioselectivity and the mechanism of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Hydroelementation of Unsaturated C&#8208;C Bonds Using 3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; Transition Metal Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Divergent hydroelementation reactions offer a cost&#8208;effective synthetic protocol to prepare two or more products starting from same set of reactant molecules by altering one or more reaction parameters. This strategy is quite helpful in functionalizing unsaturated C&#8208;C bonds into several value&#8208;added chemical compounds by using various organic and metal&#8208;based catalysts. In this regard, catalysts derived from 3d metals have come to the fore, providing an alternative to heavier transition metals and rare&#8208;earth elements. In this review, we summarize and elucidate the recent developments of divergent hydroelementation of alkenes and alkynes using the first&#8208;row transition metal complexes by categorizing them into three classes: (1) Catalyst and ligand&#8208;controlled; (2) Reaction component&#8208;controlled and (3) Substrate&#8208;controlled. Given the importance of hydroelementation reactions, we hope this review will be helpful to the organic chemistry community.</dc:description>

         <title>Organophotocatalytic Site&#8208;Selective Radical Deuteration at Sterically Hindered Benzylic Positions by Consecutive Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective C&#8208;H bond activation or exchange labeling with hydrogen isotope are of vital importance, in particular for high&#8208;specific&#8208;selectivity deuteration of pharmaceuticals. While catalytic approaches relying on closed&#8208;shell manifolds have been well documented for efficient delivery of deuterium at sterically less hindered benzylic positions, complementary strategies target sterically bulky benzylic positions remain a long&#8208;standing challenge. We herein disclose a mild, versatile approach to achieve efficient and selective radical deuteration by merging organophotoredox catalysis and bromine radical catalysis. This open&#8208;shell strategy provides the unparalleled ability of the convergent unification of readily available quinoxalinones and para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) and D2O through a simultaneous highly cross&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and chem&#8208;selective radical coupling&#8208;H/D exchange approach. Furthermore, the long&#8208;standing challenge of the incorporation of deuterium to sterically bulky benzylic positions has been addressed through this approach.</dc:description>

Abstract
A copper&#8208;powder&#8208;mediated tandem hydroamination cyclization&#8211;hydrocyanation of alkyne&#8208;tethered ketoximes is described by using TMSCN as a commercially available cyanating reagent. This methodology provides an alternative strategy for the synthesis of a series of structurally important cyano&#8208;substituted cyclic nitrones. The hydrocyanation process exhibits distinct regioselectivity depending on the substituent pattern of the alkyne moiety. Moreover, the synthesized products were shown to be capable of undergoing various derivatization reactions.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Acyl and Thiocyano Pyridylation of Alkenes with Aldehyde and NH4SCN</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
&#946;&#8208;pyridinyl ketones and &#946;&#8208;pyridinyl thiocyanates are commonly used as an essential organic synthesis intermediate and widely present in various drug molecules and bioactive molecules. Herein, a photoredox catalyzed acyl and thiocyano pyridylation of alkenes with aldehydes and NH4SCN via HAT and SET strategy respectively is described. This protocol employs more readily accessible aldehydes and NH4SCN as radical precursors under redox&#8208;neutral conditions. Moreover, high atom economy, simple and accessible starting materials, late&#8208;stage modification and wide substrate scope including primary, secondary alkyl aldehydes and aromatic aldehydes enable the potential application in the organic synthesis.

Abstract
An approach for the synthesis of quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diamines is reported using a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction of o&#8208;phenylenediamines and isocyanides. Various quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diamines could be obtained in 25%&#8211;95% yields at 100&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8197;h. The key to the success of this protocol involves the formation of two C&#8722;N and one C&#8722;C bonds via the double insertion of isocyanide.

Abstract
Asymmetric alkylation is one of the most important methods for synthesis of chiral unnatural &#945;&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;amino acids. Herein, we reported the asymmetric alkylation catalyzed by Cu/(4S,2R)&#8208;tBu&#8208;Phosferrox catalyst. This catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic performance in the asymmetric alkylation at catalyst loading as low as 1.0&#8197;mol %, giving the desired products with up to 95% yield and &gt;99% ee, which is the best result to date. Furthermore, this method was successfully applied to the scalable practical synthesis of unnatural amino acid 4,5&#8208;OH&#8208;Leu, which could be directly used in the total syntheses of phalloidin, phallacidin, other four phallotoxins and six virotoxins.

         <title>Decyanative Arylation via Radical Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Arenes, especially heteroarenes, are crucial structural motifs in organic chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, and materials science. The introduction of (hetero)aryl groups using readily available feedstocks to modify organic chemicals is a significant topic. Nitriles are ubiquitous and versatile building blocks in organic synthesis. This review summarizes recent advances in decyanative arylation via radical cross&#8208;coupling reactions. In these transformations, (hetero)aromatic nitriles undergo one&#8208;electron reduction to form persistent radical anion intermediates. Simultaneously, transient carbon centered radicals are generated through cleavage of C&#8722;H, C&#8722;C, C&#8722;X (where X=B, N, Si, S, Br) bonds through single electron transfer or hydrogen atom transfer processes. Finally, a radical&#8208;radical coupling reaction followed by CN elimination leads to the formation of aromatized products.

         <title>Manganese Promoted Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Phosphine Chlorides with Disulfides for the Synthesis of Thiophosphanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Herein we reported a manganese promoted reductive cross&#8208;coupling approach to construct P&#8722;S bond. This is a practical method for the synthesis of mono&#8208;thiophosphanes, bis&#8208;thiophosphanes and tri&#8208;thiophosphanes under mild conditions. The strategy featured a wide range of substrate scope including various disulfides and phosphine chlorides, constructing diverse sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds from inodorous and readily available starting materials. The employment of reductive conditions avoided the generation of phosphorothioates (PV) by&#8208;products. Ultimately, gram&#8208;scale synthesis and applications were explored. Extensive experiments indicated that the phosphine radical cascade process was involved in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Organoselenyl Quinolines through the Reduction of Alkynes Mediated by Electrophilic Organoselenium Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A methodology for the synthesis and functionalization of quinolines was developed. This approach involves the cyclization of 2&#8208;amino arylalkynyl ketones to 3&#8208;(organoselanyl)&#8208;4&#8208;iodoquinolines through a sequential reaction pathway. The process includes: (i) in situ formation of an electrophilic organoselenyl species, (ii) activation of the alkyne's carbon&#8208;carbon bond via a seleniranium ion intermediate, (iii) anti&#8208;nucleophilic attack of iodide on the activated triple bond, and (iv) subsequent condensation. The resulting 3&#8208;(organoselanyl)&#8208;4&#8208;iodoquinolines were demonstrated to be versatile substrates, efficiently undergoing Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling to produce 4&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;quinolines and Ullmann&#8208;type reactions to yield the corresponding sulfides. Furthermore, the 4&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;quinolines were readily converted into selenophene derivatives via halogen&#8208;promoted electrophilic cyclization, highlighting the broad applicability of the developed method.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;mediated C&#8211;C Coupling of Alkenyl Boronates and Bromodifluoroacetates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of alkenyl boronates and bromodifluoroacetates in the presence of copper powder and TMEDA as the catalytic system was developed. The corresponding C&#8211;C coupling products were obtained in 35&#8211;93% yield. The method tolerated a variety of functional groups, namely, phenol, (thio)ether, protected amino&#8208;, hydroxy&#8208;, ketone, and carboxylic acid moieties, as well as various saturated carbo&#8208; and heterocycles, and was compatible with multigram scale&#8208;up (to 76 g). The diastereoselectivity of the process was typically low so that ca. 1:1 &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; isomeric mixtures were formed from pure &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; alkenyl boronates. Further functional group transformations demonstrated the utility of the prepared compounds as valuable building blocks for synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Based on the obtained results and the literature data, a plausible reaction mechanism was proposed involving the formation of radical and organocopper intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic asymmetric synthesis of all stereoisomers of aliphatic, vicinal diols in conventional and non&#8208;conventional media</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral, vicinal diols are of high interest for academic research and industrial applications. For synthesizing chiral diols, enzymes are important catalysts due to their high selectivity and ability to work under tolerable temperature and no pressure. In this study, two consecutive enzyme&#8208;catalyzed steps were used for the asymmetric synthesis of aliphatic, vicinal diols with high product concentrations and chiral purity. The reaction comprised a ligation step employing lyases and a subsequent reduction step using oxidoreductases. Either in an aqueous buffer or an organic solvent, the potentially biobased aldehydes acetaldehyde, propanal, butanal, and pentanal were used as substrates.	Here, all possible stereoisomers of 2,3&#8208;butanediol,
3,4&#8208;hexanediol, 4,5&#8208;octanediol, and 5,6&#8208;decanediol were produced with isomeric content values between 72% and &gt; 99%, and concentrations and conversions between 4.1 and 60 mM. This work shows how four symmetric, chiral, vicinal diols can be synthesized by combining enzymes in a modular way, including exemplarily scaling.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization Amination of Propargylamine and 1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel and efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization amination of propargylamines and 1,3&#8208;dienes is reported for the first time, yielding a series of chloromethylene pyrrolidines with high efficiency and excellent selectivity. This method was successfully applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and drug molecules, providing molecular backbones with potential applications. The reaction was shown to achieve regioselective modulation of the product molecules through the resonance between the solvent and allylpalladium.

         <title>Disclosing the intra&#8208;catalyst non&#8208;covalent interactions in tetrahydropyran&#8208;based dipeptidic catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe how minor structural modifications to our bifunctional organocatalysts based on sugar amino acids (SAAs) can alter the network of non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) within the catalyst, leading to significant changes in their catalytic activity. This is attributed to the intra&#8208;catalyst NCIs, which induce conformational changes that are reflected in the transition state of the rate&#8208;determining step of the Michael addition of aldehydes to trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes. Through kinetic experiments, conformational analysis, and DFT calculations, we found that the presence of a methoxy group at the C4 position of the tetrahydropyran ring reduces the catalytic activity by a factor of five compared to the catalyst without the methoxy group. Additionally, we have identified the different intra&#8208;catalyst NCIs, both attractive and repulsive, that drive the conformational changes, ultimately modifying the energy levels of the transition states of the rate&#8208; and enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Research Progress on Organocatalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Atropisomeric Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The burgeoning field of asymmetric catalysis has significantly advanced the construction of axially chiral compounds, recognized for their distinct three&#8208;dimensional structures that are relevant in drug discovery, catalyst design and material science. Particularly, the atropisomeric aldehydes, characterized by a chiral axis and the presence of an aldehyde functionality, are of increasing value and
interest in chemistry&#8208;related domains, such as serving as privileged chiral catalysts for activation of amines. In recent years, elegant environmentally&#8208;friendly metal&#8208;free catalytic asymmetric methodologies based on de novo formation of (hetero)aromatic rings, dynamic kinetic resolution and desymmetrization have been established to build this fascinating class of atropisomers. In this review, we would
like to highlight recent research progress on enantioselective synthesis of atropisomeric aldehydes by means of organocatalysis and biocatalysis, including their scopes, limitations, mechanisms, synthetic applications and provide some insights into future development. 1. Introduction
2. Ring Formation
3. Dynamic Kinetic Resolution
4. Desymmetrization
5. Conclusions and Outlook

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a mild, operationally simple method for synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroketones through selective single defluorination of trifluoroketones and subsequent difluoroalkylation of C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds at room temperature within a single step. By successfully difluoroalkylating unfunctionalized ethers and benzyl radical precursors, we demonstrated the broad applicability of this method. The mechanistic study supports that the success of the reaction is probably attributed to the dual roles of trimethylsilyl chloride under the photocatalyzed conditions: 1) fluoride anion scavenger; and 2) chlorine radical source which promote hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of mesoporous Cu&#8322;O  nanospheres for green synthesis in the enantioselective boron conjugate addition of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated chiral compounds in aqueous phase</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral organoboron compounds are essential intermediates in various significant reactions. However, there are still few efficient catalysts for their synthesis. This paper reports a novel catalytic material for chiral asymmetric boron conjugate addition reactions: mesoporous Cu&#8322;O nanospheres (M&#8208;Cu&#8322;O). M&#8208;Cu&#8322;O is approximately 0.55 &#956;m, exhibiting dense and uniformly distributed worm&#8208;like pores. It features a specific surface area of 15.7 m&#178;/g and an average pore size of 14.3 nm. Under the conditions of Toluene:H2O = 9:1, with a chiral ligand amount of 3.6 mol% and no additional base, it achieves a high yield (98% yield) and impressive enantioselectivity (98% ee ) for the template substrate chalcone using only 3.0 mol% of the catalyst. Notably, the catalyst can be easily recovered and maintains robust catalytic performance after seven cycles, yielding 92% and an ee value of 90%. This work presents a mild and effective method for synthesizing chiral boron compounds in an aqueous phase, significantly enhancing the application potential of mesoporous copper oxide nanospheres.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiodivergent Reactions of 2&#8208;Alkynyl Aziridines with Grignard Reagents</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we report regiodivergent nucleophilic attack of Grignard reagents to 2&#8208;alkynyl aziridines. Under the catalysis of a Cu(I)&#8208;diphosphine complex, benzylic Grignard reagents add to the carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond of the aziridines to deliver &#945;&#8208;allenylamines in moderate to excellent yields; the direct addition of the Grignard reagents to the aziridines in the absence of catalyst provided homopropargylic amine derivatives. Both reactions could proceed in highly enantiospecific ways. Further synthetic manipulations of these products enable rapid access to diverse useful heterocyclic molecular scaffolds.

         <title>Iron Catalyzed Radical Alkylation of Cyclic Ketimines with Olefins via Metal Hydride Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Here, we present an innovative approach to achieve Minisci&#8208;type alkylation of cyclic N&#8208;ketimines, enabling access to a diverse range of valuable alkylated sulfonyl ketimines via iron hydride hydrogen atom transfer. More than 35 examples are shown with a wide range of substrates. Additionally, this system is easy to operate and can be efficiently scaled up. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the alkyl radical process involved and the air acts as the sole oxidant in this system.

Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;arylations of carbonyl compounds have shown to be a useful strategy for the late&#8208;stage synthesis of &#945;&#8208;arylesters. However, the use of strong basic conditions and difficult handling necessary for the in&#8208;situ preparation of enolates is a major disadvantage. On the other hand, using Reformatsky zinc&#8208;enolates can overcome these challenges. Moreover, mechanochemical in&#8208;situ activation of zinc is even more beneficial. Herein, we report mechanochemical Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling between in&#8208;situ generated Reformatsky Zn&#8208;enolates and aryl halides. This operationally simple procedure affords &#945;&#8208;arylated esters or amides using an affordable catalytic system. Reactions were carried under air and ambient conditions using granulated zinc without the need for its pre&#8208;activation. Less reactive and commercially more affordable aryl bromides afforded the desired products in good to excellent yields in comparison to aryl iodides. The optimized conditions were applied in scale&#8208;up reaction and in the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;arylated esters, amides, and derivatives of natural products.

&lt;p&gt;Transition-metal-catalyzed &#945;-arylations of carbonyl compounds have shown to be a useful strategy for the late-stage synthesis of &#945;-arylesters. However, the use of strong basic conditions and difficult handling necessary for the &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; preparation of enolates is a major disadvantage.

Abstract
A copper and DMAP relay&#8208;catalyzed strategy has been achieved for the modular synthesis of 2&#8208;alkoxy quinolines from a three&#8208;component coupling of terminal alkynes, anthranils, and alcohols. In this protocol, a novel quinoline pyridine salt is formed and serves as a key intermediate in the formation of 2&#8208;alkoxy quinolines. The reaction has a broad substrate scope of each reaction partners, affording diversified 2&#8208;alkoxy quinoline products in generally good yields.

         <title>Regioselective Hydrothiolation of Terminal Alkynes using Half&#8208;Sandwich Ni(ii) Catalysts bearing Bidentate NHC&#8208;Carboxylate Ligands</title>

Abstract
A half&#8208;sandwich nickel complex containing an NHC&#8208;carboxylate chelate ligand (i.&#8201;e., [Ni(&#951;5&#8208;Cp)(&#954;2&#8208;C,O&#8208;NHC)]) derived from the (S)&#8208;leucine has been identified for the selective hydrothiolation of terminal acetylenes toward challenging Markovnikov&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;vinyl thioethers, even with aryl alkynes. The activity and selectivity exhibited by the nickel complex are comparable, if not superior, to those of complexes of rhodium reported to be the best catalysts to date for the Markovnikov addition in the thiol&#8208;yne reaction. The experimental data are consistent with the participation of the coordinated carboxylate group in the catalytic reaction as an intermolecular acid&#8208;base co&#8208;catalyst, favoring the formation of nickel&#8208;thiolate intermediates.

Abstract
The visible light&#8208;induced one&#8208;pot tandem photolysis of areneazo&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;nitro)propanes was achieved to give carbazole and indole derivatives. The aryl azidation followed by an intramolecular C&#8722;H amination smoothly proceeded under visible light irradiation without any photocatalyst, demonstrating the synthetic versatility of areneazo&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;nitro)propanes. The in&#8197;situ generation of aryl azide intermediates was executed under mild visible light photolysis conditions, showcasing the synthetic versatility of areneazo&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;nitro)propanes, a safe alternative of diazonium salts.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Nitroalkanes with Aliphatic Grignard/Cerium and Organozinc Reagents for Synthesis of Functionalized Nitrones</title>

Abstract
This study aims to develop a more efficient, functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant approach using stable nitroalkanes and reductive coupling reactions with aliphatic Grignard/cerium and organozinc reagents. The treatment of nitroalkanes with aliphatic Grignard reagents in the presence of a catalytic amount of CuF2 and stoichiometric amount of CeCl3 affords various nitrones in good yields as single isomers. The reaction of tertiary nitroalkanes with organozinc reagents affords various functionalized nitrones without CuF2 or CeCl3. These reductive coupling reactions proceed without the loss of functional groups such as alkene, alkyne, benzyl ether, chlorine, ester, and nitrile moieties. Nitrones can also be used as precursors for [3+2] cyclizations with electron&#8208;withdrawing alkenes and alkynes.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
This is the report on the Lewis base catalysis of annulenones. Additionally, the synthesis of chiral annulenone catalysts and their application in asymmetric ring&#8208;opening reactions of meso&#8208;epoxides is shown. Annulenones, such as cyclopropenones and tropones, function as Lewis bases owing to their inherent polarity caused by aromaticity, resulting in the activation of silicon tetrachloride, which catalyzes the ring&#8208;opening reaction of meso&#8208;epoxides. Moreover, various chiral annulenone catalysts have been designed and synthesized, and microwave irradiation has been shown to improve the synthetic efficiency of chiral tropones. The chiral annulenones successfully catalyzed the asymmetric ring&#8208;opening reaction of meso&#8208;epoxides, resulting in the formation of 1,2&#8208;chlorohydrins in a high yield and high enantioselectivity (up to 90% ee in 96% yield). These results represent the example of three&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered annulenones as a chiral Lewis base catalyst.

Abstract
In this paper, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition has been revealed to synthesize the bishomocubanone derivatives in moderate to excellent yield under mild conditions. This method demonstrated a broad substrate scope and excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, affording cubane precursors and a series of bishomocubanones. Meanwhile, a hundred&#8208;gram scale experiment of this method has been employed to synthesize cubane precursors with 98% yield.

         <title>Diverse Synthesis of Azoles: Construction of ortho&#8208;Azidotetrazoles/Triazoletetrazoles through N&#8722;N Cleavage of 2H&#8208;Indazoles</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a conceptually new, general, and efficient approach for the synthesis of valuable ortho&#8208;azido&#8208;1,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole and one&#8208;pot synthesis of ortho&#8208;triazoletetrazole derivatives mainly via PIDA mediated N&#8722;N cleavage of the azole ring of 2H&#8208;indazoles using TMSN3. This current methodology represents an array of unsymmetrical ortho&#8208;azidotetrazole and ortho&#8208;triazoletetrazole derivatives with wide functional group tolerance in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. The practical utility of this reaction was showcased through successful scale&#8208;up synthesis and a variety of subsequent derivatizations of ortho&#8208;azidotetrazole products. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the reaction proceeds through a radical pathway.

         <title>Photoinduced Hydrogen Atom Transfer Activation of Benzylic C&#8722;H Bonds Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible light, as an efficient and renewable resource, has gained significant attention in organic synthesis due to its mild, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly nature. Among the various photocatalytic processes, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) has become a crucial mechanism for the activation of C&#8722;H bonds, with a particular focus on the functionalization of benzylic C(sp&#179;)&#8722;H bonds. This review shows recent developments in the area of photoinduced HAT and its use in benzylic C&#8722;H bonds functionalization. We discuss halogen atom radicals, N&#8208;centered radical, O&#8208;centered radical, S&#8208;centered radical and C&#8208;centered radical in HAT processes, and influence on reaction selectivity and substrate versatility. The potential of photoinduced HAT to bypass the need for transition metal catalysts and directing groups positions it as a promising approach for constructing intricate organic molecules with high atom economy and sustainability. This review aims to offer a detailed summary of the current state of photoinduced HAT, providing insights into its potential uses in synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctionalization of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Boranes by a Single Metal&#8208;free Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective access to densely functionalized boranes, with identical or distinct functional groups at the boron center, has great potentials in materials science, organic synthesis and drug discovery. However, assembling multifunctional boranes was heavily dependent on hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (HAT) at high temperatures, hazardous radical initiators, metal photocatalysts and HAT reagents, respectively. Simultaneously, competitive side reactions such as polymerizations and regioisomers formation remain highly challenging. Herein, a programmable multifunctionalization of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) boranes is developed for the first time powered by a single, metal&#8208;free photocatalyst, in which boryl radicals from sequential substituted boranes are generated instead of polymerizations. This robust and versatile catalytic system leads to an extremely broad variety of boranes incorporated with diverse alkyl or alkenyl groups in high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorus Fluoride Exchange (PFEx) is a new click chemistry technology that hinges on the creation of innovative hubs to unlock its potential and broaden its applications. In this study, we outline some guiding principles for PFEx hub development and validate these principles by developing a new hub, 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyclotriphosphazenes (SACPs). These SACPs serve as versatile PFEx hubs with stable functionality and orthogonal reactivity, exemplifying their utility within the Diversity Oriented Clicking (DOC) framework. We demonstrate that SACPs interact with various 1,3&#8208;dipoles, enabling the synthesis of phosphorus&#8208;rich compounds through sequential cycloaddition and PFEx reactions, thus pioneering new synthetic routes for wide application of click chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox Hydroacylative Dearomatization of Indoles with Aromatic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we reported for the first time a photocatalytic dearomative hydroacylation reaction of electron&#8208;deficient indoles with readily available aromatic acids through a phosphoranyl radical&#8208;assisted deoxygenative process. A range of racemic and optically active 2&#8208;acylindoline derivatives were obtained in good yields (up to 94%) with good diastereoselectivity. The synthetic robustness is highlighted by the enantioselective dearomatization of indoles and the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and pharmaceutical molecules. This protocol features broad substrate scope and mild reaction conditions, providing a reliable entry to developing deoxygenative strategies in dearomatization reactions. Preliminary mechanistic studies and DFT calculations suggest that a Giese&#8208;type radical addition pathway should be involved.</dc:description>

         <title>PTC in the Polyenolate&#8208;Mediated [10+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition for the Synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Disubstituted Amino Acid Precursors</title>

Abstract
The manuscript describes a formal [10+2] higher&#8208;order cycloaddition between 2&#8208;arylideneindan&#8208;1&#8208;ones and &#945;&#8208;alkylidene azlactones as higherene precursors and higherenofiles respectively. The reaction is realized under Br&#248;nsted&#8208;base catalysis utilizing the phase transfer catalysis approach. The key intermediate is an isobenzofulvene&#8208;derived polyenolate which acts as a 10&#8208;electron component in the higher&#8208;order cycloaddition. By using this strategy, a series of structurally diverse compounds containing a polycyclic hydrocarbon scaffold was prepared in 79&#8211;99% yields. In addition, the potential of the obtained [10+2]&#8208;cycloadducts has been confirmed by transformations, including the synthesis of a highly&#8208;valuable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted N&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;aminoester.

         <title>Structure&#8208;guided engineering of oleate hydrates for the synthesis of small chiral alcohols without decoy molecule</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small and chiral secondary alcohols are sought&#8208;after compounds that are frequently used in the synthesis of biologically active compounds. However, their stereochemically correct synthesis remains a challenge for the chemical industry. Synthetic routes are restrained by multiple steps and thus low atom efficiency. Here we employ engineered variants from the oleate hydratase from E. meningoseptica to produce chiral C5&#8208;C10 secondary alcohols within a single step. First, we established a two&#8208;phase system (2&#8208;PS) to trap the volatile substrates/products which facilitated semi&#8208;rational mutagensis in the active site and tunnel of the enzyme. These efforts led to variants with an up to 20&#8208;fold increase in catalytic activity and &gt;99% ee, notably, without the use of a decoy molecule. Computational analysis indicated structural changes in the tunnel radius, ligand transport and energy profiles, which gave us hints to explain the enhanced performance of the variants. Interestingly, scaling up the reaction volume demonstrated significant increases in product concentrations, leading up to a 100&#8208;fold increase in comparison to the current benchmark. This new 2&#8208;PS and the engineered enzyme variants offer a promising approach for a scalable, asymmetric hydration of small unactivated alkenes, which would drastically ease the access to chiral alcohol&#8208;based pheromones or drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into the Key Factors that Influence the Reaction Pathways in the Silyl&#8208;Prins Cyclization of gem&#8208;Vinylsilyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
This work provides an in&#8208;depth analysis of the factors governing the different reaction pathways in the acid&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of gem&#8208;vinylsilyl alcohols with aldehydes. The study evaluates the impact of both the ligands attached to silicon and the choice of the Lewis acid on the reaction outcome. Additionally, computational studies offer valuable insights into the mechanism that control these distinct pathways. The process enables the chemo&#8208; and stereocontrolled formation of a variety of structural frameworks, offering significant potential for the generation of a broad range of molecular architectures.

Abstract
Herein, we report a novel and practical strategy to access &#945;&#8208;chloroketones from esters bearing diverse (hetero)aromatic, aliphatic, alkynyl and alkenyl substituents with transient chloromethyllithium under continuous flow conditions. This highly chemoselective method enables a fast (on a time scale of &lt;5 s), efficient and straightforward access to a broad substrate scope (up to 99% yield) with a remarkable throughput of &#8764;10.6 g/h.

         <title>Shaking Up the Friedl&#228;nder Reaction: Rapid, Scalable Mechanochemical Synthesis of Polyaryl&#8208;Substituted Quinolines</title>

Abstract
Quinolines are ubiquitous heterocyclic aromatic scaffolds, which can be found in many natural and synthetic products. They are highly valued for their pharmacological and electrochemical properties, encouraging the discovery of new routes for quinoline synthesis and diversification. In particular, polyaryl&#8208;substituted quinolines have recently surged as useful substrates for a wide variety of applications, yet their synthetic routes remain difficult and inefficient. Herein, we report a rapid and novel mechanochemical Friedl&#228;nder synthesis of polyaryl&#8208;substituted quinolines under basic conditions using ball milling. The optimized reaction conditions resulted in moderate to excellent yields ranging from 48% to &gt;95% and demonstrated broad functional group tolerance at 1&#8197;hour reaction times. We further show a new route for the synthesis of photocatalyst DPQN2,4&#8722;di&#8722;OMe and photo&#8208;ligand PPQN2,4&#8722;di&#8722;OMe as well as OLED donor&#8208;acceptor pCzPPQ, electron transport material oligoquinoline TQB and organic semiconductor DPA. A gram scale reaction was also achieved using Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM), providing an isolated yield of 87% after a simple recrystallization in ethanol.

Abstract
Scarce dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazinoisoindole framework bearing two points of diversity was prepared through a cascade process based on concomitant Csp3&#8722;N and Csp2&#8722;N bond formation. This approach consists of an amidation in basic medium of a tosyl group by nucleophilic substitution followed by Cu&#8208;mediated Goldberg reaction in the same operation. The required &#946;&#8208;bromoenamide bearing a tosyl group was obtained by tosylation of fused brominated N,O&#8208;acetals for the first time in acidic medium using submolar amounts of PTSA. The obtained piperazines are useful building blocks as illustrated by the formation of a pentacyclic product via the intramolecular interception of the enamide function.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Interaction Enabled Ru(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of (Multi)&#8208;Substituted Pyridines</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a cost&#8208;effective synthesis of various multi&#8208;substituted pyridine derivatives, especially 2&#8208;aryl pyridines, using secondary alcohols and 1,3&#8208;diol as the primary feedstock with ammonium acetate serving as nitrogen donor, catalyzed by a new well&#8208;defined singlet mono&#8208;radical Ru(III)&#8208;catalyst featuring a cyclopentadienyl group, one PPh3, and a redox&#8208;active scaffold &#8722;N1&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine having a pendant &#8208;NH2 arm. The &#8208;NH2 arm of the catalyst facilitates the generation of the critical reactive intermediates by enhancing the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon center of the diols or diketones by forming hydrogen bonds, making it more catalytically effective over the similar other Ru&#8208;catalysts having no pendant &#8208;NH2 arm. The Ru&#8208;catalyst also functionalizes 2&#8208;aryl pyridine moieties with different coupling partners, such as aryl iodides, terminal alkynes, and styrene derivatives at the o&#8208;position of the phenyl ring.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling between Alkylidenecyclopropanes and Boronic Acids</title>

Abstract
The combination of a Pd(0) source and a phosphoramidite ligand promotes a formal allylic cross&#8208;coupling between alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) and boronic acids to yield synthetically appealing 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes. Remarkably, the reaction proceeds both under neutral and basic conditions, and works with both aryl&#8208; and alkenylboronic acids. DFT calculations suggest that the reaction entails a C&#8722;C activation/protonation mechanism instead of a hydropalladation pathway, which has been frequently proposed for other metal&#8208;promoted hydrofunctionalizations of ACPs.

         <title>Oxidation State and Halogen Influence on the NHC&#8208;Gold&#8208;Halide&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of Propargylic Amides</title>

Abstract
The homogeneously catalyzed cycloisomerization reaction of propargylic amides was tested as benchmark reaction for two homologous series of Au(I) and Au(III) complexes with NHC ligands. This reaction is known to afford either aromatic oxazoles or dihydrooxazoles, depending on the oxidation state of the applied gold catalysts. For this purpose, symmetric and unsymmetric NHC ligands with mixed alkyl or benzyl substituents (1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;imidazolyl&#8208;2yl or 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;imidazolyl&#8208;2&#8208;yl) and the corresponding Au(I) and Au(III) derivatives were prepared and characterized by analytical methods, IR and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies, and by X&#8208;ray diffraction methods. Ten NHC&#8208;gold(I) and NHC&#8208;gold(III) complexes were tested on the cyclization reactions by adding gold catalysts in the presence and absence of AgPF6. Noteworthy, only the 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;gold(III) trichloride was able to give selectively the aromatic oxazole without the addition of the silver salt. Interestingly, on contrary to what is reported in the literature, the use of gold(I) or gold(III) complexes does not influence the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reaction, while the halide bound to the metal does. In this regard, a mechanism purposing the dihydrooxazole as an intermediate for the formation of aromatic oxazole is proposed.

Abstract
Trimethyl phosphite promotes the synthesis of 2,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted 2H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. The protocol developed affords a two&#8208;step method towards triazoles from available reagents. 3,4&#8208;Disubstituted isoxazolones are initially coupled with diazonium tetrafluoroborates. The subsequent reaction is triggered by a single electron transfer from the phosphite to the diazenylisoxazolone under heating or blue LED irradiation at room temperature. The radical anion cascade proceeds via a ring opening/decarboxylation/cyclization sequence. The synthesized triazoles show promising fluorescence in the region from 340&#8197;nm to 450&#8197;nm with a quantum yield up to 81.6%. The emission energy depends slightly on the substituent nature at the triazole carbon atoms. If an electron&#8208;donor group is introduced into the N2 substituent of the triazole ring, it results in a bathochromic shift of the luminescence energy.

Abstract
The versatile reactivity of propargylic epoxides and alcohols, due to the presence of a triple bond, is used in the synthesis of various organic compounds and building blocks. However, there are not many known methods for the preparation of optically pure propargylic epoxides and alcohols, and the existing ones often require specific reagents. Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) can be used to obtain enantiomerically pure compounds from racemic epoxides. These important biocatalysts facilitate epoxide ring&#8208;opening reactions with unnatural nucleophiles such as azides. Here we report the biocatalytic transformation of propargylic epoxides using HHDHs. Six propargylic epoxides with different substituents were synthesized. Kinetic resolution reactions catalyzed by HHDHs in the presence of azide were performed. Two enzymes with opposite stereoselectivities, HheC and HheA2&#8208;N178A were used and yielded azido alcohols (98&#8211;&gt;99% ee, E&#8208;value &gt;200) and epoxides (29&#8211;88% ee). The best performing p&#8208;tolyl propargylic epoxide derivative was used in a sequence of two enzymatic reactions to obtain both enantiomers of the &#946;&#8208;azido alcohol and the (R)&#8208;enantiomer of the &#945;&#8208;azido alcohol, each in &gt;99% ee, through complete conversion of the starting epoxide. The obtained azido alcohols were used in further transformations. The click reactions with terminal acetylenes gave triazolyl propargylic alcohols (&gt;99% ee, 90&#8211;98% yield). In the case of the &#945;&#8208;azido alcohol, the click reaction was followed by intramolecular cyclization to form the dihydrofuranyl triazole motif that is found in biologically active compounds.

Abstract
Synthetic electrochemistry may establish direct routes to a preparation of a plethora of organic substances, which are hardly accessible by conventional experimental techniques. Herein, we present an electrochemically&#8208;driven method for an assembly of a broad range of rare heterocyclic mesoionic entities &#8211;1,2,3&#8208;triazole 1&#8208;imines. These nitrogen heterocycles were prepared through a transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and exogenous oxidant&#8208;free strategy using a C/Ni electrode pair. Over 30 examples of thus synthesized 1,2,3&#8208;triazole 1&#8208;imines illustrate selectivity and practical utility of this approach. Key solvent&#8208;controlled reactivity patterns for the formation of the triazole imine scaffold were revealed indicating a modulation ability of the developed approach. These experimental findings were additionally justified based on cyclic voltammetry (CV) data and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover, according to differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data, some of the prepared 1,2,3&#8208;triazole 1&#8208;imines correspond to the thermally stable species with an onset decomposition temperature up to 190&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Enantiocomplementary Synthesis of Tetrahydrofurans by Engineered Halohydrin Dehalogenases</title>

Abstract
Chiral tetrahydrofurans are prevalent structural motifs in biologically active compounds, approved drugs and natural products, but relevant enantiocomplementary synthesis remains underdeveloped. In this study, wild type halohydrin dehalogenase HheC from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1, was first discovered to enable the intramolecular substitution of &#948;&#8208;halohydrins for the formation of tetrahydrofurans but with unsatisfied activity and stereoselectivity. Through structure&#8208;guided protein engineering, two completely enantiocomplementary variants T134M and P84L/W139A of HheC were obtained for the synthesis of tetrahydrofurans by the kinetic resolution of &#948;&#8208;halohydrins (both giving products with up to 99% e.e., E&gt;200). This research unveiled the halohydrin dehalogenases&#8217; catalytic ability to form chiral cyclic ethers larger ring size than three&#8208;membered epoxides, which has hitherto been unexplored, and provided an enzymatic synthesis access to valuably enantiocomplementary tetrahydrofurans.

Abstract
Herein, catalytic difunctionalization of vinyl arenes is reported using an iron salt as a catalyst without ligands. A series of substituted alkylboronic acid esters was obtained as a single regioisomer from vinyl arenes at 50&#8201;&#176;C. This multicomponent protocol enabled the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;B bonds to produce boroalkylated products in a single process. A non&#8208;radical pathway is proposed for the reaction in contrast to the radical pathways of iron&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation reactions. The organoboron compounds generated from this reaction were further utilized for diverse functional group conversions.

Abstract
Photo&#8208;promoted cyanomethyl radical procedures for the preparation of 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;indenes and 2,8&#8208;dihydrocyclopenta[a]indenes from phenyl&#8208;linked 1,6&#8208;enynes with &#945;&#8208;halogenated acetonitriles are reported. The iodocyanomethylation/cyclization is performed via an atom&#8208;transfer radical addition (ATRA) strategy under photocatalyst&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. In particular, the photoinduced cyanomethylative cascade bicyclization is carried out under the fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3/Na2CO3 catalystic symtem and visible light irradiation. These methods offer a one&#8208;step and atom&#8208;economical access to diverse cyano&#8208;group containing five&#8208;membered rings with broad substrate scope and high selectivity. A plausible reaction mechanism is also proposed.

Abstract
A method for the reductive difluoromethylation of alkenes with 2&#8208;difluoromethylthio(benzothiazole) under photocatalytic conditions is described. The reaction involves the generation of the difluoromethyl radical by means of trimethyltriazinane, which serves as a precursor for the strongly reducing cyclic diaminoalkyl radical.

Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed inert C&#8722;H bond functionalization using sulfoxonium ylides as metal carbene surrogates to replace the explosive and labile diazo compounds is synthetically attractive. Presented herein is a divergent synthesis of (CF3)&#8208;indazolo[3,2&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives based on C&#8722;H bond activation&#8208;initiated cascade reactions of 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;1H&#8208;indazoles with sulfoxonium ylides. The formation of products involves Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H bond metalation, carbene formation, migratory insertion, proto&#8208;demetalation and intramolecular condensation. In general, this newly developed protocol features simple substrates, structurally diverse products, step&#8208;economy and scalability. In addition, evaluation of the photophysical properties and anti&#8208;proliferative activity against three human cancer cell lines of the products thus obtained showed that some of them possess potent anticancer activity with potential self&#8208;tracking capability through fluorescence detection.

Abstract
An Yb(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed [2+2] cycloaddition /retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE)/bicyclization of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoarylaklynyl)&#8208;naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ols and 3&#8208;alkylideneoxindoles is reported, enabling a direct C=C bond cleavage&#8208;reassembly process to regioselectively synthesize a variety of quinoline&#8208;tethered benzo[5,6]chromeno[2,3&#8208;b]indoles in 31&#8211;84% yields. Exchanging the amino group for a hydroxyl group in the arylalkynyl unit of the naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol substrate resulted in chromenyl chromeno[2,3&#8208;b]indoles via a similar cascade process.

Abstract
An expedient strategy for the construction of trifluoromethylselenolated spiro[5.5]trienones/spiro[4.5]trienones through a cascade electrophilic trifluoromethylselenolation cyclization and dearomatization has been developed. This sequential process was induced by N&#8208;trifluoromethylselenophthalimide (Phth&#8208;SeCF3), which was an efficient electrophilic trifluoromethylselenolation reagent. This approach has the feature of mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and high functional group tolerance.

Abstract
The fungal natural product aspergillomarasmine A (AMA) is an inhibitor of metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamases and a promising co&#8208;drug candidate for reversing bacterial &#946;&#8208;lactam resistance. The biosynthesis of AMA from L&#8208;Asp and O&#8208;phospho&#8208;L&#8208;serine is catalyzed by AMA synthase, which possesses high synthetic potential for the biocatalytic preparation of AMA and related aminopolycarboxylic acids. Here, we identified and structurally characterized an AMA synthase from Pyrenophora teres f. teres 0&#8211;1 (PteAMAS). Crystallographic analysis revealed a unique homotetrameric fold and a highly hydrophilic active site, which supports the PLP&#8208;dependent &#946;&#8208;replacement catalytic mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of PteAMAS for the biocatalytic synthesis of AMA and its analogues, achieving structural diversification of the APA1 moiety through a modular two&#8208;enzyme system involving PteAMAS and a selective C&#8722;N lyase, namely EDDS lyase or 3&#8208;methylaspartate ammonia lyase variant MAL&#8722;Q73&#8197;A. In addition, we exhibited the usefulness of PteAMAS for convenient synthesis of various S&#8208;alkyl, &#8208;aryl, and &#8208;arylalkyl substituted L&#8208;cysteines, which are valuable non&#8208;canonical amino acids with broad pharmaceutical applications. The present study has not only provided the structural basis for catalysis and substrate recognition by PteAMAS, but also paved the way for biocatalytic preparation of structurally complex AMA analogues and various non&#8208;canonical amino acids.

&lt;p&gt;The fungal natural product aspergillomarasmine A (AMA) is an inhibitor of metallo-&#946;-lactamases and a promising co-drug candidate for reversing bacterial &#946;-lactam resistance. The biosynthesis of AMA from L-A&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-phospho-L-serine is catalyzed by AMA synthase, which possesses high synthetic potential for the biocatalytic preparation of AMA and related aminopolycarboxylic acids. Here, we identified and structurally characterized an AMA synthase from &lt;i&gt;Pyrenophora teres&lt;/i&gt; f. &lt;i&gt;teres&lt;/i&gt; 0&#8211;1 (PteAMAS). Crystallographic analysis revealed a unique homotetrameric fold and a highly hydrophilic active site, which supports the PLP-dependent &#946;-replacement catalytic mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of PteAMAS for the biocatalytic synthesis of AMA and its analogues, achieving structural diversification of the APA1 moiety through a modular two-enzyme system involving PteAMAS and a selective C&#8722;N lyase, namely EDDS lyase or 3-methylaspartate ammonia lyase variant MAL&#8722;Q73&#8197;A. In addition, we exhibited the usefulness of PteAMAS for convenient synthesis of various &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl, -aryl, and -arylalkyl substituted L-cysteines, which are valuable non-canonical amino acids with broad pharmaceutical applications. The present study has not only provided the structural basis for catalysis and substrate recognition by PteAMAS, but also paved the way for biocatalytic preparation of structurally complex AMA analogues and various non-canonical amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A copper or silver&#8208;catalyzed cascade addition/5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization/isomerization reaction of isothiocyanate with ynone has been developed. This strategy enables the synthesis of a variety of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene&#8208;5&#8208;aminothiophen&#8208;3&#8208;one derivatives with diverse substitutions in a single vessel. The method is featured with pot&#8208;economy as well as regio&#8208; and Z&#8208;selectivity. Several biologically active molecules could be modified using this strategy. Moreover, the relevant indole&#8208;fused and indole&#8208;substituted thiophenone derivatives were also assembled in one pot by merging this strategy with other bond formation methods. Based on the experiments and the related reports, a cascade pathway triggered by the addition of ynone&#8208;derived radical towards the C(sp)&#8208;atom of isothiocyanate was proposed to elucidate the probable process of the transformation.

Abstract
Imidazoheterocycles have extensive applications in the pharmaceutical industry and agrochemicals. A comprehensive overview has been provided on the current advancements in the electrochemical functionalization of imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycles, which have been classified into ten different types of reactions. Electrochemical synthesis has emerged as a highly effective method for producing organic molecules, especially in the context of sustainable development. Employing electrons as the traceless oxidant, several C&#8722;H functionalization reactions of imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycles have been achieved at either the C3 or C5 positions. Electrons may serve as the reducing agent to synthesize pyridine rings that are either partially or fully saturated in imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines. The purpose of the review is to attract the interest of the scientific community and promote additional research on the functionalization of imidazoheterocycles using electrochemical methods.

Abstract
The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring represents an attractive yet challenging synthetic targets in the field of organic synthesis, especially in a stereocontrolled fashion. Over the past two decades, organocatalysis has emerged as an enabling technology for the facile construction of enantioenriched molecules with remarkably increasing complexity and diversity, and a myriad of chiral architectures containing bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane units were elegantly assembled through organocatalytic asymmetric transformations. This review summarizes recent advancements on this topic (mainly from 2010&#8211;2023), emphasizing the reaction types such as desymmetrization and cascade reactions of different prochiral starting materials toward various chiral bicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes as well as their aza, oxa and thio derivatives. Meanwhile, the synthetic strategy, reaction mechanism, substrate scope and synthetic applications of these catalytic reactions are also discussed. We hope that this review will motivate further development and application of organocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane frameworks.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring represents an attractive yet challenging synthetic targets in the field of organic synthesis, especially in a stereocontrolled fashion. Over the past two decades, organocatalysis has emerged as an enabling technology for the facile construction of enantioenriched molecules with remarkably increasing complexity and diversity, and a myriad of chiral architectures containing bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane units were elegantly assembled through organocatalytic asymmetric transformations. This review summarizes recent advancements on this topic (mainly from 2010&#8211;2023), emphasizing the reaction types such as desymmetrization and cascade reactions of different prochiral starting materials toward various chiral bicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes as well as their aza, oxa and thio derivatives. Meanwhile, the synthetic strategy, reaction mechanism, substrate scope and synthetic applications of these catalytic reactions are also discussed. We hope that this review will motivate further development and application of organocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
This article describes the development of a room&#8208;temperature visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced palladium&#8208;catalyzed directed aldehyde C&#8722;H bond arylation to access aryl quinolinyl ketones. In this pathway, the Pd catalyst plays a dual role by harvesting light as a photocatalyst and catalyzing the chemical transformation via C&#8722;H bond activation. This process is general to synthesize a range of aryl quinolinyl ketones and tolerates many common functional groups. Our methodology was successfully applied to synthesize highly potent tubulin polymerization inhibitors.

Abstract
Ruthenium (II)&#8208;catalysed regioselective C6 alkylation of indole&#8208;7&#8208;carboxamides with maleimide has been described. Electronically diverse maleimides reacted with various indoles to furnish corresponding C6 substituted succinimide derivatives of indoles with 46&#8211;89% yields. The reaction shows functional group tolerance. The synthetic utility of the reaction has been demonstrated through the conversion of the obtained product to the corresponding hexahydropyridazinyl derivative. We also studied the kinetics of the reaction through intermolecular competitive experiments with electronically distinct indole&#8208;7&#8208;carboxamides.

Abstract
Ag&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of N&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethylisatin ketimines with conjugated exocyclic double bonds including &#945;&#8208;alkylidene succinimides and aurone derivatives was developed for the first time. Using a catalyst system consisting of a ferrocenyl P,N&#8208;ligand and AgNO2, the reaction provides a facile method for the construction of chiral pyrrolidines bearing four consecutive stereocenters and two adjacent spiro&#8208;quaternary chiral centers, as well as offers a direct route to structurally diverse enantioenriched CF3&#8208;containing 3,2&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidinyl spirooxindole derivatives.

Abstract
A multi&#8208;gram scale synthesis of ferrocenetriflone was optimised from ferrocenesulfonyl fluoride and Me3SiCF3 (Ruppert reagent). Enantioselective deprotolithiations were then optimised using alkyllithiums in the presence of catalytic (+)&#8208;sparteine to afford 2&#8208;substituted ferrocene triflones in 79&#8211;84% ee. The use of chiral lithium amides in the presence of in&#8197;situ traps was also optimised and was found to outperform alkyllithium&#8901;chiral diamine chelates for the first time in the ferrocene series, with 89&#8211;93% ee. Crystallisation of derivatives afforded enantiopure compounds that were engaged in deprotolithiation&#8208;electrophilic trapping sequences, a halogen &#8216;dance&#8217; reaction and transition metal&#8208;promoted coupling to afford a wide range of variously polysubstituted ferrocene triflones.

Abstract
A three&#8208;component denitrative cross&#8208;coupling reaction mediated by visible light has been developed. Various 2&#8208;arylvinyl thiophosphate compounds were synthesized with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields using cheap, nontoxic, nonvolatile, and non&#8208;hygroscopic elemental sulfur (S8) as the raw material. These transformations allow the direct formation of C&#8722;S and S&#8722;P bonds without metal catalyst via a one&#8208;pot procedure.

Abstract
In this work cascade cyclizations of vinyl sulfonium salts with either indolyl chalcones or ortho&#8208;amino trifluoroacetophenones are described. This protocol enables the assembly of fused 2,3&#8208;dihyro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles and fused tetrahydroquinolines containing a CF3&#8208;substituted tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenters.

Abstract
Herein, we report the alkylation of alkenyl carbonates using alkyl Grignard reagents and iron catalysis to generate C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds and provide synthetically useful yields over a range of substrates. The transformation allows the alkylation of a wide range of substrates, including aromatic rings, alkanes, cycloalkanes, heterocycles. This reaction has introduced a new family of electrophiles to the iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

Abstract
In this work, we present an organocatalytic spiroannulation method that provides access to spirocyclic benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;ones. The reaction proceeds via the generation of an azolium dienolate from an &#945;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde using a chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, followed by annulation with benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;one&#8208;derived alkenes. The resulting chiral spirobenzofuranone&#8208;fused cyclohexenones were obtained in 77&#8211;99% ee and dr from 1.2:1 to 20:1. The utility of the protocol was underscored by gram&#8208;scale reaction and follow&#8208;up transformations.

Abstract
A cascade regioselective 1,8&#8208;addition/biscyclization of 2&#8208;indolylmethanols with &#945;&#8208;(2&#8208;indolyl) propargylic alcohols has been developed via chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis. A series of chiral cyclopenta[4,5]pyrrolo biindoles bearing a quaternary stereogenic center were obtained in modest to good yields (72&#8211;95%) with high enantioselectivities (82&#8211;94%). Additionally, the photophysical properties of these hexacyclic bisindoles are examined, revealing bright fluorescence with high quantum yields.

Abstract
We describe a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed asymmetric [3+3] cycloaddition of N&#8208;viny oxindole nitrones with 2&#8208;indolylmethanols to prepare various spirooxindole[1,2]oxazines in 43&#8211;93% yields and 88:12&#8211;97:3 enantiomeric ratios. Experimental results revealed that the addition of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) played important roles to help CPA control the reaction reactivity and enantioselectivity. The present method features the construction of a tetrasubstituted chiral carbon stereocenter and the example of N&#8208;vinyl nitrones in asymmetric [3+3] cycloaddition.

Abstract
This study developed an electrochemically promoted skeleton transformation reaction of 2,1&#8208;benzisoxazoles to synthesize alkyl sulfones. Alkyl sulfones were synthesized in 68&#8211;93% yield by using 2,1&#8208;benzisoxazole and sulfonate as substrates, and acetonitrile and water as solvents. Mechanism studies showed that this reaction involves ring opening, removal of the oxygen atom of the 2,1&#8208;benzisoxazoles, and C(sp3)&#8208;sulfonylation under electrochemical conditions.

Abstract
TMSOTf&#8208;mediated 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig aminocyclization followed by N&#8208; to C&#8208;[1,3]&#8208;sulfonyl migration on N&#8208;homopropargyl hydroxylamines gave diastereoselective access to trisubstituted 3&#8208;sulfonyl cyclic nitrone (3&#8208;sulfonyl pyrroline N&#8208;oxide) derivatives. The synthetic utility of the 3&#8208;sulfonyl cyclic nitrone products was demonstrated through the diastereoselective synthesis of the sulfonyl&#8208;substituted nonaromatic N&#8208;heterocycles such as N&#8208;hydroxypyrrolidine, pyrrolidine&#8208;fused isoxazoline, and isoxazolidine derivatives.

Abstract
A method for the copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl bromides with a range of (DMPU)2Zn(Rf)2 reagents has been developed. This protocol tolerates multiple functional groups and provides broad access to aliphatic perfluoroalkylated compounds. The applicability of this procedure is demonstrated in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug analogues.

Abstract
A Cu/Pd&#8208;catalyzed tandem radical cyclization and C&#8722;H activation/carbene insertion of &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyls with &#945;&#8211;diazoesters has been developed for the construction of fused quinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;onescaffolds. The reaction proceeded well to afford a series of 3,5&#8208;dihydrocyclopenta[de]quinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives. Additionally, bioactive molecules such as sesamol and estrone could be modified by using this method.

Abstract
Development of a mild approach for the highly efficient synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl azoles, which are typically synthesized using high temperature, ligands and preactivated substrates, is highly desirable. Here, we report a mild and efficient photo&#8208;induced Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling to obtain C2&#8208;functionalized azoles using aryl thianthrenium salt (Ar&#8208;TTs). The reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope and an excellent functional group compatibility and serves as an ideal strategy for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals. Additionally, this method enables the efficient synthesis of azole&#8208;based polycyclic compounds.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Aliphatic &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids by Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Hydroamination&#8208;Hydrodesulfurisation</title>

Abstract
Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) enzymes have been extensively exploited to produce differently substituted arylalanine analogues, but their use in the stereoselective synthesis of aliphatic fatty amino acids has never been addressed. In this work, a two&#8208;step hydroamination&#8208;hydrodesulfurisation process has been investigated for the production of aliphatic L&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids from thienylacrylic acids, easily accessible by condensation from the corresponding arylaldehydes. Wild&#8208;type PALs from Planctomyces brasiliensis and Streptomyces rimosus were selected as the most promising candidates and improved by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, thus unlocking the hydroamination of a broad panel of 10 different thienylacrylic acids bearing aliphatic and aromatic substituents. The subsequent hydrodesulfurisation step, accomplished by means of inexpensive Raney nickel in mild conditions and aqueous medium, afforded the corresponding aliphatic &#945;&#8208;amino acids in 10&#8211;63% overall isolated yield and perfect enantiopurity. This chemo&#8208;enzymatic process represents the first example of aliphatic amino acid production using PALs, circumventing a major limitation of those biocatalysts.

         <title>Recent Advances in Photoredox/Chromium dual&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonyl Addition Reactions: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The chromium&#8208;catalysed Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama&#8208;Kishi (NHK) reaction is a very dependable technique for alcohol synthesis and is extensively used in the complete synthesis of natural compounds. The majority of these reactions occur via a reductive&#8208;radical&#8208;polar crossover (RRPCO) mechanism, which is crucial for the transformation of reactive radical intermediates. The production of radicals using photoinduced catalytic reactions is now among the most effective approaches. The photoinduced chromium&#8208;catalysed addition reaction to carbonyl compounds is an effective technique for alcohol synthesis that integrates the benefits of photocatalysis with chromium catalysis. Photocatalysis significantly enhances the diversity of radical production, hence broadening the substrate scope in the chromium&#8208;catalysed NHK reaction. This paper primarily examines the photoredox chromium dual&#8208;catalysed carbonyl addition process for alcohol synthesis, including numerous methods for radical generation.

The photoinduced chromium-catalysed addition reaction to carbonyl compounds is an effective technique for alcohol synthesis that integrates the benefits of photocatalysis with chromium catalysis. Photocatalysis significantly enhances the diversity of radical production, hence broadening the substrate scope in the chromium-catalysed NHK reaction. This paper primarily examines the photoredox chromium dual-catalysed carbonyl addition process for alcohol synthesis, including numerous methods for radical generation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Herein, we disclose a new photochemical process to prepare &#947;&#8208;amino acids from allylamines and formic acid salts. The investigated redox&#8208;neutral hydrocarboxylation process produces high yields across a wide range of functionalized allylamine substrates with excellent regioselectivity. The developed operationally simple protocol can be readily scaled with low photocatalyst loading (from 1% up to 0.02&#8197;mol%) without the need for any precautions to exclude air or moisture. The mechanistic working model utilizes a thiol&#8208;catalyzed radical chain process, delivering the hydrogen atom and CO2 from formic acid salt across the alkene substrate through the carboxylate radical (CO2&#8901;&#8722;), a crucial reactive intermediate.

         <title>Photocatalytic C&#8722;I Bond Borylation and Phosphorylation of Diaryliodonium Salts with Excellent Atom&#8208;Economy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Highly atom&#8208;economic conversion of diaryliodonium salts represents an underdeveloped but highly desirable domain. Most reactions involving these species only utilize single aryl group of the diaryliodonium salts and produce an equivalent of aryl iodide as waste. Herein, by further transforming the side&#8208;product aryl iodide, we report an overall new two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot strategy that allows photocatalytic C&#8722;I bond borylation of diaryliodonium salts and ensures effective conversion of both aryl groups of the diaryliodonium into the relevant arylboronic esters. Mechanistic investigations suggest that electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor complex is formed between the photocatalyst phenothiazine and diaryliodonium salt substrate. Upon visible light irradiation, this complex produces aryl radical and aryl iodide. With addition of a base in the second step, the reducing ability of the photocatalyst is enhanced via proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process, thereby aryl iodide produced in the first step is reduced to yield aryl radical again. Both aryl radicals generated in the two steps react with B2(OR)4 to produce the corresponding monoarylation product in a quantitative yield. The strategy is also applicable for C&#8722;I bond phosphorylation of diaryliodonium salts, ensuring that both aryl moieties can be phosphorylated with high efficiency.

Abstract
An enantioselective C&#8208;, O&#8208; and N&#8208; intermolecular allylic reaction of quinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones has been developed. The reaction between 3&#8208;hydroxy quinolone and Boc&#8208;protected MBH adducts with Pd&#8208;catalysis provided a series of 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diones in 20&#8211;95% yield accompanied by 69&#8211;96% enantioselectivity. In addition, the O&#8208;allylic alkylation could occur by varying the organo&#8208;catalyst and Boc&#8208;protected MBH adducts from benzaldehyde. Furthermore, the N&#8208;allylation of 3&#8208;O&#8208;protected quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones with allylic acetates was also realized (40&#8211;92% yield, 78&#8211;97% ee).

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A regioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed protoboration of alkynes has been developed, utilizing diboron as the borylation source for the efficient synthesis of alkenylborates. The reaction proceeds via cobalt&#8208;boryl intermediates, diverging from conventional Co&#8722;H chemistry. By fine&#8208;tuning the phosphine ligand side chains, we achieved excellent reactivity and regioselectivity across a wide range of internal and terminal alkynes. This Co&#8208;catalyzed method offers significant advantages in terms of both efficiency and environmental impact, making it an attractive approach for the synthesis of complex organic molecules.

Abstract
An unprecedented cascade reaction of simple inactive alkenes, azo compounds and H2O to produce valuable poly&#8208;substituted oxazolidinones is reported herein. The transformation possesses exclusive regioselectivity and features mild reaction conditions and a broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies indicated this transformation underwent a N&#8208;alkylation&#8208;hydroxylation&#8208;transesterification cascade process. This research not only pushes the boundaries of the essential difunctionalization of alkenes but also exploits a new chemistry for azo compounds.

         <title>From gem&#8208;Dichlorocyclobutenones to Cyclobutenols: Unveiling a Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Reduction&#8208;Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation Cascade</title>

Abstract
Cyclobutenones constitute an appealing class of substrates in catalytic asymmetric transformations leading to diversely substituted enantioenriched four&#8208;membered carbocycles, which are eliciting a growing interest in medicinal chemistry. Whilst several synthetically useful enantioselective conjugate addition reactions have been reported, the catalytic enantioselective reduction of the carbonyl group of simple cyclobutenones remains an elusive transformation. Herein, we disclose the discovery of a novel allylic reduction&#8208;asymmetric transfer hydrogenation cascade, catalyzed by a Noyori&#8208;Ikariya ruthenium complex, from readily available gem&#8208;dichlorocyclobutenones, leading to 2&#8208;chlorocyclobutenols with high optical purities, which can be engaged in postfunctionalization reactions enabling access to substituted four&#8208;membered rings.

Abstract
A synthetic method to prepare &#948;&#8211;&#954;&#8208;chloroketones, &#8208;esters and &#8208;amides that relies on the copper(I)&#8208;mediated chlorination at the unactivated tertiary &#948;&#8211;&#954;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of ketones, carboxylic esters, and amides by dichloramine&#8208;T is presented. By exploiting the ability of the N&#8208;chloramide to act as both the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and chlorination reagent, the reactions were shown to be site&#8208;selective with halogenation only occurring at the unactivated tertiary carbon center situated four to ten C&#8722;C bond distances away from the carbonyl functional group in the substrate. The site&#8208;selectivity of the chlorination protocol was further exemplified by the installing of the C&#8722;Cl bond at the distal position of one example containing two tertiary carbon centers and the late&#8208;stage functionalization of two drug molecules.

Abstract
Visible light&#8208;induced site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkylation and alkenylation of 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes with maleimides at room temperature via dual catalysis in an aqueous medium has been disclosed. This operationally simple and mild approach enables the selective formation of alkylation and alkenylation products up to 92% yield under silver&#8208;free conditions with excellent substrate scope. For the mechanistic examination, KIE, H/D labeling experiments, light on&#8208;off experiments, and quantum yield measurements were carried out. Moreover, the present approach for the alkylation and alkenylation of 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes is suitable for scalable synthesis.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Direct Synthesis of Alkyl&#8208;Substituted Phosphonodithioates from White Phosphorus (P4)</title>

Abstract
The direct synthesis of organic phosphorus compounds from white phosphorus (P4) is a longstanding challenge in organic synthesis. Here, we present a novel visible light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component functionalization reaction that integrates P4, disulfide compounds, and N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) esters to produce alkyl&#8208;substituted phosphonodithioates in a one&#8208;pot process. Using 2,4,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) as a photocatalyst, blue LEDs (456&#8197;nm) as the light source, and N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) as the reducing agent in an acetone&#8208;toluene solvent system, this method achieves moderate to good yields of structurally diverse phosphonodithioates. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, ensures complete conversion of P4, avoids chlorination, and uses inexpensive, readily available starting materials, offering potential for large&#8208;scale applications.

Abstract
Dibenzoxasilepine is an important skeleton in both synthetic organic and medicinal chemistry. Here, we have succeeded in obtaining it in higher yield than the conventional method, elucidating for the first time the rearrangement tendency of the two aromatic rings during the ring expansion reaction on the cyclic pentacoordinate silicon intermediate.

         <title>Phosphonamidates of Camphorsultam: Versatile Building Blocks for the Synthesis of P&#8208;Chiral Phosphorous(V) Compounds</title>

Abstract
Camphorsultam was utilized for the optical resolution of P&#8208;chiral phosphorous compounds. After chromatographic separation of diastereomeric RP&#8208; and SP&#8208;phosphonamidate intermediates, subsequent substitution reactions with phenol derivatives yielded P&#8208;chiral phosphonic acid aryl esters with excellent enantioselectivities. In these processes, chiral sulfonamide of camphorsultam demonstrated superior abilities as an optical&#8208;resolving agent and a good leaving group. This method was applied to the synthesis of P&#8208;chiral phosphinic esters, phosphonamidates, and thiophosphonate diesters.

Abstract
Organic synthesis has long been fascinated by phenolic compounds, especially their exploration of selectively hydroxylating arenes utilizing H2O as a hydroxyl source. However, phenols&#8242; low redox potential and strong reactivity frequently result in unwanted overoxidation byproducts. Here, we present an electrochemical strategy to overcome this difficulty by using electricity as an oxidant and facilitating the para&#8208;selective hydroxylation of N&#8208;protected anilines. This process exhibits excellent regio&#8208;selectivity, compatibility with diverse functional groups, and adaptability by handling an extensive range of substrates. Noteworthily, the technique provides a sustainable substitute for paracetamol synthesis and terminal acetylene&#8208;holding hydroxylated products, proving the suitability of this strategy for drug synthesis. Significantly, mechanistic investigations suggest the possible radical pathway and water as a hydroxyl source for this strategy.

Abstract
A variety of fluorinated 2H&#8208;chromenes and dihydroquinolines was synthesized by virtue of gem&#8208;difluoromethylene allenes as versatile coupling partners to participate in the transition metal&#8208;catalysed cascade C&#8722;H activation/[5+1] annulation of 2&#8208;alkenylphenols/anilines. This protocol features specific chemo&#8208;/regioselectivity, redox&#8208;neutral manner and good compatibility, providing a straightforward synthetic route to intriguing motifs with the equipment of attractive fluoroalkenyl moiety. The distinctive gem&#8208;difluorine effect induced an unexpected protonolysis of &#963; carbon&#8208;metal bond, thus accounting for the observed selectivity via sequential C&#8722;H activation/allene insertion/protonolysis/cyclization/&#946;&#8208;F elimination process.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrative C2&#8208;Arylation of Oxazoles, Benzoxazoles, and Benzimidazoles with Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A step&#8208;economic method for C2&#8208;arylated azoles via Pd&#8208;catalyzed denitrative arylation of nitroarenes and azoles is reported. This protocol employs synthetically upstream nitroarenes as arylating reagents and proceeds through the selective cleavage of the C&#8722;NO2 and C&#8722;H bonds. Various nitroarenes and nitroheteroarenes were coupled with oxazoles, benzoxazoles, and methylbenzimidazoles, achieving yields of up to 95%. The method's utility is exemplified by its application in the synthesis of Flunoxaprofen. This strategy reduces synthetic steps and minimizes pollution, offering substantial cost&#8208;effectiveness and environmental benefits. Furthermore, the relatively inert C&#8722;NO2 bond in nitroarenes enables late&#8208;stage functionalization or stepwise coupling reactions, providing a complementary method for C2&#8208;arylation of azoles.

         <title>Photoinduced Methylthio Radical Generation from Methylthiophosphonium Salt</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The production of methylthio radical typically relies on gaseous methanethiol or dimethyl disulfide. Herein, we present a new and straightforward method for the photogeneration of methylthio radical from methylthiophosphonium salt, enabling the synthesis of methylthiophenanthridines via charge transfer complex strategy. In this approach, the methylthiophosphonium salt acts as the electron acceptor, while 2&#8208;isocyanobiaryls serve as the electron donors. This strategy is distinguished by its simplicity in both conditions and operation, and can be extended for the generation of various alkyl(aryl)thio radicals.

Abstract
We developed a temperature&#8208;controlled intermolecular dearomative [5+1] spiroannulation and [5+2] cyclization of indoles with enynones, smoothly delivering a variety of spiroindolenines and dihydrocyclohepta[b]indolones under 40&#8201;&#176;C and 80&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. A three&#8208;step cascade reaction was also realized by using OTBS or NHBoc containing enynones in the reaction with the indole under the identical condition. And a novel valuable highly&#8208;oriented three&#8208;dimensional indole&#8208;based tetracyclic scaffold was produced in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities. Additionally, various spiroindolines and spirooxindoles were facilely produced through simple operations. This highly efficient domino&#8208;reaction represents an emblematic method for the preparation of indole&#8208;based polycycles through the intermolecular pathway.

Abstract
Conjugation of amino acids to bioactive molecules has emerged as a promising strategy for optimizing pharmacological profiles of lead candidates in drug discovery. This study describes a photocatalytic Minisci&#8208;type transfer reaction of N&#8208;acyl amino acids into various N&#8208;heterocycles. Notably, this protocol enables direct conjugation of amino acids into heterocyclic C&#8722;H bonds, eliminating the need for prefunctionalized substrates. A diverse array of N&#8208;heterocycles, amino acids, oligopeptides, and drugs were used to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach. In addition, the importance of this approach is demonstrated through its application in the DNA&#8208;encoded library chemistry. Various synthetic transformations and preliminary mechanistic investigations were also explored.

Abstract
Chloroarenes constitute fundamental building blocks in organic synthesis and are widely applied in the synthesis of bioactive compounds, fine chemicals, materials, natural products and pharmaceuticals. Electrochemical chlorination has been recognized as a promising synthetic method for accessing chloroarenes, but it has proved challenging to achieve in practice as shown by the limited number of existing protocols. Herein, we report on a highly general electrocatalytic strategy for the regioselective chlorination of various substituted heteroaryl scaffolds in an undivided cell setup, using ethyl chloroformate as the chlorine source. This strategy offers several practical advantages over existing methodologies, including an operationally simple experimental setup, exceptional functional group tolerance, and the possibility to form either the mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;chlorinated products in high selectivity depending on the choice of catalyst loading, electric current and ethyl chloroformate equivalents. The practicality and selectivity of the protocol were demonstrated by the successful chlorination of an array of densely&#8208;substituted arene frameworks as well as by the synthesis of chlorinated bioactive molecules.

Abstract
Isochromenes, oxygen&#8208;containing bicyclic compounds, have gained significant attention in organic synthesis due to their versatile reactivity and prominence in biologically active natural products. This review highlights recent developments in the synthesis of isochromenes, with a focus on efficient and selective methodologies. Traditional metal&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular ring&#8208;closure reactions have been the cornerstone for isochromene formation, but recent efforts have expanded to include new strategies that enhance functionalization and scalability. By examining key advancements in the field, this article provides a critical assessment of the current state of the art involving isochromene synthesis and its ongoing challenges.

         <title>Selective Enzymatic C&#8722;H&#8208;Oxyfunctionalization for the Efficient Synthesis of Grevillic Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
In this study, a selective C&#8722;H&#8208;oxyfunctionalization using an unspecific peroxygenase (UPO) enabled an efficient biosynthetic route for the synthesis of grevillic acid (GA), a natural antioxidant. The route commenced with the release of o&#8208;coumaric acid (oCA) from trans&#8208;2&#8208;coumaric acid glucoside (trans&#8208;CAG) using commercially available &#946;&#8208;glucosidase from almonds. In addition, a cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans photoisomerization of cis&#8208;CAG was implemented to increase the synthetic access of oCA. The key step, the para&#8208;hydroxylation relative to the existing hydroxyl group of oCA, was accomplished by an UPO with full conversion and 93% isolated yield. Despite its name, the UPO turned out to exhibit excellent regioselectivity in this C&#8722;H functionalization, requiring only H2O2 as a cosubstrate.

         <title>Bidentate NHC&#8208;Containing Ligands for Copper Catalysed Synthesis of Functionalised Diaryl Ethers</title>

Abstract
Diaryl and heteroaryl ethers are important and common motifs in drug discovery and agrochemicals. Here we present a catalytic system for the copper catalysed arylation of phenols with aryl halides. Bidentate N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands provide a well&#8208;defined catalytic system that enable low loading of copper in effective coupling reactions (0.5&#8197;mol% Cu or lower). The reaction scope of aryl iodides and aryl bromides is developed, that is tolerant of functional groups and a library of biaryl ethers with lead&#8208;like properties is prepared. The presence of excess ligand (in a 1:3 ratio) is shown to be optimal to prevent catalyst degradation, presumably by avoiding decomplexation of the ligand. This is also supported by the catalytic results obtained with pre&#8208;formed copper complexes. The kinetics of the reaction are examined and shown to be first order in copper, supportive of a well&#8208;defined catalyst species, first order in phenol and aryl iodide, and zero order in base under the developed conditions. Computational studies performed using Minnesota MN15&#8208;L parametrisation method support an oxidative addition&#8208;reductive elimination sequence with both steps having similar enegies and the reductive elimination occurring through an intimate ion pair intermediate.

         <title>Stereoconvergent Access to Z&#8208;Allylborons from E/Z&#8208;Mixed 1,3&#8208;Dienes via Cu&#8208;Guanidine Catalysis</title>

Abstract
Merging the stereoisomeric mixture of substrate into a single product through stereospecific transformation is a challenging but higher&#8208;order synthetic strategy, which perfectly meets the demand of cost control in the precise chemical production. In this work, the stereoconvergent synthesis of Z&#8208;allylic boronates was realized with protoborylation of E/Z&#8208;mixed 1,3&#8208;dienes catalyzed by a novel copper&#8208;guanidine complex. The reaction could proceed smoothly under very mild conditions with good functional group tolerance, and convert diverse aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes into the desired Z&#8208;1,4&#8208;addition products with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivities in minutes. Detailed mechanistic studies also helped to disclose the origin of stereoconvergency. Both E&#8208; and Z&#8208;diene were found directly undergoing a rapid borylation without E/Z isomerization of C=C bond, followed by a convergent formation of the same thermodynamically stable allylcopper intermediate before the slow protonation step occurred.

Abstract
A metal&#8208;free base&#8208;promoted [4+3] cycloaddition reaction of N&#8208;thioacyl imines in&#8197;situ generated from &#945;&#8208;amido sulfones with &#945;&#8208;chlorohydroxamates is described. The reaction allows the straightforward synthesis of 1,3,5&#8208;thiadiazepin&#8208;6(7H)&#8208;one derivatives in 44~90% yields. Moreover, a gram&#8208;scale reaction and a product transformation were conducted, which further increased the diversity of products.

Abstract
We describe a fluorinative ring&#8208;cleavage reaction that breaks C&#8722;C bonds in cyclic &#946;&#8208;diketones bearing an aryl moiety by using N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) in the presence of inorganic carbonates (Cs2CO3 or K2CO3) in methanol at room temperature within one hour. The generated fluorinated keto acid esters bearing ortho&#8208;nitro aryl groups were transformed into fluorinated dihydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indolones (DHPIs) via reductive cyclization using B2(OH)4 followed by amidation in the presence of K2CO3. This &#8220;cut&#8208;to&#8208;fuse&#8221; strategy enables the reconstructive synthesis of valuable fused heterocycles from relatively simple cyclohexadiones.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective One&#8208;pot Double Cascade Hybrid Formation/[3+3] Spirocyclization for the Synthesis of 3&#8208;Spiropiperidines Under Phase Transfer Conditions</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report an efficient approach to synthesizing hybrid 3&#8208;spiropiperidine heterocycles that incorporate both 3&#8208;isochromanone and 3&#8208;isoindolinone units through a one&#8208;pot, double cascade reaction facilitated by an economical K2CO3/TBAB catalytic system. By examining the nucleophilicity of the lactone 3&#8208;isochromanone, we developed a cascade reaction pathway that first generates a bi&#8208;nucleophilic hybrid intermediate, which then undergoes [3+3] spirocyclization with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The regioselectivity of the spirocyclization strongly depends on the substitution pattern of lactam ring.The process exhibits high diastereoselectivity, even with the formation of three or four stereocenters, including two contiguous tetra&#8208;substituted carbons. These sequential cascade reactions were successfully scaled up, and the subsequent reactivity was readily analyzed, enabling the transformation of existing functional groups into valuable new functionalities.

Abstract
An electrochemical cascade radical cyclization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl indoles with sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate as a coupling partner has been explored, which afforded the unexpected bis&#8208;trifluoromethylated indole[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines as products. Experimental results and DFT calculations disclose that this reaction involves trifluoromethylation&#8208;triggered cyclization and the second trifluoromethylation as the key steps. This strategy does not need any transition&#8208;metal catalysts or oxidants with a readily available trifluoromethylating reagent enabling facile synthesis of bis&#8208;trifluoromethylated indole&#8208;fused tricycles.

Abstract
Herein we present a method for base&#8208;mediated sequential annulation reaction of conjugated dienes. The method offers an efficient pathway for the effective construction of bicyclo[4.1.0]heptenes. Notable features of this approach include good yields, remarkable stereoselectivity, as well as a broad substrate scope and significant step efficiency. In addition, the reaction could be effectively scaled up to a gram scale under standard condition.

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Benzo[f]chromanes and Hydroxyalkyl Naphthols: Catalytic Coupling of Naphthols and Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Catalytic dearomatization of arenols is an uphill task that can serve as a powerful method to construct C&#8722;C bonds with unsaturated coupling partners. Herein, a simple and efficient strategy for coupling naphthols with allylic alcohols is reported. A single Ru(II) pincer catalyzed coupling of naphthols with primary allylic alcohols led to the formation of benzo(f)chromanes, whereas the use of secondary alcohols delivered the hydroxyalkyl naphthols. Broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance are demonstrated. Notably, a high diastereoselectivity is attained on chromanes. Hydroxyalkyl naphthols are synthetically transformed into spiroethers, and dearomative bromination is achieved on chromanes. Mechanistic studies revealed the involvement of tandem reactions, a formal O&#8722;H bond activation of allylic alcohols by an active catalyst via amine&#8208;amide metal&#8208;ligand cooperation provided &#945;&#8208;&#946;, unsaturated carbonyl intermediates, which further underwent 1,4 conjugate addition with dearomatized naphthols. One of the crucial intermediates, naphthyl radical, is elucidated by EPR studies and trapped using a radical scavenger. Liberated hydrogen and water molecules are the only byproducts in these transformations.

Abstract
Here, we present 3,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2,5,6&#8208;trifluorophenyl glycosides as bench&#8208;stable, and reactive electron&#8208;deficient fluoroarene based glycosyl donors that can be prepared in one&#8208;step and be activated with catalytic amounts of TMSOTf. The glycosylation reaction conditions show tolerance towards acid/base sensitive protecting groups and have a different substrate scope with 68&#8211;89% yields. The electron&#8208;deficient fluoroarene&#8208;containing glycosyl donor enables the construction of O&#8208; and C&#8208;glycosides using both free alcohols and silylated alcohols, as well as C&#8208; nucleophiles as acceptors.

         <title>Modular Chiral Bithiophene&#8208;2NO Ligands: Synthesis and Application in Asymmetric Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalysed Friedel&#8208;Crafts Alkylation</title>

Abstract
The development of privileged thiophene&#8208;type ligand remains highly desirable, owing to the high coordination ability of sulfur atom to most of the soft metals. Herein, a new class of C2&#8208;symmetric rigid chiral tertiary amine&#8208;derived dioxide ligands with a coordinating bithiophene bridge was developed in a convenient synthetic route with 25&#8211;62% overall yields. The bithiophene&#8208;2NO&#8208;palladium(II) catalyst system was generated in&#8197;situ and found to be highly capable catalyst in the asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of indoles. Excellent yields (up to 92%) and high enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99% ee) are obtained for a wide range of substrates under mild conditions. Control experiments and DFT calculations revealed the origins of the enantioselectivity. This represented the first example of chiral thiophene ligands coordinating with soft metal Pd(II) in the asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation. Experiments revealed that the counteranion is involved in the stereoselectivity&#8208;determining step in this soft palladium(II) catalysis, and the additional NO and thiophene in ligands can act as the second chelation site and thus reduce the amount of free metal ions for suppressing background reaction in the catalytic system.

Abstract
We describe a selective preparation of a variety of functionalized pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;c]tetrahydroquinolines and indolo[3,2&#8208;c]tetrahydroquinolines in 40&#8211;82% and 40&#8211;80% yields from alkynyl&#8208;tethered oximes with diaryliodonium triflates, respectively. The one&#8208;pot reaction underwent N&#8208;arylation, intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition, selective [1.3] or [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement of N&#8722;O bond in total three steps. Experimental studies revealed that EtOAc solvent and copper(II)&#8208;catalyst played crucial roles on the formation of these two tetrahydroquinoline scaffolds. Moreover, these two tetrahydroquinoline scaffolds could be converted into various tetrahydroquinoline building blocks by further transformations.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Tandem Cycloisomerization/Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction of 1,7&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed methodology for regioselective cycloisomerization and tandem Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of 1,7&#8208;enynes has been described, enabling the synthesis of diverse polycyclic heterocycles with four stereocenters. This stereoselective protocol demonstrates compatibility with various substituted enynes and alkenes, yielding products in 46&#8211;90% yield while tolerating a wide range of functional groups, including esters, ketones, and halides. Notably, the reaction with naphthoquinones retains the moiety in the final product, which acts as essential core structures in various natural products and bioactive compounds.

         <title>Raney Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Deuterium Labeling of Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Heterocycles and Pharmaceuticals under Continuous Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deuterium&#8208;labeled compounds play a pivotal role in physical organic chemistry, life sciences, and materials science. This has resulted in a surge of interest in deuterium&#8208;labeled active pharmaceutical ingredients in recent years. In this study, we present a continuous flow Raney nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange process that boasts compatibility with a wide spectrum of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles and pharmaceutical compounds. The broad applicability of the developed method was demonstrated through successful labeling of various purine bases, imidazoles, pyridines, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including complex structures like abacavir and remdesivir. Control experiments revealed Raney nickel's crucial role in the exchange process, showcasing the superiority of the continuous flow approach over batch reactions. Furthermore, a scaled&#8208;up experiment demonstrated the robustness of the catalyst.</dc:description>
