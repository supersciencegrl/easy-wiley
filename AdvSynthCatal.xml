      <title>Benzylpalladium Intermediates: Unique and Versatile Reactive Intermediates for Aromatic Functionalization</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract: Aromatic functionalizations are of current interest and importance in organic chemistry, recent transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reactions can transform inert C&#8211;H bond into C&#8211;X (X = C, O, N, etc.) bonds, greatly enriching aromatic chemistry and related fields. Some well known palladium&#8211;containing intermediates such as palladacycles and allylpalladium intermediates play an important role in organic conversions. Similar with allyl group, benzyl group also possesses the capability of stabilizing palladium through &#951;3&#8208;binding. In the process of the formation of benzyl palladium intermediate, there is a transition state of dearomatization. Therefore, it is a challenging and meaningful research topic to seize these aromatic destruction intermediates, realize selective functionalization reaction on 	aromatic ring via them, and inhibit the formation of traditional benzylated products. Herein, we summarized the recent efforts on expanding the synthetic utility, as well as exploring the mechanism in aromatic functionalization via reactive benzyl palladium intermediates. We envision that the transformation via benzyl palladium intermediates will help promote the development in the &#64257;eld of palladium&#8211;catalyzed aromatic regioselective functionalization.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The trifluoromethyl (CF3) group is an advantageous structural motif in various biologically active molecules as well as materials, which is depicted by steadily increasing demand from the industries involved in drug discovery, agrochemicals and material development. &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethyl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds  constitute a very efficient building blocks as starting material in the synthesis of fluorinated molecules.

      <title>Tandem Annulations of Propargylic Alcohols to Indole Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>Indole derivatives are important heterocycles in organic synthesis for serving as privileged building blocks for functional material and as key components in a lot of bioactive compounds. Propargylic alcohols, bearing alkynyl and hydroxyl functional groups, have emerged as promising feedstock materials for the construction of carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. Especially, in the last decade, the Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acid catalysed tandem annulations of propargylic alcohols to build structurally diverse indole derivatives have been well&#8208;investigated. In this review, we summarize two main synthetic strategies toward indole derivatives via the cascade reactions of propargylic alcohols: indole&#8208;ring formation involved tandem reactions and the direct function&#8208;alization of indole skeletons. We hope this review would help to develop new and more efficient protocols for the synthesis of indole&#8208;included N&#8208;heterocycles.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Polychloromethylation Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Molecules with di&#8208; or trichloromethyl group are widely existed in natural products and man&#8208;made structures that represent special activities in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Besides, polychloromethyl&#8208;containing compounds are also high valuable intermediates in organic synthesis and also can be used as functional materials. Therefore, significant efforts have been made toward the incorporation of polychloromethyl groups into certain structures. In this field, a variety of polychloromethyl reagents, such as CH2Cl2, HCCl3, CCl4, TMSCCl3, TMSCCl2H, etc. have been utilized as the di&#8208; or trichloromethyl sources toward polychloromethylated structures through radical, nucleophilic, and other reaction patterns. 
In this review, we summarized and discussed the recent achievements in the synthesis of polychloromethylated compounds, mainly focused on the employment of different polychloromethyl reagents. Most of the works we investigated were reported after 2010. Mechanism discussions and outlooks were also given.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of C2&#8208;Functionalized Pyridines and Quinolines Using &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Oxide Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>While remarkable progress has recently been made for the direct C&#8208;H&#8208;functionalization of azines, its application is still limited by a lack of accessible functional groups (primarily carbon&#8208;based) and poor regioselectivity. In contrast, C2&#8208;functionalized pyridines and quinolines can be easily synthesized by treating readily available N&#8208;oxides with various reagents under appropriate activation conditions. This review seeks to comprehensively document the available synthetic methods for introducing functional groups at the C2 position of pyridines and quinolines. In this work, we highlight recent developments in the C2&#8208;functionalization of pyridine and quinoline N&#8208;oxides and address both the mechanisms and regioselectivity of the reactions. We also describe the pathways and reactive species involved in these processes and highlight a number of medically relevant nitrogen heteroaromatics.</dc:description>

      <title>Cyclization of Vinylketene Dithioacetals: A Synthetic Strategy for Substituted Thiophenes</title>
      <dc:description>A synthetic strategy for the synthesis of substituted thiophenes is described by the one&#8208;pot reaction of indoles with ketene dithioacetals under mild reaction conditions. Promoted by triflic acid (TfOH), the reaction of indoles with the easily available &#945;&#8208;acetyl ketene dithioacetals resulted in the formation of vinylketene dithioacetals via condensation instead of the well known nucleophilic addition&#8208;alkylthio elimination process. In the presence of CuBr2, vinylketene dithioacetals can cyclize into the corresponding substituted thiophenes. This transformation may benefit from the acidic reaction conditions and the steric effects of the 2&#8208;substituted indoles.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A facile and enantioselective approach to lactone&#8208;fused chromanone derivatives from 1&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyaryl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;diketones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes under mild conditions has been developed, which included organocatalytic stepwise Michael addition/ cycloketalization/hemiacetalization and followed by oxidation reaction. In the presence of chiral amine organocatalyst and an additional salicylic acid, a wide range of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyaryl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;diketones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes were tolerated, furnishing a spectrum of lactone&#8208;fused tricyclic chromanones bearing three contiguous stereocenters in high yields with good to excellent selectivities (90&#8208;&amp;gt;99% ee, &amp;gt;19:1 d.r.).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>Gold&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cross&#8208;coupling reactions of two distinct arenes with one gold carbene furnish triarylmethane products. Notably, competitive homo&#8208;coupling reactions are efficiently suppressed with a phosphoric acid as co&#8208;catalyst (10 mol %) in THF.

      <title>N&#8211;N Bond Formation using an Iodonitrene as an Umpolung of Ammonia: Straightforward and Chemoselective Synthesis of Hydrazinium Salts</title>
      <dc:description>The formation of hydrazinium salts by N&#8208;N bond formation has typically involved the use of hazardous and difficult to handle reagents. Here, novel, mild and operationally simple conditions for the synthesis of hydrazinium salts are reported. Electrophilic nitrogen transfer to the nitrogen atom of tertiary amines, is achieved using iodosylbenzene as oxidant and ammonium carbamate as the N&#8208;source. The resulting process is highly chemoselective and tolerant to other functional groups. A wide scope is reported, including examples with bioactive molecules.

The front cover picture, provided by Dudding, Metallinos and co&#8208;workers, illustrates that N&#8208;propargyl derivatives of L&#8208;proline hydantoin participate in reactions that can be driven in several directions (even in reverse!). For example, opposite enantiomers of alkylated propargyl products can be prepared from epimeric starting materials that are geared to give a reversal in stereochemistry. Reactions can also be driven to give axial chiral allenes with selectable stereochemistry at a distal benzylic alcohol by shifting the reaction conditions. Choose the right gear to select your product! Details of this work can be found in the full paper on pages xxxx&#8211;xxxx (M. L. Sechi, M. Andrade, H. Foy, M. Pilkington, T. Dudding, C.

      <title>Optimization of Catalyst Structure for Asymmetric Propargylation of Aldehydes with Allenyltrichlorosilane</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. The design of catalysts for asymmetric propargylations remains a challenging task, with only a handful of methods providing access to enantioenriched homopropargylic alcohols. In this work, guided by previously reported computational predictions, a set of atropisomeric bipyridine N,N&#8217;&#8208;dioxides was tested as Lewis base catalysts for the asymmetric propargylation of aldehydes with trichloroallenylsilane. The catalysts are easily prepared in four simple steps starting from readily available methyl ketones. Aryl&#8208;substituted derivatives proved to be highly active and showed a high level of enantiocontrol even at 1 mol% loading. The reaction scope includes a wide range of aromatic, heteroaromatic and unsaturated aldehydes. New computations confirm that the key stereodetermining transition state structures for the synthesized catalysts are similar to those previously reported for the model structure.</dc:description>

      <title>Asymmetric Fluorination Reactions Promoted by Chiral Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Based Organocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Fluorinated compounds can exhibit interesting biological properties. The importance of these species has made that the chemistry of fluorine has experienced a great development. On this review, the recent advances on asymmetric fluorination reactions promoted by chiral hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;based organocatalysts are discussed. Hence, examples using phosphoric acid, carboxylic acid, (thio)urea and squaramide derivatives are illustrated. The growth of this field is amazing. We have only considered pivotal works in which direct fluorination takes place using a fluorinating agent, leaving aside the reactions where a fluorine atom is incorporated from the beginning as part of other reactants.
Herein, the scarce existing examples on this field of research have been compiled</dc:description>

The importance of these species has made that the chemistry of fluorine has experienced a great development. On this review, the recent advances on asymmetric fluorination reactions promoted by chiral hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;based organocatalysts are discussed. Hence, examples using phosphoric acid, carboxylic acid, (thio)urea and squaramide derivatives are illustrated. The growth of this field is amazing. We have only considered pivotal works in which direct fluorination takes place using a fluorinating agent, leaving aside the reactions where a fluorine atom is incorporated from the beginning as part of other reactants.
Herein, the scarce existing examples on this field of research have been compiled&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Recent Advancements on Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed, Chelation&#8208;Induced &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Hydroxylation of Arenes</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract: The phenols are key intermediates as well as desired products in many target oriented syntheses. The conversion of C&#8208;H bond to C&#8208;O bond is one of the most challenging tasks in organic synthesis. In last few decades, the hydroxylation of aromatic compounds has drawn a considerable attention because of their importance in Pharmaceutical industry, material chemistry, polymers and in agrochemicals. Indeed, transition metal catalysed coordination assisted regio&#8208; and chemoselective ortho&#8208;hydroxylation of arenes has become very efficient and popular strategy to obtain good yields of phenols with tolerance of a wide range of functional groups. This review is the comprehensive summary of recent advancement on Pd, Ru, Rh, Cu and Ir catalyzed chelation controlled regioselective ortho&#8208;C&#8208;H bond hydroxylation of aromatic compounds in presence of diverse hydroxylating agents. The Review has been classified on the sources of hydroxylating agents used in reaction.

      <title>Emerging Nickel Catalysis in Heck Reactions: Recent Developments</title>
      <dc:description>The synthetic application of nickel catalysts in Heck&#8208;coupling reaction is quite prominent and noticeable of late in organic synthesis. It shows great interest over the other transition metal catalysts due to its unique characteristic that prepares them more significantly applicable in different fields of synthetic application. The usefulness of nickel&#8208;catalysts relies in the fact that they are abundant in nature, relatively less precious and environment friendly. Nickel plays pivotal role in different kind of Heck reactions known such as intramolecular&#8208;, intermolecular&#8208;, reductive&#8208;Heck type reaction producing mainly carbocycles and hetero cycles of biological significance. Carbocyclization or hetero&#8208;cyclization reaction occurred under optimized reaction conditions developed and come up with the formation of various structural building blocks of naturally occurring compounds. Via reductive Heck cyclization large membered ring of carbo&#8208; or hetero&#8208;cyclic system was formed which performed key role as building blocks in pharmaceutical synthesis and bioactive molecule formation. Intermolecular Heck type reactions were comparatively more explored. Silyl&#8208;Heck, carbonyl&#8208;Heck, and other miscellaneous type reactions were covered up through nickel&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular Heck reaction. Asymmetric versions of Heck&#8208; coupling reactions are also reported to proceed even with unactivated alkenes, offering molecules having quaternary stereogenic center in a regio&#8208; and enantioselective manner.

      <dc:description>Abstract. A catalytic asymmetric C3&#8208;indolylation of N&#8208;protected spiro&#8208;epoxyoxindoles has been developed for the access of 3&#8208;(3&#8208;indolyl)&#8208;oxindole methanols with excellent enantioselectivity (ee up to &gt;99%).

The detailed mechanistic study endorses that the feedback inhibition played a key role which restricts the DKR process.

      <title>Recent Advances in Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Fluorinated &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
      <dc:description>Enantioenriched fluorinated &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;amino acids are often encountered in numerous pharmaceuticals and bioactive molecules, and also of great importance as probes in PET and NMR for studying the behavior of enzymes and for incorporation into peptides and drug candidates.

The past decade has witnessed considerable progress in the catalytic enantioselective construction of chiral fluorinated &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives with structural diversity. In this review, we summarize these impressive achievements according to the bond&#8208;forming way of fluorinated &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;amino acids, respectively, and underline the remaining challenges.

      <title>Propargylic Alcohols as Coupling Partners in Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Arene C&#8208;H Activation</title>
      <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed site selective arene C&#8208;H bond activation concomitant functionalization with various coupling partners gain magnificent attraction in synthetic organic chemistry as complementary to traditional transformations. Mechanistically, these C&#8208;H functionalization approaches involve directing group assisted concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation (CMD), migratory insertion, and reductive elimination sequences. In this realm, diverse categories of coupling partners were employed as C&#8208;H functionalization buddies. Particularly alkynes gain enormous  attention as annulating agents. These units coordinates with metalcycle through &#7467;&#8208;interaction produce annulation outcomes in a straightforward manner.
Very recently, propargylic alcohols were appointed as valuable archetypes in arene C&#8208;H activation armoury, as they have shown regio&#8208; and chemoselective migratory insertion into primary metalcycle species via hydroxy chelation. The influential regioselectivity was drawn by dual coordination of metal complexes with the pendent directing group and a propargylic hydroxyl group. In this review, we focused on annulations and functionalization of arenes and propargylic alcohols, which afford intricate cycles as well as complex acyclic motifs in a trouble&#8208;free manner. We categorized these transformations based on number of atoms  of propargylic alcohols involved in annulation along with some addition reactions. We anticipate to pave a way towards enhanced endeavours for discovering novel reaction avenues.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
The front cover picture, designed by three groups from Hokkaido (Japan: ramanus rose), Ibaraki (Japan: plum), and Ubon Ratchathani (Thailand: lotus) illustrates the enantioselective transfer hydrogenation reactions of ketones with formic acid under iridium catalysis. Rationally designed prolinol&#8208;phosphine chiral ligands are highly effective for the hydrogenation of ketones including tert&#8208;alkylaryl ketones in up to 99% yield and with up to 99.8%&#160;ee. DFT calculations showed non&#8208;covalent interactions including&#160;O&#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O/sp3&#8208;C&#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O two&#8208;point hydrogen&#8208;bonding and C&#8211;H/&#960; interactions.

     alt="Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Transfer Hydrogenation of Ketones Controlled by Alcohol Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding and sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H Noncovalent Interactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;front cover picture&lt;/b&gt;, designed by three groups from Hokkaido (Japan: ramanus rose), Ibaraki (Japan: plum), and Ubon Ratchathani (Thailand: lotus) illustrates the enantioselective transfer hydrogenation reactions of ketones with formic acid under iridium catalysis. Rationally designed prolinol&#8208;phosphine chiral ligands are highly effective for the hydrogenation of ketones including &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;alkylaryl ketones in up to 99% yield and with up to 99.8%&#160;&lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;. DFT calculations showed non&#8208;covalent interactions including&#160;O&#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O/&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;

      <title>Stereospecific Synthesis of Glycoside Mimics Through Migita&#8211;Kosugi&#8211;Stille Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of Chemically and Configurationally Stable 1&#8208;C&#8208;Tributylstannyl Iminosugars</title>
      <dc:description>A process for the de novo synthesis of imino&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides is described. The methodology is based on the reaction of 1&#8208;C&#8208;stannylated iminosugars with various electrophiles under the conditions of Migita&#8211;Kosugi&#8211;Stille cross&#8208;couplings, which gives 1&#8208;C&#8208;substituted iminosugar derivatives in a stereoretentive process. The required iminoglycosyl stannanes are obtained by way of the highly stereoselective addition of tributylstannyllithium to (SR)&#8208; or (SS)&#8208;N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl glycosylamines, followed by an activation cyclization sequence.	Most interestingly, the methodology is tunable: the configuration of the tin adduct is controlled exclusively by the tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl auxiliary, thus giving access after ring formation to &#8216;&#945;&#8217;&#8208;configured or &#8216;&#946;&#8217;&#8208;configured iminoglycosyl stannanes. With the subsequent stereoretentive C&#8210;C bond&#8208;forming process, the methodology allows the synthesis of pseudo anomers of imino&#8208;C&#8208;glycosyl compounds in a controlled fashion.</dc:description>

      <title>Boryl Radicals&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Activation of Inactivated Alkanes for the Synthesis of Internal Alkynes</title>
      <dc:description>An intriguing pyridine&#8722;boryl radical&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H alkynylation reaction of inactivated alkanes was described. The reaction features mild operation condition and wide substrate scope, and affords the corresponding products in moderate to good yields. Notably, The presence of 4&#8208;cyanopyride N&#8208;oxide was key to the success of the reaction. Cyclohexane are more easily to be functionalized in this reaction than toluene, which could be rationally explained by polarity&#8208;match principle.</dc:description>

      <title>A Strategy for Accessing Aldehydes via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;O/C&#8208;N Bond Cleavage in the Presence of Hydrosilanes</title>
      <dc:description>We report the catalytic reduction of both active esters and amides by selective C(acyl)&#8211;X (X = O, N) cleavage to access aldehyde functionality via a palladium&#8208;catalyzed strategy. Reactions are promoted by hydrosilanes as reducing reagents with good to excellent yields and with excellent chemoselectivity for C(acyl)&#8211;N and C(acyl)&#8211;O bond cleavage. Carboxylic acid C(acyl)&#8211;O bonds are activated by 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;4,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (CDMT) to form triazine ester intermediates, which further react with hydrosilanes to yield aldehydes in one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step procedures. We demonstrate that C(acyl)&#8211;O cleavage/formylation offers higher yields and broader substrate scopes compared with C(acyl)&#8211;N cleavage under the same reaction conditions.</dc:description>
