         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Cyclization Reaction for Synthesis of 3&#8208;Amino&#8208;2,3&#8208;Dihydrobenzofuran Derivatives from 2&#8208;Carboxymethoxybenzaldehydes and Aryl Amines</title>

A novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven iron&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative cyclization reaction of 2&#8208;carboxymethoxybenzaldehyde and aryl amines under mild conditions is developed. This highly efficient transformation enables the quick construction of various substituted 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran derivatives in one&#8208;pot operation with good to excellent yields as well as broad functional group tolerance and will provide versatile short approaches to motifs and/or analogues of numerous medicinally interesting 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran natural products. Preliminary mechanistic investigations show that iron catalyst can readily realize decarboxylation of alkyl carboxylic acids to alkyl radicals through a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven protocol, thus leading to one&#8208;pot decarboxylation and cyclization cascade reactions.

         <dc:description>
Visible light and hypervalent iodine&#8208;induced dual synthetic approach for carboaminated naphthoquinones has been developed via C(sp2)&#63743;H difunctionalization.

A dual synthetic approach of three&#8208;component carboamination reactions has been developed in the presence of visible&#8208;light photocatalysis as well as hypervalent iodine(III) reagent to afford the C(sp2)&#63743;H difunctionalization. The main keynote of our approaches is metal&#8208;free, base&#8208;free, mild reaction conditions, room temperature synthesis with high yields, and broad substrate scope. Apart from this, the protocols described herein are also helpful for constructing and transforming complex molecules.

         <title>Multiphoton Multicomponent Reactions: Discovery of the 2&#8208;Photon Ketene 4&#8208;Component Reaction (2P&#8208;K&#8208;4CR)</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 13, July 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent reactions triggered by multiple photons: complex heterocycles can be synthesized in a regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner via a double photoactivation using visible light from simple building blocks, exploiting the combination of ketene 3&#8208;component reaction and Patern&#242;&#8211;B&#252;chi cycloaddition.

Herein, the first multiphoton, multicomponent approach for synthesizing highly functionalized oxetanes using diazoketones, isocyanides, silanols (or carboxylic acids), and 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives (benzils) is presented as starting materials. Blue light irradiation initiates the Wolff rearrangement of diazoketones, generating ketenes that promptly react with isocyanides and silanols (or carboxylic acids) to afford captodative olefins. Concurrently, excitation of benzils promotes a [2&#8201;+&#8201;2] photocycloaddition between the activated carbonyl group and the captodative olefin. This newly developed two&#8208;photon ketene four&#8208;component reaction has been thoroughly investigated, also through chemometric analysis, including its substrates scope and the extension to mixed benzils. Furthermore, the observed stereochemical outcomes, validated by X&#8208;Ray diffraction analysis, are elucidated through detailed computational studies, providing insights into the underlying reaction mechanism.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Promoted Esterification of Carboxylic Acids via Photoacid Generation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 13, July 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel, environmentally friendly photochemical method for the esterification of carboxylic acids with alcohols using arylazo sulfones as photoacid generators was developed. This approach avoids traditional acidic catalysts, purification did not require chromatography and the method proved effective under continuous flow conditions for enhanced productivity.

The ester functionality is ubiquitously found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and perfumes. Among the various methods of ester synthesis, the acid&#8208;catalyzed coupling of carboxylic acids with alcohols is the most common approach. Herein, a mild photochemical method is introduced, leveraging a photoacid generation approach utilizing an arylazo sulfone as the sulfonic acid precursor. A broad substrate scope of carboxylic acids or alcohols is reported, while a continuous flow process has been also implemented.

Abstract
3&#8208;Pyrrolines are important nitrogen&#8208;containing five&#8208;membered heterocycles. In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing synthetic methods for 3&#8208;pyrrolines, including direct and efficient strategy for the 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of conjugated dienes. However, most existing approaches typically require pre&#8208;activated nitrogen sources (nitrene precursor or imine) or rely on intramolecular reactions to enhance reactivity, enabling the construction of 3&#8208;pyrrolines. The synthesis of 3&#8208;pyrrolines via intermolecular reactions without using pre&#8208;activated nitrogen sources remains a challenging task. In this study, we present an intermolecular 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of conjugated dienes for the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;disubstituted 3&#8208;pyrrolines, using a tosylamide (NH2Ts) as the nitrogen source. The reaction was facilitated through the cooperation of palladium(II), copper(I) and iodide. The resulting 3&#8208;pyrrolines can be readily converted into various pyrroles and pyrrolidines through simple transformations.

&lt;p&gt;3-Pyrrolines are important nitrogen-containing five-membered heterocycles. In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing synthetic methods for 3-pyrrolines, including direct and efficient strategy for the 1,4-difunctionalization of conjugated dienes. However, most existing approaches typically require pre-activated nitrogen sources (nitrene precursor or imine) or rely on intramolecular reactions to enhance reactivity, enabling the construction of 3-pyrrolines. The synthesis of 3-pyrrolines via intermolecular reactions without using pre-activated nitrogen sources remains a challenging task. In this study, we present an intermolecular 1,4-difunctionalization of conjugated dienes for the synthesis of 3,4-disubstituted 3-pyrrolines, using a tosylamide (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ts) as the nitrogen source.

Abstract
Herein we present a novel one&#8208;pot methodology for the synthesis of enantioenriched 2H&#8208;pyrrolespirosuccinimides by copper&#8208;catalyzed reactions on Ugi adducts derived from enantiopure &#945;&#8208;alkylbenzyl amines through a chirality transfer process. We have proposed a mechanism, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, where a hydrogen radical&#8208;shuttle (HRS) process explains the chemical and stereochemical results. This work demonstrates the efficient stereoselective synthesis of structurally unique, highly functionalized nitrogen heterocyclic systems using simple protocols and affordable starting materials.

Abstract
Herein, we present the first light&#8208;mediated, diastereoselective de novo synthesis for 2,3&#8208;substituted indolines, a privileged scaffold in pharmaceuticals. The protocol was tested with various aryl and alkyl groups, maintaining high yields up to 85% across different substituents. The approach was further extended to enantioselective synthesis, yielding trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;substituted indolines with high enantiomeric excesses (94%&#8208;96%&#8197;ee). Drawbacks resulting from low efficiencies for nucleophilic radicals in previous studies were addressed by a polarity reversal strategy, incorporating electron&#8208;withdrawing groups to improve the efficiency of the initial radical addition. Finally, the methodology was utilized for the synthesis of azaindolines, a highly valuable target in pharmaceutical research. Our approach now encompasses modifications to the aromatic backbone, the use of both nucleophilic and electrophilic radicals as coupling partners, the synthesis of indolines, azaindolines, and tetrahydroquinolines, variation of protecting groups, and the diastereoselective synthesis of 2,3&#8208;substituted indolines.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling Reaction of Diazo Reagent with Formamide for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Formyloxy Ketones and &#945;&#8208;Ketoamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 13, July 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct coupling reaction of diazo reagent with formamide has been developed to construct &#945;&#8208;formyloxy ketones and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides in moderate to excellent yields with a broad substrate scope. The synthetic protocol features mild reaction conditions and simple operation under air, which can enable the installation of aldehyde and amine group into the target molecule via C&#63743;N bond cleavage.

A copper&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction of diazo reagents with formamides is reported. Under the optimal reaction conditions, this reaction leads to a wide range of &#945;&#8208;formyloxy ketones and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides in moderate to good yields. This strategy enables the installation of two important functional groups, aldehyde and amine group, into the target molecule in the presence of formamide via C&#63743;N bond cleavage. Mechanism studies indicate that this conversion reaction may undergo a radical process.

         <title>Dual Photoredox/Cu&#8208;Catalysis Enables Diastereoselective Synthesis of 3&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Ethynyltropanes via Decarboxylative Alkynylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 13, July 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative alkynylation of tropanes is developed. This approach works under mild conditions and selectively produces a range of 3&#8208;&#946;&#8208;alkynylated tropanes. Moreover, it provides a versatile and convergent platform for further functionalization of the triple bond.

An efficient decarboxylative alkynylation of a tropane redox&#8208;active ester with terminal alkynes is described, yielding ethynyltropanes with exclusive &#946;&#8208;configuration. This cost&#8208;effective process utilizes mild, nontoxic copper&#8208;catalyzed, photoinduced reaction conditions. Beyond introducing a novel pathway for the catalytic alkynylation of nortropanes, this method offers a versatile and convergent approach for synthesizing complex nortropane derivatives through further functionalization of the triple bond, including reductions, and inverse demand Diels&#8211;Alder reactions.

Abstract
Photo&#8208;induced radical silylation cyclization of N&#8208;propargylindoles/(3&#8208;phenoxyprop&#8208;1&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzenes with silylboronates or tris(trimethylsilyl)silane was finished, which gave diverse silylated fused cycles. This cascade system featured simple/mild conditions, and good substrate scopes/yields. Meanwhile, a range of scaled&#8208;up experiments, preparation of one silylated active molecule, and mechanistic exploration were performed to examine the application and reaction process.

         <title>Impact of the Substitution Pattern in N&#8211;heterocyclic Olefin&#8208;Substituted Phosphines on Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 13, July 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of olefin backbone substitution in N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin&#8208;substituted phosphines is investigated. While these ligands are highly electron&#8208;donating, their catalytic activity in Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions decreases as the size of the backbone substituent increases. Stoichiometric reactions reveal unfavorable side reactions that reduce steric congestion, explaining the observed differences in catalytic activities.

In recent years, N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) have been recognized for their strong electron&#8208;donating properties. These properties have been utilized in the design of phosphine ligands (NHOPs) to enhance the electron density in palladium complexes, thereby promoting palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. In this study, the impact of the substituent in the olefin backbone was investigated. NHOP ligands with methyl and phenyl moieties have been prepared and their catalytic performance compared with the hydrogen&#8208;substituted analogs. The increased ligand bulk in the backbone results in a reduced catalytic activity in selected Pd&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig aminations. The unfavorable steric profile, as revealed by the crystal structures of the ligands and the observation of various decomposition products, is proposed as the reason for the diminished activity.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of 2,5&#8208;Disubstituted Furans through a C&#63742;C Double Bond Cleavage Radical Cascade</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 13, July 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic cyclization of two enaminone molecules is conducted to 2,5&#8208;disubstituted furans from a C&#63742;C double bond cleavage radical cascade under exogenous oxidation and transition metal free, mild, and practical conditions. The desired products are produced with the leaving of DMF and dimethylamine.

An electrochemically oxidative cyclization between two molecules of enaminones to give 2,5&#8208;disubstituted furans had been established through the leaving of DMF and dimethylamine under mild and practical reaction conditions. Attributing to the electrolysis process, the exogenous oxidation and transition metal are avoided. Moreover, this electrosynthesis is highlighted by good yields obtained, good functional group compatibility and high step economy. In addition, based on the intermediate monitoring, intermediate verification, radical&#8208;trapping, and cyclic voltammetry experiments, a possible mechanism is proposed.

The unconventional annulations between pent&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones and vinyl diketones has been achieved to afford bicyclo[3.2.1]octanediones in high yields, which are ubiquitous in bioactive substances but are challenging to synthesize using traditional methods

The bicyclo[3.2.1]octanone and bicyclo[3.2.1]octanedione scaffolds, along with their derivatives, are ubiquitous in natural products and synthetic pharmaceuticals. However, the synthetic routes to access these scaffolds have been relatively underdeveloped. Herein, this study introduces a unique reaction between pent&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones and vinyl diketones, which serves as a versatile platform for the efficient synthesis of a wide array of bicyclo[3.2.1]octanediones in good to excellent yields. Furthermore, this study method facilitates diverse downstream transformations of these products, underscoring the versatility and potential of diketone&#8208;based chemistry in constructing complex molecules.

         <title>Synergistic Visible Light Nanophotocatalysis and Asymmetric Organocatalysis for the Stereoselective &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Aldehydes</title>

         <dc:description>
An unprecedent dual catalytic nanophotocatalytic and asymmetric organocatalytic system for the &#945;&#8208;functionalization of aldehydes is developed using carbon nanodots as photosensitizers. The optimized methodology yields the alkylated products with up to 94% yield and up to 98:2 e.r., evidencing the possible recycling of the nanocatalysts. This procedure can serve as pivotal starting point for the use of carbon dots in asymmetric photocatalysis.

Carbon dots (CDs) are privileged carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials which they have been extensively studied in recent years in catalysis. In fact, their peculiar photoluminescence features have found applications in nanophotocatalysis as well as bioimaging and sensing. Nevertheless, their application as nanophotoredox catalysts in stereoselective transformations is still unexplored. Herein, this study reports the combination of carbon dots as nanophotocatalysts and asymmetric organocatalysis for the stereoselective &#945;&#8208;functionalization of aldehydes. Employing various bromo&#8208;derivatives as alkylating agents, it achieves the corresponding enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;alkylated derivatives with excellent yields (up to 94%) and enantioselectivities (up to 98:2 e.r.). With a series of control experiments, cyclic voltammetry and fluorescence quenching studies, it is possible to postulate a synergistic dual catalytic cycle that involves a photo&#8208;oxidative quenching of the excited stated of CDs paired with an enamine activation promoted by the MacMillan organocatalyst followed by radical alkylation. This study successfully demonstrates that carbon dots can efficiently replace metal&#8208;based photocatalysts, promoting photoredox catalytic stereoselective transformations even at low concentrations (down to 0.1&#8201;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1), paving the way to more sustainable and possibly recyclable catalytic systems.

Abstract
A novel, metal&#8208;free, air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;compatible one&#8208;pot tandem protocol for the regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of Z&#8208;vinyl sulfides (achieving yields up to 99%), is reported. This straightforward and efficient process combines the selective hydroiodination of internal alkynes, promoted by the eutectic mixture choline iodide (ChI)/p&#8208;TsOH (1:1) under mild, bench&#8208;type conditions (without the need for toxic molecular HI), with a subsequent sulfenylation step of the in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated vinyl iodides.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel, metal-free, air- and moisture-compatible one-pot tandem protocol for the regio- and stereoselective synthesis of &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-vinyl sulfides (achieving yields up to 99%), is reported. This straightforward and efficient process combines the selective hydroiodination of internal alkynes, promoted by the eutectic mixture choline iodide (&lt;i&gt;ChI&lt;/i&gt;)/&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-TsOH (1:1) under mild, bench-type conditions (without the need for toxic molecular HI), with a subsequent sulfenylation step of the &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ-&lt;/i&gt;generated vinyl iodides. This final step is compatible with aromatic, heteroaromatic and aliphatic thiols. Notably, the methodology addresses a longstanding challenge by enabling the selective formation of Markovnikov products with &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-configuration in the thiolation of secondary propiolamides. It also avoids volatile organic solvents and is easily scalable to gram quantities, offering significant advantages for synthetic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A solid&#8208;state Pd/Cu co&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling facilitated by electromagnetic milling (EMM) was realized without solvent or additional heating. This strategy exhibited excellent substitutions tolerance and a wide substrate scope. The physical parameters were investigated, which proved both of magnetic field strength and frequency to be positive correlation to yields. Meanwhile, the suitable size of the grinding medium is key to the transformation. The coordination between copper, palladium and ligands were investigated by mass measurement and 31P NMR, proving that CuI, PPh3, and DABCO coordinated in a 1:1:1 ratio under EMM, and DABCO could efficiently inhibit the homocoupling by&#8208;product from alkyne. The active catalyst complex for the Sonogashira coupling reaction in EMM is generated in&#8197;situ. The EMM system offers a straightforward method for Sonogashira coupling and demonstrates significant potential for practical applications.

         <title>Titanium Catalyzed the Cross&#8208;Coupling of Nitriles and Alkyl Halides for the Synthesis of Ketones</title>

Abstract
Here, a titanium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl halides with nitriles under mild reaction conditions for the synthesis of ketones is reported. This reaction is applicable in benzyl halides, allyl halides, which are inactive substrates in the past reports, as well as non&#8208;activated alkyl halides. Mechanistic studies have suggested that Ti(III) acts both as a carbon radical initiator and a cyanoactivator. The gram&#8208;scale and derivatisation experiments also further demonstrate the potential application of the methodology.

Abstract
Fluorene derivatives have obtained broad interest in organic synthesis, materials chemistry, and pharmaceutical fields due to their unique structure, physical, chemical and photoelectric properties. Moreover, the bare fluorene molecule has a variety of reactive sites that provides the transformations to synthesize various functionalized intermediates, polymers and macrocycles. Recently, C&#8722;C bond formation is one of useful tool in fluorene molecule modifications due to the low toxicity and high efficiency. This review covers the synthesis of various fluorene&#8208;based small molecules, fluorene&#8208;based polymers, fluorene&#8208;based conjugated materials and fluorene&#8208;based nanogrids via the C&#8722;C bond formation at the 9&#8208;position of fluorene derivatives. Transition&#8208;metal catalysis and metal&#8208;free methods to synthesize different fluorene derivatives are highlighted.

         <title>Carboxylic acids as enabling directing groups in C&#8722;H activation and functionalization: A decade review</title>

Abstract
Over the last decade, carboxylic acids have drawn profound interest in synthetic chemistry, due to its exceptional adaptability as traceless directing groups (TDGs) in the construction of complex organic molecules in the realm of C&#8722;H activation. The chameleonic nature of such privileged functionality startles each time in portraying its diversity by either trace elimination of acid group or by inherent annulation which makes an aura of distinction from other conventional DGs. In this review, the recent developments of carboxylic acid as a directing group (DG) are emphasized from the year 2017 with apparent late&#8208;stage applications. In view of synthetic chemistry context and substrate scope, innovative avenues are addressed along with multiple approaches in utilising carboxylic acids as efficient DGs.

Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;thiocarboxylic acids featuring C&#8211;S chirality are valuable targets in organic synthesis. This review outlines recent progress in their asymmetric synthesis, including chiral pool approaches, metal&#8208; /organo&#8208;catalysis, and emerging biocatalytic strategies.

Enantiomerically pure &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;thiocarboxylic acids bearing a stereocentre at the C&#8211;S bond represent a class of compounds of notable significance in organic and medicinal chemistry. The chirality at the C&#8211;S bond presents both challenges and opportunities in synthetic chemistry. Traditionally, the enantioselective synthesis of these &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;thiocarboxylic acids has relied on chiral pool strategies using naturally derived precursors such as amino acids and hydroxycarboxylic acids. In recent years, the expansion of organo&#8208; and metal&#8208;catalysed methodologies, employing catalysts such as cinchona alkaloids, copper, and rhodium complexes, has led to strategies with improved efficiency and stereocontrol. Additionally, advances in biocatalysis have enabled more sustainable routes toward s these valuable compounds, using enzymes such as hydrolases and nitrilases. Given the growing academic and industrial interest in these compounds, this review provides an overview of the methods developed and the progresses made over the past two decades in the asymmetric synthesis of thiocarboxylic acids bearing a stereocentre at C&#8211;S bond.

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Interrupted Cycloaddition Between Azides, Ag(I)&#8208;Acetylides, and Diorganoyl Dichalcogenides</title>

Unleashing the power of Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides with LiCl/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The LiCl/DMSO mixture have an unexplored ability to dramatically increase the solubility of Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides regardless of their molecular structure, which is explored to achieve high chemoselectivity in the Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed interrupted cycloaddition between organic azides, Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides, and diorganoyl dichalcogenides. Insights into this effect and its interplay with the reaction mechanism are discussed.

Herein, an efficient and mild Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed interrupted cycloaddition is described between organic azides and Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides, using diorganoyl dichalcogenides as trapping reagents of the Cu(I) triazolide intermediate to prepare fully substituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles containing an organochalcogen (S, Se, Te) group at C5 position. It is found that chalcogenoacetylenes and 1,4&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles are competitive side products in this reaction, but the use of Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides and LiCl as an additive in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) significantly increased the yields and selectivity for 1,4&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;5&#8208;organochalcogen&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides are well&#8208;known for their low solubility in organic solvents. However, the LiCl/DMSO mixture exhibits an interesting, unexplored ability to dramatically increase the solubility of Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides regardless of their molecular structure. The complete solubilization of Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides is the key to controlling the reaction chemoselectivity, and insights on this effect and its interplay with the reaction mechanism are discussed.

         <title>Harnessing Vinylogy with Radicals: Photoinduced &#947;&#8208;Benzylation Reactions of 2&#8208;Silyloxyfurans</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two radical&#8208;mediated benzylations of 2&#8208;silyloxyfurans, promoted by visible light and suitable photoredox catalysts have been disclosed. A broad scope of &#947;&#8208;benzyl butenolides was obtained in one step, some of which were used as strategic precursors to bio&#8208;valuable chiral butanolides. Notably, harnessing vinylogy with radicals brings new &#8220;chemical&#8221; life to silyloxyfurans, one of the most exploited vinylogous nucleophile in synthesis.

2&#8208;Silyloxyfurans are among the most exploited Mukaiyama&#8208;type vinylogous nucleophiles from which a myriad of bioactive &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones have been accessed. Although a plethora of &#8220;polar&#8221; reactions featuring this scaffold as a key player have been developed so far, its behavior in radical chemistry is still in its infancy. Herein, the development of two complementary vinylogous, radical&#8208;mediated benzylations of 2&#8208;silyloxyfurans, promoted by visible light and suitable photoredox catalysts, is described. Common to both photocatalytic cycles is the reduction of a suitable redox active ester forging a key benzyl radical intermediate, which undergoes two different fates. First, the photoinduced oxidation of the silyloxyfuran generates an unprecedented silyl&#8208;radical cation species able to trap the nucleophilic benzyl radical. Alternatively, with specific electron&#8208;rich substrates, the benzyl radical can be converted to the corresponding benzyl carbocation intermediate via a net&#8208;neutral radical&#8208;polar crossover pathway, enabling a vinylogous, polar benzylation reaction. A broad scope of chiral, &#947;&#8208;benzyl butenolides is obtained in one step, some of which are used as strategic precursors to access bioactive phenyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;valerolactone metabolites.

         <title>Heterogeneous Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 1,4&#8208;Conjugate Additions of Grignard Reagents to Cyclic and Linear Enones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition of Grignard reagents to various cyclic and linear enones using a heterogeneous catalyst is reported. Recyclable copper nanoparticles immobilized on polysaccharide support (e.g., cellulose, chitosan) enable high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. Integrated with asymmetric tandem reactions involving enals and &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, the method produces chiral &#946;,&#948;&#8208;disubstituted ketones with excellent stereoselectivity.

Highly selective conjugate additions of Grignard reagents to cyclic and linear enones catalyzed by recyclable heterogeneous polysaccharide/nanocopper catalysts are disclosed. The method also allows the synthesis of ketones with an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center. When integrated with catalytic asymmetric tandem reactions using enals and &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, it yields chiral &#946;,&#948;&#8208;disubstituted ketones with high stereoselectivity.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes (NHCs): An Emerging Efficient Catalyst in Amide Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents recent breakthroughs in N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed amide bond formation, covering metal&#8211;NHC and metal&#8208;free NHC systems. It emphasizes sustainable, mild, and atom&#8208;economical strategies, offering new mechanistic insights and broad substrate scope for green and efficient amide synthesis.

Since the discovery of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), their role as ligands and organocatalysts has grown significantly due to their unique umpolung reactivity and strong &#963;&#8208;donor capabilities. In recent years, the field of amide bond formation has seen notable advancements through NHC catalysis. Given the wide application of amides in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science, several NHC&#8208;based strategies have emerged for synthesizing amides from substrates such as aldehydes, alcohols, esters, and nitriles. This review highlights the sustainable and efficient nature of NHC&#8208;catalyzed amide bond formation. Both metal&#8211;NHC complexes and metal&#8208;free NHCs offer diverse catalytic pathways, with Ru&#8211;NHC systems proving especially effective in redox&#8208;neutral amidations. NHCs promote reactions through mechanisms involving acyl azolium, hemiaminal, and Breslow intermediates, enabling high selectivity under mild conditions. Many of these methods align with green chemistry principles, featuring high atom economy and minimal waste generation. The versatility and tunability of NHC catalysts allow broad substrate compatibility, and recent innovations include metal&#8208;free organocatalysis, continuous flow processes, and electrochemical amidation strategies. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of NHC&#8208;catalyzed amide formation, summarizing key mechanisms, substrate scope, and catalyst design, emphasizing their dual role in metal&#8208;based and organocatalytic sustainable amidation methods.

         <title>Perdeuteration of (Hetero)arenes in Flow Enabled by Defective Porous Carbon</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose, which is widely present in nature, is utilized as a precursor to prepare defective porous carbon materials and developed a general system for the perdeuteration of (hetero)arenes in flow.

Deuterium incorporation in organic compounds has been widely applied in medicinal chemistry and materials science. Specifically, fully deuterated aromatic compounds are frequently applied in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. For this application, there is a growing interest in the development of methods for perdeuteration. Herein, a general and scalable method for constructing perdeuterated (hetero)arenes using carbon materials via hydrogen isotope exchange reaction is described. Defective porous carbon material is generated by pyrolyzing cellulose, which permits perdeuteration of arenes and heteroarenes using inexpensive and easy&#8208;handling D2O as the deuterium source. Materials characterization and mechanistic studies reveal that vacancy&#8208;defect O&#8208;doped porous&#8208;carbon is generated after pyrolyze cellulose and D species in pores could be formed under continuous flow. This methodology represents a cost&#8208;effective methodology for scalable deuteration and enables efficient labeling in a straightforward manner.

         <title>Asymmetric C&#63743;H Functionalization Enabled by a Traceless Oxidizing Chiral Auxiliary</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#63743;H bond transformation by using a novel traceless oxidizing chiral directing group (CDGOX), which offers a general access chiral N&#8208;heterocycles with diverse chiral elements.

Chiral directing group strategy has long been utilized in the asymmetric C&#63743;H bond functionalization to access the complex molecules with different chiral elements. However, this strategy often encounters synthetic challenges such as the removal of preinstalled chiral auxiliaries. Reported herein is the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#63743;H bond transformation by using a novel oxidizing chiral directing group strategy (CDGOX). N&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;menthoxyl amide is designed and used as an oxidizing chiral auxiliary, which not only enables the stereoselective C&#63743;H bond transformation with diverse hydrocarbons but also be self&#8208;removed in situ through the intramolecular oxidation, constituting a traceless directing group for the asymmetric C&#63743;H bond transformation. Notably, the current strategy is capable of forming diverse chiral elements, e.g., axial chirality, planar chirality, and point chirality, providing a novel and complementary strategy for the construction of chiral N&#8208;heterocycles with good enantioselectivity.

Reported herein is the transition metal-catalyzed enantioselective C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H bond transformation by using a novel oxidizing chiral directing group strategy (CDG&lt;sup&gt;OX&lt;/sup&gt;). &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(-)-menthoxyl amide is designed and used as an oxidizing chiral auxiliary, which not only enables the stereoselective C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H bond transformation with diverse hydrocarbons but also be self-removed in situ through the intramolecular oxidation, constituting a traceless directing group for the asymmetric C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H bond transformation. Notably, the current strategy is capable of forming diverse chiral elements, e.g., axial chirality, planar chirality, and point chirality, providing a novel and complementary strategy for the construction of chiral &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycles with good enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic Polyene Cyclization to Cyclopentyl Thioethers with Consecutive Quaternary Centers in Fluorinated Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic strategy enables efficient cyclization of polyenes to cyclopentyl thioethers with consecutive all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers. Using 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate in 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol, the method proceeds via a thiyl radical mechanism, offering high yields and good diastereoselectivities.

The synthesis of carbocycles bearing consecutive all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers remains a formidable challenge in organic chemistry due to their steric congestion and synthetic inaccessibility. Herein, an efficient and sustainable photocatalytic strategy for the cyclization of polyenes to cyclopentane thioethers using 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate (TPT+) as a photocatalyst in 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) is reported. The transformation proceeds via a thiyl radical&#8208;initiated mechanism, forming multiple Csp3&#63743;Csp3$\left(\text{C}\right)_{\left(\text{sp}\right)^{3}} &amp;#x00026;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;bond; \left(\text{C}\right)_{\left(\text{sp}\right)^{3}}$ bonds and quaternary centers in a single step under mild conditions. The method tolerates a broad range of aliphatic and functionalized thiols and exhibits high yields and good diastereoselectivities, the latter strongly depending on the addressed mechanism of the transformation. Mechanistic investigations support a radical pathway initiated by thiol oxidation. This work highlights the potential of combining photocatalysis with microstructured solvent systems to facilitate polyene cyclizations. Overall, it provides a versatile platform for synthesizing sterically congested, biologically relevant carbocyclic frameworks.

A mild and an efficient metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free electrochemical protocol for the synthesis of 3&#8208;selenylated benzothiophene derivatives is described.

A mild and highly efficient metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free electrochemical approach for the synthesis of 3&#8208;selenylated benzothiophene derivatives is described. In this innovative electrochemical cascade cyclization reaction, the selenylated benzothiophene skeletons can be constructed along with the formation of C&#63743;Se and C&#63743;S bonds in a single step. Moreover, this electrochemical protocol exhibits good functional group compatibility, paving the way for the construction of diverse selenylated benzothiophene compounds with various functional groups from readily available starting materials under an aerobic reaction condition. Meanwhile, a series of control experiments are carried out, and a reasonable reaction mechanism is proposed. Finally, the scaled&#8208;up reactions are performed, and then the photochemical and bioactive properties of the synthesized compounds are elaborately discussed.

A solvent&#8208;controlled divergent access to 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;pyrones and enamine derivatives starting from ketenimines with acylacetonitriles is reported.

A DABCO&#8208;mediated Mannich&#8208;type reaction of ketenimines with acylacetonitriles toward the stable &#946;&#8208;aminoacrylates is reported. The multifunctional properties of &#946;&#8208;aminoacrylates led to the discovery of a solvent&#8208;controlled divergent access to 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;pyrones and enamine derivatives. In addition, the selective reduction and dihalogenation of &#946;&#8208;aminoacrylates are also achieved, which greatly increased the structural diversity of the products.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reaction for the construction of diverse tetrasubstituted alkenes and indenones is presented using directing group&#8208;tethered alkenyl bromides as electrophiles via the Catellani reaction.

Palladium/norbornene&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;alkenylation of aryl iodides to construct tetrasubstituted alkenes, which are of great significance in many fields of chemistry, has remained notoriously challenging. Herein, ester&#8208;tethered alkenyl bromides can serve as suitable electrophiles is demonstrated in the Catellani reaction for facile access to diverse tetrasubstituted alkenes and indenones. This procedure shows good functional group tolerance and easy scalability.

A one&#8208;step regioselective access to T&#8208;Shaped and Z&#8208;Shaped polyaromatics s&#8208;tetrazines by a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#63743;H o&#8208;functionalization is reported. Electron&#8208;rich aryl coupling partners display a higher reactivity than electron&#8208;poor aryl, and allow the formation of poly(hetero)aromatic derivatives while avoiding 1,4&#8208;azaphilic addition of the organometallic reagents that may occur with organometallic nucleophiles such as aryl cuprates.

The N&#8208;directed rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H bond arylation of s&#8208;aryltetrazine is reported using arylboronic acids as coupling partners. Convenient synthetic conditions are identified that avoid the 1,4&#8208;azaphilic addition of the organometallic reagents on the tetrazine core, that may occur with organometallic nucleophiles, such as aryl cuprates. Thus, using [RhCl2Cp*]2 and Cu(OAc)2 in trifluoromethylbenzene favors the C&#63743;H activation and direct arylation of the s&#8208;tetrazine. This setup tolerates both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the (hetero)aryl boronic acids. Electron&#8208;rich aryl coupling partners display a higher reactivity, and allow the formation of polyaromatic derivatives. This methodology provides a facile and straightforward route to diversely structured polyaromatics incorporating the valuable s&#8208;tetrazine core, with so&#8208;called T&#8208;shaped and Z&#8208;shaped architectures.

         <title>Recent Advances in Catalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of Seven&#8208; and Eight&#8208;Membered Rings with Inherent Chirality</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review mainly highlights recent advancements in asymmetric catalytic synthesis of seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings with inherent chirality. It will provide a stepping stone for further investigations by summarizing and discussing the recent developments in the area of synthesis of inherently chiral cycles.

Inherently chiral seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered cyclic frameworks constitute privileged structural motifs in natural products and bioactive compounds. While remarkable achievements have been made in enantioselective synthesis of centrally and axially chiral seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings, the catalytic atroposelective construction of inherent chiral systems remains a significant challenge in modern organic synthesis. Current methodologies predominantly focus on calix[n]arene assemblies, particularly enantioenriched calix[4]arenes, whose success in materials science applications has been well&#8208;documented in recent reviews. This review systematically summarizes emerging strategies for catalytic asymmetric access to seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings, encompassing both direct asymmetric functionalization of preformed rings and de&#8201;novo ring&#8208;forming approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on catalytic asymmetric annulation methodologies and stereoselective functional group transformations that induce inherent chirality. By critically analyzing the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art and existing limitations, this review aims to inspire innovative catalytic systems and unconventional disconnection strategies for constructing these biologically relevant yet synthetically challenging architectures.

         <title>TBHP/Ammonium/Iodide&#8208;Promoted Ring&#8208;Opening of Cyclobutanones toward &#947;&#8208;Iodo Nitriles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TBHP/ammonium/iodide&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;opening reaction of a variety of cyclobutanones is developed to access &#947;&#8208;iodo nitriles. The key intermediate of this transformation is a C&#8208;centered radical formed by undergoing &#946;&#8208;scission from iminyl radical. As such, this mild transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free procedure provides a direct, facile, and efficient pathway toward diverse &#947;&#8208;iodo functionalized nitriles.

A TBHP/ammonium/iodide&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;opening of a variety of cyclobutanones is developed to access &#947;&#8208;iodo nitriles in DCM under N2 at 40&#8201;&#176;C. This transformation initiated with in&#8201;situ imination, forming an iminyl radical that underwent &#946;&#8208;scission to yield a ring&#8208;opening C&#8208;centered radical. The latter successively underwent a single electron transfer followed by nucleophilic substitution, or alternatively proceeded via a halogen&#8208;atom transfer process to generate &#947;&#8208;iodo nitrile. As such, this mild transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free procedure provides a direct, facile, and efficient pathway toward diverse &#947;&#8208;iodo functionalized nitriles.

         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical cascade cyclization method for unactivated olefins with perfluoroalkyl iodides (IRf), constructing diverse perfluoroalkylated ortho&#8208;diazaheterocyclic compounds was developed. This catalytic strategy demonstrates broad substrate scope and has been successfully applied to 34 examples. Moreover, the reaction is initiated through the formation of an electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex between IRf and TMEDA.

An efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven strategy for the radical perfluoroalkylation/tandem cyclization of unactivated alkenes with perfluoroalkyl iodides (IRf) has been developed, enabling efficient synthesis of perfluoroalkylated heterocyclic derivatives, including pyrazoles, pyridazines, and benzodiazepines. This methodology features broad substrate compatibility with 34 examples, affording the desired products in yields up to 81%. Results of mechanistic studies indicate that the formation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex between perfluoroalkyl iodides and TMEDA greatly initiates the reaction, avoiding the use of extra catalysts and oxidants.

The B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation of 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes and glyoxals with PMHS affords 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines in high yields. The asymmetric variant can be achieved by using the chiral borane catalyst formed in&#8201;situ from HB(C6F5)2 and a binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral diene and PhSiH3, affording chiral products with excellent enantioselectivities.

Borane&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation of 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes and glyoxals for step&#8208;economic synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines has been developed. The use of B(C6F5)3 catalyst and polymethylhydrosiloxane provides convenient access to various 2&#8208;aryl&#8208; and 2&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxaline products in good to excellent yields with wide substrate scope and broad tolerance of functional groups. The asymmetric variant of this reaction can be achieved by using the enantioenriched borane catalyst generated in&#8201;situ from HB(C6F5)2 and a binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral diene and PhSiH3, affording a variety of chiral 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines with enantioselectivities ranging from 90% to &gt;99% ee. The judicious selection of borane catalyst and hydrosilane has been demonstrated to be crucial for catalysis. This cascade reaction proceeds with simple operation, and can be easily scaled up. Preliminary mechanistic studies have been performed to elucidate the catalytic pathway.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Fluorenones via Intramolecular C&#8211;H Arylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from 2&#8208;diazobenzophenones, a straightforward synthesis of valuable fluorenones via a gold&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot oxidation, C&#8211;H activation, and cyclization is described. The addition of ascorbic acid, the correct selection of the counteranion of the 2&#8208;diazobenzophenones, and the use of terpyridine as an auxiliary ligand are crucial for the reaction to proceed in good yields.

This study shows that aryldiazonium salts can participate as electrophiles in gold&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H arylation of arenes. Using 2&#8208;diazo benzophenones, a gold&#8208;catalyzed oxidation/C&#8211;H activation/cyclization sequence has been developed, leading to valuable fluorenones. Key parameters for the reaction to proceed in good yields are the introduction of electron&#8208;donating groups, the use of PF6&#8722; as counteranion, and terpyridine as an auxiliary ligand.

         <title>Water&#8208;Mediated 1,7&#8208;Palladium Aryl&#8208;to&#8208;Aryl Migration in an Unusual Aryne Trimerization Enables the Synthesis of Multihelicenes with Profoundly Hindered Stereogenic Axes</title>

         <dc:description>
In the presence of a Pd0 catalyst, large &#960;&#8208;extended arynes trimerize in an unusual manner to forge extremely compact and strained chiral benzenoids. This new trimerization reaction involves a 1,7&#8208;Pd isomerization, a rare and poorly understood process that is elucidated.

The nickel(0)&#8208;catalyzed [2&#8201;+&#8201;2&#8201;+&#8201;2] cyclotrimerization of 13,14&#8208;picyne, a &#960;&#8208;extended aryne intermediate having bay regions at both sides of the aryne triple bond, has recently enabled the synthesis of an overcrowded triple [7]helicene. In contrast, it has now been found that under palladium(0) catalysis, the same &#960;&#8208;extended aryne intermediate trimerizes in a very different manner, notably featuring a formal 1,7&#8208;hydrogen shift coupled with a rare 1,7&#8208;palladium aryl&#8208;to&#8208;aryl migration. Remarkably, this new aryne trimerization reaction seems general and reveals possible using a further &#960;&#8208;extended analog of 13,14&#8208;picyne. The two chiral multi[5]helicenes thus obtained have, in addition to helical stereogenic elements, a profoundly hindered stereogenic biaryl axis located in the fjord region of a carbo[5]helicene fragment. Both compounds are characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, which reveals their remarkably compact and severely distorted structures. A thorough mechanistic study, combining experiments and DFT simulations, shows that the observed 1,7&#8208;Pd aryl&#8208;to&#8208;aryl migration is a two&#8208;step 1,4&#8208;to&#8208;1,4&#8217;&#8208;Pd isomerization process enabled by the presence of trace amounts of water, a proton shuttle, in the reaction mixture.

         <title>Synthesis of Spirolactones from Carbonyls via Carboborylation of N&#8208;Sulfonylhydrazones with Alkoxycarbonylalkylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spirolactones are readily prepared from carbonyls via their N&#8208;tosylhydrazones. The reaction involves carboborylation with ethoxycarbonyl&#8208;substituted boronic acids, followed by oxidation and lactonization. Thermal or photochemical protocols enable versatility. The approach is applicable to natural products and bioactive molecules, demonstrating broad substrate scope and synthetic utility.

A straightforward synthesis of spirolactones from carbonyls via N&#8208;tosylhydrazones is described. The process consists of a reaction between N&#8208;tosylhydrazones and ethoxycarbonylethylboronic acid or ethoxycarbonylpropylboronic acid, leading to spiro &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones or &#948;&#8208;valerolactones, respectively. The transformation takes place by carboborylation of the N&#8208;tosylhydrazone followed by oxidation of the homologated boronic acid that delivers a hydroxyester, which undergoes further lactonization to yield a spirocyclic lactone. Depending on the structure of the starting N&#8208;tosylhydrazone, thermal or photochemical protocols are applied for the key carboborylation reaction. The usefulness of the process is illustrated by the application in a variety of natural products and biologically relevant carbonyl&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Iterative Use of Regiocomplementary Flavin&#8208;Dependent Halogenases Gives Access to Unique Halogenation Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The halide motif is ubiquitous in organic synthesis, facilitating fine&#8208;tuning of molecular properties and functionalization using substitution and cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Combination of different flavin&#8208;dependent tryptophan halogenases enables the installation of novel halogenation patterns on l&#8208;tryptophan, which can be orthogonally addressed in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions, yielding a plethora of halogenated biaryl and triaryl building blocks for the synthesis offine chemicals.

Flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases provide an environmentally friendly, highly regioselective toolkit for the halogenation of various aryl compounds. While previous works characterize the substrate scope of many halogenases individually, exploration of their combinatorial use has thus far been at best superficial. In this study, combinations of the Trp&#8208;halogenases PyrH, Thal, RebH, and AetF are used to synthesize a range of novel di&#8208; and trihalogenated tryptophan derivatives. All tested enzymes accept some halotryptophan derivatives well, while others are mostly rejected. This behavior is rationalized using crystallographic data in conjunction with molecular docking. Upscaling using halogenase combiCLEAs provides facile access to nine novel di&#8208; and even trihalogenated tryptophan derivatives. The more reactive bromine and iodine substituents prove orthogonal to chlorine substituted positions during Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling, readily giving access to chlorinated biaryl scaffolds. Finally, the strategic selection of two different boronic acids enables the selective synthesis of indole&#8208;containing triaryl compounds.

An efficient and scalable metal&#8208;free method is developed for C3&#8208;alkylation of indoles to access &#946;&#8208;(3&#8208;indolyl)carbonyl frameworks employing alkylidene and arylidene malonates as alkyl surrogates, catalyzed by nontoxic and inexpensive iodine.

An efficient and scalable metal&#8208;free protocol is developed for C3&#8208;alkylation of indoles employing alkylidene and arylidene malonates as alkyl surrogates, catalyzed by nontoxic and inexpensive iodine. The developed methodology is operationally simple and provides access to a diverse range of products in high yields, up to 95%. The method is further extended and developed into an one&#8208;pot stepwise synthesis strategy for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;(3&#8208;indolyl)carboxylic acid derivatives. Via product modifications, pharmaceutically relevant 5,10&#8208;dihydroindeno[1,2&#8208;b]indole (DHII) and carboline&#8208;based core for MK2 inhibitor analogues are synthesized.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Amino Esters with &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Carbon Centers via NHC/Photoredox Dual Catalysis</title>

&#947;&#8208;Amino acid derivatives with an &#945;&#8208;quaternary center are prevalent in medicinally important compounds. A dual N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene/photocatalytic pathway is developed for the three&#8208;component synthesis of &#945;, &#945; &#8208;disubstituted &#947;&#8208;amino esters. This methodology allows for the rapid synthesis of diverse libraries of &#947;&#8208;amino esters in good yields.

&#947;&#8208;Amino acid derivatives are important motifs in medicinal chemistry and have shown wide applicability as inhibitory neurotransmitters. An important class of these compounds feature &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstitution. However, established routes for the direct synthesis of &#947;&#8208;amino esters bearing &#945;&#8208;quaternary centers are severely limited in both number of available routes and scope of the transformation. Herein a method is presented for the three&#8208;component synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted &#947;&#8208;amino esters via N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene/photoredox dual catalysis. This reaction involves in&#8201;situ formation of an acyl azolium ester which undergoes photocatalytic reduction to the key stabilized alkoxycarbonyl radical. This methodology is shown to be capable of synthesizing a wide variety of &#947;&#8208;amino esters with various &#945;&#8208;quaternary centers in moderate to good yields, including a derivative of the drug loperamide. The diversity of products that can be synthesized facilitates the rapid generation of libraries of &#947;&#8208;amino acid derived compounds.

         <title>Deazaflavin&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation of White Phosphorus with Aryl Bromides and Chlorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 5&#8208;aryldeazaflavin photocatalyst o&#8208;Me&#8208;dFl catalyzes the arylation of white phosphorus with aryl chlorides and bromides under near UV&#8208;LED irradiation, affording triarylphosphines and tetraarylphosphonium salts. Nuclear magnetic resonance&#160;studies and density functional theory&#160;calculations offer insights into the reaction pathway.

A substantial improvement in the challenging photocatalytic arylation of white phosphorus (P4) with aryl chlorides and bromides is reported. Using the readily accessible deazaflavin&#8208;based photocatalyst o&#8208;Me&#8208;dFl, valuable triarylphosphines (PAr3) and tetraarylphosphonium salts ([PAr4]X, X&#8201;=&#8201;Br, Cl) are synthesized from P4 under near UV&#8208;LED (365&#8201;nm) irradiation in up to 87% combined yield with drastically reduced reaction times compared to previous protocols. 31P nuclear magnetic resonance&#160;spectroscopic monitoring studies and density functional theory calculations provide insights into the reaction pathway. The results represent an important step toward more atom&#8208;efficient and economical photocatalytic P4 functionalization reactions.

         <title>CO2 Conversion in Water Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water microdroplets significantly accelerate CO2 conversion reactions and enable otherwise unfavorable processes due to their unique physicochemical environment&#8212;characterized by strong interfacial effects, intrinsic electric fields, localized super acidic or basic conditions, radical formation, and enhanced reducing power.

Microdroplet chemistry is gaining recognition as a powerful tool and promising platform due to its unique physicochemical environment, suitable for a wide range of applications. When scaled down to the nano&#8208; or micrometer range, microdroplets possess a high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio and exhibit several distinctive properties, such as strong interfacial effects, electric fields, super acidic or basic environments, radical generation, and enhanced reducing power. These characteristics contribute to accelerated reaction rates and enable reactions that are otherwise unfavorable. This minireview explores and discusses the applications of microdroplet chemistry in CO2 conversion processes.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Directed Selectivity in Vinylcarbene Reactions: A Comparative Study of Ag, Rh, and Cu Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals that ligand stereoelectronic effects, rather than vinylogous electrophilicity, govern selectivity in Ag&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Cu&#8208;catalyzed vinylcarbene C(sp3)&#63743;H insertions. These insights guide the design of more selective catalysts for C&#63743;H functionalization.

A comprehensive mechanistic investigation is conducted to uncover the factors governing the selectivity of Ag, Rh, and Cu catalysts in vinylcarbene&#8208;mediated reactions. The study examines the preference for carbenic versus vinylogous C(sp3)&#63743;H bond insertion, highlighting the critical roles of the electronic and steric properties of transition metal catalysts. Contrary to previous assumptions that the enhanced electrophilic character of the vinylogous position in metal vinyl carbenes is the primary determinant, the findings demonstrate that the stereoelectronic effects of the ligand play a more dominant role. These insights inform the design of catalytic systems with tailored selectivity, advancing predictive catalysis and C&#63743;H bond functionalization.

A series of pharmacologically interesting isothiocyanate&#8208;containing amino acids and oligopeptides is obtained through the desulfurization strategy with the wide tolerance of protected groups and amino acid residues, which can be further converted into thiocitrulline derivatives.

A sustainable and mild approach for the synthesis of nonproteinogenic isothiocyanate&#8208;decorated amino acids from lysine residues and carbon disulfide via green&#8208;light photocatalysis is described. A series of pharmacologically interesting isothiocyanate&#8208;containing amino acids and oligopeptides are synthesized for the first time through the desulfurization method with the wide tolerance of protected groups and amino acid residues. The produced unnatural amino acids can be successfully converted into thioamide&#8208;containing amino acids such as thiocitrulline and its analogs. Mechanism studies support the dithiocarbamate radical coupling, deprotonation, and desulfurization processes. This approach expands the scope of nonproteinogenic amino acids and provides a new type of amino acid residues with a robust active site, which are significant organic building blocks and potential biological diagnostic markers.

         <title>Electrochemical [3+2] Cycloaddition to Access 5&#8208;Aryl(alkyl)thiotetrazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
5&#8208;Aryl(alkyl)thiotetrazoles were synthesized via an electrochemical three&#8208;component cascade reaction of thiophenols/thiols, isocyanides and azides.

An electrochemical three&#8208;component reaction of thiophenols/thiols, isocyanides and azides is developed. By using carbon felt (GF) as anode and platinum plate as cathode, a series of 5&#8208;aryl(alkyl)thiotetrazoles are obtained in moderate to good yields. The reaction is proposed to occur through cascade radical addition, oxidation, and [3+2] cycloaddition. The method could be further extended to the synthesis of 5&#8208;alkyl(aryl)selenyltetrazoles. The simple and mild reaction conditions, good substrate scope and scalability make this reaction have a good application prospect in organic synthesis.

A highly efficient and selective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed method for synthesizing primary amides directly from alcohols, with the concurrent release of molecular hydrogen, is reported. The reaction proceeds through tandem dehydrogenative coupling, oxime ether and nitrile as intermediate using methoxyamine as the amine source. The present strategy simplifies traditional processes, offering a more direct route to primary amides. Mechanistic investigations are conducted to elucidate and support the proposed reaction pathway.

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Chloro and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Dichloro Acetamidines via the Carbenoids Addition to Inherently Low Electrophilic Carbodiimides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbodiimides act as competent electrophilic synthons for the chemoselective addition of lithium mono&#8208; and di&#8208;halocarbenoids. The transformation is provided through a single synthetic operation&#8212;hitherto elusive&#8212;halogenated acetamidines. Interestingly, the constitutively tamed electrophilicity of the starting materials is effectively counterbalanced by the usage of the highly reactive halogenated organolithiums.

The hitherto few explored &#945;&#8208;halomethyl amidine motif has been assembled through the addition of a lithiated (di)&#8208;halomethane (i.e., carbenoid) to easily accessible N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl&#8208;substituted carbodiimides. Despite the inherent low electrophilicity of these heterocumulenes&#8212;as quantitatively determined in Mayr's previous studies&#8212;their sp&#8208;hybridized carbon atom acts as a competent site of attack for these tamed nucleophiles. The overall high&#8208;yielding transformation featuring a genuine chemoselective profile&#8212;as documented by using variously functionalized materials&#8212;is adaptable to the addition of dihalogenated carbenoids. Reaction products could be advantageously used in nucleophilic substitution sequences as well as in further functionalization of the nitrogen atoms due to the constitutive heteroallyl&#8208;type skeleton.

         <title>Electrolyte&#8208;Free Electrochemical C3&#8208;Arylmethylation of Indoles with Tertiary/Secondary N&#8208;Methyl Anilines using N&#8208;Methyl as the Methylene Source</title>

         <dc:description>
This study presents an electrochemical C3&#8208;arylmethylation of indoles with tertiary/secondary N&#8208;methyl anilines using the N&#8208;methyl as the methylene donor to link indoles and anilines under electrolyte&#8208;, oxidant&#8208;, and catalyst&#8208;free conditions, producing various C3&#8208;arylmethylated indoles in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields after the cleavage of the C&#63743;N bond in presumed C3&#8208;aminomethylated indoles.

An electrochemical approach devoid of electrolytes, oxidants, metals, and light is established for the C3&#8208;arylmethylation of indoles using tertiary/secondary N&#8208;methyl anilines, demonstrating a wide substrate scope, with N&#8208;methyl serving as the methylene donor. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the presumed C3&#8208;aminomethylated indole acts as a reactive intermediate, facilitating the formation of the arylmethylated product via radical/electrophilic addition, anodic oxidation/deprotonation, fragmentation, and cathodic reduction/protonation processes.

This work presents an efficient rongalite&#8208;induced cascade C&#8722;C/C=O bond formation reaction involving indoles, difluoromethyl bromides, and H2O for the synthesis of indole&#8208;3&#8208;glyoxylates and indole&#8208;3&#8208;yl&#8208;glyoxylamides. Mechanistic insights reveal rongalite's dual role as a super electron donor for C&#8722;C coupling and a proton source for C&#8722;F bond cleavage, enabling C=O formation. The method boasts high efficiency, scalability, and wide substrate scope.

Mechanistic studies suggest that rongalite may act as a precursor of a super electron donor to activate difluoromethyl bromides for C&#63743;C bond formation, as well as a source of protons to facilitate the cleavage of the C&#63743;F bond for C&#63742;O bond formation. The cascade reaction exhibits remarkable efficiency, broad substrate compatibility, and scalability. Moreover, the products can be further transformed into valuable heterocyclic structures and pharmacologically active compounds.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;H Activation and Cyclization with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations of isocyanates via C(sp2)&#8208;H activation (2006&#8211;2025). It categorizes advances by substrate type, and provides a concise analysis of substrate scopes, limitations, molecular modifiability, mechanistic studies, and their applications in the synthesis of diversely functionalized molecules. Future challenges are outlined.

Nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds represent the core structures of natural products and drugs, and their efficient synthesis is of great significance for the development of medicinal chemistry and functional materials. Isocyanates, owing to their high electrophilicity and multifunctionality, have become a universal building block for constructing complex nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of isocyanates through C(sp2)&#63743;H bond activation to construct heterocyclic frameworks has emerged as an atom&#8208;economical alternative. This review systematically summarizes the research progress of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of isocyanates through C(sp2)&#8208;H activation from 2006 to 2025. It categorizes these advancements according to the substrates involved in the cyclization reaction, providing a concise analysis of substrate scopes, limitations, molecular modifiability, mechanistic studies, and their applications in the precise synthesis of diversely functionalized molecules. Moreover, the main challenges and future opportunities are also succinctly elucidated with the goal of expanding the application range of these reactions.

         <title>Photocatalytic Diazo&#8208;Transfer from Hypervalent Iodine Diazo Reagents to Azocarboxylates: Divergent Access to 1H&#8208;Diazirines and 1H&#8208;Tetrazoles</title>

We report the diazo&#8208;transfer from Hypervalent Iodine Diazo Reagents to azocarboxylates under photocatalytic conditions. The subsequent intramolecular decarboxylative cyclization leads to the divergent access to 1&#8201;H&#8208;diazirines and 1H&#8208;tetrazoles depending upon the substituents in the azo&#8208;substrate. The control experiments suggested that the diazo&#8208;group transfer may take place through photocatalytically generated diazomethyl radical intermediate or through electrophilic diazomethylation of azocarboxylate radical anion

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Enantiopure (R)&#8208;Citronellal from Geraniol via a Short&#8208;Chain Dehydrogenase and Ene Reductase</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic cascade with two consecutive biocatalytic steps consisting of a short&#8208;chain alcohol dehydrogenase and an ene reductase in a biphasic system provides (R)&#8208;citronellal with &gt;90% conversion and &gt;99% enantiomeric excess from inexpensive geraniol.

The development of synthetic routes to produce enantiopure (R)&#8208;citronellal as a key intermediate for the synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;menthol and other valuable terpenoids is highly relevant in the pharmaceutical, flavor, and fragrance industries. Herein, we showcase a cascade with two consecutive biocatalytic steps performed separately using the inherent selectivity of a short&#8208;chain alcohol dehydrogenase (SDR) and an ene reductase (ERED) from the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) family. The first reaction involves the AaSDR1&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of relatively inexpensive geraniol in a biphasic system, providing geranial as an intermediate. The organic phase containing geranial is then extracted and transferred to the second step, where the ERED variant OYE2_Y83V catalyzes the asymmetric reduction of geranial to produce (R)&#8208;citronellal, achieving &gt;90% conversion and &gt;99% enantiomeric excess. The use of n&#8208;heptane in a two&#8208;liquid phase system not only facilitates substrate and product solubilization but also minimizes geranial isomerization. This biocatalytic cascade therefore enables the synthesis of enantiopure (R)&#8208;citronellal.

         <title>Oxidative Rearrangement of 3&#8208;Aryl Azo Indoles in Water: Synthesis of C3&#8208;Oxo&#8208;C2&#8208;Amino Indoles and their Application as Fluorophores for Lipid Droplet Detection</title>

         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free, sustainable oxidative rearrangement of 3&#8208;azo indoles in water is described to C3&#8208;oxo&#8208;C2&#8208;amino indoles, which are used as fluorescent probes to detect lipid droplets.

A novel oxidative rearrangement of the diazene moiety in 3&#8208;aryl azo indoles is reported, leading to the formation of C3&#8208;oxo&#8208;C2&#8208;amino indoles with excellent regioselectivity. This transformation, achieved using oxone in water at ambient temperature, proceeds in good yields with broad functional group tolerance, including toward azaindoles. Mechanistic insights are gained through control experiments, crystal structures, and density functional theory calculations. Experimental and theoretical photophysical studies, along with cellular uptake and colocalization experiments, demonstrate that the resulting compounds selectively bind to lipid droplets (LDs), highlighting their potential as fluoroprobes for LD detection.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple photoredox system comprising Hantzsch ester, Cs2CO3, and 4DPAIPN that enables direct and site&#8208;selective deoxygenation of benzyl alcohol derivatives is described. Mechanistic studies reveal that in&#8201;situ reversible acylative activation of hydroxy groups plays a pivotal role in achieving the unique selectivity, highlighting the importance of reversible activation strategies in selective molecular transformations.

A simple yet efficient method is presented for direct and site&#8208;selective deoxygenation of benzyl alcohol derivatives, including polyols, without requiring preactivation. This reaction system, consisting of Hantzsch ester, Cs2CO3, and a photocatalyst under photoirradiation, enables direct and site&#8208;selective deoxygenation. Mechanistic studies reveal that in&#8201;situ reversible acylative activation of hydroxy groups plays a pivotal role in achieving unique selectivity. This approach offers a general and practical strategy for the selective transformation of polyols.

         <title>Integrating Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis and Enzymes for the Stereoselective Synthesis of Alcohols and Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration between visible&#8208;light photocatalysis and biocatalysis has the potential to greatly improve modern organic synthesis by combining the production of valuable synthetic intermediates under mild photochemical conditions with the high degree of stereoselectivity reached by enzymes. The review collects the recent efforts in the photoenzymatic asymmetric synthesis of alcohols and amines.

The stereocontrolled formation of C&#63743;O and C&#63743;N bonds is important for the preparation of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, fragrances, and flavors. In this field, enzymes have become a valid alternative to transition metal complexes and organocatalysts due to their high degree of stereoselectivity and desirable sustainability features.

&lt;p&gt;The integration between visible-light photocatalysis and biocatalysis has the potential to greatly improve modern organic synthesis by combining the production of valuable synthetic intermediates under mild photochemical conditions with the high degree of stereoselectivity reached by enzymes. The review collects the recent efforts in the photoenzymatic asymmetric synthesis of alcohols and amines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stereocontrolled formation of C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O and C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N bonds is important for the preparation of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, fragrances, and flavors. In this field, enzymes have become a valid alternative to transition metal complexes and organocatalysts due to their high degree of stereoselectivity and desirable sustainability features. In this scenario, the increasing interest toward sustainable and efficient chemical processes has also led to the combination of complementary catalytic systems. The merge of biocatalysis and photocatalysis is among the most recent approaches. While photocatalysis allows the production of valuable synthetic intermediates and reactive species under mild conditions, biocatalysis exploits highly specific enzymes to catalyze reactions with high (stereo)-selectivity and minimal byproduct formation. This review summarizes the progress in photoenzymatic catalysis (also photobiocatalysis), emphasizing their complementary mechanisms in producing chiral alcohols and amines, and highlights how such integration not only enhances the sustainability of catalytic systems but also expands the scope of reactions accessible under milder and ultimately more sustainable conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Borane&#8208;Catalyzed Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Ring Opening of 2&#8208;Substituted Aziridines with Phenols for Direct Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines</title>

Boron&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208; and ortho&#8208;selective C&#63743;H bond substitution of phenols with 2&#8208;alkyl/aryl aziridines to access the branched selective ortho&#8208;phenolic&#8208;&#946;&#8208;arylethylamines is achieved. N&#8208;heterocyclic arenes can also act as carbon nucleophiles to open the aziridine ring selectively to afford the branched products. This protocol is demonstrated for the synthesis of serotonin and tryptamine.

A metal&#8208;free chemo&#8208; and regioselective nucleophilic ring opening of 2&#8208;substituted aziridines with ortho&#8208;C(sp2) atom of phenols enables facile access to medicinally relevant &#946;&#8208;arylethylamine derivatives. In this approach, phenols act as aryl nucleophiles that favor C&#63743;C bond formation selectively at the ortho&#8208;C(sp2) position with the more substituted carbon of aziridines to generate branched, selective arylated products. Despite the significant advancement of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling and nucleophilic ring opening of 2&#8208;substituted azirines, only linear arylated products are widely demonstrated. The first metal&#8208;free branched selective nucleophilic ring opening of 2&#8208;alkyl and 2&#8208;aryl aziridines with phenols is reported to address this challenge. Furthermore, the diversity of the substrate scope by using N&#8208;heterocycles as nucleophiles empowers the generation of &#946;&#8208;heteroarylethylamine derivatives. A combination of computational and experimental investigation reveals that the reaction proceeds via a borane&#8208;promoted proton transfer, followed by aziridine ring opening and Fridel&#8211;Crafts alkylation involving a &#960;&#8208;complex of carbocation&#8208;anion ion pair. This protocol is further applicable for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant compounds like serotonin and tryptamine.

         <title>Noncovalent&#8208;Interaction&#8208;Dictated Product Selectivity in Intermolecular and Intramolecular Controllable Oxidation of Aromatic Amines Using 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Diperoxyphenic Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving controllable generation and effective interception of relevant intermediates during intermolecular and intramolecular oxidation of aromatic amines by noncovalent interactions is an attractive objective. It has been reported herein the means to enable a family of intermolecular and intramolecular controllable selective oxidation of aromatic amines that create opportunities for the synthesis of symmetric or unsymmetric nitrosobenzenes, nitrobenzenes, azoxybenzenes, and azobenzenes.


Selective oxidation of aromatic amines is a valuable transformation in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry as well as materials science. However, the efficient means to reach its full potential remain a formidable challenge because meticulous perturbations on the oxidation states can potentially lead to dramatically different product selectivity and efficacy profiles. Herein, by identifying bench&#8208;stable and easily prepared 2,2&#8242;&#8208;diperoxyphenic acid as oxidant and/or I2 as additive, a general and divergent oxidation is developed to reliably form a wide assortment of nitrosobenzenes, nitrobenzenes, azobenzenes, and azoxybenzenes in an intermolecular and intramolecular controllable manner, avoiding the use of stoichiometric metal oxidants and transition metal&#8208;based catalysts. Mechanistic studies reveal that the imposing of noncovalent interactions enables the achievement of reagent&#8208; and additive&#8208;dependent reordering of N&#63743;H bond reactivity and the rate of corresponding elementary steps.

         <title>Cu/Ru Sequential Catalysis via In Situ Directing Group Formation for Site&#8208;Selective C&#63743;H Arylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu/Ru sequential catalysis enables in situ formation of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles as directing groups for site&#8208;selective C&#63743;H arylation.Combining click chemistry with Ru&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H activation bypasses prefunctionalization, ensures high regioselectivity, and accommodates diverse substrates.Applications include late&#8208;stage drug modification and functional material synthesis.

A Cu/Ru bimetallic sequential catalytic strategy combining copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) with Ru&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H activation is developed, enabling the in&#8201;situ formation of nitrogen&#8208;containing triazoles and their ortho C&#63743;H arylation in a one&#8208;pot dual&#8208;functional transformation. This system innovatively employs the 1,2,3&#8208;triazole formed via CuAAC as an endogenous directing group, facilitating sequential [3+2] cycloaddition and Ru&#8208;mediated C&#63743;H functionalization through a stepwise catalytic approach. The strategy overcomes the limitations of traditional preactivation and exhibits excellent regioselectivity and broad substrate compatibility. This approach has been successfully applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceutical molecules, offering a new paradigm for the modular synthesis of complex compounds.

         <title>Electrochemically Driven Hydroxy&#8208;Thiocarbamation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces an electrochemical method for multi&#8208;component hydroxy&#8208;thiocarbamation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, using (hetero)aryl alkenes, KSCN, and H2O to produce &#946;&#8208;hydroxy primary S&#8208;thiocarbamates. The process is highly atom&#8208;economical, and demonstrates excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, enabling diverse product synthesis and late&#8208;stage natural product modification.

This article reports the first example of multi&#8208;component hydroxy&#8208;thiocarbamation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes in an electrochemical undivided cell. Simple and readily available electron&#8208;deficient (hetero)aryl alkenes, KSCN and H2O are used as starting materials to produce &#946;&#8208;hydroxy primary S&#8208;thiocarbamate derivatives in moderate to good yields. H2O is involved in the formation of carbamoyl and hydroxyl groups, making the method highly atom&#8208;economical. The reaction introduces multiple functional groups under mild and environmentally friendly conditions, without the need for metals or external oxidants. The reaction exhibits good functional&#8208;group tolerance and excellent product diversity. The procedure is operationally simple, and late&#8208;stage modification of natural products further demonstrates the practical application of the method.

         <title>Electrochemical Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Heterofunctionalization of Tropones via C(sp2)&#63743;H Derivatization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and selective. The electrochemical heterofunctionalization of activated tropones is achieved using readily available inorganic salts. A theoretical model, based on cyclic voltammetry and quantum chemistry calculations, predicts both reactivity trends and site selectivity. This model is supported by the rapid synthesis of densely functionalized tropones and tropolones (35 examples, with yields up to 95%).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simple and selective&lt;/b&gt;. The electrochemical heterofunctionalization of activated tropones is achieved using readily available inorganic salts. A theoretical model, based on cyclic voltammetry and quantum chemistry calculations, predicts both reactivity trends and site selectivity. This model is supported by the rapid synthesis of densely functionalized tropones and tropolones (35 examples, with yields up to 95%).&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electrochemically Driven Diastereoselective Dearomative 2,3&#8208;Diesterification of Indoles with Carboxylic Acids</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein an electrochemical radical cation&#8208;mediated dearomative 2,3&#8208;difunctionalization of indoles with carboxylic acids for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;diesterified indolines with excellent trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity is reported.

An electrochemically driven radical cation&#8208;mediated dearomative 2,3&#8208;difunctionalization of indoles with carboxylic acids is described, which provides an efficient and straightforward route for the construction of a range of 2,3&#8208;diesterified indolines with excellent trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields. This metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free electrochemical protocol proceeds in an undivided cell, exhibiting broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies reveal that the anodic single&#8208;electron oxidation of indoles is the initial step and oxocarbenium ion formation is the key to controlling trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Solvent&#8208; and Transition Metal&#8208;Free Mechanochemical Synthesis of 2&#8208;Thiazolines and S&#8208;Thiocarbamates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent&#8208; and transition metal&#8208;free synthetic pathways for obtaining 2&#8208;thiazolines and S&#8208;thiocarbamates, based on the mechanochemical process of addition of chloroalkyl iso(thio)cyanates to thiols catalyzed by cheap and commercially available K2CO3, are designed and optimized. This approach has been successfully applied to obtain 39 materials with significant medicinal potential in yields above 95%.

For the first time, the mechanochemical synthesis of five&#8208;membered N,S&#8208;heterocyclic 1,3&#8208;thiazolines and S&#8208;thiocarbamates has been performed starting from chloroalkyl iso(thio)cyanates, thiols, as well as dithiols, in the presence of cheap and commercially available potassium carbonate (K2CO3) as a catalyst. The experimental conditions are optimized to allow the effective formation of attractive materials with significant medicinal potential in yields above 95% in transition metal&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free conditions. The reactions are efficient and easily scalable to gram quantities, offering substantial benefits for practical applications.

         <title>Insights into Alkene Hydroselenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the hydroselenation reactions of alkenes with selenols or their surrogates for the synthesis of valuable organoselenium compounds, with a special emphasis on the mechanisms of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed and radical hydroselenation.

Selective hydrofunctionalization of alkenes enables the efficient construction of structurally diverse and value&#8208;added molecules with new functionalities. The past few decades have witnessed rapid applications of organoselenium compounds in pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and materials. Alkene hydroselenation represents one of the most promising strategies for the highly regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208;, and stereoselective synthesis of selenium&#8208;containing substances. This review outlines the hydroselenation reactions of alkenes with selenols or their surrogates developed over the past five decades and discusses the origin of selectivity based on representative examples. These developments are categorized according to the reactivity patterns exhibited by the selenium nucleophiles. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, light&#8208;induced, and electrocatalytic hydroselenation are highlighted to enhance the understanding of the mechanism.

         <title>B(C6F5)3&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive C&#63743;C Bond Cleavage of Bisindolylmethanes</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient, metal&#8208;free method for synthesizing C3&#8208;alkylated indoles via B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed reductive C&#63743;C bond cleavage of bisindolylmethanes (BIMs) under mild conditions is reported, offering broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance.

In this study, B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed reductive C&#63743;C bond cleavage of bisindolylmethanes (BIMs) is reported as an efficient strategy for preparing C3&#8208;alkylated indoles. In the presence of silane, B(C6F5)3 selectively activates Csp2&#8208;Csp3 bonds of BIMs under mild conditions. Moreover, this sustainable process exhibits a broad substrate scope, highly functional group tolerance, and excellent regioselectivity. Preliminary mechanistic studies disclose that the formation of stabilized ion&#8208;pair intermediates is crucial to achieving the desired transformation. Notably, the strategy provides a metal&#8208;free alternative to transition metal catalysis, enabling the sustainable synthesis of valuable indole derivatives.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Photoredox Synthesis of Sulfonylated Benzimidazoisoquinolines via 10 H&#8208;Phenothiazine&#8208;Catalyzed Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free photocatalytic strategy using unmodified 10 H&#8208;phenothiazine is presented for the synthesis of sulfonylated benzimidazoisoquinolines. Visible light activates catalytic electron donor&#8211;acceptor complexes between phenothiazine and sulfonyl chlorides, driving a sulfonation/cyclization cascade with broad substrate scope, high efficiency, and mild conditions.

An unmodified 10 H&#8208;phenothiazine is directly utilized as an efficient photocatalyst to enable ready access to sulfonylated benzo[4,5]imidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives from N&#8208;allyl benzimidazoles and sulfonyl chlorides. The reaction involves the formation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor complexes between phenothiazine and sulfonyl chloride, which, upon visible light irradiation, undergo single&#8208;electron transfer to generate sulfonyl radicals. The reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and high efficiency.

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Chloro and &#945;,&#945; &#8208;Dichloro acetamidines via the Carbenoids Addition to Inherently Low Electrophilic Carbodiimides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hitherto few explored &#945;&#8208;halomethyl amidine motif has been assembled through the addition of a lithiated (di)&#8208;halomethane (i.e. carbenoid) to easily accessible N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl substituted carbodiimides. Despite the inherent low electrophilicity of these heterocumulenes &#8211; as quantitatively determined in Mayr&#8217;s previous studies &#8211; their sp&#8208;hybridized carbon atom acts as a competent site of attack for these tamed nucleophiles. The overall high&#8208;yielding transformation featuring a genuine chemoselective profile &#8211; as documented by employing variously functionalized materials &#8211; is adaptable to the addition of dihalogenated carbenoids. Reaction products could be advantageously employed in nucleophilic substitution sequences, as well as, in further functionalization of the nitrogen atoms due to the constitutive heteroallyl&#8208;type skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>eAmidation: An Electrochemical Amidation of Aldehydes via the Oxidation of N&#8208;Aryl Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the use of electrochemistry has emerged as a powerful yet sustainable means of enabling key transformations. Amidation is one of the most frequently executed transformations in synthetic chemistry, and using an electrochemical approach, the current study has demonstrated the synthesis of amides from aldehydes and amines. Mechanistic work indicates that the reaction proceeds via the oxidation of an intermediate hydrazone to generate an acyl diazene as the acylating species. The protocol developed has enabled the synthesis of a broad range of amides, including access to pharmaceutically relevant products, directly from aldehydes without recourse for hazardous chemical oxidants and activating agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand controlled regio&#8208;divergent [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of alkynes by merging electrochemistry and nickel catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions between three alkynes, a diyne and an alkyne, or a triyne offer a straightforward and typical protocol toward all kinds of polysubstituted benzens. Herein, the synthesis of polysubstituted aromatics through electrochemical nickel catalyzed cyclotrimerization of alkynes is developed. The regio&#8208;divergent cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes was achieved by judicious choice of ligands. And tributylphosphine, sterically hindered bipyridine or &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands delivered 1,2,4&#8208; and 1,3,5&#8208;substituted aromatics with high regioselectivities respectively. Besides, the semi&#8208;intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between	diynes and alkynes are also amenable under this catalytic system. This approach operates without metal reductant, exhibits wide functional groups tolerance, ease of scalability and furnishes 75 examples with moderate to good yields, including some biorelevant compounds. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculation revealed the catalytic pathways of 1,3,5&#8208; and 1,2,4&#8208;cyclotrimerizations, and the origin of the ligand controlled regioselectivity.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydration reactions of diynes to access tetrasubstituted cyclohexenones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;carboalkoxy&#8208;3&#8208;substituted&#8208;cyclohexenones are powerful building blocks for the synthesis of a variety of bioactive target molecules. Their preparations requires multi&#8208;steps sequence involving the use of stoichiometric quantities of various reagents, while the catalytic approaches are limitited to trisubstituted cyclohexenones. We describe here an efficient catalytic approach based on gold(I)&#8208;catalysis starting from unsymmetrical diynyl mono&#8208;ester or symmetrical diynyl di&#8208;ester substrates. The carbon chain linking the two alkyne functions can bear two or one substituent, or even be unsubstituted. Regardless of the nature of the substrates and independently of its substitution, the cyclohexenone derivatives are cleanly produced.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(II) complex dispersed in imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid: Recyclable catalyst system for regioselective and chemoselective hydrobromination and hydrochlorination of alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a recyclable catalyst system combining Cu(II)O and 4,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline in a 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid for the hydrohalogenation of alkynes. The reaction efficiently yields alkenyl bromides and chlorides with good functional group tolerance and regioselectivity across a range of functionalized alkynes. Remarkably, the reaction exhibits unprecedented chemoselectivity for alkyne over alkenes in polyenynes and enables late&#8208;stage modifications to rapidly synthesize brominated polyenes. The catalyst system could be recycled for up to six runs without significant reduction of the reaction yield.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Click reactions display many of the goals desired for more sustainable chemical
conversions.  Yet, the solvent used is an often overlooked aspect in determining the
environmental impact of reactions. In the current paper we develop the first
mechanochemical method for the efficient and solvent&#8208;free SuFEx reaction of sulfonyl
fluorides with a wide range of phenols.  After outlining the optimization process, which
yields an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use and robust method, we provide indications of the very wide
scope of this approach, and demonstrate this potential via the application to a range of
natural phenols that also display other functionalities, and several gram&#8208;scale
syntheses.</dc:description>
