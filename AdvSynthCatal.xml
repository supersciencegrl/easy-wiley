      <title>Catalyst&#8208; and Base&#8208;Free Asymmetric Synthesis of Functionalized Prolines via One&#8208;Pot Cascade Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>A one pot, three&#8208;step cascade reaction to provide functionalized proline derivatives was developed. The Michael addition reaction of N&#8208;allylated proline and activated alkyne forms a zwitterionic intermediate that further undergoes cyclization and [2,3]&#8208;rearrangement to provide C&#945;&#8208;alkylated proline bicyclic derivatives. This transformation was highly stereoselective and the chirality of the N&#8208;allylated prolines was completely transferred to the product via a C&#8208;N&#8208;C chirality transfer process. The developed reaction is operationally simple and does not require any reagents other than the substrates.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A one pot, three&#8208;step cascade reaction to provide functionalized proline derivatives was developed. The Michael addition reaction of N&#8208;allylated proline and activated alkyne forms a zwitterionic intermediate that further undergoes cyclization and [2,3]&#8208;rearrangement to provide C&#945;&#8208;alkylated proline bicyclic derivatives. This transformation was highly stereoselective and the chirality of the N&#8208;allylated prolines was completely transferred to the product via a C&#8208;N&#8208;C chirality transfer process. The developed reaction is operationally simple and does not require any reagents other than the substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Reductive Alkylation of Amines with Carboxylic Ortho Esters</title>
      <dc:description>We have demonstrated for the first time that carboxylic ortho esters could be used as an alkylating agent in the reductive alkylation of amines. A variety of amines, including amino acid esters, were alkylated affording mono&#8208;alkylated products with high selectivity in practical to high yields using standard heterogeneous catalysts. By applying acyclic ortho esters alkylation was completed at room temperature.</dc:description>

The front cover picture, provided by Hiroki Miura and his co&#8208;workers, shows a planet with two faces to illustrate the palladium&#8211;gold alloy&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl chlorides and hydrosilanes enabling the selective formation of aryl&#8211;silicon bonds. Whereas nanoparticles solely composed of palladium predominantly promoted the hydrodechlorination of aryl chlorides to afford benzene derivatives, palladium&#8211;gold alloy nanoparticles efficiently catalyzed the title reaction to give arylsilanes with high selectivity.

      <title>Monosubstituted, Anionic Imidazolyl Ligands from N&#8211;H NHC Precursors and Their Activity in Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions.</title>
      <dc:description>We report that treatment of several 2&#8208;diphenylphosphinoimidazoles with Pd(II) salts generates monosubstituted N&#8211;H NHC&#8208;Pd complexes via insertion into the C&#8211;P bond. Removal of the N&#8211;H proton in situ leads to anionic imidazolyl&#8208;Pd complexes that are highly stable and catalytically active, achieving up to 340,000 turnovers at 1 ppm catalyst loading in Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions. DFT&#8208;calculated Tolman electronic parameters for the sterically small anionic complexes suggest that these ligands are significantly more donating than traditional NHCs, which provides a rationale for rapid cross&#8208;coupling catalysis. Excellent reactivity is also demonstrated in Sonogashira reactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Structure Ligation Relationship of Amino Acids for the Selective Indole C&#8208;H Arylation Reaction: L&#8208;Aspartic acid as Sustainable Alternative of Phosphines Ligands</title>
      <dc:description>The Structure Ligation Relationship (SLR) of free amino acids (AAs) under Pd&#8208;catalysis were examined for the chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective indole C&#8211;H arylation reactions. While the majority of AAs were minor or ineffective, the L&#8208;aspartic acid (L&#8208;Asp) stands out promising to deliver high&#8208;value C3&#8211;arylated indoles with excellent chemo&#8208; (C vs N) and regioselectivity (C3 vs C2) with high functional group tolerance. Thus, the protocol offers a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable alternative of phosphine&#8208;based ligands for the indole C3&#8208;H arylation reactions. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggested the simultaneous involvement of &#8722;NH2, &#945;&#8722;CO2H, and &#946;&#8722;CO2H functionalities of L&#8208;Asp and found critical for its ligation efficiency. The developed catalytic system was compatible with the tandem decarboxylation/arylation procedure for the chemoselective synthesis of 3&#8208;aryl indoles.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Progress on Reductive Coupling of Nitroarenes by Using Organosilanes as Convenient Reductants</title>
      <dc:description>Nitroarenes are stable, low&#8208;cost, and readily available starting materials. The directly utilize nitroarenes in synthetically valuable C&#8211;N bond formation is of great significance, because the pre&#8208;reduction step to corresponding amines can be avoided. Previously, phosphines and carbon monoxide (CO) are the most widely used reductants in the reductive cyclization or/and carbonylation of nitroarenes. Currently, much attention has been attracted to organosilanes as new potential reducing agents, not only because they are inexpensive, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, and mild reagents, but also various novel reaction models of nitroarenes have been explored. In this review, we mainly summarize the recent progress on the reductive coupling of nitroarenes by using organosilanes as the end reductants. We hope that a deep understanding of the reaction model and underlying working mechanism can provide a timely guideline for researchers who are interested in this fantastic area, leading to further exploration of practical and efficient reductive coupling of nitroarenes for C&#8208;N bond formation and N&#8208;heterocycle synthesis.</dc:description>

In this review, we mainly summarize the recent progress on the reductive coupling of nitroarenes by using organosilanes as the end reductants. We hope that a deep understanding of the reaction model and underlying working mechanism can provide a timely guideline for researchers who are interested in this fantastic area, leading to further exploration of practical and efficient reductive coupling of nitroarenes for C&#8208;N bond formation and N&#8208;heterocycle synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Advances in the Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Atropisomeric Hexatomic N&#8208;Heterobiaryls</title>
      <dc:description>Axially chiral hexatomic N&#8208;heterobiaryls are among the most important class of structures with extensive utility in asymmetric catalysis as chiral ligands and organocatalysts, as exemplified by QUINAP and QUINOX. Besides, these atropisomers have attracted broad attention due to their application in drug discovery. Hence, it is not surprising that extensive efforts have been devoted for the pursue of efficient catalytic asymmetric methods for their direct and atroposelective construction. In addition to the direct heteroaryl&#8208;aryl cross&#8208;coupling, which remains as a challenge, a series of creative catalytic asymmetric strategies based on pre&#8208;formed heterobiaryl systems have been developed by taking advantage of the intrinstic property of N atom on the heteroarenes. Generally, the methods employed extensively involved kinetic resolution, dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation, dynamic kinetic resolution and desymmetrization reaction. A growing number of approaches through stereoselective de novo formation of a six&#8208;membered
N&#8208;heteroaromatic ring have also been reported for specific applications in this field. This review summarizes recent advancements of axially chiral hexatomic N&#8208;heterobiaryls construction by means of asymmetric catalysis, including their scope, limitations, mechanisms and applications.

      <title>Double Carbonylation Reactions: Overview and Recent Advances</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. The compounds like amides, carbamates, oxamates, oxamides, &#945;&#8208;keto amides, diketones, esters, ureas, etc. find extensive applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and organic synthesis. The classical syntheses of these compounds often involve cumbersome routes involving toxic chemicals. The carbonylation reactions such as aminocarbonylation, alkoxycarbonylation, oxidative carbonylation and double carbonylation deliver as an efficient and attractive alternative to the conventional synthetic routes even at industrial scale. The catalytic single carbonylation reactions are extensively studied, however, catalytic double carbonylation reactions are not explored for several potential applications. This review covers literature on the use of different types of catalysts involving various	metals like Pd, Cu, Fe, Co, Rh and Ni for double carbonylation reactions along with the chemistry of associated ligands. It also covers double carbonylation used for synthesis of different types of novel substrates with the discussion related to mechanism of formations of mono and di carbonylation products. The notable introduction of several CO&#8208;surrogates and exploration of their efficiency have solved the problems related to the toxicity of CO.  CO&#8208;surrogates used for double carbonylation reactions are also discussed.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The first palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct C(sp3)&#8208;H chalcogenation of benzylics with diaryl disulfides and diselenide has been established. The coupling reaction proceeds between the thioether radical and palladiumcycle intermediate.

The current protocol exhibits a relatively broad substrate scope and high functional group compatibility. A mechanistic study indicates that palladium(III) intermediate is probably formed during the course of the reaction.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>








Abstract
The enantioselective synthesis of chiral azaarenes by rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of organoboronic acids to carbonyl&#8208;activated alkenyl azaarenes was reported. Diverse chiral azaarenes were produced in up to 99% yield and with up to 99% ee (&gt;60 examples). Catalytic asymmetric syntheses of dexchlorpheniramine and dexbrompheniramine were realized by using the developed method.

      <title>Silylation of Aryl Chlorides by Bimetallic Catalysis of Palladium and Gold on Alloy Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Supported palladium&#8208;gold alloy&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl chlorides and hydrosilanes enabled the selective formation of aryl&#8208;silicon bonds. Whereas a monometallic palladium catalyst predominantly promoted the hydrodechlorination of aryl chlorides and gold nanoparticles showed no catalytic activity, gold&#8208;rich palladium&#8208;gold alloy nanoparticles efficiently catalyzed the title reaction to give arylsilanes with high selectivity. A wide array of aryl chlorides and hydrosilanes participated in the heterogeneously&#8208;catalyzed reaction to furnish the corresponding arylsilanes in 34&#8211;80% yields. A detailed mechanistic investigation revealed that palladium and gold atoms on the surface of alloy nanoparticles independently functioned as active sites for the formation of aryl nucleophiles and silyl electrophiles, respectively, which indicates that palladium and gold atoms on alloy nanoparticles work together to enable the selective formation of aryl&#8208;silicon bonds.

      <title>Efficient Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate [NADP(H)] Recycling in Closed&#8208;Loop Continuous Flow Biocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Biocatalytic redox reactions regularly depend on expensive cofactors that require recycling. For continuous conversions in flow chemistry, this is often an obstacle since the cofactor is washed away. Here, we present a quasi&#8208;stationary recycling system for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate utilizing an immobilized alcohol dehydrogenase. Four model substrates were reduced with high enantioselectivity as a proof of concept. The two&#8208;phase system enables continuous production as well as quick substrate changes. This setup may serve as a general cofactor regeneration module for continuous biocatalytic devices employing (co&#8208;)substrates being miscible in organic solvent. The system resulted in space&#8208;time yields up to 117&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1 and total turnover numbers for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate higher than 12,000&#8197;mol/mol are possible.

      <title>Still&#8208;Gennari olefination and its applications in organic synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>The Still&#8208;Gennari olefination is a widely applied modification of the Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons reaction, allowing access to Z &#8208;olefins by carbonyl group transformation. Its synthetic utility is undoubtedly of great significance for organic chemistry, as can be illustrated by the number of citations of the original report by W. C. Still and C. Gennari which up to date has been cited over 1000 times. In 2008 Nobel prize winner Ei&#8208;ichi Negishi indicated the Still&#8208;Gennari olefination as one of the crucial methods for the olefin synthesis, complementary to palladium catalyzed alkenylations. Surprisingly, so far there is no review concerning this popular and valuable transformation. Therefore, we aim to comprehensively systematize achievements in this field and to present the scope of applications of the Still&#8208;Gennari olefination along with recent examples in total synthesis of biologically active compounds. Our review intends to be of interest for general chemical community as well as to be a helpful source of information for synthetic organic chemists.</dc:description>
