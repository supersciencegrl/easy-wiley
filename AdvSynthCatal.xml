         <title>Nitrogen Radical&#8208;Triggered Trifunctionalizing Ipso&#8208;Spirocyclization of Unactivated Alkenes with Vinyl Azides: A Modular Access to Spiroaminal Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>we report an example of non&#8208;dearomative trifunctionalizing ipso&#8208;spirocyclization of unactivated alkenes through photoredox&#8208;catalyzed, nitrogen radical&#8208;triggered cyclization&#8208;trapping&#8208;translocation&#8208;cyclization cascade, providing a single&#8208;step modular access to spiroaminal frameworks through the sequential formation of one C&#8722;C bond and two geminal C&#8722;N bonds. The developed protocol utilizes not only internal and terminal olefinic oxime esters but also olefinic amides as nitrogen radical precursors, and features a broad substrate scope, varied functional group compatibility, easy scalability, and potential for product derivatization and late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive estrone derivative. Importantly, the mechanistic studies including DFT calculations indicate that such photocatalytic trifunctionalizing ipso&#8208;spirocyclization undergoes a radical relay cascade of intramolecular 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization, intermolecular radical trapping, 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer, and sequential 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization, which would open up another reaction mode of alkenes.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An operationally mild, ruthenium&#8208;based photocatalytic protocol has been developed for the conversion of gamma&#8208;mono&#8208; and gamma&#8208;disubstituted allyl carbonates in the presence of Umemoto&#180;s reagent to afford novel types of six&#8208;membered cyclic carbonates. Variation and diversification of the carbonate ring substitution provides access to substituted monomers useful in ring&#8208;opening polymerization leading to polycarbonates with potentially tailored properties, as illustrated by comparative experiments using monomers with different pi&#8208;stacking capabilities.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Alkylation: A Tandem Approach to the Synthesis of Nonsymmetric N,N&#8208;Dialkyl Acyl Hydrazides with Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The borrowing hydrogen strategy has been applied in the synthesis of nonsymmetric N,N&#8208;dialkylated acyl hydrazides via a tandem three&#8208;component reaction catalyzed by a phosphine free diaminocyclopentadienone ruthenium tricarbonyl complex. This strategy represents the first direct one&#8208;pot approach to nonsymmetric functionalized acyl hydrazides. Different aromatic acyl hydrazides underwent dialkylation with a variety of primary or secondary alcohols and methanol or ethanol as alkylating agents in mild reaction conditions and good yields. Deuterium labelling experiments suggested that the primary or secondary alcohol was the hydrogen source in this tandem process. DFT calculations show that the combination of the tandem mixed product cannot be perfectly explained neither structurally nor electronically, but might be dependent of the physical state of the aldehyde or ketone intermediate (gaz vs. liquid) at the reaction temperature.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An organocatalyzed asymmetric dearomative [3+2] annulation reaction of electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;nitrobenzo heteroarenes including 2&#8208;nitrobenzofurans, 2&#8208;nitrobenzothiophenes and 2&#8208;nitroindoles with 3&#8208;isothiocyanato oxindoles was developed. With a multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding bifunctional thiourea as the catalyst, the reaction displays broad substrate scope and provides an access to structurally diverse polycyclic spirooxindoles containing three contiguous stereogenic centers in high yields with good diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to 99% yield, 94:6 dr, and 97% ee). This organocatalysis protocol is able to afford the products with complementarily diastereoselectivity versus the previous work with transition metal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Construction of 5&#8211;6&#8211;5 Tricyclic Lactone Framework Bearing a Quaternary Bridgehead Carbon via Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric [2+2+2] Cycloaddition of Enediynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [2+2+2] cycloaddition of ene&#8208;yne&#8208;yne enediynes to generate enantio&#8208;enriched tricyclic cyclohexadienes bearing a quaternary bridgehead carbon. We found that the Rh&#8208;Phanephos complex is an appropriate catalyst for the cycloaddition of enediynes bearing an unsubstituted propiolate terminus, whereas Rh&#8208;biaryl bisphosphine catalysts, which have been widely used for asymmetric cycloadditions of alkynes and alkenes, are not applicable for the reaction of such enediynes. Several control experiments suggest that the reaction using the Rh&#8208;Phanephos complex exclusively proceeds via a rhodacyclopentadiene intermediate, unlike when using a Rh&#8208;biaryl bisphosphine complex that can form a rhodacyclopentadiene intermediate as well as a rhodacyclopentene intermediate in a substrate&#8208;dependent manner.</dc:description>

We found that the Rh-Phanephos complex is an appropriate catalyst for the cycloaddition of enediynes bearing an unsubstituted propiolate terminus, whereas Rh-biaryl bisphosphine catalysts, which have been widely used for asymmetric cycloadditions of alkynes and alkenes, are not applicable for the reaction of such enediynes. Several control experiments suggest that the reaction using the Rh-Phanephos complex exclusively proceeds via a rhodacyclopentadiene intermediate, unlike when using a Rh-biaryl bisphosphine complex that can form a rhodacyclopentadiene intermediate as well as a rhodacyclopentene intermediate in a substrate-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Direct Functionalization of Isoindolinones for Synthesis of 3,3&#8208;Disubstituted Isoindolinones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of tetrasubstituted carbon center (especially the chiral one) represents one of the most challenging and demanding topics in the synthesis of natural products and related drugs. The development of isoindolinones with this feature appears to be of great importance, because the 3,3&#8208;disubstituted isoindolinones structural motif, which includes all kinds of tetrasubstituted carbon centers, spirocyclic or not, all carbon or heteroatom&#8208;containing, show wide spectra of biological and pharmaceutical activities. Therefore, the synthetic methodologies for preparing these skeletons have received significant attention during the past decade. In general, these strategies can be classified into two major categories, namely, the direct functionalization of parent isoindolinones and the lactam ring formation involved reactions, judging by whether there is a lactam ring formation process or not during the production of the final 3,3&#8208;disubstituted isoindolinones. Since the second strategy has been well reviewed, this review mainly summarizes the recent progress in the direct functionalization of parent isoindolinones to construct 3,3&#8208;disubstituted isoindolinones via three subdivided strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereospecific Synthesis of Tetrahydroisoquinolines via Radical Cyclization: Application in the Synthesis of ent&#8208;Tadalafil</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Enantioselective synthesis of 1&#8208;substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines from L&#8208;Dopa methyl ester through intramolecular aryl radical cyclization is demonstrated. The strategy consists of bromination of (S)&#8208;2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;bromo&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)propanoate followed by condensation with various aldehydes to afford bromoimidate ester. Aryl radicals generated from bromoimidate ester under the radical generating conditions (nBu3SnH/AIBN) cyclizes via 6&#8208;endo	mode to afford cis&#8208;1&#8208;substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines exclusively in 99% ee. The utility of this synthetic protocol is demonstrated in the synthesis of (6S, 12aS) Tadalafil (5 steps, 21%, 99% ee).</dc:description>

         <title>Rh(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Direct C6&#8722;H Arylation of 2&#8208;Pyridones with Aryl Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed C6&#8208;selective C&#8722;H arylation of 2&#8208;pyridones with inexpensive, readily available, safe and structurally diverse aryl carboxylic acids with the aid of a pyridine directing group is developed. This decarbonylative arylation protocol features an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle catalytic system, and is amenable to diversely substituted 2&#8208;pyridones and aryl carboxylic acids. It allows access to a wide range of C6&#8208;arylated 2&#8208;pyridones, including those that are difficult to prepare using conventional C&#8722;H arylation processes. The method tolerates various electron&#8208;neutral, electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient functional groups, and affords the products in 41&#8211;91% yields.

         <title>Synthesis of Fused Dihydroazepine Derivatives of Fullerenes by a Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A synthetic methodology is reported that functionalizes C60 and C70 fullerenes with dihydroazepine rings by a cascade reaction encompassing a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;bisallenes and a [4+2] cycloaddition. This transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction provides a versatile and step&#8208;economical approach to the synthesis of 6,7&#8208;membered polyheterocyclic fullerene adducts. Electrochemical characterization of the products obtained ventures their application in organic and perovskite photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Enantioselective Organocatalyzed aza&#8208;Michael Addition Reaction of 2&#8208;Hydroxybenzophenone Imines to Nitroolefins under Batch and Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Herein, an asymmetric organocatalytic aza&#8208;Michael addition reaction of ketimines to nitroolefins is presented. The use of 2&#8208;hydroxybenzophenone imine improves the enantioselective addition of N&#8208;centered nucleophiles to nitroalkenes by means of intramolecular hydrogen bond formation at the imine moiety. Moreover, the versatility of the process is demonstrated under both batch and flow conditions, showing the synthesis of a large variety of nitroamine derivatives with excellent yields and enantioselectivities. In addition, we applied this methodology to the formal synthesis of VNI, a drug&#8208;like scaffold for the treatment of Chagas disease.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Oxidative Condensation of Catechols, Aldehydes and NH4OAc towards Benzoxazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Benzoxazoles extensively exist in biologically active compounds, natural products, pharmaceuticals and functional materials. Thus, facile and green synthesis of such valuable compounds from easily available substrates will make a contribution to drug, material, and fine chemistry. A method for the synthesis of benzoxazoles from catechols, aldehydes and ammonium acetate is developed using NaIO4 as oxidant under metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions. A broad range of benzoxazoles including some fluorescent whitening agents, JTP&#8208;426467 and tafamidis analogues are synthesized in 56&#8211;95% yields with outstanding functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations suggest that an interesting o&#8208;iminocyclohexa&#8208;diene alcohol intermediate is involved in the reaction. These salient features of the protocol make it an alternative for the synthesis of benzoxazoles.

         <title>C1&#8208;Symmetric Atropisomeric NHC Palladium(II) Complexes:  Synthesis, Resolution and Characterization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Series of chiral palladium(II) allyl and cinnamyl complexes bearing a C1&#8208;symmetric N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes were synthesized from achiral precursors. The chirality of theses complexes results from the formation of the carbene&#8208;palladium bond which restricts the rotation of dissymmetric N&#8208;aryl substituents of the NHC and thus creates an axis of chirality. Chiral HPLC at preparative scale enabled the resolution of racemic complexes and provided a straightforward access to complexes with excellent enantiopurities (&gt;99.5% ee). Enantiopure complexes were studied by crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and electronic circular.dichroism (ECD).  Their configuration stabilities were investigated both experimentally and theoretically through the determination of the rotational barrier values. These complexes were tested for the intramolecular &#945;&#8208;arylation of amides, with a moderate chiral induction (up to 54% ee).</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic, Organic Oxidant Promoted, Enamine C&#8722;H Oxidation/Cyclopropanation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate that organic, single&#8208;electron oxidant in the presence of diarylprolinol silylether type catalyst serves as a tool for the transformation of electron&#8208;rich enamines to iminium ions. These iminium ions take part in a subsequent Michael&#8208;initiated ring&#8208;closure (MIRC) reaction with in&#8197;situ present nucleophile giving rise to overall cyclopropanation reaction of saturated aldehydes. Stereodefined cyclopropanes are obtained in high yields and selectivities. This one&#8208;pot transformation represents the additional example of saturated aldehydes being used in the coupled one&#8208;pot processes.

The presence of internal alkyne in the starting materials directed the reaction towards through [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition, while terminal alkyne led to a spirocyclization reaction between azomethine ylide and terminal unsaturated C&#8208;C bond.

Abstract
Heterocycles play an essential role in medicinal as well as in organic synthetic chemistry. The synthesis of these valuable scaffolds is an emerging and challenging field of today&#8216;s research in organic chemistry. In recent years, several heterocycles as new synthons have emerged as potential nucleophiles in asymmetric transformations. Among them, 5H&#8208;oxazol&#8208;4&#8208;one is one of the strategic synthons for synthesizing enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acid derivatives, which are otherwise very challenging via direct installation of a hydroxy group at the &#945;&#8208;position of carbonyls. Over the years, considerable progress has been made to establish new and efficient methodologies under mild reaction conditions exploiting metal&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalysis. This review presents a comprehensive summary of various catalytic development in asymmetric synthesis employing 5H&#8208;oxazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones as &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acid surrogates.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Spirocyclic Ether from ortho&#8208;Carbonylarylacetylenols via Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization under Acidic Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
ortho&#8208;Carbonylarylacetylenol, can be utilized for the synthesis of several important core structures. In this work, a method is developed for the diastereoselective synthesis of spirocyclic ethers using a silver catalyst under the presence of acid. This protocol can be applied to a variety of substrates resulting in the corresponding products in 35&#8211;97% yields with good diastereoselectivity. The proposed reaction mechanisms and stereoselectivity outcome of the corresponding products are investigated using DFT calculation. This current protocol can be applied to a broad range of substrates which would be useful for the creation of libraries of spirocylic ethers

Abstract
Herein we report a catalytic, easily scalable protocol for the enantioselective synthesis of Tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives, using a biphasic system composed by catalytic DBU in DME and aqueous solutions of Na2CO3. Under very mild reaction conditions, without using metal or chiral additives, this heterogeneous system promotes the degradative rearrangement of functionalized N&#8208;aryl sulphonyl &#945;&#8208;amino esters into the corresponding tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;amino esters, with high enantiomeric ratios (up to 97.5:2.5) and good yields (up to 95%).

Abstract
An asymmetric organocatalytic aza&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction was developed to give the enantioenriched &#916;4&#8208;isoxazoline scaffold bearing a quaternary&#8208;substituted stereogenic centre in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields and enantioselectivity (50&#8211;99%, 55&#8211;&gt;99% ee). This protocol involves the in&#8197;situ generated isoxazolium ions in the presence of a chiral phosphoric acid followed by the heteroarene addition through asymmetric counteranion&#8208;directed catalysis.

The front cover picture, prepared by Dr D. Prukala, illustrates ethylene&#8208;bridged 7,8&#8208;dimethoxyflavinium salt excited with blue light. This salt is characterised by relatively long&#8208;lived excited state and high photostability thus making it superior among flavin photocatalysts for aerobic oxidations/oxygenations. The flavinium salt was demonstrated to provide photooxidation of various benzylic substrates, even those with high oxidation potential (X = Cl, CF3). Details can be found in the Research Article by Sikorski, Cibulka and co&#8208;workers. (A. Pokluda, Z. Anwar, V. Boguschov&#225;, I. Anusiewicz, P. Skurski, M. Sikorski, R. Cibulka, Adv. Synth.

         <title>Discovery and Engineering of Bacterial (&#8722;)&#8208;Isopiperitenol Dehydrogenases to Enhance (&#8722;)&#8208;Menthol Precursor Biosynthesis</title>

Abstract
Microbial synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;menthol, a compound of plant origin, is of great importance because of the high demand for this product and related sustainability issues. However, the total biosynthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;menthol from easily available feedstocks like (&#8722;)&#8208;limonene by engineered microbial hosts is stalled by the poor protein expression or activity of several enzymes from the native (&#8722;)&#8208;menthol biosynthesis pathway of mint (Mentha piperita). Among these unsatisfied steps, (&#8722;)&#8208;isopiperitenol dehydrogenase (IPDH) catalyzed oxidation reaction of (&#8722;)&#8208;trans&#8208;isopiperitenol was one of the bottlenecks that need to be optimized. In this work, two novel bacterial enzymes with IPDH activity were discovered to replace their inefficient counterpart from plant cells in microbial (&#8722;)&#8208;menthol synthesis. Two key residues in PaIPDH from Pseudomonas aeruginosa were mutated to PaIPDHE95F/Y199V with 4.4&#8208;fold improved specific activity than PaIPDH. The mechanism for the beneficial mutations was elucidated by molecular dynamics simulations. PaIPDHE95F/Y199V was used to synthesize (&#8722;)&#8208;isopiperitenone from (&#8722;)&#8208;limonene in&#8197;vivo via a self&#8208;sufficient cofactor cascade enzyme reaction, affording a 3.7&#8208;fold enhanced titer of (&#8722;)&#8208;isopiperitenone compared with that obtained using the original mint IPDH (MpIPDH). The bacterial enzyme PaIPDHE95F/Y199V can be applied in the future for constructing a more efficient artificial pathway to biosynthesize (&#8722;)&#8208;menthol in a microbial whole&#8208;cell system.

         <dc:description>A gold&#8208;catalyzed carbocyclization/C=N bond formation cascade reaction has been developed for the synthesis of polyfunctionalized 4&#8208;iminonaphthalenones and indenes in good to high yields under mild reaction conditions. The reaction goes through 5/6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig diazo&#8208;yne carbocyclization to form the endocyclic vinyl carbene species from corresponding alkyne&#8208;tethered diazo compounds, followed by electrophilic addition/N&#8208;O bond cleavage/aromatization sequence with benzo[c]isoxazoles, which features a C=N bond formation process. In addition, the resulting products could be converted into multi&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;naphthol derivatives in high yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Substituent&#8208;controlled Divergent Cascade Cycloaddition Reaction of Chalcones and Arylalkynols: Access to Diverse Spiroketals and Oxa&#8208;bridged Fused Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two divergent cascade cycloaddition reactions of chalcones and arylalkynols were developed in the presence of PtI2. Through introducing different substituents onto the chalcones, two completely different products, spiroketals and oxa&#8208;bridged fused heterocycles were obtained in high yields under the same reaction conditions, respectively. And the control experiments were carried out to elucidate this high chemoselectivity. This substituent&#8208;controlled cascade cycloaddition reaction has the advantages of mild reaction conditions and simple operation, as provides a facile synthetic route for diverse complex oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles.</dc:description>

Abstract
A transition metal&#8208; and azide&#8208;free approach is explored to synthesize 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles under sunlight. The reaction proceeds via C&#8722;N and N&#8722;N bond formations. These regioselective 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles are obtained from isatin Schiff bases, benzaldehydes and tosylhydrazine in the presence of base. This protocol offers the structurally diverse 1,2,3&#8208;triazole derivatives with 75&#8211;90% yields.

         <title>Direct use of benzylic alcohols for multicomponent synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl quinazolinones utilizing the &#960;&#8208;benzylpalladium(II) system in water</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate the direct use of benzylic alcohols for a multicomponent reaction of readily available isatoic anhydrides with amines in water, which is a straightforward synthetic route for the direct construction of a series of 2&#8208;aryl quinazolinones. This one&#8208;pot synthetic method involves a dehydrative N&#8208;benzylation of in situ generated anthranilamides followed by an amide&#8208;directed benzylic C&#8208;H amination process utilizing the &#960;&#8208;benzylPd(II) system. Comparison of independent rate measurements using benzyl alcohol and its deuterated form gave a kinetic isotope effect of 3.5. Therefore, the benzylic C&#8211;H bond is cleaved in the rate&#8208;determining step. We successfully carried out a gram&#8208;scale reaction in 85% yield with simplified product isolation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Concise Route to Cyclic Amines from Nitroarenes and Ketoacids under Iron&#8208;catalyzed Hydrosilylation Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starting from nitroarenes, under hydrosilylation conditions, using a well&#8208;defined N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene iron(0) catalyst, (IMes)Fe(CO)4, the corresponding aniline derivatives were produced in 61&#8208;92% isolated yields. More impressively, a selective synthesis of cyclic amines such as pyrrolidines, piperidines and azepanes were conducted from levulinic acid,1,5&#8208; and 1,6&#8208;keto acids, respectively. The sequential procedure proceeded efficiently under both visible light irradiation and thermal conditions with 20 examples in isolated yields up to 69%.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first example of homogeneously catalyzed hydrogenation of the N=N bond of azo compounds using a complex of an earth&#8208;abundant&#8208;metal. The hydrogenation reaction is catalyzed by a manganese pincer complex, proceeds under mild conditions, and yields amines, which makes this methodology a sustainable alternative route for the conversion of azo compounds. A plausible mechanism involving metal&#8208;ligand cooperation and hydrazine intermediacy is proposed based on mechanistic studies.</dc:description>

Abstract
An efficient enantioselective dearomative cycloaddition reaction between either 2&#8208;nitroindoles or 2&#8208;nitrobenzofurans and N&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethylisatin ketimines by dipeptided phosphonium salt catalysis is firstly established. This protocol provides a new and facile synthetic approach to create a variety of CF3&#8208;containing polycyclic spirooxindole derivatives under mild reaction conditions with high yields in excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (all &gt;20:1 dr, up to 95% ee).

Abstract
Multi N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene(NHC)&#8208;modified iridium catalysts were employed in the &#946;&#8208;alkylation of alcohols; dimerization of primary alcohols (Guerbet reaction), cross&#8208;coupling of secondary and primary alcohols, and intramolecular cyclization of alcohols. Mechanistic studies of Guerbet reaction, including kinetic experiments, mass analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, were employed to explain the fast reaction promoted by bimetallic catalysts, and the dramatic reactivity increase of monometallic catalysts at the late stage of the reaction.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Fused Indolines via Copper (II)&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomatizing Cyclization of Indoles</title>

Abstract
Herein, a copper(II)&#8208;catalyzed dearomative cyclization amination of N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminobenzoyl) indoles is presented. Under mild reaction conditions, the cyclization proceeds to afford tetracyclic indolines by forming a new C&#8722;N bond in good yields. The tetracyclic 5a,6&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,1&#8208;b]quinazolin&#8208;12(5H)&#8208;ones are obtained in good to excellent yields (up to 99% yield) by using trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH) mediated N&#8722;Ts bond cleavage. The obtained compounds could be easily functionalized by simple synthetic methods.

         <title>Alkene, Bromide, and ROH &#8211; How To Achieve Selectivity? Electrochemical Synthesis of Bromohydrins and Their Ethers</title>

Abstract
Bromohydrins and their ethers were electrochemically synthesized via hydroxy&#8208; and alkoxybromination of alkenes using potassium bromide and water or alcohols. High selectivity of bromohydrins formation was achieved only with the use of DMSO as the solvent and an acid as the additive. The proposed combination of starting reagents, additives, and solvents allowed to form bromohydrins or their ethers selectively despite the variety of side&#8208;products (epoxides, dibromides, diols). Bromohydrins were obtained in high yields, up to 96%, with a broad substrate scope in an undivided electrochemical cell equipped with glassy carbon and platinum electrodes at high current density.

Abstract
A metal&#8208;free approach for the synthesis of 5&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoles via I2&#8208;mediated [4+1] annulation of readily available trifluoroacetimidohydrazides and methyl ketones has been achieved. The transformation involves iodination/Kornblum oxidation, intermolecular dehydration condensation and an iodine&#8208;mediated intramolecular cyclization/aromatization sequence. The developed protocol can be easily scaled up to 3&#8197;mmol scale without obvious efficiency decrease and be implemented by a consecutive one&#8208;pot manner.

Abstract
A route to &#947;&#8208;keto sulfones through a metal&#8208;free reaction of cyclopropanols, DABCO&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(SO2)2 and alkyl halides is described. This reaction occurs under mild conditions in the absence of any catalysts, additives, or oxidants. Various functional groups including as ester, amino, methoxy, bromo, trifluoromethyl, nitro and carbonyl are tolerated well in this transformation, and the corresponding &#947;&#8208;keto sulfones are afforded in 35% to 95% yields. The proposed mechanism implies that this reaction proceeds through &#947;&#8208;keto sulfinate intermediate generated in&#8197;situ, which further undergoes nucleophilic substitution with alkyl halides leading to &#947;&#8208;keto sulfones.

Abstract
Enzyme discovery for use in the manufacture of chemicals, requiring high stereoselectivities, continues to be an important avenue of research. Here, a sequence directed metagenomics approach is described to identify short chain carbonyl reductases. PCR from a metagenomic template generated 37 enzymes, with an average 25% sequence identity, twelve of which showed interesting activities in initial screens. Six of the most productive enzymes were then tested against a panel of 21 substrates, including bulkier substrates that have been noted as challenging in biocatalytic reductions. Two enzymes were selected for further studies with the Wieland Miescher ketone. Notably, enzyme SDR&#8208;17, when co&#8208;expressed with a co&#8208;factor recycling system produced the anti&#8208;(4aR,5S) isomer in excellent isolated yields of 89% and 99% e.e. These results demonstrate the viability of a sequence directed metagenomics approach for the identification of multiple homologous sequences with low similarity, that can yield highly stereoselective enzymes with applicability in industrial biocatalysis.

Abstract
2&#8208;(2&#8208;Oxoalkylidene)&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazolidine derivatives were synthesized in good to excellent yields regiospecifically through the catalyst&#8208;free electrophilic ring expansion of N&#8208;unprotected aziridines and the ketene C=O double bond of &#945;&#8208;oxoketenes, in&#8197;situ generated from the microwave&#8208;assisted Wolff rearrangement of 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diketones. The ring expansion predominantly underwent an SN1 process and the hydrogen bond decides the (E)&#8208;configuration of products.

Abstract
Reduction of phosphine oxides into the corresponding phosphines using PhSiH3 as a reducing agent and Ph3C+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; as an initiator is described. The process is highly efficient, reducing a broad range of secondary and tertiary alkyl and arylphosphines, bearing various functional groups in generally good yields. The reaction is believed to proceed through the generation of a silyl cation, which reaction with the phosphine oxide provides a phosphonium salt, further reduced by the silane to afford the desired phosphine along with siloxanes.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Phloretin &#945;&#8208;Glucosides Using a Sucrose Phosphorylase Mutant and its Effect on Solubility, Antioxidant Properties and Skin Absorption</title>

Abstract
Glycosylation of polyphenols may increase their aqueous solubility, stability, bioavailability and pharmacological activity. Herein, we used a mutant of sucrose phosphorylase from Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum engineered to accept large polyphenols (variant TtSPP_R134A) to produce phloretin glucosides. The reaction was performed using 10% (v/v) acetone as cosolvent. The selective formation of a monoglucoside or a diglucoside (53% and 73% maximum conversion percentage, respectively) can be kinetically controlled. MS and 2D&#8208;NMR determined that the monoglucoside was phloretin 4&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside and the diglucoside phloretin&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;[&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranosyl&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;O&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside], a novel compound. The molecular features that determine the specificity of this enzyme for 4&#8217;&#8208;OH phenolic group were analysed by induced&#8208;fit docking analysis of each putative derivative, using the crystal structure of TtSPP and changing the mutated residue. The mono&#8208; and diglucoside were, respectively, 71&#8208; and 1200&#8208;fold more soluble in water than phloretin at room temperature. The &#945;&#8208;glucosylation decreased the antioxidant capacity of phloretin, measured by DPPH and ABTS assays; however, this loss was moderate and the activity could be recovered upon deglycosylation in&#8197;vivo. Since phloretin attracts a great interest in dermocosmetic applications, we analyzed the percutaneous absorption of glucosides and the aglycon employing a pig skin model. Although the three compounds were detected in all skin layers (except the fluid receptor), the diglucoside was present mainly on superficial layers.

Abstract
Stabilised sulfur ylides are synthetically appealing compounds, which reactivity under Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis has been poorly explored. Herein, we report a new catalyst&#8208; and substrate&#8208; dependent chemodivergent reaction between stabilised sulfur ylides and salicylaldehydes, leading to the (suprising) formation of 2H&#8208;chromenes or dihydrobenzofurans products. Particular attention was set on the unusual mechanisms involved. Two unique reaction routes including two ylide units in the reactions are proposed. These pathways were validated by performing a selectivity switch in some cases, enabled by the modulation of the nucleophilicity of the sulfur ylide, and by the loading of the Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst in the reaction.

Abstract
The substrate scope of the asymmetric allylation with zinc organyls catalyzed by 3,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl)&#8208;1,1&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl hydrogenphosphate (TRIP) has been extended to non&#8208;cyclic ester organozinc reagents and ketones. Tertiary chiral alcohols are obtained with ee's up to 94% and two stereogenic centers can be created. Compared to the previous lactone reagent the stereopreference switches almost completely, proving the fact that the nature of the organometallic compound is of immense importance for the asymmetry of the product.

         <title>Effective [3+1+1+1] Cycloaddition to Six&#8208;Membered Carbocycle Based on DMSO as Dual Carbon Synthon</title>

Abstract
A [3+1+1+1] cycloaddition was developed among 2&#8208;arylpropene, ketone and DMSO in the presence of K2S2O8. 2&#8208;arylpropene provides three carbons, ketone offers one carbon, and DMSO as dual carbon donor contributes two carbons to the six&#8208;membered carbocycle. It gave the cyclohexene motif and spirocyclohexene skeleton. Four C&#8722;C bonds formed in this process. Both propylene and ketone could be well tolerated and give the corresponding cyclohexene or spirocyclohexene motif in useful yields. Based on the controlled experiments, a possible mechanism was proposed.

Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reactions have allowed researchers to attain unorthodox bond formation and elusive chemical processes under mild and inherently safe reaction conditions. However, these methods have relied heavily on Ru&#8208; and Ir&#8208;based complexes or metal&#8208;free chromophores. While the heavy transition metal complexes are limited by their high cost, toxicity, and adverse environmental effects. Metal&#8208;free photo&#8208;redox catalysts are restricted due to their poorer photo&#8208;stability. In order to overcome these shortcomings, extensive research aimed towards utilizing 3d&#8208;transition metals has come to the forefront. Manganese, in this regard, holds great promise as a versatile and economically sustainable 3d&#8208;transition metal catalyst. Hence, it is not surprising that recent years have witnessed several advances in visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated manganese catalysis in areas of organic, polymer, and materials chemistry. Manganese&#8208;based heterogeneous systems have also been utilized to effect dimerization and oxygenation reactions showcasing the versatility of manganese. Moreover, manganese has enabled late&#8208;stage functionalization of valuable medicinal compounds and natural products, which are all important from the viewpoint of medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry. In the present review, comprehensive discussions on the advances, significance, approaches, and mechanistic aspects have been added for each photochemical reaction process. Further, the reaction scope, limitations, and future prospects of visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced manganese catalysis have also been reviewed.

Abstract
For almost 40&#8197;years, difluoromethylene phosphonates have proven to be versatile molecular tools in biochemical studies owing to their close resemblance to naturally occurring phosphates and phosphonates. As bioisosteric, non&#8208;hydrolyzable analogs of these essential molecules, difluoromethylene phosphonates can target the critical parts of the cellular machinery and therefore exhibit a diverse spectrum of biological activity. In the past ten years, there have appeared many new methods for the synthesis of difluoromethylene phosphonates. Most notably, photoredox catalysis has firmly entered the field, while cross&#8208;coupling and nucleophilic strategies have met considerable elaboration and refinement, entirely in accord with the current trends in synthetic organic chemistry. Herein, we introduce difluoromethylene phosphonates as a distinct, high&#8208;tech subclass of synthetic phosphonates resulting from the research efforts on the cross&#8208;section of organophosphorus, organofluorine, and bioorganic chemistry. We then proceed to the discussion of general methods for the preparation of difluoromethylene phosphonates, comprehensively reviewing reactions developed in the past 15&#8197;years while providing the context of earlier works where appropriate. Finally, we present selected examples of molecules with high biological activity, their biological targets, and the synthetic steps employed for their preparation.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular alkene thioacylation reaction initiated by the activation of thioester C(acyl)&#8722;S bonds is reported. This approach successfully suppressed decarbonylation and &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination with related acyl and alkyl metal thiolate intermediates, providing an efficient and atom&#8208;economical method to access indanone scaffolds. Mechanistic studies provide support for C(acyl)&#8722;Pd bond insertion of olefins. The synthetic utility of this protocol is demonstrated by the further conversion of the newly formed methylene sulfide substituent.

It demonstrates that the 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition adduct from N&#8208;o&#8208;AQMs could undergo further cyclization with the tethered alkyne moiety to afford N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Chemoselective and Stereoselective Approach to Synthesis of Spiro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;Lactams with Potent Anticancer Activity</title>

Abstract
Chemoselective approaches were developed for derivatizing diastereoselective chromanone spiro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams through the Michael&#8208;type addition by using amide as a weak nucleophile to construct the spiro&#8208;carbon center under basic conditions. To expand the scope of this post&#8208;Ugi cascade reaction, a new series of oxidized chromone derivatives was synthesized by altering solvent from EtOH to DMF. Compounds 7&#8201;a and 7&#8201;b which could be synthesized in one day, demonstrated comparable anticancer activities with legendary anticancer drug paclitaxel in the PANC and U87&#8197;cell lines. This methodology offers a new approach to construct spiro&#8208;carbon centers with functionalized chromanones or chromones under mild reaction conditions.

Abstract
A [4+3] annulation of 2&#8208;ylideneoxindoles with crotonate&#8208;derived sulfur ylides has been developed. A series of oxepino[3,2&#8208;b]indoles were prepared in moderate to excellent yields (62&#8208;93%) under mild conditions. Moreover, the synthetic oxepino[3,2&#8208;b] indoles can be further transformed into more complex cyclopropa[5,6]oxepino[3,2&#8208;b]indoles via a [2+1] cyclopropanation. In addition, the synthetic compounds show certain antiproliferative activity against K562 and MCF&#8208;7 cells, and its IC50 values for these two kinds of tumor cells up to 5.40&#177;0.88&#8197;&#956;M and 18.41&#177;0.50&#8197;&#956;M, respectively.

Abstract
A dynamic kinetic resolution &#8211; asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (DKR&#8208;ATH) methodology of &#945;&#8208;keto/enol&#8208;lactams was developed. We also propose a possible catalytic mechanism evolving a transition state stabilized by &#951;6&#8208;arene CH&#8722;O interaction. The efficient approach can be applied to a wide range of substrates including non&#8208;aryl ones which would be difficult to prepare by other asymmetric reduction methods.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dynamic kinetic resolution &#8211; asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (DKR-ATH) methodology of &#945;-keto/enol-lactams was developed. We also propose a possible catalytic mechanism evolving a transition state stabilized by &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-arene CH&#8722;O interaction. The efficient approach can be applied to a wide range of substrates including non-aryl ones which would be difficult to prepare by other asymmetric reduction methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of glycosyl chlorides with aryl bromides has been developed. The reaction proceeds smoothly under visible&#8208;light irradiation and features the use of bench&#8208;stable glycosyl chlorides, allowing the highly stereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;aryl glycosides.

Abstract
Herein, a metal&#8208;free strategy for the aerobic oxidative cleavage of the inert C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond was developed. Deconstruction of morpholine derivatives was conducted using visible light as an energy source and O2 as an oxidant under mild conditions. This procedure demonstrated suitable selectivity and functional group tolerance. Moreover, a possible mechanism involving a radical process was proposed based on a series of mechanism exploration and control experiments.

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step double annulation strategy to produce isoindolo[2,1&#8208;b]isoquinolin&#8208;5(7H)&#8208;ones via the reaction of N&#8208;methoxybenzamides with symmetrical/unsymmetrical alkynes and alkenes has been developed, which proceeds through Ru&#8208;catalysed unsymmetrical double annulations using a single DG under single catalytic conditions. Furthermore, we have developed amide&#8208;alkyne regioselective annulations using unsymmetrical internal alkynes having oxygen/nitrogen substituents leading to a single isomer. The developed procedure offers broad substrate scope, tolerates a wide range of functional groups and affords good product yields.

Abstract
Presented herein is a selective synthesis of 3&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;fluorovinyl)indoles and 3&#8208;acylindoles via the coupling of 1&#8208;phenylpyrazolidinones with &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethylene alkynes. Mechanistically, the formation of 3&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;fluorovinyl)indoles is resulted from a cascade process including Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H bond cleavage, regioselective triple bond insertion, pyrazolidinone ring&#8208;opening, indole ring&#8208;formation and HF elimination. Interestingly, when this reaction was carried out in CH3OH/H2O instead of CH3CN, the in&#8197;situ formed 3&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;fluorovinyl)indoles readily undergo a hydration process to afford 3&#8208;acylindole derivatives. This protocol features with controllable selectivity, simultaneous formation of both the heterocyclic scaffold and the monofluoroalkenyl moiety, atom&#8208;economy, substrate diversity, good functional group tolerance and redox&#8208;neutral reaction conditions. Anticancer screening of selected products against two human cancer cell lines demonstrated their potential as lead compounds for drug development.

         <dc:description>Enantioselective iodocycloetherifications can be conducted using sterically highly demanding BINOL&#8208;based phosphoric acid diesters as catalyst. To achieve highly enantioselective reactions, cocatalysis by triphenylphosphine selenide is necessary. With cocatalysis, good to excellent enantioselectivities can be achieved for a broad range of substrates using catalyst and cocatalyst loadings as low as 1 mol%. The triphenylphosphine selenide cocatalyst itself does not strongly influence diastereoselectivity, but leads to higher reactivity and, in combination with a BINOL&#8208;based phosphoric acid diester, to good enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Potassium Base&#8208;Catalyzed Michael Additions of Allylic Alcohols to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Amides: Scope and Mechanistic Insights</title>

Abstract
We report herein the first KHMDS&#8208;catalyzed Michael additions of allylic alcohols to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides through allylic isomerization. The reaction proceeds smoothly in the presence of only 5&#8197;mol% of KHMDS to afford a variety of 1,5&#8208;ketoamides in high yields. Mechanistic investigations, including experimental and computational studies, reveal that the KHMDS&#8208;catalyzed in&#8208;situ generation of the enolate from the allylic alcohol through a tunneling&#8208;assisted 1,2&#8208;hydride shift is the key to the success of this transformation.

         <title>Electrochemical&#8208;In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Oxidative Sulfonylation of Phenols with Sulfinic Acids as an Access to Sulfonylated Hydroquinones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The electrochemical in&#8208;situ oxidative sulfonylation of phenols with sulfinic acids access to sulfonylated hydroquinones has been developed. A series of sulfonylated hydroquinones were prepared under mild mediator&#8208;, catalyst&#8208; and exogenous&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free conditions. Notably, such an electrochemical in&#8208;situ&#8208;oxidative synthetic strategy presented wide functional group tolerance and amenability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis with 62&#8211;80% yields.

         <title>Synthesis of Enantioenriched Amines by Iron&#8208;Catalysed Amination of Alcohols Employing at Least One Achiral Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The synthesis of a broad range of enantioenriched amines by the direct Fe&#8208;catalysed coupling of amines with alcohols through the borrowing hydrogen strategy, while at least one of these substrates is achiral is reported. When starting from &#945;&#8208;chiral amines and achiral alcohols, a wide range of enantioenriched amine products, including N&#8208;heterocyclic moieties can be obtained with complete retention of stereochemistry and the power of this method is demonstrated in the one&#8208;step synthesis of known pharmaceuticals from commercially available, simple enantiopure primary amines and achiral alcohols. It was also found that the use of &#946;&#8208;branched enantioenriched primary alcohols and achiral amines as reaction partners leads to a partial loss of stereochemical integrity in the final product, however, a systematic optimization enabled partial retention of enantiopurity and possible parameters effecting for racemization were identified.

Abstract
We herein report an efficient and systematic synthesis of 1&#8208;pyrrolines from cyclobutyl azides under thermal and neutral conditions. The reaction proceeded without any additional reagents, and nitrogen was generated as the sole by&#8208;product. Furthermore, the generated 1&#8208;pyrrolines could be continuously transformed into pyrroles, N&#8208;Boc&#8208;amines, and oxaziridines in an one&#8208;pot manner.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Crystallization&#8208;induced diastereomer transformations (CIDT) enable isolation of the target compounds in high enantio&#8208; and diastereomeric purities and with up to quantitative yields simply by filtration. Numerous inspiring examples of this appealing synthetic strategy reported over the last fifteen years are reviewed. Important observations along with aspects to consider when designing CIDT experiments are discussed.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthetic Use of Migration Reactions of Allyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Allyl alcohol compounds are widely used structural units. In recent years, considerable attention has been devoted to exploring the migration reactions of allyl alcohols via semipinacol or neophyl rearrangements, and so on, providing an attractive and powerful strategy for obtaining various important carbonyl compounds.
However, to date, no review has been published that summarizes the significant advances in the preparation of functionalized carbonyl compounds using these migration rearrangement reactions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allyl alcohol compounds are widely used structural units. In recent years, considerable attention has been devoted to exploring the migration reactions of allyl alcohols via semipinacol or neophyl rearrangements, and so on, providing an attractive and powerful strategy for obtaining various important carbonyl compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, to date, no review has been published that summarizes the significant advances in the preparation of functionalized carbonyl compounds using these migration rearrangement reactions. In this paper, the latest progress in the use of allyl alcohols as flexible synthons involving group migration is introduced, and the reaction scopes, limitations, and some of the mechanisms are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we reported a protocol for synthesis of oxy&#8208;substituted ferrocenes via cobalt&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8722;H alkoxylation under mild conditions. Notably, alcohol serves as an both alkoxide reagent and a solvent. Various ferrocene amides including estrone&#8208;derived ferrocene amide are compatible with these reaction conditions. Moreover, control experiments suggested that this alkoxylation might undergo a Co(III)/Co(IV)/Co(II) catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

Abstract
The iridium&#8208;catalysed enantioselective intramolecular allylic substitution of pyrimidine&#8208;tethered allylic carbonates was developed. A wide range of chiral pyrimidine&#8208;fused diazepinone derivatives were successfully constructed in 88&#8211;96% yields with 85&#8211;99% ees. This work further highlights the power of chiral&#8208;bridged biphenyl phosphoramidites in asymmetric synthesis.

Abstract
An I2&#8208;promoted strategy has been developed for the synthesis of thiazol&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;one derivatives from 1,3&#8208;diketones with potassium thiocyanate. This [3+2] cyclization reaction involves C&#8722;S and C&#8722;N bond formation and exhibits good functional group tolerance. A series of thiazol&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;one derivatives are obtained in moderate to good yields.

Abstract
Chiral contiguous bisaziridines were prepared by the aziridination of chiral 3&#8208;[1&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylethyl)aziridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)]acrylaldehydes with either N&#8208;Boc&#8208;O&#8208;tosyl or N&#8208;Ts&#8208;O&#8208;tosyl hydroxylamine as a nitrogen source and (2R)&#8208; or (2S)&#8208;[diphenyl(trimethylsilyloxy)methyl]pyrrolidine as a chiral organocatalyst. The regioselective ring opening of bisaziridines afforded chiral nitrogen&#8208;rich molecules.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereoselective Synthesis of (Z)&#8208;Conjugated Enynyl Homoallylic Alcohols</title>

Abstract
The diastereoselective synthesis of anti&#8208;homoallylic alcohols bearing conjugated (Z)&#8208;enynes through a palladium&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction is described. This reaction features a broad substrate scope, good functional group compatibility, and high levels of (Z)&#8208;alkene stereocontrol. In this reaction, Pd(0) functions as a catalyst in two fundamental steps of the tandem sequence: 1) the generation of a borylated &#960;&#8208;allylpalladium species from bifunctional conjunctive reagents, inducing umpolung allylation of aldehydes, and 2) C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp) cross&#8208;coupling. Further transformations of the obtained products highlight their synthetic utility.

         <title>Trichloroisocyanuric Acid&#8208;Promoted Synthesis of Arylselenides and Aryltellurides from Diorganyl Dichalcogenides and Arylboronic Acids at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method for the synthesis of arylselenides and aryltellurides has been established based on the oxidative cross&#8208;coupling between diorganyl dichalcogenides and aryl boronic acids. With trichloroisocyanuric acid as an oxidant, the reaction proceeded smoothly to afford the desired products in 45&#8211;97% yields at ambient temperature. Three reaction reagents used in this method are stoichiometric and the oxidation by&#8208;product isocyanuric acid can be easily isolated and recovered. Besides of arylboronic acids, aryl trifluoroborates and aryl trihydroxyborates salts are also able to perform this transformation.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Selective N&#8208;Arylation of Oxadiazolones by Diaryliodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Here, we report the method for copper&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation of diverse oxadiazolones by diaryliodonium salts under mild conditions in high yields (up to 92%) using available CuI as a catalyst. The developed method allows utilizing both symmetric and unsymmetric diaryliodonium salts bearing auxiliary groups such as 2,4,6&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl (TMP). We found that the steric effects in aryl moieties determined the chemoselectivity of N&#8208; and O&#8208;arylation of the 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;5(4H)&#8208;ones. Mesityl&#8208;substituted diaryliodonium salts demonstrated the high potential as a selective arylation reagent. The structural study suggests that steric accessibility of N&#8208;atom in 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;5(4H)&#8208;ones impact to arylation with sterically hindered diaryliodonium salts. The synthetic application of proposed method was also demonstrated on selective arylation of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;ones and 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;5&#8208;thiol.

Abstract
The synthesis of trans&#8208;4a,12b&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[f,h]quinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones (2), dibenzo[f,h]quinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones (3) and 3,4&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[f,h]quinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones (4) via photo&#8208;induced annulation of 6&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones (1) under irradiation of a 313&#8197;nm UV light was described. Compounds 2 were obtained in 82&#8211;95% yields when the irradiation time was 3&#8197;h. Products 3 were obtained by irradiating 1 for 12&#8197;h in the presence of iodine. Heating the solutions of 2 in DMF at 130&#8201;&#176;C for 24&#8197;h gave compounds 4 via a double 1,3&#8208;H shift. The demonstrated protocols showed the diversity of photo&#8208;induced cyclization of compounds 1.

         <title>Oxidative Cleavage of Indoles Mediated by Urea Hydrogen Peroxide or H2O2 in Polar Solvents</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The oxidative cleavage of indoles (Witkop oxidation) involving the use of H2O2 or urea hydrogen peroxide in combination with a polar solvent has been described. Among these solvents, 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) stands out as the one affording the corresponding 2&#8208;ketoacetanilides generally in higher yields The protocol described has also enabled the oxidation of different pyrroles and furans derivatives. Furthermore, the procedure was implemented in a larger&#8208;scale and HFIP was distilled from the reaction mixture and reused (up to 4 cycles) without a significant detriment in the reaction outcome, which remarks its sustainability and applicability.

Abstract
A hydroxyl&#8208;assisted, organophotoredox/cobalt dual catalyzed annulation of 2&#8208;propynolphenols to form 2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;benzo[b]furans was developed by employing 1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) as photosensitizer and CoCl2(PPh3)2/5,5&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine as cobalt catalytic precursor. Various substrates and functional groups were tolerated. The practical applications of this reaction were further demonstrated by enlarged gram&#8208;scale and various derivations for complex heterocycles. Primary mechanistic studies suggested the involvement of cobalt&#8208;hydride mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process.

Abstract
A series of strong &#960;&#8208;acceptor polyfluorinated and dicationic chelating phosphines have been synthesized and evaluated in the Rh&#8208;catalysed dimerization of norbornadiene (NBD) into its thermodynamically more stable dimer, heptacyclo[6.6.0.02,6.03,13.04,11.05,9.010,14] tetradecane (HCTD). While dicationic ligands direct the dimerization towards HCTD, by the use of neutral polyfluorinated ancillary ligands endo&#8208;endo&#8208;heptacyclo [8.4.0.02,12.03,8.04,6.05,9.011,13]tetradecane (BINOR&#8722;S) is selectively obtained. In addition, a selective Pd&#8208;catalysed arylation at position C8 of the HCTD framework is achieved by the use of a picolylamide directing group previously attached at C1. Theoretical calculations have been performed to understand the origin of that regioselectivity.

&lt;p&gt;A series of strong &#960;-acceptor polyfluorinated and dicationic chelating phosphines have been synthesized and evaluated in the Rh-catalysed dimerization of norbornadiene (NBD) into its thermodynamically more stable dimer, heptacyclo[6.6.0.0&lt;sup&gt;2,6&lt;/sup&gt;.0&lt;sup&gt;3,13&lt;/sup&gt;.0&lt;sup&gt;4,11&lt;/sup&gt;.0&lt;sup&gt;5,9&lt;/sup&gt;.0&lt;sup&gt;10,14&lt;/sup&gt;] tetradecane (HCTD). While dicationic ligands direct the dimerization towards HCTD, by the use of neutral polyfluorinated ancillary ligands &lt;i&gt;endo-endo&lt;/i&gt;-heptacyclo [8.4.0.0&lt;sup&gt;2,12&lt;/sup&gt;.0&lt;sup&gt;3,8&lt;/sup&gt;.0&lt;sup&gt;4,6&lt;/sup&gt;.0&lt;sup&gt;5,9&lt;/sup&gt;.0&lt;sup&gt;11,13&lt;/sup&gt;]tetradecane (BINOR&#8722;S) is selectively obtained. In addition, a selective Pd-catalysed arylation at position C8 of the HCTD framework is achieved by the use of a picolylamide directing group previously attached at C1. Theoretical calculations have been performed to understand the origin of that regioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
The synthesis and photophysical properties of fluorescent pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines (PPs) are explored. An array of 5,7&#8208;disubstituted fluorescent PPs are prepared selectively by using &#946;,&#946;&#8208;difluoro peroxides as the 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;electrophiles. The synthesized PPs display a fairly significant stokes shift (up to 211&#8197;nm) and a large window of tunable emission wavelength that covers most of the visible spectrum (400&#8197;nm to 800&#8197;nm). Theoretical calculation indicates that the distinguished variation of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) ability upon the varied substituents is responsible for the color&#8208;tunable fluorescence emission.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Decarbonylative Trifluoromethylthiolation Enabled by Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex Photoactivation</title>

Abstract
A catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free decarbonylative trifluoromethylthiolation of aldehyde feedstocks has been developed. This operationally simple, scalable, and open&#8208;to&#8208;air transformation is driven by the selective photoexcitation of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes, stemming from the association of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (donor) with N&#8208;(trifluoromethylthio)phthalimide (acceptor), to trigger intermolecular single&#8208;electron transfer events under ambient&#8208; and visible light&#8208;promoted conditions. Extension to other electron acceptors enables the synthesis of thiocyanates and thioesters, as well as the difunctionalization of [1.1.1]propellane. The mechanistic intricacies of this photochemical paradigm are elucidated through a combination of experimental efforts and high&#8208;level quantum mechanical calculations [dispersion&#8208;corrected (U)DFT, DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T), and TD&#8208;DFT]. This comprehensive study highlights the necessity for EDA complexation for efficient alkyl radical generation. Computation of subsequent ground state pathways reveals that SH2 addition of the alkyl radical to the intermediate radical EDA complex is extremely exergonic and results in a charge transfer event from the dihydropyridine donor to the N&#8208;(trifluoromethylthio)phthalimide acceptor of the EDA complex. Experimental and computational results further suggest that product formation also occurs via SH2 reaction of alkyl radicals with 1,2&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)disulfane, generated in&#8208;situ through combination of thiyl radicals.

         <title>Pyrazoleamides in Catalytic Asymmetric Reactions: Recent Advances</title>

         <dc:description>
The front cover picture, designed by Sara and Luca Meninno, illustrates poorly reactive carboxylic acids and their ester and amide derivatives transformed into pyrazoleamides super&#8208;molecules with superpowers. Where carboxylic acids, esters and amides fail pyrazoleamides succeed, allowing the transition from a world with limited possibilities to a rich and futuristic world, meeting the increasing needs of the society. The super&#8208;powers consist in: i) easy one&#8208;step synthesis from readily available carboxylic acids; ii) easy metal and H&#8208;bonding coordination with catalysts, unlocking otherwise inaccessible reactions on carboxylic acid derivatives; iii) exceptional leaving group ability which enables several post&#8208;functionalizations with different nucleophiles. Pyrazoleamides, unlike carboxylic acid derivatives have proven increasingly useful starting materials in a variety of diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective metal&#8208;, organocatalytic and photoinduced transformations, giving access to valuable intermediates, heterocycles and pharmaceuticals. Details can be found in the Review by Meninno, Franco, Benaglia, and Lattanzi. (S. Meninno, F. Franco, M. Benaglia, A. Lattanzi, Adv. Synth.

Abstract
We report the development of a rapid approach for directly converting indoles into 2&#8208;oxindoles promoted by HOCl formed in&#8197;situ from the combination of (bis(trifluoroacetoxy) iodo)benzene (PIFA) and n&#8208;Bu4NCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O. The procedure is widely functional group tolerant and provides 2&#8208;oxindoles in up to 95% yield within 5&#8197;min. The potential applications of the developed methodology are demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale preparation of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole (11&#8201;a), the one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step syntheses of spiro&#8208;oxindoles 26&#8201;a and 26&#8201;b, and the formal synthesis of (&#8208;)&#8208;folicanthine (2).

         <title>Blue LED Induced Manganese (I) Catalysed Direct C2&#8722;H Activation of Pyrroles with Aryl Diazoesters</title>

Abstract
Herein, we have reported a blue LED mediated manganese pentacarbonyl bromide catalysed incorporation of carbene moieties from aryl diazoesters onto 1H&#8208;pyrroles via their selective C2&#8722;H activation. A manganese metal&#8208;carbene has been identified as the active catalyst to facilitate the reaction. Eighteen mono substituted pyrrole derivatives were isolated in good to excellent yields (67&#8594;82%) and the disubstituted products were also formed in minor quantities (5 to 8%). HPLC based kinetics study enabled optimization of the reaction. Control experiments, FT&#8208;IR, NMR and GC&#8208;MS based characterization elucidated the putative reaction mechanism.

         <title>Harnessing Additional Capability from in Water Reaction Conditions: Aldol versus Knoevenagel Chemoselectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Aldol reaction chemoselectivity, racemic or enantioselective, has not been previously demonstrated in the presence of Knoevenagel active functional groups. Here, we show that unhindered &#946;&#8208;diketones remain unreacted while a ketone moiety undergoes a highly enantioselective aldol desymmetrization resulting in three new stereogenic centers using in water reaction conditions. A mechanistic hypothesis for the chemoselective formation of either aldol or Knoevenagel products is presented. It elucidates how these amino acid catalyzed reactions completely suppress formation of the expected Knoevenagel product under in water (heterogeneous) reaction conditions, but not when water is present as a dissolved cosolvent (homogeneous). Finally, the developed hypothesis reinforces and expands the role of water at an organic&#8208;water interface.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Formal (4+2)&#8208; and (2+2+2)&#8208;Cycloaddition Between 1&#8208;Azadienes and Styrylmalonates as Analogues of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes</title>

Abstract
The reactions of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) and isomeric &#946;&#8208;styrylmalonates with conformationally non&#8208;rigid &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines in the presence of Lewis acids were studied. The effect of the structural features of starting compounds on the process course was determined. The main attention was focused to discover the reaction conditions for the formal (4+2)&#8208;cycloaddition pathway with the possibility of variation of the &#945;&#8208;substituent in azadiene instead of known (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition synthetic methodology. Based on the results obtained, a method for the diastereoselective synthesis of substituted trans,trans&#8208;tetrahydropyridines was developed. Three substrate&#8208;sensitive diverse Lewis acid catalytic systems have been employed based on Sc(OTf)3, Sn(OTf)2, and GaCl3. The use of GaCl3 as a Lewis acid allows to obtain a minor product of the formal (2+2+2)&#8208;cycloaddition, which represents a fully 1,2,3,4,5,6&#8208;hexasubstituted cyclohexane derivative produced with diastereoselectivity &gt;30:1. Appropriate mechanistic and stereochemical models have been suggested.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Domino Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Difunctionalized Indoles via Migratory Insertion of Isocyanides in Batch and Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We report, herein, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade comprising carbopalladation, migratory insertion of isocyanide and triple bond activation followed by a nucleophilic attack (OR&#8722;) to construct difunctionalized acyl indoles. The process involves multiple bond formations via key palladium&#8208;chemistry steps, to construct these bis&#8208;heterocycles containing two privileged scaffolds (indole and oxindole) in a single operational step, along with attempts to generate enantioselectivity at a quaternary carbon center. The methodology also demonstrates a continuous&#8208;flow process to synthesize aryl isocyanides within minutes and using them in a telescopic manner.

         <title>An Amphiphilic (salen)Co Complex &#8211; Utilizing Hydrophobic Interactions to Enhance the Efficiency of a Cooperative Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An amphiphilic (salen)Co(III) complex is presented that accelerates the hydrolytic kinetic resolution (HKR) of epoxides almost 10&#8197;times faster than catalysts from commercially available sources. This was achieved by introducing hydrophobic chains that increase the rate of reaction in one of two ways &#8211; by enhancing cooperativity under homogeneous conditions, and increasing the interfacial area under biphasic reaction conditions. While numerous strategies have been employed to increase the efficiency of cooperative catalysts, the utilization of hydrophobic interactions is scarce. With the recent upsurge in green chemistry methods that conduct reactions &#8216;on water&#8217; and at the oil&#8208;water interface, the introduction of hydrophobic interactions has potential to become a general strategy for enhancing the catalytic efficiency of cooperative catalytic systems.

Abstract
An efficient method for targeting a variety of symmetrical and asymmetrical &#945;&#8208;substituted dithiomalonates (DTMs) is described, utilizing 1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;carbothioates as reactive acylating agents and MgBr2&#8901;OEt2/DBU or LiHMDS for soft or hard enolization conditions of thioesters, respectively. The utility of this methodology was demonstrated through the synthesis of the pyridopyrimidine mesoionic insecticides: triflumezopyrim and dicloromezotiaz.

Abstract
Pseudocyclic &#946;&#8208;trifluorosulfonyloxy vinylbenziodoxolones were prepared starting from hydroxybenziodoxolones and alkynes in the presence of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid. The reaction of these compounds with azide anion leads to &#946;&#8208;azido vinylbenziodoxolones as products of vinylic nucleophilic substitution in which addition&#8208;elimination reactions occur and the double bond configuration is retained. The structures of &#946;&#8208;trifluorosulfonyloxy vinylbenziodoxolone and &#946;&#8208;azido vinylbenziodoxolone were established by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

Abstract
A method for the selective synthesis of (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;fluoroenones and &#945;&#8208;difluoroalkyl ketones have been achieved. By employing water as oxygen source, potassium carbonate as base, tetrasubstituted &#946;&#8208;fluoroenones could be regio&#8208; and stereoselectively synthesized by oxy&#8208;difluoroalkylation of alkynes under visible light irradiated with moderate to good yields. &#945;&#8208;Difluoroalkyl ketones could be obtained while using phenylpyridine as base. This transformation features mild condition, wide functional tolerance and step economy. The large&#8208;scale transformations and further derivatization show its potential application in organic synthesis.

         <title>Utilization of C(sp3)&#8208;Carboxylic Acids and Their Redox&#8208;Active Esters in Decarboxylative Carbon&#8722;Carbon Bond Formation</title>

Abstract
Over the last several years, radical&#8208;mediated decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reactions employing alkyl carboxylic acids have emerged as a powerful tool for the regiospecific construction of carbon&#8722;carbon bonds. Under thermal or photocatalytic conditions, a wide variety of C(sp3)&#8208;carboxylic acids and their redox&#8208;active esters undergo decarboxylative C&#8722;C bond formation with suitable reactant partners, leading to complex chemical scaffolds with wide&#8208;ranging applications. This synthetic strategy has several advantages over the more conventional organometallic reagents, including abundant starting material availability and high functional group tolerance associated with the mild reaction conditions. This review article highlights recent developments in the functionalization of &#945;&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted carboxylic acids as well as the more challenging unactivated acids, with representative examples discussed against the backdrop of insightful comments on reaction mechanisms. In addition, examples of the synthesis of natural products, drug molecules, and the late&#8208;stage modification of bioactive molecules employing this non&#8208;traditional C&#8722;C bond formation strategy are included. This review has been categorized into three main sections that are organized around the type of C&#8722;C bond being forged: C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2), C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3), and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp). Further, the reactions of carboxylic acids and their redox&#8208;active esters have been organized separately in each section.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Oxyphosphorylation of Unactivated Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Here, we describe an application of hydroazidation in the instant activation of alkynes for achieving the oxyphosphorylation of unactivated alkynes with diarylphosphinoyl radicals under mild reaction conditions. This reaction provides a method for accessing &#946;&#8208;ketophosphine oxides and phosphorus&#8208;containing pyrroles.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Heck/Insertion/Decarboxylation Domino Sequence: Synthesis of Dihydrocyclohepta[de]naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization for the construction of fused dihydrocyclohepta[de]naphthalene skeletons was developed. The skeleton was assembled from 3&#8208;iodo&#8208;4H&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;one, norbornene and 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;naphthoic acid. Unlike the classic Catellani reaction, which involves the removal of norbornene, in the present system, norbornene acts as a building block for the construction of rigid nonplanar molecular architectures rather than as an ortho&#8208;directing transient mediator. This synthesis involves the formation of three C&#8722;C bonds via a one&#8208;pot process, and it is compatible of a series of substituents.

Abstract
A synthetic method is presented for S&#8722;N bond formation starting from cheap and affordable materials. We show that (un)substituted N&#8208;protected cyclic eight&#8208;membered C2&#8208;symmetric sulfenamides have been prepared in a few steps using this procedure. The synthetic utility of these ambipolar derivatives was demonstrated in a variety of synthetic transformations affording different S,N&#8208;heterocyles of pharmaceutical relevance in one or two steps from simple starting materials.

Abstract
A method to synthesize pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]cinnolines via rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation of pyrazolidinones and subsequent [4+2] annulation of sulfoxonium ylides was developed. 5&#8208;Substituted or 5,10&#8208;disubstituted pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]cinnolines could be obtained by slightly adjusting the reaction conditions. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and practical transformations proved the practicability of this method. The mechanism of this method was proposed in the article on the basis of preliminary mechanistic results and previous reports. This method features simplified operation, metal&#8208;oxidant free, and readily available reactants.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Functionalization of Selenocystine&#8208;Containing Peptides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A straightforward and atom&#8208;economic method for the functionalization of short selenocystine&#8208;containing peptides is presented. This method is shown to be tolerant to unprotected peptides. The detailed protocol is based on the generation of a selenium radical via visible light&#8208;initiated reaction in the presence of transition metal&#8208;free photocatalyst. The selenium radical is further oxidized to an electrophile and trapped by N&#8208;heterocycles. The mechanism is confirmed by NMR, HRMS, UV, EPR and cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments and photocatalyst emission quenching studies. A visible light&#8208;initiated reaction is employed for the synthesis of selenocysteine&#8208;containing indole&#8208;based macrocycles via intramolecular Se&#8722;C bond formation.

         <title>Enantioselective Catalyzed Synthesis of Amino Derivatives Using Electrophilic Open&#8208;Chain N&#8208;Activated Ketimines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
N&#8208;Activated ketimines are characterized by the presence of acyl, sulfonyl, and phosphinoyl groups linked to the nitrogen atom of the azomethine system. These electron&#8208;withdrawing groups enhance the electrophilic character of the imino moiety allowing the addition of even weak nucleophilic reagents. The presence of the oxygen atoms in these activating groups with its coordinating and Lewis or Br&#248;nsted properties is of paramount importance in asymmetric catalyzed reactions. This review collects the results that have appeared in the literature during the last two decades on the utilization of open&#8208;chain N&#8208;activated ketimines for the synthesis of optically active &#945;&#8208;disubstituted and &#945;&#8208;trisubstituted amino derivatives including nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds.

Abstract
An iron&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component cyanoalkylsulfonylation of 2,3&#8208;allenoic acids, K2S2O5, and the ring&#8208;opening of cyclobutanone oxime esters is described. The radical tandem cyclization route allows access to diverse cyanoalkylsulfonylated butenolides in moderate to good yields under mild conditions. Moreover, the products are further converted, offering the corresponding derivatives.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Rational Engineering of Toluene Dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida F1 towards Oxyfunctionalization of Bicyclic Aromatics</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture, designed and donated by WesWizzArt and painted by the Mexican artist Way (Wayra Castillo&#8208;Guerrero), illustrates the toluene dioxygenase&#8208;catalyzed conversion of aromatics. The enzyme exhibits a high affinity for monocyclic, but only a low one for bicyclic substrates. A semi&#8208;rational designed mutant library opened the way for the conversion of the bicyclic substrates naphthalene, 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline and 2&#8208;phenylpyridine at unprecedented rates, enabling the biosynthesis of their products in substantial quantities. Variants at active site positions M220, A223 and F366 exhibited a major influence in product formation and selectivity. Details can be found in the Research Article by Bernhard Hauer and co&#8208;workers (J. L. Wissner, J. T. Schelle, W. Escobedo&#8208;Hinojosa, A. Vogel, B. Hauer, Adv. Synth.

         <title>Catalytic Formal Hydroamination of Allylic Alcohols Using Manganese PNP&#8208;Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture, designed by L. Duarte de Almeida et al. illustrates the successful application of a well&#8208;defined manganese PNP pincer complex in the formal hydroamination of allylic alcohols with primary and secondary amines as well as with N&#8208;heterocycles. The corresponding &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols were obtained in up to 94% yield in a tandem reaction combining dehydrogenation/Michael addition/hydrogenation sequence. The properties of these non&#8208;innocent pincer ligands allowed application of this non&#8208;noble metal catalyst in organic synthesis with a broad substrate scope. Details can be found in the communication by M. Beller, K. Junge and co&#8208;workers (L. Duarte de Almeida, F. Bourriquen, K. Junge, M. Beller, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2021, 363, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202100081).

Abstract
A &#946;&#8208;hydroxy elimination instead of common oxidization to carbonyl group in secondary propargyl alcohols was successfully developed to form 2&#8208;benzyl substituted isoquinoline N&#8208;oxides by a Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation and annulation cascade, in which moderate to excellent yields (up to 92%) could be obtained under mild reaction conditions, along with good regioselectivity, broad generality and applicability.

         <title>Aniline&#8208;Type Hypervalent Iodine(III) for Intramolecular Cyclization via C&#8722;H Bond Abstraction of Hydrocarbons Containing N&#8208; and O&#8208;Nucleophiles</title>

Abstract
We developed a method for the preparation of (diacetoxyiodo)&#8208;2&#8208;(N&#8208;alkylamido)benzene as an aniline&#8208;type hypervalent iodine(III). We also achieved direct cyclizations via C&#8722;H bond abstraction, such as the Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag reaction, a direct amination, and a direct lactonization, using the aniline&#8208;type hypervalent iodine(III) to obtain corresponding products in high yields.
