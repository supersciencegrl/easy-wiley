         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of Bis&#8208;sulfonyl Dibenzofurans via K2CO3&#8208;Mediated Benzannulation of &#945;&#8208;Sulfonyl o&#8208;Hydroxyacetophenones with 1,4&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;2&#8208;butyne</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A one&#8208;pot synthesis method for functionalized bis&#8208;sulfonyl dibenzofurans was developed under an air atmosphere using potassium carbonate&#8211;mediated benzannulation of diversified &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl o&#8208;hydroxyacetophenones with 1,4&#8208;dichloro&#8208;2&#8208;butyne. A plausible mechanism was proposed and discussed. This method provides intermolecular double &#945;&#8208;propargylation, sulfonyl migration, and intramolecular ring&#8208;closure via the formation of one carbon&#8211;oxygen single (C&#8211;O) bond, one carbon&#8211;sulfur single (C&#8211;S) bond, and two carbon&#8211;carbon (C=C) double bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;catalyzed Isotopic Labelling: Synthesis of Oxygen&#8208;18&#8208;Labelled Esters from Amides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isotopic labelling is critical for studying the biochemical mechanisms of bioactive molecules, with 18O&#8208;labelled esters being particularly important in biochemical research. However, current methods for synthesizing 18O&#8208;labelled esters have limitations, such as the need for excess 18O&#8208;labelled water and harsh reaction conditions. In this article, we present a new method for preparing 18O&#8208;labelled esters using a Ni&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction of amides, alkyl halides, and 18O&#8208;labelled water. This method demonstrated excellent selectivity and compatibility with various amides and alkyl halides,allowing for the synthesis of diverse isotopically labelled esters. Ni&#8208;catalyzed alkyl bromides reacted with carboxylates generated from amide and water reaction in the presence of a base to form the desired esters. Compared to current methods, our approach offers a more efficient and straightforward procedure for synthesizing 18O&#8208;labelled esters, with potential applications in the study of physiological metabolic process.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct enantioselective alkynylation of trifluoropyruvates with terminal 1,3&#8208;diynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A direct catalytic enantioselective alkynylation reaction of trifluoropyruvates with terminal 1,3&#8208;diynes was achieved by using C2&#8208;symmetric NCN pincer rhodium (III) complexes with bis(imidazolinyl)phenyl ligands. This protocol is effective for enantioselective synthesis of optically active trifluoromethylated tertiary alcohols with the diyne moiety. A variety of electronically and structurally diverse terminal 1,3&#8208;diynes are well tolerated. Furthermore, the catalytic reaction is applicable to preparation of both enantiomers of the chiral CF3&#8208;containing conjugated diynols with high enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Indole&#8208;Fused 1,4&#8208;Diazepinones via Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Cyclization Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photoredox&#8208;promoted approach for the efficient synthesis of [1,4]diazepino[1,7&#8208;a]indol&#8208;6(7H)&#8208;ones starting from N&#8208;indolyl phenylacrylamides and readily available aroyl chlorides as radical source is reported. This method, that involves a cascade radical addition on C&#8208;C double bond followed by intramolecular cyclization at indole C2&#8208;position, affords two diastereomeric indole&#8208;fused 1,4&#8208;diazepinones characterized by a N&#8208;C(aryl) axial chirality in high yields.</dc:description>

         <title>KI&#8208;facilitated trifunctionalization of maleimides in water: Access to disulfonylated diazosuccinimide derivatives and its synthetic applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A trifunctionalization cascade reaction of substituted maleimides was developed to generate a series of disulfonylated diazosuccinimides in satisfactory yields by employing readily available sulfonyl hydrazides as both diazo source and sulfonylation reagent. The notable features of this developed method include avoiding the use of transition metal catalysts, environmentally benign H2O as the solvent, mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance, and the late&#8208;stage modification of drugs. The derivatization reactions were effectively applied to synthesize aminosulfonylation&#8208;substituted maleimides. The involved radical pathway was also demonstrated by mechanistic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Divergent Carbene Insertion into the N&#8208;H bonds of Tryptamines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Easy access to divergent products with chemoselectivity is of great importance in organic synthesis. Herein, we have developed a chemoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed carbene insertion protocol onto N&#8208;H bonds of tryptamine derivatives. Divergent insertion products are obtained by varying the nucleophilicity of the aliphatic NH of tryptamine with electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. The reaction provided N&#8208;H insertion products with broad substrate scope in good yields.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A four&#8208;step metal&#8208;free procedure is described for the transformation of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;methylcyclopent&#8208;2&#8208;enone derivatives into highly functionalized E&#8208;alkylidenecyclobutanes featuring oxygenated tetrasubstituted centers.

         <title>Au(I) and HOTf&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade [5+1]&#8208;Annulations between Allenylacetals and Diazo Esters To Form 1,3&#8208; and 2,3&#8208;Disubstituted Naphthoates, Respectively</title>

Abstract
Gold&#8208;catalyzed [5+1]&#8208;annulations between allenylacetals with diazo esters to form 1,3&#8208;disubstituted naphthoate derivatives are described. Notably, this reaction chemoselectivity is switched to 2,3&#8208;naphthoate products when using the HOTf catalyst. Mechanistic studies of these reactions support an acetal activation, in which oxoniums are formed initially, followed by attack of the allene, generating allyl cations to trap &#945;&#8208;diazo esters. In gold catalysis, such diazo addition intermediates undergo Roskamp rearrangement, whereas in HOTf catalysis the same intermediates undergo a Conia&#8208;ene reaction instead.

Abstract
A photo&#8208;induced metal&#8208;free radical hydroboration of various styrenes with NHC&#8208;borane has been developed, which can provide mono&#8208; and di&#8208;alkylated boranes in a selective manner. Besides, this strategy can also be applied to prepare di&#8208;functionalized boranes with two different alkyl groups. Mild reaction conditions and good functional groups compatibility were observed. Preliminary mechanism for this reaction was proposed.

Abstract
Chiral 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;arylbut&#8208;3&#8208;enoic acid derivatives are important precursors for the synthesis of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such as enalapril, lisinopril, cilapril or benazepril. In this work, we take advantage of the unexplored promiscuous ketoreductase activity of &#916;1&#8208;piperidine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate/&#916;1&#8208;pyrroline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate reductase from Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DSM 50315 (DpkAPsyrin) for the synthesis of (S,E)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;arylbut&#8208;3&#8208;enoic acids. The strategy was designed as an enzymatic cascade comprising an aldol condensation between pyruvate with aryl aldehydes, catalyzed by the trans&#8208;o&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene pyruvate hydratase&#8208;aldolase from Pseudomonas putida (HBPAPputida), for the construction of carbon scaffold, and an ensuing asymmetric reduction of the carbonyl group catalyzed by DpkAPsyrin. The enzymatic cascade provided quantitative conversions, with global isolated yields between 57&#8211;85%. A total of nine structurally diverse (S,E)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;arylbut&#8208;3&#8208;enoic acids were prepared in ee between 87&#8211;99%.

         <dc:description>We disclose how an N,C,N&#8208;bismuthinidene is able promote an intramolecular conjugate amination that affords cyclic carbamates in excellent yields. The reaction proceeds at room temperature in short reaction times, requiring a remarkably low loading of a bismuth(I) complex (0.1 mol%) and without the need of an additional Br&#248;nsted base. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction takes place through a polar pathway involving the conjugate addition of the nucleophilic bismuthinidene, followed by an intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aminopyridines via Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloaddition of Diynes with N&#8208;Substituted and N&#8208;Unsubstituted Cyanamides</title>

Abstract
Reactivity of nitriles in a CoCl2&#8722;6H2O/dppe/Zn&#8208;catalyzed diyne&#8208;nitrile cycloaddition was explored through the competitive reactions of a diyne with two different nitriles, and it was found that cyanamides are good substrates, and the reaction yielded 2&#8208;aminopyridines. Notably, N&#8208;unsubstituted cyanamide (H2N&#8722;CN) could be used for the reaction with 1,6&#8208;diynes to afford the corresponding N&#8208;unsubstituted 2&#8208;aminopyridines, which cannot be prepared via other catalytic reactions and are versatile intermediates for further transformations such as the synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted pyridines and 6,7&#8208;annulated imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines.

Abstract
An iodine&#8208;mediated radical cyclization of o&#8208;vinylaryl isocyanides with disulfides or diselenides was developed. The atom&#8208;economic reaction provides a method for regioselective construction of the 2&#8208;chalcogenated quinolines in 42&#8211;93% yields by incorporation of both chalcogen atoms of disulfides or diselenides into quinolines.

         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light induced multicomponent reaction of aromatic aldehydes, amines and sodium difluoromethanesulfinate for the synthesis of fluorinated secondary amines has been investigated. The protocol affords a convenient pathway for the introduction of difluoromethyl group into imines, which generated in situ by the reaction of aldehydes and amines. A diverse range of fluorinated secondary amines were synthesized in 43%&#8208;79% yields under room temperature. The notable advantage of the protocol is using commercial available reagents, simplicity of the synthetic procedure, and larger scale application.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative N&#8208;Phosphorylation: Modular Preparation of N&#8208;Acyl Iminophosphoranes Using Dioxazolones and Phosphines</title>

Abstract
Dioxazolones and phosphines have been used to access N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes in copper(I) catalysis under simple thermal conditions. The synthetic utility of this protocol is demonstrated by a broad range of substrates with an excellent atom&#8208;economy. The optimization process showed that copper demonstrated as catalytic amount toward the targeted transformation. Functionalization studies of N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes were also conducted. Our reaction protocol is compatible with an example of a bioactive motif&#8208;containing N&#8208;acyl iminophosphorane analogue.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;catalyzed formal [3+2] annulation&#8208;aromatization reaction for the synthesis of various substituted imidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines from amidines with stabilized isoquinolinium N&#8208;ylides in the presence of bases is developed. The procedure reported here involves a direct C&#8722;H activation and the formation of C&#8722;C/C&#8722;N bonds in one&#8208;pot. The reaction mechanism is probed by radical&#8208;trapping experiment, fluorescence quenching, and light on/off experiments. The late&#8208;stage modification experiments provide the potential applications in the field of organic and medicinal chemistry for chemists.

         <title>DABCO&#8208;Promoted Selective Photochemical C&#8722;N Coupling: Access to Unsymmetrical Azahelicenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A multifaceted study on the effect of various factors on the efficiency of photocyclization of naphthofuran O&#8208;acyl oximes was performed. It showed that without any additives or in the presence of electron acceptors, the reaction occurs by a radical pathway and with low chemoselectivity, while DABCO promotes intramolecular cyclization to give naphthofuroquinolines (NFQs) in 34&#8211;87% yields. The iminyl radical formed under UV irradiation in the presence of DABCO due to single electron transfer (SET) and N&#8722;O bond cleavage undergoes selective intramolecular homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS) with formation of a new C&#8722;N bond. This route to quinoline&#8208;annulated scaffolds is based on the use of DABCO both as an electron transfer agent and a proton acceptor.

Abstract
We herein disclose a simple and general method for the synthesis of chromendiones through Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization/annulation reactions of nitrones with cyclic 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones by using nitrone group as a traceless directing group. This method exhibits high efficiency and broad functional group compatibility. The derivatization of these chromendiones has been also demonstrated to further strengthen the synthetic utility of the transformation.

Abstract
A Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed dearomative skeletal rearrangement of azofurans with indoles is reported, enabling a regioselective 1,6&#8208;addition, ring&#8208;opening and 1,4&#8208;addition cascade to produce 26 examples of indolylated pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;ones with a cyclic tetrasubstituted stereocenter in 58&#8211;94% yields. This protocol demonstrates remarkable compatibility regarding azofurans and indoles with different substitution patterns, featuring complete regioselectivity.

Abstract
Herein, metal triflates&#8211;catalyzed one&#8208;pot domino cyclocondensation of 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;sulfonylacetones and 3&#8208;arylacroleins via (3+3) or (3+2+1) annulation has been proposed to construct diversified 2&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;4&#8208;arylphenols and 2,6&#8208;bis&#8208;sulfonyl 5&#8208;aryl&#8208;4&#8208;arylidene&#8208;2&#8208;cyclohexenones. In this effective reaction, C&#8722;C and C=C bonds are formed via a cascade process and 3&#8208;arylacrolein acts as a C3 and C1 synthon during the formation of a six&#8208;membered ring system under mild conditions. A plausible mechanism has been proposed and discussed.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Divergent C3/C5 Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Arylation of 2&#8208;Pyridylthiophenes</title>

Abstract
The development of a rational protocol to realize the complete regioselectivity and the capability to switch regioselectivity is an appealing yet challenging task. Herein, a regiodivergent C&#8722;H arylation of 2&#8208;pyridylthiophenes has been demonstrated via the choice of RuII and PdII catalysts. The reactions proceeded smoothly in a good regioselective manner to afford the corresponding C3&#8208; and C5&#8208;arylated thiophenes. Late&#8208;stage diversification of biologically relevant scaffold derived from estrone and successful transformation of the products further highlighted the potential utility and importance of this synthetic strategy.

         <title>Photocatalytic Redox&#8208;Neutral Synthesis of Heterotriarymethanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The C(sp3)&#8722;H bond decyanative arylations of diverse symmetrical and unsymmetrical BIMs have been successfully accomplished. Aromatic nitriles were utilized as components in the presence of thiobenzoic acid (TBA) under visible&#8208;light irradiation. These redox&#8208;neutral protocols provide a highly efficient and practical strategy for the synthesis of a broad range of bis(indolyl)&#8208;substituted and mono(indolyl)&#8208;substituted hetero&#8208;triarylmethanes. Moreover, this synthetic approach has been expanded to the construction of indole&#8208;substituted triarylmethanes bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters. It is noteworthy that the preparation of the natural product Arsindolin A was effectively achieved using this methodology.

Abstract
The distinctive hydrophobic hydration effect in the aqueous solution contributes to the success of the phospha&#8208;Michael reaction between &#946;&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted enones and diarylphosphine oxides, providing an access to biologically relevant &#947;&#8208;ketophosphine oxides bearing a sterically highly congested CF3&#8208; and P(O)&#8208;tetrasubstituted carbon center. More importantly, the resulting products could be further transformed into densely functionalized &#947;&#8208;ketophosphine oxides containing a CF3&#8208; and P(O)&#8208;tetrasubstituted carbon center.

Abstract
Herein, we developed a rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of indenones from 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;nitrosoindoles and alkynes in a redox&#8208;neutral manner. The reaction did not require harsh conditions or any external oxidants. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculation revealed that the reaction involved directed C&#8722;H activation, dearomative spirocyclization, N&#8722;O/C&#8722;C bond cleavage and ketimine hydrolysis cascade processes.

Abstract
Due their multifaced applications, the access to organosulfur derivatives in an efficient and economical way is a challenge in organic synthesis. In this context photochemistry and photocatalysis play a crucial role in the development of innovative (and selective) Carbon&#8208;Sulphur bond formation processes. The present review aims to collect the most recent strategies to achieve this target under visible light driven conditions.

Abstract
Herein, a copper&#8208;catalyzed photoinduced [3+3] cycloaddition reaction of &#945;&#8208;acidic isocyanides with 2,5&#8208;diaryltetrazoles is described. The reaction proceeded smoothly with high regioselectivity, affording a range of important 1,2,4&#8208;triazines under mild conditions. The obtained 1,2,4&#8208;triazines were converted into triazine alcohol, Weinreb amide and triazinone easily, which further illustrate the utility of this [3+3] cycloaddition process.

The obtained 1,2,4-triazines were converted into triazine alcohol, Weinreb amide and triazinone easily, which further illustrate the utility of this [3+3] cycloaddition process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Flow chemistry has recently opened new chemistry windows thanks to the safer use of hazardous and sensitive reagents. Furthermore, flow procedures usually outperform their batch counterparts due to improved mass and heat transfer, offering a good opportunity for industrial application. Herein, a rapid Simmons&#8208;Smith cyclopropanation flow process is presented. Taking advantage of the in&#8197;situ production of the zinc carbenoid species, several olefins bearing aromatic rings of different electronic nature, aliphatic chains or heterocycles were smoothly cyclopropanated with a residence time of just 15 minutes. In addition, industrial applicability of the protocol is assured thanks to a successful 12&#8208;mmol scale experiment, which represents a 3.59 grams per hour production of a selected example, and to the satisfactory synthesis of pharmaceutical drugs.

Abstract
A quinine&#8208;derived thiourea&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective double annulation strategy using alkylidene Meldrum&#8242;s acid as an acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor with salicylaldehyde&#8208;derived azomethine ylide is reported. The methodology is realized via a (3+2) cycloaddition/transesterification/decarboxylation sequence, giving chromeno[4,3&#8208;b]pyrrolidines within 15&#8211;420&#8197;minutes at room temperature in 51&#8211;97% yields with 92&#8211;99% ee under 1&#8211;10&#8197;mol% catalyst loading. A plausible activation model is proposed for the excellent stereoinduction by H&#8208;bond interaction between the catalyst and the Meldrum&#8242;s acid motif according to control experiments.

         <title>Synthesis of Furfural Sulfides and 4&#8208;Alkylthiopyridines via Heterocyclization of &#945;&#8208;Acyl Ketene Dithioacetals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Herein, we devised a synthetic approach for skeletally diversified furfuryl sulfides and 4&#8208;alkylthiopyridines involving the heterocyclization of flexible &#945;&#8208;acyl ketene dithioacetals, enabled by cooperative Pd/Cu catalysis. The overall transformation was initiated by acyl&#8208;directed desulfurative Sonogashira coupling, which was proposed as the key step in surmounting the competitive carbothiolation pathway. This step was followed by 1,6&#8208;addition of either a S&#8208; or N&#8208;nucleophile and intramolecular cyclization. Notably, the two different annulation reactions featured readily accessible starting materials, selective cleavage and reassembly of multiple chemical bonds, broad functional group tolerance, pharmacologically significant heterocyclic products with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivities, and high atom economy.

An additive&#8208; and external oxidant&#8208;free reaction of cyclopropanols, DABCO&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(SO2)2 and diaryliodonium salts in aqueous phase is described. This reaction proceeds under mild reaction conditions, affording bioactive aryl substituted &#947;&#8208;keto sulfones in 36%&#8208;90% yields with good functional group tolerance. This reaction proceeds through a &#947;&#8208;keto sulfinate intermediate, which undergoes a nucleophilic reaction with diaryliodonium salts, giving rise to corresponding aryl substituted &#947;&#8208;keto sulfones.

         <title>Photocatalytic N&#8208;Alkylation of NH&#8208;Sulfoximines via Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydroamination of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Sulfoximines, the isoelectronic with sulfones, represent a class of alternative and intriguing motifs in both discovery program and agrochemistry. N&#8208;Alkylation on imines could significantly improve their bioactivities, but the lack of general method has hindered their further uptake by medicinal chemistry and drug development. Herein, we present a mild photocatalytic anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamination of alkenes to construct N&#8208;alkylated sulfoximines with broad substrate tolerance on primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl substituents as well as a diverse range of sulfoximines. The mechanistic studies support the photocatalytic pathway, and demonstrate that the alkene radical cation rather than the iminium radical serves as the key intermediate in the transformation.

         <title>Synthesis of Triaminocyclopentadienyl Iron(II) Tricarbonyl Complexes and Application to the Synthesis of Aminophosphines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A new family of triaminocyclopentadienyl iron(II) tricarbonyl complexes has been synthesized, fully characterized and applied in hydrogenation transfer. These complexes are the first Earth&#8208;abundant metal complexes able to catalyze reductive alkylation of primary and secondary aliphatic amines with 2&#8208;diarylphosphinobenzaldehyde derivatives at room temperature. These non&#8208;pincer type cyclopentadienyl iron(II) complexes demonstrate not only better efficiency than known cyclopentadienone iron carbonyl complexes but also high functionality tolerance. The resulting aminophosphines provide a straightforward and rapid access to potential P&#8722;N ligands.

Abstract
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed trifunctionalization of 5&#8208;heteroaryl&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;hexenes via remote heteroaryl migration and a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed trifunctionalization of 5&#8208;hexenenitriles via cyano migration are reported. This protocol provides access to a broad scope of CFnR&#8208;containing ketones with high molecular complexity and functional group diversity. The reaction features mild conditions and high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities. The success of gram&#8208;scale reactions and the versatility of products in derivative synthesis illustrated the potential value of this transformation in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Enantioselective Regulation of Short&#8208;chain Dehydrogenases via Key Sites in its Loop and Adjacent Regions for the Enantiodivergent Reduction of Difficult&#8208;to&#8208;reduce Ketones</title>

         <dc:description>Short&#8208;chain dehydrogenases (SDRs) are powerful catalysts for the asymmetric reduction of prochiral ketones in pharmaceutical products. Herein, through gene mining and evolutionary analysis, we obtained two major types of SDRs (SDR&#8208;1 and SDR&#8208;2) for the enantioselective complementary reduction of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;piperidone, which gives the corresponding product (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc&#8208;piperidol, an intermediate of the interleukin inhibitor and lymphoma treatment drug (imbruvica), respectively. By integrating multiple sequence alignment, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and computational modeling, we proposed a &#8220;loop regulation&#8221; mechanism for the enantioselective control of SDRs, through which residues in the loop region could potentially fine&#8208;tune their enantioselectivity. Further, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis assays showed that two key residues (L201 and F205 for SDR&#8208;1, F92 and H93 for SDR&#8208;2) in the loop and its adjacent region played critical roles in fine&#8208;tuning the enantioselectivity of SDRs. Understanding this mechanism of SDR stereo preference in catalyzing asymmetric reduction, we further switched the enantioselectivity of the homologous enzymes. The obtained enzymes catalyzed the enantiodivergent synthesis of chiral heterocyclic alcohols with different ring sizes and substituents (25&#8211;99% conversion and 25&#8211;99% ee (R/S)), including piperidols, 4&#8208;hydroxy azepanes, 3&#8208;hydroxy azepanes and pyrrolidinols. These findings could potentially guide future attempts at protein engineering of stereoselective SDRs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Three&#8208;Step Chemoenzymatic Cascade Synthesis of Miconazole Analogues Based on the Asymmetric Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Heteroaryl Amino Alcohols via Ketoreductases</title>

Abstract
Chiral &#946;&#8208;heteroaryl amino alcohols play a crucial role as intermediates in the synthesis of numerous bioactive pharmaceuticals, including cenobamate, oteseconazole, and miconazole. Nevertheless, there is a lack of literature documenting the establishment of a versatile approach for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;heteroaryl amino alcohols and the aforementioned drugs. In this study, we successfully asymmetrically synthesized 50 pairs of chiral &#946;&#8208;heteroaryl amino alcohols using two engineered ketoreductases (KREDs) with opposite stereopreference. Based on this achievement, we developed a three&#8208;step chemoenzymatic cascade route for synthesizing of chiral miconazole analogues from commercially available 2&#8208;bromoacetophenone derivatives. By optimizing the solvent for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;imidazolyl ketones in the first step, followed by the reduction of &#945;&#8208;imidazolyl ketones using KREDs in the second step and etherification in the third step, we obtained 20 chiral miconazole analogues with promising yields (26&#8211;84%) and impressive stereoselectivities (up to &gt;99%&#8201;ee). Notably, this route eliminates the need for the isolation of ketone and alcohol intermediates, and avoids the use of metal catalysts in the synthesis of chiral miconazole analogues. Furthermore, we successfully scaled up the preparation of (S)&#8208;miconazole, achieving a 30% isolated yield and &gt;99%&#8201;ee. This method presents a novel synthetic approach for production chiral ether drugs and chiral &#946;&#8208;heteroaryl amino alcohols, offering new possibilities in pharmaceutical synthesis.

Abstract
B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation of easily accessible 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes and 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;diketones with polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS) has been developed for step&#8208;economic diastereoselective synthesis of cis&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines and cis&#8208;2,4&#8208;disubstituted 2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines. This metal&#8208;free catalytic protocol provides access to various differently substituted products in 53&#8211;95% yield and with diastereoselectivities ranging from 6:1 to 20:1. The diastereoselectivity strongly depends on the choice of hydrosilane, with PMHS being optimal. The reaction is operationally simple and readily scaled up, and proceeds without exclusion of air and moisture.

         <title>Radical Substitution of Polyfluoroarenes and Heteroarenes Promoted by Photoredox Activation of Organozinc Iodides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Aromatic compounds interact with organozinc reagents under photoredox conditions, leading to the substitution products. The reaction is performed under blue light irradiation via in&#8197;situ generated organozinc reagents (Barbier conditions), which are oxidized by the photocatalyst, followed by radical attack at the aromatic substrate.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aromatic compounds interact with organozinc reagents under photoredox conditions, leading to the substitution products. The reaction is performed under blue light irradiation via in&#8197;situ generated organozinc reagents (Barbier conditions), which are oxidized by the photocatalyst, followed by radical attack at the aromatic substrate. The method works with polyfluorinated arenes, 2-chlorobenzoxazoles, and 2-sulfonyl-substituted benzothiazole.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Cross&#8208;electrophilic coupling of various benzyl sulfonium salts with Callyl&#8722;O electrophiles is described using a simple Co&#8722;Mn catalytic system. This catalytic system is able to activate both the stable Csp3&#8722;S bond of sulfonium salts and the Csp3&#8722;O bond of allylic acetate or ether under mild reaction conditions to form various functionalized alkyl olefinic compounds. Allyl methyl ethers were employed for the first time in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophilic coupling to build Csp3&#8722;Csp3 bonds. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested the involvement of benzyl radicals generated from C&#8722;S bond cleavage through a single electron transfer.

Abstract
The combination of the catalytic power of amorphous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (aMOFs) and biocatalysis has greatly boosted the development of novel synthetic strategies due to its functional diversity and stereospecificity. 2&#8208;Cyanoacrylamides are important building blocks for many biologically active molecules. Herein, we described a chemical&#8208;biological relay catalytic method to access (E)&#8208;2&#8208;cyanoacrylamides based on the catalysis of amorphous porphyrin&#8208;MOFs SPUZ&#8208;1 and whole cells of Rhodococcus rhodochrous (nitrile hydratase). The approach was proved to be simple and efficient, and the highest conversion was up to 99%

Abstract
Herein, a visible light&#8208;mediated multicomponent radical cross&#8208;coupling reaction of [1.1.1]propellane with N&#8208;heterocycles and disulfides is described. The mild conditions enabled the installation of the BCP motif in a wide variety of compounds in the absence of photocatalyst, additive and metal catalyst, with excellent functional group tolerance, This methodology opens a approach for the synthesis of potentially bioactive 1&#8208;arylthiol&#8208;3&#8208;heteroaryl bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes in moderate to good yield.

Abstract
Application of a binary Ga&#8208;based catalyst system for the coupling of CO2 and aziridines to form oxazolidinones is presented. It has been possible to optimize the catalyst system for the selective formation of a single regioisomer, in excellent yield, under relatively mild reaction conditions. The optimized catalyst system has been successfully applied to a range of substituted aziridines derived from styrene oxide. It has been observed that aziridines bearing two aromatic substituents result in piperazine formation through an unexpected dimerization reaction. These piperazine products can be selectively formed in the absence of CO2 or are favored at lower reaction temperatures. A detailed DFT study into the reaction mechanism for the formation of both products has been carried out and an unusual ligand assistance in the case of oxazolidinone synthesis has been identified. More specifically, this ligand interaction promotes the initial ring&#8208;opening of the aziridine and this work presents the first fully elucidated mechanism involving this intermediate.

Abstract
Switchable synthesis of 3&#8208;alkenyl succinimides and maleimides has been achieved via Michael addition and oxidative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of &#945;&#8208;oxo ketene dithioacetals and maleimides by switching different reaction conditions. In the presence of 30&#8197;mol% of CH3SO3H in DCE at 120&#8201;&#176;C, Michael addition reaction of &#945;&#8208;oxo ketene dithioacetals and maleimides occurred to afford 3&#8208;alkenyl succinimides in 40&#8211;90% yields, whereas in the presence of 30&#8197;mol% of Pd(OAc)2 in DMF at 20&#8201;&#176;C, 3&#8208;alkenyl maleimides were obtained in 40&#8211;80% yields from the oxidative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of &#945;&#8208;oxo ketene dithioacetals with maleimides. The presupposition of directing groups onto the substrates is not required in the Michael addition reaction. The method can be extended to gram scale.

Abstract
In this study, we present a methodology for synthesizing aza&#8208;heterocyclic compounds using N&#8208;tosylhydrazones as key reagents. Our primary objective was to obtain six or seven&#8208;membered ring heterocycles; however, we unexpectedly observed the formation of bi&#8208;indole compounds in high yields. Furthermore, our synthetic pathway enables modifications at the C3 or C2 position of the indole, leading to the formation of the respective 3&#8242;&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;biindole or carbazole derivatives.

Abstract
Herein, a method about hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mediated electrochemical cross dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reaction of heterocycles with ethers has been established. Saturated linear, branched or cyclic ethers were all suitable for this cross&#8208;coupling reaction to form the corresponding products in 70&#8211;98% yields. The advantages of this reaction are transition metal&#8208; and chemical oxidant&#8208;free conditions, high yields, and broad functional group tolerance, etc.

         <title>Electrophilic C3&#8722;H Alkenylation of 2,6&#8208;Dialkoxypyridine Derivatives via Pd(II)/Tl(III) Reaction System</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report the reaction system based on Pd(II) catalyst and Tl(OCOCF3)3 for the electrophilic C3&#8722;H alkenylation of 2,6&#8208;dialkokypyridines with alkenes. Synergistic action of the Pd/thioether ligand catalytic system and Tl(III) results in efficient C&#8722;H alkenylation of various nitrogen heteroaromatics with complete regioselectivity. Remarkably, the use of a sterically hindered thioether ligand and the Pd(II)/Tl(III) system enables mono&#8208;selective C3(5)&#8722;H alkenylation of 2,6&#8208;dialkoxypyridines, and subsequent introduction of a second, different alkene affords unsymmetrical, multi&#8208;substituted pyridine derivatives. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds via electrophilic thallation of heteroarenes followed by Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck&#8208;type reaction. The utility of this method is showcased by its application to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of structurally complex bioactive molecules having 2,6&#8208;dialkoxypyridine as a core structure.

Abstract
Direct enantioselective synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted chromen&#8208;4&#8208;ones, bearing the amino group at &#945;&#8208;stereogenic center with respect to the heterocycle is developed. It is based on Mannich&#8208;type asymmetric addition of 3&#8208;hydroxychromen&#8208;4&#8208;one and its analogues to N&#8208;protected imines in the presence of available alkaloid dihydrocuprein. &#945;&#8208;Stereogenic chromenone amino derivatives were formed in this reactions in 81&#8211;95% yield with up to 98% ee. The chiral adducts were transformed to diverse enantiomerically enriched chromen&#8208;4&#8208;one functional derivatives.

Abstract
Described herein is the development of an organoaluminium&#8208;mediated tandem conjugate addition&#8208;cyclization sequence of p&#8208;quinone monoacetals with 2&#8208;siloxyphenyl Grignard reagents to afford a collection of phenol&#8208;bridged cyclohexanone derivatives. Furthermore, a tandem conjugate&#8208;addition and dimerization reaction of p&#8208;quinone monoacetals with Grignard reagents is also reported to offer a straightforward and diastereoselective synthesis of complex bridged&#8208;ring compounds bearing tricyclo[6.2.2.02,7]dodecene skeletons.

Furthermore, a tandem conjugate-addition and dimerization reaction of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-quinone monoacetals with Grignard reagents is also reported to offer a straightforward and diastereoselective synthesis of complex bridged-ring compounds bearing tricyclo[6.2.2.0&lt;sup&gt;2,7&lt;/sup&gt;]dodecene skeletons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The inside cover picture illustrates a new approach that was devised for the Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation reaction, involving the combination of an activated amide and an arene. To activate the arene, a catalytic system composed of [Pd(cinnamyl)Cl]2 and Cu(OTf)2 was employed. The reaction between the activated arene and the amide resulted in the formation of the desired aryl ketone, demonstrating favorable yields. This advancement opens up possibilities for the synthesis of diverse aryl ketones through the Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation process.

Abstract
Chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) has been established as a cornerstone in chemical synthesis reactions for over five decades, owing to its distinctive molecular structure and remarkable catalytic effect. However, in recent years, a revolutionary approach to asymmetric synthesis has emerged, utilizing photocatalytic excitation of molecules to generate free radicals, effectively surpassing the limitations of classical organic synthesis methodologies.A prominent and significant area of research has been dedicated to the investigation of chiral phosphoric acid synergistic photocatalysis for enantioselective chemical synthesis. This unique catalytic system encompasses a bifunctional hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalyst, enabling simultaneous interactions between radical intermediates and substrates. The review paper focuses on the application and progress of this catalytic system in asymmetric synthesis throughout the past decade.

Abstract
N&#8208;Heteroaryl sulfonamides are an extremely significant variety of organosulfur compounds that are present in many significant FDA&#8208;approved drugs and therapeutic agents. Therefore, synthesis of these N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfonamides is one of the most interesting topics among the synthetic organic chemists. Among the various synthetic methodologies, direct C&#8722;N bond formation through N&#8208;heteroarylation of sulfonamides has emerged as a procedure continued of choice as it bypasses the genotoxicity common in the traditional methods. This review encompasses and summarizes the progress and development in this subject with literature coverage up to June 2023.

Abstract
We presented a cascade transformation of N, N&#8208;diallylamines and fluoroalkyl iodides into various functionalized fluoroalkylated pyrrolidines through a visible light&#8208;induced synthetic process in the solvent&#8208;free conditions. In this reaction system, the substrate N, N&#8208;diallylamine acted both as the base and the electron donor.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We presented a cascade transformation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-diallylamines and fluoroalkyl iodides into various functionalized fluoroalkylated pyrrolidines through a visible light-induced synthetic process in the solvent-free conditions. In this reaction system, the substrate &lt;i&gt;N, N&lt;/i&gt;-diallylamine acted both as the base and the electron donor. We further demonstrated the practicality of this protocol by the direct modification of amino acids and pharmaceutical molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
We developed the remote selective C&#8722;H bromination for the synthesis of C4&#8242;&#8208;brominated biarylphosphine oxides using FeBr3 as a brominating reagent. C3&#8242;&#8208;Brominated products were obtained in reactions with substrates bearing a 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropyl substituent on the bottom ring. Moreover, direct access to C5&#8208;chlorinated peri&#8208;substituted(1&#8208;naphthalenyl)phosphines is developed using FeCl3 as a chlorinating reagent. These halogenated compounds can be utilized for cross&#8208;coupling reactions to construct functionalized phosphine oxides.

Abstract
Herein, we report peroxidative dearomatization of 2&#8208;naphthol and C&#8722;H peroxidation of 3&#8208;arylbenzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;ones with 66&#8211;94% yield under catalyst&#8208;free conditions using continuous flow module. Besides, an approach for the synthesis of N&#8208;substituted&#8208;2&#8208;phenylbenzo[d][1,3]dioxole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxamide has been achieved via the skeletal rearrangement of peroxybenzofuranone using amines in the absence of catalyst under continuous flow. The mechanistic study suggests that this peroxidation reaction proceeds via free radical formation under thermolytic conditions.

Abstract
We report a visible light&#8208;mediated approach for the radical hydrocarboxylation of vinylsulfone derivatives. Using cheap and easily accessible sodium formate as C1&#8208;source and K2S2O8 as reagent, a set of vinylsulfone substrates could be efficiently hydrocarboxylated in aqueous medium without any additional catalyst or reagent; and the concept could be also applied for direct hydroacylations, hydroalkylations and hydrophosphorylations. The control experiments clearly indicated that the reaction proceeds via radical mechanism without the generation of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes; supporting the working model of K2S2O8&#8208;initiated in&#8197;situ formation of CO2 radical anion.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular dearomative formal [4+2] annulation of phenols with propargyl electrophiles is reported, enabling substituent&#8208;controlled regiodivergent synthesis of a wide range of skeletally diverse spirocyclohexadienones with good yields. The regiodivergence could be precisely controlled by adjusting the steric hindrance of O&#8208; and N&#8208;substituents from binucleophilic substrates, where substrates with an O&#8208;nucleophilic site were converted into spiro[chromane&#8208;4,1&#8242;&#8208;cyclohexane]&#8208;2&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;dien&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;ones with complete regioselectivity and (Z)&#8208;selectivity, whereas N&#8208;nucleophiles enabled a different regiodivergent process to access spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;1,4&#8242;&#8208;quinoline]&#8208;2,5&#8208;dien&#8208;4&#8208;ones.

Abstract
This report has realized the catalytic asymmetric [3+2] annulation of benzylideneindolinones with CF3&#8208;containing isatin&#8208;derived azomethine ylides for the first time, in which the organocatalysis has failed. In the presence of dinuclear zinc catalysts, a series of functionalized 2,3&#8208;pyrrolidinyl dispirooxindoles have been synthesized in good yields with excellent stereoselectivity under mild reaction conditions. This protocol can be run on a gram scale and a possible catalytic mechanism is proposed.

Abstract
A synthetic strategy involving a Simmons&#8208;Smith cyclopropanation, followed by an acid&#8208;catalyzed pinacol rearrangement, was developed to transform &#945;&#8208;hydroxy silyl enol ethers into 1&#8208;substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexan&#8208;5&#8208;ones. These bicyclic ketones underwent further synthetic manipulations to generate various 1,5&#8208;disubstituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes, which could serve as potential bioisosteres of ortho&#8208;substituted arenes.

         <title>Selectfluor Mediated Regioselective Annulation Using Imidazopyridines, Acetophenones and DMF as Carbon Synthon</title>

Abstract
A Selectfluor mediated regioselective &#960;&#8208;extended [3+1+1] annulation using imidazopyridines, acetophenones and DMF as carbon source has been realized. The current route compared to traditional &#960;&#8208;extended annulation reaction utilizes commercially available acetophenones as a cyclic partner and offers three C&#8722;C bond formations. This reaction displayed good functional group tolerance wherein DMF served as a carbon synthon. Five&#8208;membered bridged chroman&#8208;4&#8208;one derivative of imidazopyridine has been achieved with 2&#8208;hydroxy acetophenone, wherein DMF acted as a dual carbon synthon and offered four C&#8722;C and one C&#8722;O bond formation in one&#8208;pot.

         <title>Synthesis of Fluoromethyl&#8208;Substituted Cyclopropanes by Electrophilic Cyclization of Homoallylic Boronate Intermediates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The electrophilic cyclization via the boronate complex between various homoallylic boronates and Selectfluor&#174; is reported. This reaction provides a fluoromethylated cyclopropane ring that was difficult to synthesize by previous methods. The use of phenyl lithium, which activates the homoallylic boronate, is important for the reaction. The intermediate boronate species in this reaction was observed through 11B{1H} NMR experiments. We also demonstrate the synthesis of a building block, including fluoromethyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropane for a bioactive compound.

         <title>Selective Monoarylation of Ammonium Triflate with Aryl Chlorides Catalyzed by [Pd(&#946;&#8208;MeNAP)Br]2 and AdBrettPhos</title>

Abstract
The selective introduction of a primary amino group into aromatic compounds is a desirable transformation, but is challenging due to competing double arylation. A catalyst generated from &#946;&#8208;methylnaphthyl (MeNAP) palladium bromide and the bulky ligand biphenyl&#8208;diadamantylphosphine (AdBrettPhos) has been found to promote the amination even of non&#8208;activated aryl chlorides with ammonium triflate within 30&#8197;min at 80&#8201;&#176;C to the primary anilines. The efficiency of the protocol was evaluated in comparative experiments, its versatility documented by the synthesis of various primary anilines including drug&#8208;like molecules.

Abstract
N&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;alkoxyalkyl)benzotriazoles are of great importance for biochemical and antitumor activity. A feasible protocol has been developed for the synthesis of N&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;alkoxyalkyl)benzotriazoles using azoles, aldehydes and alcohols as substrates under electrochemical conditions. The reaction is carried out under acid catalyst&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions, so that a variety of synthetically useful nitrogen heterocyclic derivatives can be obtained. More meaningfully, a gram&#8208;scale synthetic approach was employed to demonstrate the scale&#8208;up applicability of this transformation.

         <title>Atroposelective Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Isokotanin A via Combined Metal and Enzyme Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
In this report a new atroposelective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;isokotanin A is described. The combination of metal&#8208; and enzyme catalysis facilitates a scalable route towards the key axially chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenol building block. We established a one&#8208;pot Miyaura&#8208;Suzuki homocoupling towards the tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biphenol on a decagram scale, applying Buchwald's precatalyst PdG4SPhos and SPhos in low loadings. Next, an enzymatic kinetic resolution method was achieved by utilizing commercially available Candida rugosa lipase for catalyzing the enantioselective hydrolysis of biphenyl dipropionate. The enantiomerically pure tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biphenol was converted in 8 steps to the natural product.

         <title>Visible Light Induced EDA&#8208;mediated Deaminative C&#8208;2 Alkylation of Heterocyclic&#8208;N&#8208;Oxides using Katritzky salts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, a direct C&#8208;2 alkylation of Heterocyclic&#8208;N&#8208;oxides with alkyl amines as Katritzky salts via visible&#8208;light induced deaminative approach was developed. Mechanistic studies revealed that Katritzky salts and base were involved to generate an EDA complex, which underwent intermolecular single electron transfer (SET) to give an alkyl radical intermediate. Finally, the alkyl radical intermediate further underwent&#8208;addition with heterocyclic&#8208;N&#8208;oxide substrates to access the desired products with 63&#8211;94% yield. The method worked well with quinoline&#8208;N&#8208;oxides, pyridine&#8208;N&#8208;oxides, and benzopyrazine&#8208;N&#8208;oxides.

Abstract
A cascade Wolff rearrangement and double N&#8208;acylation reaction has been developed for the synthesis of fused pyrimidinediones in one&#8208;pot under air. These reactions were performed with &#945;&#8208;diazoketones and 2&#8208;aminopyridines or 3&#8208;aminopyrazoles under catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions. The protocol avoided traditional purification procedures, such as organic solvent extraction and column chromatography. The synthesis of biologically active molecules and gram&#8208;scale experiment demonstrated the potential applications of this reaction.

         <title>Synthetic Study on the Lycoricidine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A stereoselective synthesis of isolycoricidine, a natural product belonging to the Amaryllidaceae alkaloids family was produced. In addition, a synthetic study on the main core of lycoricidine led to the formation of analogues and a diastereomer of dihydrolycoricidine. Our strategy was based on an oxidative phenol dearomatization, a stereoselective Heck process, a selective dihydroxylation on a dienone system, several stereoselective reductions, and an oxidative retro&#8208;Michael procedure as an amine&#8208;deprotecting group strategy. Furthermore, two steps highlight the usefulness of hypervalent iodines in total synthesis of natural products.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective dearomative [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction between N,N&#8208;dimethylhydrazone derived from 9&#8208;anthracenecarbaldehyde and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is reported. The developed strategy utilizes HOMO&#8208;rising activation of diene (via hydrazone formation) and aminocatalytic LUMO&#8208;lowering activation of dienophile (via iminium ion formation). High chemical and stereochemical efficiency have been obtained owing to the application of J&#248;rgensen catalyst. Target cycloadducts were subjected to selected transformations aiming at unmasking the hydrazone moiety that proceeded with preservation of optical purity introduced in the organocatalytic step.</dc:description>

Abstract
A variety of 5&#8208;indo&#8208;1&#8208;yl pyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones with an N&#8722;C axis were prepared via a carbene&#8208;catalyzed oxidative [3+3] annulation of indole&#8208;1&#8208;pyruvate esters and enals. Asymmetric construction of pyran&#8208;2&#8208;one ring from enals ensures the realization of this strategy. The resulting compounds were converted into axially chiral N&#8208;arylindoles with an N&#8722;C axis via a cycloaddtion aromatization.

Abstract
Despite advances in the development of catalytic asymmetric Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, introducing &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters as dienophiles remains challenging owing to their low reactivity. Herein, we report that a chiral aminocatalyst in conjunction with a chiral isothiourea catalyst or a Br&#248;nsted acid can promote enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective Diels&#8208;Alder reactions between 2,4&#8208;dienals and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters. This method proceeds through the formation of chiral trienamine intermediates for the exo&#8208;cycloaddition with activated dienophiles, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acylammonium species or protonated N&#8208;heteroaryl&#8208;substituted alkenes. Through synergistic activation of both dienes and ester dienophiles, densely functionalized cyclohexenes bearing multiple stereocenters can be afforded with up to &gt;25:1 dr and &gt;99% ee. Moreover, we show that variation of the configurations of the chiral catalysts and the olefin geometry allows the stereodivergent preparation of four stereoisomers of the enantiopure exo&#8208;products.

The inside cover picture illustrates the introduction of a catalyst&#8208;free three&#8208;component coupling reaction for the synthesis of 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. This innovative process employs light&#8208;activated electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes to initiate single&#8208;electron reduction via carboxylic acid derivatives, triphenylphosphine, and sodium iodide. Subsequently, decarboxylation fragmentation gives rise to nucleophilic alkyl radicals, enabling sequential radical coupling with both electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208;rich olefins. This approach showcases extensive substrate compatibility, offering a well&#8208;defined pathway to valuable compounds and highlighting its versatility for various transformations and the modification of natural products. Details can be found in the Communication by Hongze Liao and co&#8208;workers (Z. Su, J. Zhang, H.&#8208;W. Lin, H. Liao, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2023, 365, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202300645)

Abstract
An electrochemically&#8208;driven organocatalytic enantioselective oxidative coupling of tetrahydroisoquinolines and acrylaldehyde was developed. Various chiral C1&#8208;alkenyl tetrahydroisoquinolines derivatives were obtained with 69&#8211;86% yields and 93:7&#8211;96:4 er. Notable features of this reaction include asymmetric organocatalysis (5.0&#8197;mol% &#946;&#8208;ICD as catalyst), electricity as the oxidant, air atmosphere, and undivided cell. This synthetic route offers access to various optically active C1&#8208;substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines derivatives.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Functionalization of Remote C&#8722;H Bonds by Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag&#8208;type Reactions</title>

Abstract
Nitrogen radicals are one of the most useful reactive intermediates for selective transposition via intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). The Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag (HLF) reaction is a distinctive radical&#8208;based approach in which nitrogen radicals are used for remote C&#8722;H bond functionalization via intramolecular HAT. Due to its excellent regioselectivity and atomic economy, the HLF reaction represents a new approach for the preparation of valuable functional molecules. In this review, we provide a brief overview of recent research advances in remote C&#8722;H bond functionalization via nitrogen radicals mediated HLF&#8208;type reactions involving intermolecular cyclization, intramolecular cyclization, and remote &#948;&#8208;site functionalization.

Abstract
A substrate&#8208;dependent, regio&#8208; and stereocontrolled diversity&#8208;oriented organocatalytic vinylogous Michael addition/cyclization cascade of 2&#8208;alkylidene indane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones with enals, using secondary amines as the catalyst, has been developed. This allows the synthesis of spiroindane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones, tetrahydrofluoren&#8208;9&#8208;one derivatives, and benzofused oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes in a highly selective manner. Plausible catalytic pathways for the formation of these biologically interesting compounds were proposed. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have clarified and supported the mechanisms how the organocatalyst is able to activate the enals and 2&#8208;hydroxycinnamaldehydes, directing the C&#8722;C bond forming with the vinylogous dienolates and enabling the synthesis of these interesting indane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones derivatives.

Abstract
Herein, we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated hydroaminoalkylation of pyrimidin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones via the aza&#8208;Giese&#8208;type reaction in presence of acridinium dye as photocatalyst under mild aerobic conditions. Using N&#8208;Boc protected aminoalkyl trifluoroborates as radical precursors and various pyrimidine&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one substrates, a diverse set of Biginelli&#8208;type 3,4&#8208;dihydropyrimidin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones was prepared in 31&#8211;73% yields. Further transformation of the products obtained enabled the synthesis of 3,6,7,7a&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione derivatives which showed promise as inhibitors of poly (ADP&#8208;ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes (IC50 0.46&#8211;1.12&#8197;&#956;M for PARP&#8208;2 in a fluorometric assay).

Using &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Boc protected aminoalkyl trifluoroborates as radical precursors and various pyrimidine-2(1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-one substrates, a diverse set of Biginelli-type 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-ones was prepared in 31&#8211;73% yields. Further transformation of the products obtained enabled the synthesis of 3,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyrrolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-2,5-dione derivatives which showed promise as inhibitors of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes (IC50 0.46&#8211;1.12&#8197;&#956;M for PARP-2 in a fluorometric assay).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
The Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed ortho alkylation of N&#8208;pyridylcarbazoles with nitroalkenes has been developed, furnishing a wide range of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;nitroalkyl)carbazoles. Both aromatic and aliphatic nitroalkenes participated in this alkylation reaction successfully. This protocol also proceeded well with an indoline based substrate. Derivatization of the representative nitroalkane product was described.

         <title>Selective C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization of Unprotected Indoles by Donor&#8208;Acceptor Carbene Insertion</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Copper catalysts containing alkoxydiaminophosphine (ADAP) ligand catalyze the selective C3&#8722;H functionalization of unprotected indoles upon carbene transfer from donor&#8208;acceptor diazo compounds, the N&#8722;H bond remaining unaltered during the transformation. Mechanistic studies, including DFT calculations, allows proposing the existence of two competitive pathways, none of them occurring through the formation of cyclopropane intermediates, at variance with previously reported systems.

         <title>Selective Catalysts for the Homogeneous Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and highly selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of terminal alkynes to alkenes using neutral dimeric rhodium(I) complexes of the type [Rh(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(PP)]2 is presented. Dehydroisophytol (DIP) was chosen as the alkyne for this study because of its high importance in the industrial production of synthetic vitamin E. Excellent selectivity of over 91% towards the alkene was achieved with known and new rhodium catalysts. No deactivation was observed for the [Rh(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(PP)]2 complexes and the molar Rh:DIP ratio could be increased to 1:20 000, and importantly, no reduction in selectivity was observed. The results presented open the door to the industrial application of homogeneous rhodium complexes in the semihydrogenation of terminal alkynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Potential of 3&#8208;Hydroxyindolinones: Synthesis of Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones through Acid&#8208;Promoted Azidation and Ring&#8208;Expansion</title>

Abstract
We report herein a synthesis of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones from 3&#8208;hydroxyindolin&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives, which can be synthesized from commercially available isatins in one or two steps. The reaction proceeded through a CF3CO2H&#8208;mediated azidation via a carbocation, followed by acid&#8208;induced N2 extrusion and ring&#8208;expansion. Both CF3CO2H and the solvent 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol were found to be crucial for this rearrangement. The axial chirality in 3&#8208;hydroxyindolin&#8208;2&#8208;one skeleton was fully preserved in the products.

Abstract
Described herein is a visible light&#8208;mediated radical addition/SO2 insertion/anionic cyclization of benzo&#8208;fused homoallylic tosylates, allowing access to a diverse array of otherwise challenging&#8208;to&#8208;access fluoromethylated polycyclic &#947;&#8208;sultines with two adjacent tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenters in 49&#8211;95% yields, which can be further readily functionalized towards bulky two adjacent tetrasubstituted carbon&#8208;containing benzo&#8208;fused &#947;&#8208;sultone and mercaptoalkanol. Sodium fluoroalkanesulfinates were utilized as bifunctionalization reagents for both fluoromethyl groups and SO2. The cyclization proceeds through a stepwise photoinduced radical addition followed by an intramolecular 5&#8208;exo&#8208;tet anionic substitution cyclization after SO2 insertion.

         <title>Electrochemical Approach to Amide Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Electrochemical amidation of the C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of broad spectrum of arenes toward the direct synthesis of anilides and N&#8208;benzylamides under mild conditions (room temperature, ambient pressure) in the absence of metal catalyst and external oxidizing agents using nitriles RCN (R=Me, Et) as amide source is described. This electrochemical approach features moderate to high yields, a broad scope of arenes with different functional groups and is amenable to gram scale synthesis. The key role of the hydroxyl radical as inductor generated during the oxidation of water and fixed by a spin trap in EPR experiment has been established.

Abstract
This study presents an approach for the electrochemical oxidation ring&#8208;opening/cyclization reaction of methylcyclopropane with diselenides/ditellurides, leading to the synthesis of diverse 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalene derivatives with exceptional selectivity and efficiency. This methodology involves C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization, ring opening and cyclization processes. One characteristic of this method is its ability to accommodate a wide range of substrates with various functional groups.

The inside cover picture illustrates the most recent advances that were reported for the (aza and thia) Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction via energy transfer (EnT) and direct excitation in visible light. Visible light photochemistry has injected new vitality into traditional (aza and thia) Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction, overcoming some long&#8208;standing challenges and achieving significant achievements in this fascinating field. A series of four&#8208;membered heterocycles with novel structures and complex skeletons have been successfully synthesized, including some bioactive pharmaceutical cores and marketed drugs. The application of visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered (aza) Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction in analytical chemistry, and materials science has also received great attention. Details can be found in the Review by Qing&#8208;Bao Zhang, Qiang Liu and co&#8208;workers. (Q. &#8208;B. Zhang, Y. Yang, S. Zhang, Q. Liu, Adv. Synth.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydrogenation: Divergent Synthesis of Quinolines and Quinolones from ortho&#8208;Nitrobenzyl Alcohols</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we report the divergent synthesis of quinolines and quinolones via a transfer hydrogenative condensation of ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl alcohols in one step. The reaction proceeded using the cyclopentadienone iron complex without any additional redox reagents. After transfer hydrogenation between ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl alcohols and secondary alcohols, the subsequent Friedl&#228;nder annulation affords polysubstituted quinoline products in 22&#8211;90% (39&#8197;examples). The developed method was also applied to synthesize quinolones by using primary alcohols instead of secondary alcohols (12 examples). The obtained quinoline products were converted into several drug candidates to demonstrate its synthetic potential.

         <title>Synthesis of 9,10&#8208;Dibenzoyl&#8208;phenanthrene Derivatives Through a Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Domino Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed domino approach toward synthetically challenging phenanthrene derivatives has been developed. The procedure involves a sequence of oxidative homocoupling, cyclization, and oxidation starting from deoxybenzoin derivatives halogenated in the ortho position. Good assembly efficiency and good functional group tolerance have been observed with yields from moderate to excellent. A plausible reaction mechanism has been proposed based on experimental results and literature data.

Abstract
Herein, we report a cascade strategy towards 9&#8208;amino&#8208;10&#8208;alkynylphenanthrenes, which involves copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed reactions of 2&#8217;&#8208;cyano&#8208;biaryl&#8208;2&#8208;aldehyde N&#8208;tosylhydrazones and terminal alkynes in a one&#8208;pot manner. In addition, the obtained 9&#8208;amino&#8208;10&#8208;alkynylphenanthrenes could be engaged as &#960;&#8208;extending building blocks in the synthesis of 9H&#8208; dibenzo[3,4:5,6]borinino[1,2&#8208;b]phenanthro&#8208;[9,10&#8208;e][1,2]azaborinine (BNTBA), a new&#8208;type BN&#8208;embedded PACs, which shows the different properties compared with its all&#8208;carbon analogue tribenzo[f,k,m]tetraphene (TBA). The present synthetic method starts from easily available commercial substrates and provides a practical way for the syntheses of highly functionalized phenanthrenes and &#960;&#8208;extension BN&#8208;embedded PACs.

         <title>[2 + 2 + 1 + 1] Cycloaddition Reaction of 1,3,5&#8208;Triazinanes with Methylene Compounds: Approach to Hexahydropyrimidines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An acetic acid&#8208;catalyzed [2 + 2 + 1 + 1] cycloaddition of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes with methylene compounds was developed. This protocol provides an access to hexahydropyrimidines (HHPs) (25 examples) in 35&#8208;99% yields under mild conditions in 2 hours. The potential application of this method was demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Preliminary mechanistic investigation was conducted to elucidate the possible mechanism. This work represents the yet unknown example of [2 + 2 + 1 + 1] cycloaddition reaction between 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes and active methylene compounds.</dc:description>
