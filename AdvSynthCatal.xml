         <title>Development of a Radical Silylzincation of (Het)Aryl&#8208;Substituted Alkynes and Computational Insights into the Origin of the trans&#8208;Stereoselectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl&#8208; and hetaryl&#8208;substituted acetylenes undergo regio&#8208; and stereoselective silylzincation by reaction with [(Me3Si)3Si]2Zn in the presence of Et2Zn (10&#8211;110 mol%) as additive. The distinctive feature of this addition across the C&#8211;C triple bond is its trans stereoselectivity. The radical nature of the silylzincation process is supported by diagnostic experiments and DFT calculations, which also corroborate the role played by steric effects to obtain that stereoselectivity. The procedure can be combined in one&#8208;pot with the copper(I)&#8208;mediated electrophilic substitution of the C(sp2)&#8211;Zn bond, with retention of the double bond geometry. This makes it valuable for the synthesis of stereodefined di&#8208; and trisubstituted vinylsilanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Borata&#8208;alkene species as nucleophilic reservoir</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Monoboryl anions show a remarkable stability due to the valence deficiency of the adjacent three coordinate boron center and can be expressed as its resonance form, the borata&#8208;alkene systems [R2B=CH2]&#8208;. The diversity on synthetic approaches as well as the properties of the C=B bond are disclosed in this review attending both electronic and structural properties of the boryl moieties involved. A full characterization in solid state through X&#8208;ray diffraction, demonstrates the short distances between B and C, as a consequence of the boron ylide character in the boron stabilized carbanions. This review includes a collection of C&#8208;B length distances as well as 11B NMR data that can be useful for diagnostic evidences of the partial boron&#8208;carbon double bond character. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis on DFT computed structures also support and justify the borata&#8208;alkene character. 
The reactivity of the C=B bond acting as nucleophilic synthon, is unveiled through extensive electrophilic trapping examples. The homologation protocols with diborylmethane,  via single carbon chain extension, involves a facile introduction of the C(sp3)&#8722;B bonds which can be subsequently transformed into functionalized target products, containing C&#8208;O, C&#8208;N or C&#8208;C bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Synthesis of Polysubstituted 4&#8208;Aminoquinolines from Ynones and 2&#8208;Aminobenzonitriles under Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>

Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and base&#8208;promoted one&#8208;pot reaction of ynones with 2&#8208;aminobenzonitriles is described. The reaction was initiated through sequential aza&#8208;Michael addition/intramolecular annulation to afford various multisubstituted 4&#8208;aminoquinolines and 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridines in good to excellent yields. Operational simplicity, high atom&#8208;economy with broad substrate scope makes this protocol more attractive. Also, the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and further transformation of the product were studied. Additionally, 2&#8208;haloarylyones as substrate provide N&#8208;arylquinolones as the sole product via the SNAr mechanism.

         <title>Recyclable Copper Nanoparticles&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroboration of Alkenes and &#946;&#8208;Borylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyl Compounds with Bis(Pinacolato)Diboron</title>

Abstract
Nano&#8208;ferrite&#8208;supported Cu nanoparticles (Fe&#8208;dopamine&#8208;Cu NPs) catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroboration of alkenes with B2pin2 is reported under mild reaction conditions. This protocol can be applied to a broad range of substrates with high functional group compatibility. In addition, we demonstrated the use of Fe&#8208;dopamine&#8208;Cu NPs as a catalyst for the &#946;&#8208;borylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones and ester, providing alkylboronate esters in up to 98% yield. Reuse of the magnetically recyclable catalyst resulted in no significant loss of activity in up to five reaction runs for both systems.

         <title>[3+1+1] Annulation Reaction of Benzo&#8208;1,2&#8208;Quinones, Aldehydes and Hydroxylamine Hydrochloride: Access to Benzoxazoles with Inorganic Nitrogen Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A synthesis of benzoxazoles with an inorganic nitrogen source is reported. By employing large&#8208;tonnage industrial feedstock inorganic hydroxylamine hydrochloride as the nitrogen source, its [3+1+1] annulation reaction with benzo&#8208;1,2&#8208;quinones and aldehydes delivers various useful benzoxazoles in high yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies prove that the quinone oxime rather than the aldehyde oxime is the reaction intermediate.

         <title>Manganese(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective C6&#8208;Alkenylation of 2&#8208;Pyridones Using Alkynes via C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed chelation&#8208;assisted direct C6&#8208;H alkenylation of 2&#8208;pyridones with both terminal and internal alkynes in a highly regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective manner has been developed. The catalytic system consisting of Mn(CO)5Br catalyst and KOAc additive allows 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridones to undergo efficient alkenylation with various terminal alkynes in methyl tert&#8208;butyl ether (MTBE) to furnish the C6&#8208;alkenylated 2&#8208;pyridone products in high yields, and the alkenylation with internal alkynes occurs effectively in CH2Cl2 at increased catalyst and additive loadings. Mechanistic studies suggest the involvement of a five&#8208;membered organomanganese as the key intermediate in the catalytic cycle. Notable features of the protocols include 100% atom economy, excellent stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectivities, broad substrate scope, and high tolerance of a wide variety of functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp2)&#8722;H Oxidative Coupling of (Hetero)arenes Using 3d Transition Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H oxidative coupling has emerged as a straightforward and powerful technique for the construction of (hetero)biaryls, with substantial application to drug discovery, agrochemicals, biology, and material sciences. Mainly aryl&#8208;aryl, aryl&#8208;heteroaryl, and heteroaryl&#8208;heteroaryl couplings via double C(sp2)&#8722;H activation using 4d or 5d noble transition metal catalysts have been extensively studied. Considering the earth&#8208;abundant and inexpensive nature of 3d transition metals, the sustainable development of C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp2)&#8722;H oxidative coupling employing such metal catalysts has gained significant attention. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp2)&#8722;H oxidative coupling of (hetero)arenes catalyzed by 3d transition metals.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Synthesis of Rotationally Hindered C12&#8208;Naphthylated Tribenzo[a,c,j]xanthenes through Catalytic Tricyclization of Yne&#8208;Allenones</title>

Abstract
A Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed tricyclization of yne&#8208;allenones with 1&#8208;alkynylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ols has been developed, and used to produce a wide range of rotationally hindered tribenzo[a,c,j]xanthenes with generally good yields and stereoselectivity. This process involves a complex [2+2] cycloaddition relay and [4+2] cyclization cascade, enabling scission/recombination of C&#8722;C triple bonds to access unprecedented hexaheterocyclic architectures. The reaction also features good compatibility with different types of substituents, triple annulation cascade and the efficient control of regio&#8208; and stereochemistry.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Thiocarbonylation of Benzyl Chlorides with Sulfonyl Chlorides for the Synthesis of Arylacetyl Thioesters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A convenient procedure for the synthesis of thioesters has been developed via a palladium&#8208;catalyzed thiocarbonylation of benzyl chlorides with sulfonyl chlorides. Various arylacetyl thioesters were produced in good yields by using sulfonyl chlorides as an odorless sulfur source. Furthermore, W(CO)6 exhibited dual roles as both a solid CO surrogate and reductant here.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Cascade Reaction of Benzaldehyde with Benzylamine and hydroxylamine or Aniline: Synthesis of 1,2,4&#8208;Oxadiazoles and Quinazolines</title>

         <dc:description>The analogous three&#8208;component synthesis strategy for substituted 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole and quinazoline derivatives from readily available benzaldehyde, benzylamine and hydroxylamine or aniline has been developed. Both the cascade reaction sequences involves nucleophilic addition of C&#8208;N bond, introduction a halogen donor, nucleophilic substitution and Cu(II)&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation. This synthesis methodology demonstrated good yields, broad substrate scope and oxygen as a green oxidant. Thus, this synthesis protocol provides strategies for the construction of substituted 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole and quinazolines from readily and simple starting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Haloalkenyl Imidoyl Halides as Multifacial Substrates in the Stereoselective Synthesis of N&#8208;Alkenyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
N&#8208;Alkenyl compounds are versatile synthetic building blocks and their stereoselective transformations are key processes in the synthesis of many prominent classes of natural products, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. However, a large structural variety of known N&#8208;alkenyl compounds and their diverse reactivity have so far precluded the development of a general method for their stereoselective synthesis. Herein we present an aluminum halide&#8208;mediated, highly stereoselective, efficient and scalable transformation of commercially available N&#8208;fluoroalkyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles to N&#8208;haloalkenyl imidoyl halides, and demonstrate their use in the synthesis of stereodefined N&#8208;alkenyl amides, amidines, imines, hydrazonoamides, imidothioates, iminophosphonates, 1,2,4&#8208;triazoles and tetrazoles. The reaction is of wide scope on both the triazole substrate and aluminum halide, providing highly functionalized products. Mechanistic and computational investigations suggest a reaction mechanism involving the triazole ring opening, initiated by the coordination of nitrogen one of the triazole ring to the Lewis acid, N2 elimination and the formation of a vinyl cation intermediate, which reacts with nitrogen&#8208;bound aluminum halide, followed by a series of halide exchange reactions on C&#8722;X and Al&#8722;X bonds.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Free Direct Arene C&#8208;H Amination</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of arylamines via the formation of a C&#8208;N bond is an essential tool for the preparation of functional materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients and bioactive products. Usually, this chemical connection is only possible by transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions, photochemistry or electrochemistry.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of arylamines via the formation of a C&#8208;N bond is an essential tool for the preparation of functional materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients and bioactive products. Usually, this chemical connection is only possible by transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions, photochemistry or electrochemistry.

         <title>Pyrazoleamides in Catalytic Asymmetric Reactions: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Pyrazoleamides are a class of compounds which have received significant attention in the last years in asymmetric catalysis as more reactive and practical surrogates of esters or amides. These readily available reagents have served in a variety of diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective metal&#8208; and organocatalytic transformations, spanning from simple carbon&#8208;carbon or carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond formation to cascade and rearrangement reactions, to produce valuable classes of heterocyclic compounds. More recently, pyrazoleamides have proved to be pertinent reagents in asymmetric catalysis merged with photoredox catalysis, and in more challenging stereoselective bond&#8208;forming reactions, occurring directly from a visible&#8208;light activated substrate/catalyst complex without any charge separation. Both strategies enable new activation concepts useful for the production of difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access intermediates and pharmaceuticals. In this review, an overview of the progress achieved in asymmetric catalytic reactions of pyrazoleamides from 2015 up to middle 2020, is illustrated.

         <title>Break&#8208;and&#8208;Build Strategy for the Synthesis of 2&#8208;Benzoylbenzoxazoles from o&#8208;Aminophenols and Acetophenones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Although compounds with a 2&#8208;benzoylbenzoxazole motif are biologically relevant, there are only a few methods for synthesizing them, most of which relied on multistep process or required substrates bearing activating groups. Herein, we report an efficient method for the synthesis of such compounds by direct reactions of o&#8208;aminophenols with acetophenones promoted by sulfur in DMSO. The reaction was found to proceed via a Willgerodt rearrangement&#8208;type benzoxazolation of acetophenones followed by a benzylic oxidation to reinstall the carbonyl function. This method has a broad substrate scope and good tolerance for sensitive functional groups.

         <title>Electrochemical&#8208;Induced Hydrogenation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Internal Olefins and Alkynes with CH3OH as Hydrogen Donor</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Efficient hydrogenation of electron&#8208;deficient internal olefins and alkynes access to saturate ketone with CH3OH as a single hydrogen donor under electrochemical conditions has been successfully developed. This hydrogenation strategy can be used to convert electron&#8208;deficient internal olefins and alkynes to saturate ketone under electrochemical conditions with exogenous&#8208;reductant and a metal catalyst. Mechanistic studies reveal that radical hydrogenation was involved in this transformation. Notably, various electron&#8208;deficient internal olefins and alkynes could be tolerated in such an electrochemical hydrogenation synthetic strategy and can be easily scaled up with good efficiency.

         <title>Rapid Synthesis of Functionalized Hydrocarbazolones via Indole C2&#8722;H Activation Using Enone Functionality as a Directing Group/Electrophilic Species</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Hydrocarbazolones are a key structural unit in many natural bioactive compounds and are thus a valuable synthetic target. A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization reaction with acceptor/acceptor diazo compounds was developed for synthesizing 2,3&#8208;fused indole variants. An &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated enone was utilized as a directing group for site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H activation and as an electrophile for the subsequent cyclization. Overall, the developed annulation enabled the rapid assembly of synthetically valuable hydrocarbazolones from readily available indoles. Additionally, computational investigations were conducted to elucidate the reaction pathway and rationalize the experimentally observed site&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Photocatalytic Deoxygenative Carboimination towards Functionalized Pyrrolines by Using Unstrained &#947;,&#948;&#8208;Unsaturated Oximes</title>

Abstract
Photocatalytic deoxygenative carboimination of unstrained &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated oximes with &#960;&#8208;acceptors including trifluoromethyl alkenes, 1&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes, gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, acrylates, and styrenes has been achieved which provides an efficient and mild approach to construct structurally diverse and highly functionalized pyrrolines with good functional group tolerance. Importantly, upon utilization of trifluoromethyl alkenes as the coupling partners, the developed protocol not only allows the introduction of the extremely valuable gem&#8208;difluoroalkene functionality and pyrroline moiety into one molecule, but could also further transform the resulting gem&#8208;difluoroalkene&#8208;functionalized pyrrolines to the architecturally intriguing indolizine alkaloids via oxidation/reduction and sequential C&#8722;F bond cleavage. The mechanistic studies indicated that a free&#8208;radical and anionic process was probably involved in this photocatalytic deoxygenative transformation.

         <title>Aromatic C&#8722;H Hydroxylation Reactions with Hydrogen Peroxide Catalyzed by Bulky Manganese Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The oxidation of aromatic substrates to phenols with H2O2 as a benign oxidant remains an ongoing challenge in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we successfully achieved to catalyze aromatic C&#8722;H bond oxidations using a series of biologically inspired manganese catalysts in fluorinated alcohol solvents. While introduction of bulky substituents into the ligand structure of the catalyst favors aromatic C&#8722;H oxidations in alkylbenzenes, oxidation occurs at the benzylic position with ligands bearing electron&#8208;rich substituents. Therefore, the nature of the ligand is key in controlling the chemoselectivity of these Mn&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H oxidations. We show that introduction of bulky groups into the ligand prevents catalyst inhibition through phenolate&#8208;binding, consequently providing higher catalytic turnover numbers for phenol formation. Furthermore, employing halogenated carboxylic acids in the presence of bulky catalysts provides enhanced catalytic activities, which can be attributed to their low pKa values that reduces catalyst inhibition by phenolate protonation as well as to their electron&#8208;withdrawing character that makes the manganese oxo species a more electrophilic oxidant. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the new system can accomplish the oxidation of alkylbenzenes with the highest yields so far reported for homogeneous arene hydroxylation catalysts. Overall our data provide a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of how Mn(II)/H2O2/RCO2H oxidation systems are easily tunable by means of the solvent, carboxylic acid additive, and steric demand of the ligand. The chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selectivity patterns of the current system, a negligible KIE, the observation of an NIH&#8208;shift, and the effectiveness of using tBuOOH as oxidant overall suggest that hydroxylation of aromatic C&#8722;H bonds proceeds through a metal&#8208;based mechanism, with no significant involvement of hydroxyl radicals, and via an arene oxide intermediate.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oxidation of aromatic substrates to phenols with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a benign oxidant remains an ongoing challenge in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we successfully achieved to catalyze aromatic C&#8722;H bond oxidations using a series of biologically inspired manganese catalysts in fluorinated alcohol solvents. While introduction of bulky substituents into the ligand structure of the catalyst favors aromatic C&#8722;H oxidations in alkylbenzenes, oxidation occurs at the benzylic position with ligands bearing electron&#8208;rich substituents. Therefore, the nature of the ligand is key in controlling the chemoselectivity of these Mn&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H oxidations. We show that introduction of bulky groups into the ligand prevents catalyst inhibition through phenolate&#8208;binding, consequently providing higher catalytic turnover numbers for phenol formation. Furthermore, employing halogenated carboxylic acids in the presence of bulky catalysts provides enhanced catalytic activities, which can be attributed to their low pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values that reduces catalyst inhibition by phenolate protonation as well as to their electron&#8208;withdrawing character that makes the manganese oxo species a more electrophilic oxidant. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the new system can accomplish the oxidation of alkylbenzenes with the highest yields so far reported for homogeneous arene hydroxylation catalysts. Overall our data provide a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of how Mn(II)/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/RCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H oxidation systems are easily tunable by means of the solvent, carboxylic acid additive, and steric demand of the ligand. The chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selectivity patterns of the current system, a negligible KIE, the observation of an NIH&#8208;shift, and the effectiveness of using &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;BuOOH as oxidant overall suggest that hydroxylation of aromatic C&#8722;H bonds proceeds through a metal&#8208;based mechanism, with no significant involvement of hydroxyl radicals, and via an arene oxide intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
A rearrangement of propargylic pivalate with isocyanide under transition metal&#8208;free conditions is disclosed. Intermolecular 1,3&#8208;acyloxy and acyl migration enables the rapid formation of a C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond from a C&#8722;O bond and the synthesis of polysubstituted 5&#8208;iminopyrrolones.

Abstract
1,4&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;5&#8208;carboxamido substituted 3&#8208;trifluoromethylpyrazoles are obtained with exclusive regioselectivity under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. This decarboxylative [3+2] cycloaddition protocol was enabled by employing trifluoromethyl nitrilimines as 1,3&#8208;dipoles, and isoxazolidinediones as CO2&#8208;masked alkynyl dipolarophiles. The applicability of this method is further manifested by its compatibility with difluoromethyl, alkyl, aryl, and heteroaryl nitrilimines, as well as the preparation of 4&#8208;carboxylic amido analogue of drug Celebrex.

Abstract
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of ortho&#8208;vinyl aromatic bromides and olefins was achieved through a controllable 1,4&#8208;palladium migration/Heck cascade protocol.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Dehydrative Amination of Sulfamate Esters Tethered to Allylic Alcohols: A Strategy for the Synthesis of Cyclic Sulfamidates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
An efficient synthesis protocol for cyclic sulfamidates has been developed via catalytic intramolecular cyclizations of sulfamate esters tethered to allylic alcohols. The reactions proceed smoothly at room temperature in the presence of (IPr)AuCl (5&#8197;mol%) and AgBF4 (5&#8197;mol%). This protocol features good to excellent yields, high selectivity, broad substrate scope, and mild reaction conditions. This method is also applicable to the synthesis of a seven&#8208;membered sulfamidate.

Abstract
Herein, we report a Palladium(0)&#8208;catalyzed C4 site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H difluoroalkylation of isoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones through a radical pathway. The present reaction enables the preparation of 2,2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;(1&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydroisoquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)acetates/acetamides through the direct cross&#8208;coupling reaction of readily available isoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones with 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoroacetates or 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoroacetamides. Therefore, this method provides an efficient and convenient approach to install a difluoroacetate or a difluoroacetamide moiety into bioactive molecules. Bioassay results showed that introduction of these difluorinated groups at C4 position was beneficial to improve their antiviral activity and compound 5&#8201;ab was found to exhibit similar antiviral activity with commercial Ningnanmycin.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Development of Direct Trifluoromethylselenolation Reagents and Methods</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The introduction of trifluoromethylchalcogen group (CF3O, CF3S and CF3Se) has attracted growing attention in the field of modern organofluorine chemistry. Compared with the CF3S and CF3O chemistry, methods for trifluoromethylselenolation are much less developed owing to the limited availability of CF3Se transfer reagents and synthetic methods. The CF3Se group introduces promising lipophilicity (Hansch&#8208;Leo parameter=1.29) and strong electron&#8208;withdrawing effect (Hammett constants &#963;m=0.44, &#963;p=0.45) which are important parameters for the development of new pharmaceutically relevant compounds. Traditionally, the CF3Se compounds were synthesized by the nucleophilic trifluoromethylation of diselenides and selenocyanates, which suffered from harsh conditions and/or limited substrates scope. Compared with the indirect methods, the direct formation of C&#8722;SeCF3 constitutes is a more efficient approach. In recent years, new reagents and methods were developed which enabled the incorporation of the trifluoromethylselenyl group directly under mild conditions, specifically in transition metal catalysis and photoredox catalysis. In this review, we will focus on direct trifluoromethylselenolation strategies based on the development of new trifluoromethylselenolation reagents and methods.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of trifluoromethylchalcogen group (CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O, CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S and CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se) has attracted growing attention in the field of modern organofluorine chemistry. Compared with the CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S and CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O chemistry, methods for trifluoromethylselenolation are much less developed owing to the limited availability of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se transfer reagents and synthetic methods. The CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se group introduces promising lipophilicity (Hansch&#8208;Leo parameter=1.29) and strong electron&#8208;withdrawing effect (Hammett constants &#963;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;=0.44, &#963;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;=0.45) which are important parameters for the development of new pharmaceutically relevant compounds. Traditionally, the CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se compounds were synthesized by the nucleophilic trifluoromethylation of diselenides and selenocyanates, which suffered from harsh conditions and/or limited substrates scope. Compared with the indirect methods, the direct formation of C&#8722;SeCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; constitutes is a more efficient approach. In recent years, new reagents and methods were developed which enabled the incorporation of the trifluoromethylselenyl group directly under mild conditions, specifically in transition metal catalysis and photoredox catalysis. In this review, we will focus on direct trifluoromethylselenolation strategies based on the development of new trifluoromethylselenolation reagents and methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
In the presence of PhCO2H (20&#8197;mol%), the formal [3+2] cycloaddition between in&#8197;situ formed 1,4&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;one&#8208;based azomethine ylides and azodicarboxylic acid derivatives proceeded readily, thus leading to the formation of trans&#8208;configured spiro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones in up to 98% chemical yield with &gt;20:1&#8197;dr. The relative configuration of the title compounds was unambiguously determined by means of X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis. The reaction mechanism was hypothesized to account for the diastereoselective formation of the isolated spiro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Base&#8208;Controlled C&#8722;N Coupling Reactions: Selective Mono Versus Diarylation of Primary Amines with 2&#8208;Chlorobenzimidazoles</title>

Abstract
Herein, a base&#8208;controlled protocol was developed for the C&#8722;N coupling of primary amines and 2&#8208;chlorobenzimidazoles, affording a handful of secondary or tertiary amines in a selective fashion. Moreover, this protocol was realized under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, and the variation of the base from iPr2NH to LiOtBu completely switched the selectivity from monoarylation to diarylation. Further investigations elucidated that the variety, intrinsic basicity and amount of the utilized bases considerably affected these reactions.

Abstract
Metal&#8208;free reaction of indoloazomethine ylides with 2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)aryl triflates in the presence of TMAF and MeOH provided 1,4&#8208;thiadiazepines through sequential N&#8208;arylation and intramolecular imine addition reaction, which is fully oxidized with p&#8208;chloranil. These compounds are smoothly isomerized to indoloindolizines in quantitative yield. Moreover, formation of indoloindolizine was accessed from indoloazomethine ylide and 2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)aryl triflate in semi&#8208;one&#8208;pot.

Abstract
A procedure on palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative reaction of trifluoroacetimidoyl chlorides and nitro compounds for the construction of pharmaceutically valuable 2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones has been achieved. In this transformation, Mo(CO)6 has been used both as a convenient CO source and a reducing reagent. This newly developed protocol is compatible with various nitro compounds and can be readily scaled up to 1&#8197;mmol scale.

         <title>Organocatalytic Deuteration Induced by the Dynamic Covalent Interaction of Imidazolium Cations with Ketones</title>

Abstract
In this article, we suggest a new organocatalytic approach based on the dynamic covalent interaction of imidazolium cations with ketones. A reaction of N&#8208;alkyl imidazolium salts with acetone&#8208;d6 in the presence of oxygenated bases generates a dynamic organocatalytic system with a mixture of protonated carbene/ketone adducts acting as H/D exchange catalysts. The developed methodology of the pH&#8208;dependent deuteration showed high selectivity of labeling and good chiral functional group tolerance. Here we report a unique methodology for efficient metal&#8208;free deuteration, which enables labeling of various types of &#945;&#8208;acidic compounds without trace metal contamination.

Abstract
A highly efficient cascade Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation/intramolecular chemodivergent cyclization reaction of N&#8208;carbamoylindoles and sulfoxonium ylides has been successfully achieved for the first time. This synergistic process provides rapid access to functionalized dihydropyrimidoindolone and tricyclic [1,3]oxazino[3,4&#8208;a]indol&#8208;1&#8208;ones skeletons under redox neutral conditions with broad substrate scope and remarkable functional&#8208;group compatibility. Further late&#8208;stage modification of structurally complex drug molecules and mechanistic studies were also accomplished.

Abstract
A visible light&#8208;rose bengal&#8208;TBHP mediated, controlled oxidation of N&#8208;substituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinolines is developed for the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones and isoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones. The present method feature's a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerances, and the products were prepared in good to excellent yields. The developed methodology further demonstrated in the synthesis of isoindolo[2,1&#8208;b] isoquinolin&#8208;5(7H)&#8208;one (topoisomerase&#8208;I inhibitor).

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroarylation of Homopropargyl Iodoindoles with Concurrent Alkyl and Iodonium Migrations</title>

Abstract
A selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp) arylation/carbocyclization/iodonium migration reaction sequence has been accomplished. Novel 2&#8208;iodo&#8208;1&#8208;aryl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazoles are now easily available. As this result is contrary to the selectivity observed using gold catalysis, the formation of 2&#8208;iodocarbazoles is noticeable, suggesting a metal&#8208;controlled cyclization through chemo&#8208; and regioselective 1,2&#8208;alkyl migration and 1,4&#8208;iodonium migration.

Abstract
A clean method has been developed for the &#945;&#8208;allylation of phenyl and alpha alkyl phenyl acetonitrile with allylic alcohols. The reaction is catalyzed by nickel complexes in&#8197;situ generated from a combination of Ni(cod)2 and the dppf ligand and performed at 80&#8201;&#176;C in methanol as reaction solvent.	Accordingly to this simple and base&#8208;free protocol that only yields water as a side&#8208;product, many allylic nitriles were synthetized with good yields.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted synthesis of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones has been developed using 9&#8208;mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methylacridinium perchlorate as an organo&#8208;photocatalyst. The atmosphere&#8208;controlled method (Ar/air) enabled the selective synthesis of hydroxyl&#8208; and acyl&#8208;containing quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones under mild reaction conditions without the use of any metal catalysts or toxic reagents. A fluorescent labelling experiment showed that hydroxyl&#8208;containing quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones may have utility in various biological applications as potent fluorophores.

Abstract
Herein we describe a gold&#8208;catalyzed bidirectional synthesis of N&#8208;heteropolycyclic compounds bearing carbazole moieties &#8211; namely &#960;&#8208;extended benzodicarbazoles and &#960;&#8208;extended indolocarbazoles. Overall, four previously unknown core structures were synthesized. This approach is convergent, modular and the gold&#8208;catalyzed key step comprises of a cascade reaction starting from stable di&#8208;azido compounds. The obtained molecules were fully characterized and their optical and electronic properties as well as their performance in organic thin&#8208;film transistors generated by vacuum deposition were studied.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein we describe a gold&#8208;catalyzed bidirectional synthesis of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;heteropolycyclic compounds bearing carbazole moieties &#8211; namely &#960;&#8208;extended benzodicarbazoles and &#960;&#8208;extended indolocarbazoles. Overall, four previously unknown core structures were synthesized. This approach is convergent, modular and the gold&#8208;catalyzed key step comprises of a cascade reaction starting from stable di&#8208;azido compounds. The obtained molecules were fully characterized and their optical and electronic properties as well as their performance in organic thin&#8208;film transistors generated by vacuum deposition were studied. Charge&#8208;carrier mobilities of up to 0.3&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/Vs were measured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
A method for Beckmann rearrangement using ethyl 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfonyloxyimino) acetate (o&#8208;NosylOXY) under microwave irradiation is reported. Ketoximes (19&#8197;examples) are converted to the corresponding amides/lactams with 69&#8211;97% yields in &#8764;10&#8197;minutes without any Lewis acid or co&#8208;catalyst. This is an example of halogen&#8208;free organocatalytic Beckmann rearrangement. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)&#8208; and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)&#8208;based detailed mechanistic investigation suggest that o&#8208;NosylOXY acts as an initiator. Such initiators are reported before based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, we report here the HRMS signatures of two transient intermediates, the nitrilium ion and the nitrilium ion's dimeric species. Rigorous NMR&#8208;based investigation of the reaction mechanism is performed. Our results indicate that the reported Beckmann rearrangement proceeds via two consecutive rearrangements.

         <title>Front Cover Picture: Zinc&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrosilylation of Cyclic Imines: Synthesis of Chiral 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Substituted Pyrrolidines as Pharmaceutical Building Blocks (5/2021)</title>

The front cover picture illustrates the application of Zn&#8208;complex as a key catalyst for enantioselective hydrosilylation of cyclic imines. As the replacement of platinum&#8208;group metals is currently an interesting challenge in catalysis, a promising alternative in asymmetric hydrosilylation, is to use environmentally benign and easily accessible chiral Zn&#8208;based catalysts. I. W&#281;glarz, K. Michalak and J. Mlynarski show that in situ generated zinc&#8208;ProPhenol complex with silane affords pharmaceutically relevant enantioenriched 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted pyrrolidines in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). Details can be found in the communication by Jacek Mlynarski and co&#8208;workers (I. W&#281;glarz, K. Michalak, J. Mlynarski, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2021, 363, 1317&#8211;1321; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202001043).

         <title>Recent Developments in Remote Meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Bond Functionalizations</title>

Abstract
In the past decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the developments of novel methods for the activation/functionalization of inert C&#8722;H bonds as these protocols are not only competent, reduce the waste materials in addition to the reaction time and multiple steps but also allows the reaction to be carried out in a highly regio&#8208;specific manner under operationally simple yet effective reaction conditions. Although, in recent years, a remarkable progress has been made in the field of ortho&#8208;and para&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds functionalization but to our best knowledge, the distal meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation/functionalization is still infancy and is yet to be explore to the advanced level. Hence, we feel that there is an urgent need to aware the research community about where the field of meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization stand at present and where it might be going in near future. To this context, we strive to compile the significant achievements made in the selective meta&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds functionalization since 2018 to till date. More interestingly, we have also displayed an overview of the earlier reports related to the meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation/functionalization at the beginning of this particular manuscript, and hopefully the present review article will open diverse opportunities for the advancement of both academia as well as industry.

Abstract
Mechanochemical reactions by milling, grinding or other types of mechanical action have emerged as a salient green approach because of its wide applications towards academic and industrial chemical communities in sustainable solvent&#8208;free/solvent&#8208;less processes. Liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG) as an extension of traditional solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical techniques by which a small amount of liquid is used as an additive to enhance and/or control reactivity, has been fruitfully applied in the screening of inclusion compounds, cocrystals, salts, solvates, and polymorphs. However, utilization of this important technique in the synthesis of pharmaceutically and biologically relevant targets was not adequately investigated. This review article summarizes an overview of the latest development of LAG mechanochemical approaches in the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and drug&#8208;like fragments, highlights its superiority versus conventional syntheses.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis and Applications of &#945;&#8208;Ketothioesters</title>

Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Ketothioesters have only recently received widespread attention as synthetic intermediates and an impressive growth has been realized for their utilization in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Several elegant approaches such as oxidative thioesterification and radical coupling allow for their convenient synthesis from easily available starting materials, e.&#8201;g., methyl ketones, alkenes, alkynes, and &#945;&#8208;hydroxyketones. Due to their multifaceted and diverse reactivities, several important reactions such as C(O)&#8722;S bond cleavage and S&#8208;migration with various C&#8208;, N&#8208;, and O&#8208;based nucleophiles, Ni&#8208;catalyzed mono&#8208; and double&#8208;decarbonylations, enantioselective carbonyl&#8208;ene reaction, diastereoselective hetero Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with olefins, and different types of cyclization reactions have been observed. They have also proven to be a valuable tool for the synthesis of heterocycles, pharmaceutically relevant anticancer drug, and natural product. However, in comparison to other 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives such as &#945;&#8208;ketooxoesters, &#945;&#8208;ketoamides, and &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehydes, they are much less appreciated as synthetic intermediates. This review summarizes the recent advancements achieved in the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;ketothioesters as well as their applications in the development of new reactions for the formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O bonds, including multiple bond&#8208;forming processes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#945;&#8208;Ketothioesters have only recently received widespread attention as synthetic intermediates and an impressive growth has been realized for their utilization in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Several elegant approaches such as oxidative thioesterification and radical coupling allow for their convenient synthesis from easily available starting materials, e.&#8201;g., methyl ketones, alkenes, alkynes, and &#945;&#8208;hydroxyketones. Due to their multifaceted and diverse reactivities, several important reactions such as C(O)&#8722;S bond cleavage and S&#8208;migration with various &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;, and &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;based nucleophiles, Ni&#8208;catalyzed mono&#8208; and double&#8208;decarbonylations, enantioselective carbonyl&#8208;ene reaction, diastereoselective hetero Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with olefins, and different types of cyclization reactions have been observed. They have also proven to be a valuable tool for the synthesis of heterocycles, pharmaceutically relevant anticancer drug, and natural product. However, in comparison to other 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives such as &#945;&#8208;ketooxoesters, &#945;&#8208;ketoamides, and &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehydes, they are much less appreciated as synthetic intermediates. This review summarizes the recent advancements achieved in the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;ketothioesters as well as their applications in the development of new reactions for the formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O bonds, including multiple bond&#8208;forming processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
Epoxidation of alkenes is a significant reaction in organic chemistry due to its opportunities in producing compounds of biochemical interest. Catalytic epoxidation with first&#8208;row transition elements has gained attention in the latest years wherein manganese based catalysts stand superior by satisfying numerous principles of green chemistry. In this review, we have summarized the recent developments in olefin epoxidation using homogeneous manganese catalysts. Manganese complexes with porphyrin, Schiff base, salen, and other non&#8208;heme ligands made efficient catalytic systems during the last five years. Notably, we witnessed greener approaches in recent reports wherein photo&#8208;catalysis is a promising strategy. We anticipate that the review will benefit the researchers to get a better understanding of the reaction and to choose the best catalysts for their reactions.

         <title>Recent Advances in Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Couplings (CDC) of C&#8722;H Bond in Aqueous Media</title>

Abstract
To develop highly efficient synthetic reactions is quite important in organic chemistry. Cross dehydrogenative couplings (CDC) utilize C&#8722;H bonds of substrates to construct new C&#8722;X (X=C, S, O, N, P) bonds. For CDC, the pre&#8208;functionalization of reaction substrates can be avoided and the C&#8722;X (X=C, S, O, N, P) bonds can be newly formed by simple and efficient synthesis routes. Meanwhile, water is increasingly used as a substitute for organic solvents in cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling because of its rich content, non&#8208;toxicity, and non&#8208; flammability. In recent years, organic chemists are devoted their efforts to explore the cross dehydrogenative couplings (CDC) in aqueous phase which feature high atom utilization rate and environmental friendliness. Herein, we summarized the recent advances in the construction of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;S, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;P bonds through CDC reactions of C&#8722;H bonds in water.

Abstract
Phenanthridine derivatives are one of the most intensively studied families of biologically active compounds. There has been considerable scientific interest in the turn of this century in the synthesis of these N&#8208;containing heterocycles as they are prevalent in many alkaloids and also possess striking biological activities including antibacterial, antifungal, antitumor activities. In this regard, a number of synthetic approaches toward the construction of phenanthridine moieties with various substituents, and to increase their yield have been developed by the synthetic organic community. Even though many researchers have developed various innovative methods for the synthesis of phenanthridine derivatives for the past few years, still there is substantial scope for the discovery of novel synthetic methods. In this review, the latest developments in the diverse synthetic strategies of phenanthridine derivatives in the presence and absence of metals were described. The present review also enlightens the use of different reagents, the diversity of the substrates identified, and the plausible mechanisms unravelled towards the construction of these biologically relevant scaffolds.

Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional aza&#8208;analogues of 1,2&#8208;benzothiazine 1,1&#8208;dioxides have been prepared from sulfonimidamides. Two different protocols are presented. The first is a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed annulation reaction with &#945;&#8208;sulfonyloxyketones leading to 4&#8208;unsubstituted benzothiazine derivatives. By selective bromination with NBS the heterocyclic ring can further be functionalized. In the second approach, an iridium catalyst is applied under solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical conditions providing products with 3,4&#8208;disubstituted thiazine rings from diazoketo esters and diazoketo sulfones.

Abstract
A series of pyridine functionalized porous organic polymers (POPs&#8208;Py&amp;PPh3) have been synthesized by polymerizing tris(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)phosphane and 4&#8208;vinylpyridine. The pyridine moieties in the copolymer materials contribute to CO2 adsorption and promote the subsequent conversion of CO2. The POP supported Ru catalyst (Ru/POP3&#8208;Py&amp;PPh3) shows a high catalytic activity (TON up to 710) in the N&#8208;formylation of various primary and secondary amines with CO2/H2, affording the corresponding formamides in good yields (55&#8211;95%) under mild reaction conditions. The heterogeneous catalyst can be easily separated from the reaction system and reused for at least eight cycles in the N&#8208;formylation of morpholine.

Abstract
We report the first synthesis of 2&#8208;alkenylquinolines from 2&#8208;allylquinolines and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The reaction proceeds in a highly regioselective and enantioselective way and shows a broad tolerance of functionalities both in the aromatic ring of the enal and on the quinoline.

Abstract
The Rh(III)&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H couplings of 1&#8208;naphthols with gem&#8208;difluoromethylene alkynes have been realized for the direct construction of difluorinated dihydrobenzo[de]chromenes with broad substrate/functional group compatibility and good regio&#8208;/chemoselectivity and in an atom&#8208;economic manner. The unique fluorine effects account for the unconventional reaction path involving intramolecular 1,3&#8208;hydrogen migration process to afford the exo&#8208;methylene fragment.

Abstract
The first successful enantioselective hydrosilylation of cyclic imines promoted by a chiral zinc complex is reported. In situ generated zinc&#8208;ProPhenol complex with silane afforded pharmaceutically relevant enantioenriched 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted pyrrolidines in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). The synthetic utility of presented methodology is demonstrated in an efficient synthesis of the corresponding chiral cyclic amines, being pharmaceutical drug precursors to the Aticaprant and Larotrectinib.

Abstract
A catalyst and additive&#8208;free strategy for selective ring&#8208;opening selenocyanation of saturated heterocycles with elemental selenium and TMSCN is developed, affording a series of aliphatic selenocyanates and selenaheterocycles. In the case of unprotected unstrained N&#8208;heterocycles, the reactions offer ammonium selenonitriles that prove to be an efficient selenonitrile reagent.

Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation reactions with Cr(CO)6 as carbonyl source are key for the preparation of N&#8208;ynonylsulfoximines from NH&#8208;sulfoximines and bromoalkynes. The couplings proceed at room temperature with a wide range of substrate combinations affording the corresponding products in good yields.

         <title>Multigram&#8208;Scale Kinetic Resolution of 4&#8208;Acetyl[2.2]paracyclophane</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture was designed by C. Zippel, Z. Hassan and S. Br&#228;se. Kinetic resolution of 4&#8208;acetyl[2.2] paracyclophane via ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrogenation has been realized. This method can be performed on a multigram&#8208;scale and gives access to enantiomerically pure derivatives with planar and central chirality of (Rp)&#8208;4&#8208;acetyl&#8208;PCP (97% ee, 43%) and (Sp,S)&#8208;PCP derivatives (97% ee, 46%), which are useful intermediates since it can be transformed into a wide variety of enantiopure paracyclophane derivatives for the synthesis of PCP&#8208;based ligand/catalyst systems and chiroptical materials. Details can be found in the Update by Stefan Br&#228;se and co&#8208;workers (C. Zippel, Z. Hassan, A. Q. Parsa, J. Hohmann, S. Br&#228;se, Adv. Synth.

Abstract
Herein, we report the [Bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene mediated C&#8722;H bond arylselenylation of 4H&#8208;Pyrido&#8208;[1,2&#8208;a]&#8208;Pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones using readily available organodiselenides. This methodology is scalable and permits for the generation of a broad spectrum of functionally and structurally diverse selenoether derivatives in very promising yields (up to 98%). Notably, this protocol proceeds at ambient conditions and in the absence of a metal. The application of this methodology for the facile synthesis of ArSe substituted 5H&#8208;thiazolo&#8208;pyrido[3,2&#8208;a]pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones is also demonstrated.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Tetrahydro&#8208;Furanyl Spirooxindoles via [3+2] Annulations of 3&#8208;Hydroxyoxindoles and Cyclic Ketolactams</title>

Abstract
Asymmetric construction of pharmacologically interesting tetrahydrofuranyl spirooxindole frameworks has been achieved through organocatalytic [3+2] annulations of the readily available 3&#8208;hydroxyoxindoles and pyrrolidone&#8208;derived cyclic ketolactams. A variety of chiral spiro tetrahydrofuranyl products, which contain four contiguous stereocenters including two tetrasubstituted carbon centers, have been rapidly synthesized with remarkable results (up to 99% yield, &gt;95:5 dr, and 99:1 er). Synthetic derivatization of the hemiketal moiety enables the installation of various halogen atoms into the structurally complex molecules in a stereospecific manner. Preliminary screening of anticancer bioactivity was performed, and 4&#8201;w showed obvious inhibitory capacity to the proliferation on a panel of cancer cell lines.

         <title>Glycosyltransferase Co&#8208;Immobilization for Natural Product Glycosylation: Cascade Biosynthesis of the C&#8208;Glucoside Nothofagin with Efficient Reuse of Enzymes</title>

Abstract
Sugar nucleotide&#8208;dependent (Leloir) glycosyltransferases are synthetically important for oligosaccharides and small molecule glycosides. Their practical use involves one&#8208;pot cascade reactions to regenerate the sugar nucleotide substrate. Glycosyltransferase co&#8208;immobilization is vital to advance multi&#8208;enzyme glycosylation systems on solid support. Here, we show glycosyltransferase chimeras with the cationic binding module Zbasic2 for efficient and well&#8208;controllable two&#8208;enzyme co&#8208;immobilization on anionic (ReliSorb SP400) carrier material. We use the C&#8208;glycosyltransferase from rice (Oryza sativa; OsCGT) and the sucrose synthase from soybean (Glycine max; GmSuSy) to synthesize nothofagin, the natural 3&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucoside of the dihydrochalcone phloretin, with regeneration of uridine 5&#8217;&#8208;diphosphate (UDP) glucose from sucrose and UDP. Exploiting enzyme surface tethering via Zbasic2, we achieve programmable loading of the glycosyltransferases (&#8764;18&#8197;mg/g carrier; 60%&#8211;70% yield; &#8764;80% effectiveness) in an activity ratio (OsCGT:GmSuSy=&#8764;1.2) optimal for the overall reaction rate (&#8764;0.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 catalyst; 30&#8201;&#176;C, pH&#8197;7.5). Using phloretin solubilized at 120&#8197;mM as inclusion complex with 2&#8208;hydroxypropyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin, we demonstrate complete substrate conversion into nothofagin (&#8764;52&#8197;g/L; 21.8&#8197;mg product h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 catalyst) at 4% mass loading of the catalyst. The UDP&#8208;glucose was recycled 240&#8197;times. The solid catalyst showed excellent reusability, retaining &#8764;40% of initial activity after 15&#8197;cycles of phloretin conversion (60&#8197;mM) with a catalyst turnover number of &#8764;273&#8197;g nothofagin/g protein used. Our study presents important progress towards applied bio&#8208;catalysis with immobilized glycosyltransferase cascades.

         <title>Access to Trisubstituted Fluoroalkenes by Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Metathesis</title>

Abstract
Although the olefin metathesis reaction is a well&#8208;known and powerful strategy to get alkenes, this reaction remained highly challenging with fluororalkenes, especially the Cross&#8208;Metathesis (CM) process. Our thought was to find an easy accessible, convenient, reactive and post&#8208;functionalizable source of fluoroalkene, that we found as the methyl 2&#8208;fluoroacrylate. We reported herein the efficient ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed CM reaction of various terminal and internal alkenes with methyl 2&#8208;fluoroacrylate giving access, for the first time, to trisubstituted fluoroalkenes stereoselectively. Unprecedent TON for CM involving fluoroalkene, up to 175, have been obtained and the reaction proved to be tolerant and effective with a large range of olefin partners giving fair to high yields in metathesis products.

         <title>Photochemical and Electrochemical Strategies towards Benzylic C&#8722;H Functionalization: A Recent Update</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalysed processes have been widely used for the functionalization of inert C&#8722;H bonds. Strategies for the functionalization of the benzylic C&#8722;H position having a relatively weak C&#8722;H bond (bond dissociation energy&#8764; 80&#8211;90&#8197;kcal/mol) differ from the inert aliphatic and aromatic C&#8722;H positions with stronger C&#8722;H bonds. The recent advances in the direct activation of the benzylic position through the generation of C(sp3) radicals have demonstrated the potential of electrochemistry and photochemistry as a means for constructing new chemical bonds. This review will cover the recent progress of benzylic C&#8722;H functionalization through organic radical strategies employing photochemistry and electrochemistry as sustainable tools. In addition, the mechanistic details of the typical reactions have been included which, in turn, will help the researchers to look at this promising area from a different perspective towards new discoveries and often hidden opportunities.

         <title>Recent Advances and Strategies for the Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;H Functionalization of N&#8208;Nitrosoanilines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The challenges faced in the activation and functionalization of C&#8211;H bonds while producing high&#8208;value aromatic intermediates are significant for synthetic organic chemistry. This review summarizes the advancements made toward the C&#8211;H functionalization of N&#8208;nitrosoanilines in the past decade, in which the nitroso group coordinates to a transition metal, such as rhodium, palladium, cobalt, iridium, and ruthenium, acting as a directing group to allow the activation of the ortho C&#8211;H bond. The versatility of this synthetic approach has led to the regio&#8208; and chemoselective introduction of various functional groups giving rise to aromatic congeners with diverse functional and structural properties. C&#8211;H functionalized nitroso compounds can be further transformed into valuable synthetic intermediates and unique heterocyclic compounds. A description of the mechanism underlying each reaction is also included. This review includes the following sections:

1. Introduction
2. Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization
3. Palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization
4. Miscellaneous catalysis
    4.1 Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization
    4.2 Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization
    4.3 Iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkynylation of Vinylaziridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkynylation reactions are efficient transformations allowing the straightforward formation of functionalized alkynes. Therein, we disclose the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkynylation of vinylaziridines giving rise to both linear and branched enynes. The optimization of the reaction conditions allowed to determine the key parameters of the cobalt&#8208;based catalytic system. The scope investigation showed that the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkynylation is mainly limited to phenylacetylene derivatives. In most cases branched and linear enynes were isolated in equimolar proportions (20 examples). Additional experiments allowed us to propose a plausible mechanism. Finally, the hydroalkynylation products were further subjected to an iodocyclization affording a 2,3&#8208;dihydropyrrole derivative and a platinum&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein we reported a protocol to access aminated benzofused sultams through sequential ortho&#8208;amination, followed by ipso&#8208;arylation of aryl iodide bearing sulfonamide functional group via palladium/norbornene coorperative catalysis. This reaction has showcased a broad spectrum of substrate scope under mild conditions with moderate to good efficiency.

Abstract
In this study, visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced [3+2] cyclization reactions of hydrazones with hypervalent iodine diazo reagents as diazomethyl radical precursors are reported. Mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group compatibility were observed. Furthermore, the synthetic utility was demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis and elaboration to several value&#8208;added products. This protocol broadens the scope of diazo chemistry, and is applicable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products.

Abstract
A unique cascade sequence of vinylogous Michael addition&#8208;Michael addition&#8208;oxa&#8208;Michael addition using dienone substrates was reported for the first time, achieving the rapid construction of 5/6/5 fused ring compounds in good yields with good to high stereoselectivities under mild conditions. Enantioenriched polycyclic rings can be obtained with high level of enantioselectivity by the stereodivergent resolution using ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation. The protocol provides a concise approach for the construction of the related fused ring substances.

         <title>Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Azoxyarenes via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidative Dehydrogenative Coupling of Anilines with Nitrosoarenes</title>

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenative coupling of nitrosobenzenes with anilines for the synthesis of unsymmetrical azoxybenzenes was developed. This approach uses O2 as the oxidant. The reaction products are diverse unsymmetrical azoxybenzenes rather than azobenzenes, which are obtained in the Mills reaction. The use of an inexpensive copper catalyst, a broad substrate scope, and mild reaction conditions make this protocol an atom&#8208;economic and step&#8208;economic procedure for preparing unsymmetrical azoxy compounds.

Abstract
Here, we review recent progress in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free inter&#8208;element boration reactions via Lewis&#8208;basic activation of various boron reagents, focusing mainly on the boration reactions of carbon&#8208;carbon multiple bonds without an electron&#8208;withdrawing (activating) group and those with an electron&#8208;withdrawing group where the polarity of the addition reaction is inverse to the &#8220;natural&#8221; reactivity.

         <title>Enantioselective Desymmetrization of 1,3&#8208;Disubstituted Adamantane Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates that starting from the tetrahedron as a source, a road splits into two. On the left side of the road, alpha&#8208;amino acid derived from methane is passing. On the right side of the road, amino acid containing the adamantane core derived from adamantane is passing. Hoping that optically active amino acids containing the adamantane core are useful as large analogs of alpha&#8208;amino acids, their preparation by an enantioselective desymmetrization of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted adamantane derivatives via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H bond amination was examined.

         <title>Aryldiazonium Salts in Photoredox Catalysis &#8211; Recent Trends</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Aryl diazonium salts are an important class of organic compounds that are now widely used as arylating agents in photoredox catalysis owing to their lower redox potential, broad substrate scope, and atom economy. They have successfully been used in many interesting organic transformations to introduce an aryl group. They serve as good alternatives for aryl halides and other aryl organometallic reagents primarily used as aryl group surrogates. New reactions using aryl diazonium salts are continually emerging, and in this review, we have highlighted some recent developments in photoredox arylations and their applications.

         <title>Recent Trends and Prospects in the Copper&#8208;Catalysed &#8220;on Water&#8221; Reactions</title>

Abstract
Recalling the serious hazards imposed by the &#8220;ungreen&#8221; techniques used over the years, chemists are now expected to adopt synthetic tactics that strictly adhere to the three E's of green chemistry: Environmental, Economical and Energy efficient. Among the various measures undertaken to improve the benignity of a chemical system, top priority has been given for identifying abundant, non&#8208;toxic and non&#8208;flammable greener solvents such as water, replacing detrimental organic solvents. Despite the safer aspects, reactions in aqueous solutions hardly meet the green chemical standards, particularly due to the challenging product isolation and purification techniques. Sharpless's demonstration of, until then almost unknown, &#8220;on water&#8221; effect was a major breakthrough in the realm of sustainable organic chemistry. Needless to say, integration of homo&#8208;/heterogeneous water&#8208;compatible catalysts under &#8220;on water&#8221; conditions without deteriorating its efficiency, has also awakened the industrial prospects of the protocol. Among the various transition metals, copper complexes or salts are considered as first line catalysts due to their irrevocable contributions to the synthetic world. Also, due to the water tuneable nature of these catalysts, many copper&#8208;catalysed organic transformations that once required harsh conditions, could now be obtained using clean and safe protocols. This review comprehends the recent advancements in the copper&#8208;catalysed &#8220;on water&#8221; reactions covering literatures since 2006.

         <title>Palladium Catalyzed Aminocarbonylation of Benzylic Ammonium Triflates with Nitroarenes: Synthesis of Phenylacetamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A palladium catalyzed reductive aminocarbonylation of benzylic ammonium triflates with nitroarenes for the synthesis of phenylacetamides was developed. Using Pd(acac)2/DPPF catalyst system, a range of different substituted phenylacetamides were prepared in moderate to good yields from benzylic ammonium triflates and nitroarenes through Csp3&#8722;N bond cleavage. A variety of alkyl, aryl, and halide substituents on both substrates can be used, and many useful functional groups can be tolerated.

Abstract
We herein report the ammonium salt&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted isoindolinones bearing a heteroatom functionality in the 3&#8208;position. A broad variety of differently substituted CF3S&#8208; and RS&#8208;derivatives were obtained with often high enantioselectivities when using Maruoka's bifunctional chiral ammonium salt catalyst. In addition, a first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the racemic synthesis of the analogous F&#8208;containing products was obtained as well, giving access to one of the rare examples of a fairly stable &#945;&#8208;F&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid derivative.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Supported, Well&#8208;Defined Metal&#8208;Based Catalysts for C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization and Related Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The use of graphenic materials as support for transition metal&#8208;based catalysts in reactions involving the functionalization of carbon&#8208;hydrogen bonds is reviewed. In many cases, the catalytic activities reported are comparable or better than the homogeneous counterparts, a feature which adds to a substantial degree of recyclability of the materials.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Sulfonyl&#8208; and Bromo&#8208;Substituted Indolo[2,1&#8208;&#945;]isoquinoline Derivatives through Electrochemical Radical Cascade Cyclization</title>

Abstract
A tunable electrosynthesis of sulfonyl&#8208; and bromo&#8208;substituted indolo[2,1&#8208;&#945;]isoquinoline derivatives has been disclosed. In this reaction, a variety of easily available 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl indoles can readily react with sulfonyl and/or bromine radicals, which are generated from arylsulfonyl hydrazides and potassium bromide respectively, to furnish the valuable sulfonyl&#8208; and bromo&#8208;substituted benzindolo&#8208;fused polycyclic compounds in moderate to good yields. Control experiment indicated that the reaction proceeds via a radical cascade cyclization pathway. This protocol features broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance under transition metal&#8208;free and oxidant&#8208;free conditions.

Abstract
Quaternary phosphonium salts have been extensively used in organic synthesis as Lewis acid organocatalysts. This review covers recent applications of phosphonium salts as Lewis acidic catalysts for Mannich, Strecker, and Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions for the formation of C&#8722;C bonds, annulation reactions, etc., allowing the construction of structurally diverse and synthetically useful architectures.

Abstract
The utilization of carbon dioxide as a building block in organic synthesis has become a highly sought&#8208;after research area. In this minireview, an overview of recent advances on carboxylations using carbon dioxide via visible light photoredox and transition&#8208;metal dual catalysis is given. The merging of these methods provides new avenues to construct carboxylates.

Abstract
C4&#8208;C5 periannulation of 1&#8208;naphthols and ynones via BF3.Et2O mediated one&#8208;pot cascade under metal and solvent&#8208;free conditions have been developed for the synthesis of perinaphthenones. Furthermore, this strategy features the formation of new periannulation at C4&#8208;C5 positions of &#945;&#8208;naphthol, synthesis of highly substituted perinaphthenones, broad substrate scope, readily available starting materials and good to moderate yields. The perinaphthenones products synthesized here have exhibited interesting photo physical properties

         <title>Pauson&#8208;Khand Reactions with Concomitant C&#8722;O Bond Cleavage for the Preparation of 5,5&#8208; 5,6&#8208; and 5,7&#8208;Bicyclic Ring Systems</title>

Abstract
Pauson&#8208;Khand reactions (PKR) with concomitant C&#8722;O bond cleavage have been developed for construction of 5,5&#8208; 5,6&#8208; and 5,7&#8208;bicyclic ring systems bearing complex stereochemistry. The chemistry generates intermolecular PKR&#8208;type products in an absolute regio&#8208; and stereochemical control which is hardly achievable through real intermolecular Pauson&#8208;Khand reactions. A mechanism for this Pauson&#8208;Khand reaction has been proposed based on deuterium labelling experiments.

&lt;p&gt;Pauson&#8208;Khand reactions (PKR) with concomitant C&#8722;O bond cleavage have been developed for construction of 5,5&#8208; 5,6&#8208; and 5,7&#8208;bicyclic ring systems bearing complex stereochemistry. The chemistry generates intermolecular PKR&#8208;type products in an absolute regio&#8208; and stereochemical control which is hardly achievable through real intermolecular Pauson&#8208;Khand reactions. A mechanism for this Pauson&#8208;Khand reaction has been proposed based on deuterium labelling experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Recent Advances in Synthesis of Difluoromethylene Phosphonates for Biological Applications</title>

Abstract
For almost 40&#8197;years, difluoromethylene phosphonates have proven to be versatile molecular tools in biochemical studies owing to their close resemblance to naturally occurring phosphates and phosphonates. As bioisosteric, non&#8208;hydrolyzable analogs of these essential molecules, difluoromethylene phosphonates can target the critical parts of the cellular machinery and therefore exhibit a diverse spectrum of biological activity. In the past ten years, there have appeared many new methods for the synthesis of difluoromethylene phosphonates. Most notably, photoredox catalysis has firmly entered the field, while cross&#8208;coupling and nucleophilic strategies have met considerable elaboration and refinement, entirely in accord with the current trends in synthetic organic chemistry. Herein, we introduce difluoromethylene phosphonates as a distinct, high&#8208;tech subclass of synthetic phosphonates resulting from the research efforts on the cross&#8208;section of organophosphorus, organofluorine, and bioorganic chemistry. We then proceed to the discussion of general methods for the preparation of difluoromethylene phosphonates, comprehensively reviewing reactions developed in the past 15&#8197;years while providing the context of earlier works where appropriate. Finally, we present selected examples of molecules with high biological activity, their biological targets, and the synthetic steps employed for their preparation.

         <title>Cascade Chan&#8208;Lam C&#8722;O Coupling/[3,3]&#8208;Rearrangement of Arylhydroxylamines with Arylboronic Acids Toward NOBIN Analogues</title>

Abstract
Herein, we developed a copper&#8208;mediated Chan&#8208;Lam type O&#8208;arylation of arylhydroxylamines with arylboronic acids to generate transient N,O&#8208;diarylhydroxylamines that could rapidly undergo cascade [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement and rearomatization to afford NOBIN (2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl) analogues under mild conditions. The newly synthesized racemic biaryl products can be further resolved by a chiral DMAP&#8208;catalyzed O&#8208;acylation/kinetic resolution protocol.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Preparations and Synthetic Applications of Oxaziridines and Diaziridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Oxaziridines and diaziridines have been used as versatile intermediates due to their high ring strain as well as the reactive C&#8722;O/N bond, for the synthesis of diverse range of nitrogen containing compounds. In the past few decades, numerous novel and handy methodologies on the preparations and utilizations of both the oxaziridines and diaziridines have been developed. In spite of few published reviews in the area (almost a decade back), the synthetic communities have made tremendous progress in their preparations and utilizations. This review has demonstrated the comprehensive advancement in the chemistry of oxaziridines and diaziridines for the last few years (almost a decade).

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Pyrrole&#8208;imidazole Alkaloids via a Tandem C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C coupling Protocol</title>

Abstract
Herein, we present a strategy for the synthesis of pyrrole alkaloid derivatives through a tandem C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C coupling reaction employing 2&#8208;pyrrole formaldehyde and proline as starting materials. This cyclization protocol is successfully applied to polarity&#8208;controlled site&#8208;selective and stereoselective C(sp3)&#8722;H hydrocarboxylation of proline derivatives, allowing for a remarkably streamlined synthesis of pyrrole alkaloid derivatives which have shown promising biological activities.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative alkylselenation of propiolic acids with Se powder and epoxides leading to alkynyl selenides is developed. This protocol not only provides an approach to obtain alkynyl selenides with the formation of double C&#8722;Se bonds, but also expands the applicability of alkynyl carboxylic acid.

Abstract
Regioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition using fluorine&#8208;containing diynes with nitriles was described. Cycloaddition of fluorinated diynes with nitriles under the influence of CoCl2(phen), zinc bromide, and zinc dust in dichloroethane at 80&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8197;h took place smoothly, exclusively affording the corresponding &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkylated pyridines in excellent yields. In addition, dinitriles as substrate were also found to be suitable for this reaction, giving the corresponding fluoroalkylated bipyridine derivatives in excellent yields.

Abstract
Transition metals have been an indispensable component of modern catalysis and among these palladium is the top&#8208;ranked choice of chemists as a catalyst. After the several important developments of palladium catalysed C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions, carbonylative transformations have been realised as an attractive post modification of these reactions. Carbonylative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reaction is among such transformations for direct incorporation of CO fragment for the preparation of biaryl or aryl/alkyl ketones via transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Ketone functionality is basically a valuable building block having huge pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications. Moreover, carbonylative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling is also used in the synthesis of various natural bioactive molecules through the direct joining of molecular fragments via CO bridge. In this review, the past decade developments in the carbonylative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions are documented in detail with modern approaches in transition&#8208;metal catalysis.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Cycloisomerization of 1,3&#8208;Diketones with Keto&#8208;Vinylidenecyclopropanes: Synthesis of Enantiomerically Enriched Cyclic &#946;&#8208;Amino Alcohols</title>

Abstract
We report here an effective and atom&#8208;economical method to synthesize enantiomerically enriched cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols via a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloisomerization of 1,3&#8208;diketones with keto&#8208;vinylidenecyclopropanes. The reactions proceed through a Rh&#8208;catalyzed transformation of keto&#8208;vinylidenecyclopropanes via cleavage of the distal C&#8722;C bond of the three&#8208;membered ring as a three&#8208;carbon synthon, allowing the generation of a range of enantiomerically enriched cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols tethered to an alkene and an 1,3&#8208;dione moiety in good yields with high ee values under mild conditions. Derivatizations including allylation of the functionalized &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols and subsequent RCM reaction as well as the preparation of a pyrazole derivative were carried out as well.

         <title>De Novo Construction of Substituted Terephthalates via Phosphine Catalyzed Domino Benzannulation Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The robustness of phosphine catalysis enabling the domino benzannulation reactions of allenoates with enamines is described. A broad array of substituted terephthalates were delivered under simple and practical reaction conditions. Furthermore, the reaction could be carried out on a gram scale with higher yield, and various conversions of the terephthalate products demonstrate the versatility of this transformation.

         <title>PPTS&#8208;Catalyzed Bicyclization Reaction of 2&#8208;Isocyanobenzaldehydes with Various Amines: Synthesis of Diverse Fused Quinazolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A PPTS (pyridinium p&#8208;toluenesulfonate)&#8208;catalyzed bicyclization reaction of 2&#8208;isocyanobenzaldehydes as 1,5&#8208;dielectrophiles with various amines has been developed. The reaction not only provides a simple and efficient strategy for the assembly of structurally diverse fused quinazoline derivatives from readily available substrates under metal&#8208;free and mild conditions in a single step with only water and hydrogen as the by&#8208;products, but also opens the way to the application of o&#8208;formyl arylisocyanides in the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles.

         <title>Engineering an Alcohol Dehydrogenase from Kluyveromyces polyspora for Efficient Synthesis of Ibrutinib Intermediate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
(S)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypiperidine [(S)&#8208;NBHP] is a key intermediate for the synthesis of mantle cell lymphoma drug, ibrutinib. Here, KpADH, an alcohol dehydrogenase from Kluyveromyces polyspora, exhibits evolutionary potential in the asymmetric reduction of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;3&#8208;piperidone (NBPO) to (S)&#8208;NBHP. By screening key residues in substrate binding pocket of KpADH, an excellent variant Y127W was obtained with 6&#8208;fold improved activity of 119.3&#8197;U&#8201;mg&#8722;1, 1.8&#8208;fold enhanced half&#8208;life of 147&#8197;h and strict S&#8208;stereoselectivity (&gt;99% ee). When catalyzed by Y127W, a complete conversion of 600&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 NBPO was achieved at a substrate to catalyst ratio (S/C) of 30 in 10&#8197;h. Based on crystal&#8208;structure of Y127W, molecular docking and dynamic simulations reveal hydrogen bonds formed between W127 and Boc group of NBPO, as well as improved structural stability mainly contribute to the increased catalytic activity and stereoselectivity of Y127W. This study offers guidance for engineering ADHs for biosynthesis of chiral heterocyclic alcohols, and provides insights into mechanisms in catalytic activity and stereoselectivity toward carbonyl&#8208;containing heterocyclic substrates.

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Boc&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypiperidine [(&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;NBHP] is a key intermediate for the synthesis of mantle cell lymphoma drug, ibrutinib. Here, &lt;i&gt;Kp&lt;/i&gt;ADH, an alcohol dehydrogenase from &lt;i&gt;Kluyveromyces polyspora&lt;/i&gt;, exhibits evolutionary potential in the asymmetric reduction of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Boc&#8208;3&#8208;piperidone (NBPO) to (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;NBHP. By screening key residues in substrate binding pocket of &lt;i&gt;Kp&lt;/i&gt;ADH, an excellent variant Y127W was obtained with 6&#8208;fold improved activity of 119.3&#8197;U&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 1.8&#8208;fold enhanced half&#8208;life of 147&#8197;h and strict &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;stereoselectivity (&amp;gt;99% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;). When catalyzed by Y127W, a complete conversion of 600&#8197;g&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; NBPO was achieved at a substrate to catalyst ratio (S/C) of 30 in 10&#8197;h. Based on crystal&#8208;structure of Y127W, molecular docking and dynamic simulations reveal hydrogen bonds formed between W127 and Boc group of NBPO, as well as improved structural stability mainly contribute to the increased catalytic activity and stereoselectivity of Y127W.

The front cover picture, designed by K. Nomura and K. M. Dawood illustrates the basic mechanism for Z&#8208;selective (cis&#8208;specific) olefin metathesis by molybdenum, ruthenium and vanadium catalysts. The review includes reports for transition metal catalyzed Z&#8208;selective olefin metathesis reactions (EROCM, CM, ROMP, and RCM) applied for organic synthesis and polymer synthesis. The review also includes basic background in the catalyst design, ligand modifications, which play an essential role for the success. Details can be found in the review by Kamal M. Dawood and Kotohiro Nomura (K. M. Dawood, K. Nomura, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2021, 363, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202001117).

         <title>Salicylic Acid&#8208;Promoted Three&#8208;Component Annulation of Benzimidazoles, Aryl Nitroalkenes and Elemental Sulfur</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, a three&#8208;component cyclization reaction of benzimidazoles, aryl nitroalkenes and elemental sulfur has been developed. Cheap and easily available salicylic acid found to be an efficient mediator for the present transformation. This protocol provides a facile access to structurally significant imidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazole skeleton from simple raw materials with a range of compatible synthetically useful functionalities. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale preparation of this method is effective, which enables potential applications of it in broader fields of molecule synthesis. Mechanistically, a reaction cascade involving sequential aza&#8208;Michael addition, nucleophilic sulfuration, and deaminative aromatization was proposed.

         <title>High&#8208;Level Production of Phenylacetaldehyde using Fusion&#8208;Tagged Styrene Oxide Isomerase</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude improvement in the production of phenylacetaldehyde to 3.37&#8197;M (405&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1) from the enzymatic isomerisation of styrene oxide was achieved. A small ubiquitin&#8208;related modifier (SUMO) tag increases the productivity of the whole&#8208;cell biocatalytic system by enhancing the expression of active membrane&#8208;bound styrene oxide isomerase (SOI) while retaining enzyme catalytic efficiency and broad natural substrate scope. The isomerisation was performed by using Escherichia coli expressing SUMO&#8208;tagged SOI in an organic&#8208;aqueous biphasic system to yield 96% of phenylacetaldehyde.

Abstract
[2.2]Paracyclophane (PCP) derivatives have been promising platforms to study the element of planar chirality and through&#8208;space electronic communications in &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular systems. To access enantiomerically pure derivatives thereof, a kinetic resolution of 4&#8208;acetyl[2.2]&#8208;PCP employing a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrogenation process was developed. This method can be performed on a multigram&#8208;scale and gives access to enantiomerically pure derivatives with planar and central chirality of (Rp)&#8208;4&#8208;acetyl&#8208;PCP (&#8805;97% ee, 43%) and (Sp,S)&#8208;PCP derivatives (&#8805;97% ee, 46%), which are useful intermediates for the synthesis of sterically demanding PCP&#8208;based ligand/catalyst systems and chiral synthons for engineering cyclophane&#8208;based chiroptical materials.
