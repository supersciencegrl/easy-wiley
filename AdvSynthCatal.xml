         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Assisted Transition Metal&#8208;Free Aminocyanation of Alkynes with Arylamines and N&#8208;Cyanosuccinimide</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free aminocyanation of aryl alkynes has been achieved using indium tribromide, InBr3 or B(C6F5)3 as a Lewis acid. This aminocyanation protocol features with non&#8208;toxic cyanide source, a good substrate scope and valuable aminocyanation products. Mechanistic studies reveal the complex formation between Lewis acid and alkyne to produce in situ alkyne nitrile as a key intermediate. Further hydroamination of alkyne nitrile with arylamines affords the E&#8208;selective (majorly) &#946;&#8208;aminoacrylonitrile derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Chichibabin&#8208;Type Phosphonylation of 2&#8208;(Hetero)aryl Pyridines: Selective Synthesis of 4&#8208;Phosphinoyl Pyridines via an Activated N&#8208;benzylpyridinium Salt</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A direct C&#8208;H phosphonylation of pyridine by N&#8208;benzylating activation is reported, which afforded 4&#8208;pyridylphosphine oxides with high regioselectivity, without the employment of metal catalyst or expensive activator. By increasing the electrophilicity of pyridinium with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the N&#8208;benzyl group, the phosphonylation process could be realized at room temperature. Control experiments and NMR investigation confirmed the interaction between DBU and diphenylphosphine oxide which generated the true phosphorus nucleophile. Moreover, DFT calculations offered enough insight into an intermolecular cooperative dehydrogenation&#8208;debenzylation mechanism, which helped to elucidate the origin of C4&#8208;regioselectivity in this metal&#8208;free Chichibabin&#8208;type phosphonylation.</dc:description>

         <title>4&#8208;(Dimethylamino)pyridinium Azide in Protic Ionic Liquid Media as a Stable Equivalent of Hydrazoic Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a procedure for the multigram synthesis of 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridinium azide, stable, non&#8208;explosive, low&#8208;hygroscopic source of azide ion soluble in both protic and aprotic organic solvents. In protic ionic liquid media this reagent was shown to serve as a safer equivalent of toxic and unstable hydrazoic acid. The high synthetic utility of this system was demonstrated using donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane ring opening as a model process. General procedures furnishing a variety of dialkyl (2&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;arylethyl)malonates or 4&#8208;azido&#8208;4&#8208;arylbutyrates, depending on the protic ionic liquid applied, were elaborated. The conversion times for studied donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes were established providing the relative reactivity sequence. The application of 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridinium azide for a conventional nucleophilic substitution, oxirane ring opening, (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition to (thio)cyano group as well as their combinations realized as telescopic synthesis was also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalysed Synthesis of Propargyl Alcohol and Derivatives from Acetylene and other Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A copper(I)/phosphine system that homogeneously catalyses the alkynylation of formaldehyde with acetylene or terminal alkynes is reported. Using acetylene at atmospheric pressure, the catalyst consisting of &lt;1&#8197;mol% copper(I) phenylacetylide and a trialkyl bisphosphine ligand shows a high selectivity towards the formation of propargyl alcohol rather than 1,4&#8208;butynediol, which is not reported for common heterogeneous copper acetylide catalysts. The biphasic water/toluene reaction mixture allows the separation of targeted products with the aqueous layer and catalyst recycling via the organic layer.

         <title>Suzuki Coupling of Activated Aryltriazenes for Practical Synthesis of Biaryls from Anilines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Aryltriazenes can hardly take part in productive organic transformations unless stoichiometric Br&#246;nsted or Lewis acid activators are used. We report here for the first time a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki coupling of aryltriazenes activated by a sulfonyl group at N3 atom under the common basic conditions. Benefiting from elimination of stoichiometric acid activators, activated aryltriazenes could efficiently couple with arylboronic acids to afford diaryls in modest to excellent yields by using a simple catalyst at low loading, 0.3&#8197;mol% Pd(PPh3)2Cl2. Scope and limitation of the coupling are demonstrated with 26 examples.

Abstract

The reaction was carried out with an Ir&#8208;based photocatalyst and Cs2CO3 as a base. The desired functionalized long&#8208;chained alkylated derivatives were obtained in 48&#8211;93% yields under mild reaction conditions without any external metal co&#8208;catalysts, oxidants, or additives. Various alkyl carboxylic acids and amino acid derivatives are used as alkylating reagents to synthesize the &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated diesters, and unnatural homo&#8208;allylic amino acid derivatives with excellent functional groups tolerance. The utility of this method was showcased by performing a gram&#8208;scale synthesis. A mechanism is proposed based on control experiments and quenching studies.

Abstract
We have developed a method for constructing tricyclic [1,2&#8208;a]indoles via nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular imine&#8208;alkene coupling reactions. This method enables syntheses of 6&#8208;5&#8208;5 and 6&#8208;5&#8208;6 tricyclic [1,2&#8208;a]indoles. The use of NIXantphos or DPPPent as a ligand and 4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid as a co&#8208;catalyst is crucial for the reaction. The synthetic utility of the method was demonstrated by converting the product into useful indole amines.

Abstract
An photosensitizer&#8208; and additive&#8208;free, visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced decarboxylative aminoalkylation/C&#8722;O coupling cyclization of enaminones with N&#8208;arylglycine for the synthesis of 3&#8208;aminoalkyl chromones has been achieved. This synthetic method features good functional&#8208;group tolerance, mild reaction conditions and no request of photocatalyst or additive, thus making this protocol more practical and sustainable.

Abstract
Tofacitinib is an oral protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. Its efficient production remains a challenge due to the two consecutive stereogenic centers associated to the piperidine ring. In this study, an enzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;asymmetric reductive amination was developed to prepare enantiomerically complementary cis&#8208;1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;N,4&#8208; dimethylpiperidin&#8208;3&#8208;amine and its analogues. Two enantiocomplementary imine reductases (IREDs) were identified for the synthesis of (3R,4R)&#8208; and (3S,4S)&#8208;1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;N,4&#8208;dimethylpiperidin&#8208;3&#8208;amine in high isolated yields (83% and 91%) with excellent stereoselectivity (97% and &gt;99% ee values) and diastereoselectivity (&gt;99:1 dr), providing a green methodology for the production of the key intermediate of tofacitinib.

Abstract
Dirhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular insertion of aryldiazoacetates into an unactivated primary C&#8722;H bond was described in this study. The insertion reaction of aryldiazoacetates with ortho&#8208;isopropyl or ortho&#8208;ethyl groups in the presence of a catalytic amount of dirhodium(II) tetrakis(triphenylacetate), Rh2(tpa)4, at room temperature proceeded site&#8208;selectively to afford 2&#8208;unsubstituted indane&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylates in 75%&#8211;96% yields. In the case of o&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;substituted aryldiazoacetates, cis&#8208;isomers were obtained as major products. Furthermore, a chemoselective C&#8722;H insertion reaction of aryldiazoacetate bearing 1&#8208;oxyethyl&#8208;substituent at the ortho position was achieved by using a bulky and electron&#8208;deficient pivaloyl group as the protecting group of a highly active oxygen atom. The present reaction provided a direct route to 2&#8208;unsubstituted indanes.

         <title>Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Asymmetric Allylic Amination with Pyridones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein a catalytic synthetic method for enantioenriched N&#8208;substituted pyridones. By employing chiral iridium catalyst generated from the Carreira [P/olefin] ligand, intermolecular asymmetric allylic amination of allyl alcohols with pyridones proceeded smoothly with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selectivities (&gt;19:1 N/O, &gt;19:1 b/l and &#8805;89% ee). The reaction underwent through a kinetic resolution process under mild conditions and displayed a broad substrate scope for both pyridones and allylic alcohols. The potential of this method was demonstrated by a gram&#8208;scale reaction with only 0.6 mol% catalyst loading and diverse transformations of the amination products to useful skeletons.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Catalysts generated by combinations of Pd(TFA)2 and pyridine&#8208;hydrazone ligands have been applied to 1,2 addition of arylboronic acids to aliphatic N&#8208;carbamoyl (Cbz) hydrazones, affording protected &#945;&#8208;aryl monoalkylhydrazines with high enantioselectivities (37&#8208;99% ee).

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Enantioselective Halohydrin Dehalogenases &#8211; Group B</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) possess an unnatural activity of introducing functionalities such as N3, CN, NO2 etc., into a molecule through the ring&#8208;opening reaction of epoxides. The enantioselectivity of HHDHs is substrate&#8208;dependent and not always high enough for synthetic applications. B&#8208;group of HHDHs has been neglected in the past, due to observed low enantioselectivity based on performance on a relatively limited number of substrates. Extensive screening of substrates on HheB2 from Mycobacterium sp. GP1 and HheB from Corynebacterium sp. N&#8208;1074 was performed. Several highly enantioselective reactions were discovered (E &gt; 200), with HheB showing higher enantioselectivity and activity toward larger panel of substrates compared to HheB2. Enzymes HheB and HheB2	are highly homologous; they differ by only 4 residues. By using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, residues 120 and 125 were found to be responsible for higher enantioselectivity of HheB compared to HheB2. Computational analysis supported the observed enantioselectivity and provided evidence that kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of reactions within HheB enzymes are crucial in determining the observed selectivities towards enantiomers. Due to remarkable activity and enantioselectivity, B&#8208;group HHDHs emerged as a catalyst of choice for the synthesis of bulky tertiary alcohols, as shown in this work.</dc:description>

         <title>Pentafluorophenyl Group as Activating Group: Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Deuterio Carboxylic Acid Derivatives via Et3N Catalyzed H/D Exchange</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
We discovered that highly regioselective H/D exchange can be achieved on the &#945;&#8208;position of the pentafluorophenyl (Pfp) ester using Et3N as the catalyst and D2O as the deuterium source. Our computational and experimental results showed that the Pfp group can significantly increase the acidity of the &#945;&#8208;hydrogen of the ester. This mild reaction condition tolerated a variety of functional groups. 90%&#8764;98% yields and 91%&#8764;98% deuterium incorporations were obtained with all the tested Pfp esters. Taking advantage of the high reactivity of Pfp esters, a series of valuable &#945;&#8208;deuterio carboxylic acid derivatives, including herbicide, drugs and drug intermediates, have been synthesized using &#945;&#8208;deuterio Pfp esters as precursors.

         <title>Insight into the Stereocontrol of DNA Polymerase&#8208;Catalysed Reaction by Chiral Cobalt Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantiomers of chiral substances typically have distinct biological activities, thus, the explorations of biochemical processes at the enantiomeric level has has very high significance. This study investigated DNA polymerase&#8211;catalyzed reaction modulated by various types of chiral cobalt complexes. The experimental data showed that polymerase reactions were inhibited or accelerated in the presence of K[Co(edta)]&#183;2H2O or [Co(en)3]I3&#183;H2O. More importantly, the stereocontrol of bioreactivity was found to be different for the enantiomers&#65292;which was reflected in their ability to bind to the polymerase reaction system. The docking simulation illustrated that the acceleration or inhibition of polymerase reaction could be correlated with diverse electrostatic energy induced by the attached metal chelates, whereas the different stereocontrol of bioreactivity for the enantiomers was attributed to a discrepancy of Van der Waals interactions between the enantiomer and polymerase catalytic sites.</dc:description>

The experimental data showed that polymerase reactions were inhibited or accelerated in the presence of K[Co(edta)]&#183;2H2O or [Co(en)3]I3&#183;H2O. More importantly, the stereocontrol of bioreactivity was found to be different for the enantiomers&#65292;which was reflected in their ability to bind to the polymerase reaction system. The docking simulation illustrated that the acceleration or inhibition of polymerase reaction could be correlated with diverse electrostatic energy induced by the attached metal chelates, whereas the different stereocontrol of bioreactivity for the enantiomers was attributed to a discrepancy of Van der Waals interactions between the enantiomer and polymerase catalytic sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Functionalization of white phosphorus with disulfides, amines and KOH to phosphoramidodithioates containing both P&#8722;N, P&#8722;S and P=O bonds via a four&#8208;component reaction is presented. It proceeds with high yields and provides an attractive approach for the construction of valuable N&#8722;P(O)&#8722;S motif using a one&#8208;step strategy. The advantages of this newly developed process include a clean reaction profile, complete conversion of white phosphorus, transition metal&#8208;free and halogen&#8208;free environmentally benign system, and large&#8208;scale synthetic application. Besides, phosphoramidodithioates can also be utilized to construct P&#8722;C, P&#8722;O and P=S bonds with the appropriate reagents.

         <title>Synthesis of Quinolines and 2&#8208;Functionalized Quinolines by Difluorocarbene Incorporation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A general method is developed to allow de novo construction of quinolines and C2&#8208;functionalized quinolines from ortho&#8208;alkenyl anilines in the presence of a difluorocarbene precursor. This method exploits a crucial reactivity of in&#8208;situ generation of isocyanides from condensation of primary aniline with difluorocarbene. Subsequent &#945;&#8208;addition of isocyanide by neighbouring alkenyl group constructs the quinoline ring. Furthermore, when a combination of difluorocarbene precursor and Se are present, selenoisocyanate intermediates are tentatively generated that upon nucleophilic addition by ortho&#8208;alkenyl produce 2&#8208;SeH quinolines. In the presence of a second nucleophile such as anilines, competing nucleophilic addition of anilines to the selenoisocyanate is preferred, generating selenourea intermediate. Further nucleophilic addition of the ortho&#8208;alkenyl to selenourea followed by elimination of H2Se produces 2&#8208;aminoquinolines. This allows one&#8208;step multi&#8208;component modular preparation of various C2&#8208;functionalized quinolines from readily available starting compounds. This method shows good yields, scope and chemoselectivity. It is operationally convenient and friendly without manipulating unpleasant isocyanides. The difluorocarbene&#8208;enabled primary amine to isocyanide conversion may be exploited to develop other interesting reactions.

         <title>Ylide&#8208;Functionalized Diisopropyl Phosphine (prYPhos): A Ligand for Selective Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Couplings of Aryl Chlorides</title>

Abstract
The ylide&#8208;functionalized diisopropyl phosphine (prYPhos) promotes Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings of aryl chlorides and bromides with arylboronic acids. Using Pd2(dba)3/prYPhos as the catalyst and K2CO3 as the base, various (hetero)biaryls were synthesized in 45&#8211;98% yields at mild reaction conditions, tolerating sensitive functional groups and steric hindrance. The electron rich, sterically demanding ligand induces a high selectivity for halides versus triflate. Chloroaryl triflates were selectively coupled at the chloride, leaving inherently more reactive triflate groups in place.

Abstract
5&#8208;Oxazoyl&#8208;sulfamates have been profiled as versatile building blocks for modifications of oxazoles with various nucleophiles. The unified approach provides a diversification platform to directly access 5&#8208;amino&#8208;oxazoles, 5&#8208;oxazolyl&#8208;sulfides, and 5&#8208;oxazoyl&#8208;aryl ethers from a single precursor.

Abstract
A DBU/AgOTf relay&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction of 2&#8208;alkynylbenzaldehydes and &#945;&#8208;diazo esters for the efficient construction of 1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofuran derivatives has been documented. This protocol can tolerate a wide range of substrates and its scalability is demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale reaction. Moreover, the obtained 1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofurans can be converted to indanone derivatives by a AgOTf&#8208;catalyzed ring recombination process. Both of the resulting products, 1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofurans and indanones, are important structural units of a variety of pharmaceuticals and natural products, and their structures are clearly confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

Abstract
Six&#8208; or seven&#8208;membered dibenzosultams were synthesized upon treatment of N&#8208;aryl&#8208; or N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2&#8208;halobenzenesulfonamides with HCOONa&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O in DMSO without using additional measures and additives, such as light irradiation, electrochemical apparatus, transition metals, and oxidants. Further functionalization of the free NH group of the resultant dibenzosultams demonstrates the synthetic practicability of this method.

Abstract
An asymmetric decarboxylative Mannich reaction of phosphonate sultam&#8208;ketimines with malonic acid half esters is developed enabled by saccharide&#8208;derived bifunctional amino thiourea catalysis. This protocol provides access to a broad range of &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carboxylic phosphonates featuring the N,P&#8208;containing tetrasubstituted stereocenters with 78&#8211;99% ee. Further synthetic derivatizations could allow the introduction of amide, alcohol, and azetidine scaffolds to the core structures.

Abstract
This review outlines the progress over recent years in the reactions involving combined approach of hypervalent iodine reagents and transition metals such as palladium, nickel, iridium, gold, rhodium, copper, iron, ruthenium, platinum, silver, zinc, rhenium and cobalt. This approach enables organic transformations complimentary to traditional manifolds. Hypervalent iodine reagents play a preeminent role in organic chemistry due to their versatile reactivity, heteroatom ligands and mild reaction conditions. These reagents in combination of transition metal compounds are used in many synthetically useful organic reactions such as oxidation, rearrangement, amination, halogenation, amidation, ring&#8208;opening, cyclization and C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C functionalization reactions, etc. which are discussed here.

         <title>Nanoconfinement Effects of Micellar Media in Asymmetric Catalysis</title>

Abstract
Replacement of organic solvents, in particular chlorinated, aromatic, and polar aprotic ones, is an emerging issue that can find a solution in the development of catalytic reactions in water. Nature performs a multitude of chemical transformations in water under mild conditions mediated by enzymes. In particular the nanoconfinement effects of the enzymes ensure high activity and impressive stereoselectivities. Micellar catalysis is nowadays a real alternative approach to catalysis in traditional organic media, enabling good activity under mild conditions, with the advantage of possible catalyst and micellar medium recycling. Micellar media emerged also as good nano&#8208;environments for stereoselective reactions, with many examples of chemical transformations mediated by metal and organo&#8208;catalysts for which improvements of stereoselectivity were observed with respect to the same reaction under homogeneous conditions in traditional organic solvents. More specifically, both the catalytically active site and the micelles provided by the surfactant can contribute to the asymmetric induction, partially resembling what known in terms of stereoselectivity imparted by the active site of enzymes and metallo&#8208;enzymes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replacement of organic solvents, in particular chlorinated, aromatic, and polar aprotic ones, is an emerging issue that can find a solution in the development of catalytic reactions in water. Nature performs a multitude of chemical transformations in water under mild conditions mediated by enzymes. In particular the nanoconfinement effects of the enzymes ensure high activity and impressive stereoselectivities. Micellar catalysis is nowadays a real alternative approach to catalysis in traditional organic media, enabling good activity under mild conditions, with the advantage of possible catalyst and micellar medium recycling. Micellar media emerged also as good nano-environments for stereoselective reactions, with many examples of chemical transformations mediated by metal and organo-catalysts for which improvements of stereoselectivity were observed with respect to the same reaction under homogeneous conditions in traditional organic solvents. More specifically, both the catalytically active site and the micelles provided by the surfactant can contribute to the asymmetric induction, partially resembling what known in terms of stereoselectivity imparted by the active site of enzymes and metallo-enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reaction between aromatic aldehydes and DMSO was developed, which afforded &#946;&#8208;keto sulfoxides in 73&#8211;92% yields. The reaction process involved base&#8208;promoted DMSO addition to aldehydes, and copper&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation. Furthermore, the aromatic alcohols which could be oxidized to aldehydes are also suitable substrates for this catalytic system.

Abstract
In the present study, 2D Co(II) coordination polymers (CP&#8208;1), which integrate terminal CoBrn (CoBr2 and CoBr3) sites immobilized on the framework, are synthesized at the gram level. As a special heterogeneous catalyst, CP&#8208;1 shows regioselectivity (&#946;:&#945;&gt;99:1) and stereoselectivity (only E configuration) in the hydroboration of alkynes. The hydroboration reaction conditions are mild and cover a broad substrate range (31 examples). In addition, the heterogeneous catalyst can be recycled for at least five times.

Abstract
An in tandem enantioselective Heck&#8208;Matsuda (HM) reaction of cyclic and acyclic olefins directly from anilines is described. The method relies on a process involving the progressive in&#8197;situ diazotization of the starting anilines followed by a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Heck&#8208;Matsuda arylation using chiral N,N&#8208;ligands. This intermolecular enantioselective HM arylation strategy was applied to the desymmetrization of three distinct unactivated olefins as proof of concept. The method demonstrates broad substrate scope furnishing the Heck adducts in good to excellent enantiomeric ratios of up to 99:1, high diastereoselectivities (cyclopenten&#8208;3&#8208;ol with &gt;20:1 dr), and good overall yields of up to 82% over 2 or 3 steps.

Abstract
Enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening allylic alkylation of a cyclopropanol with an allyl phosphate was developed using a phenol&#8208;NHC chiral ligand. DFT calculations indicated that a copper homoenolate is formed via Li&#8722;Cu bimetallic activation of a cyclopropoxide and that syn&#8208;SN2&#8217; attack of the Cu center of the homoenolate to the allyl phosphate followed by facile C&#8722;C bond formation affords the &#946;&#8208;allylated ketone. Noncovalent interaction analysis showed that the enantiocontrol is achieved by the synergy of electrostatic interactions among Cu, Li, and O atoms, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions, and C&#8722;H/&#960; London dispersions.

Abstract
An asymmetric allylation of cyclic ketimine esters with vinylethylene carbonates was accomplished through a Pd/Cu dual catalysis system under a mild condition, providing a range of trisubstituted allylic 2H&#8208;pyrrole analogues bearing a chiral quaternary stereogenic center in high yields (up to 92% yield) and with excellent regioselectivities and enantioselectivities (up to 96% ee). A gram&#8208;scale operation was also conducted in high efficiency without erosion of enantioselectivity and stereoselectivity.

         <title>Aryl&#8208;alcohol&#8208;Oxidase&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Piperonal and Other Valuable Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of fungal aryl&#8208;alcohol oxidases in biocatalysis is still modest, despite their advantageous capability to produce valuable aldehydes via oxidation of the respective alcohols without the need for costly external cofactors. For biocatalytic application, enzyme stability in the presence of organic solvents required for substrate solubilization has to be investigated, and process limitations due to low oxygen supply and the accumulation of the by&#8208;product H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must be addressed. In this study, we showed that the aryl&#8208;alcohol oxidase &lt;i&gt;Pe&lt;/i&gt;AAO2 from &lt;i&gt;Pleurotus eryngii&lt;/i&gt; P34 remained active and stable in the presence of up to 30 % (v/v) various organic solvents and up to 500 mM H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The potential of this biocatalyst was explored based on conversion of piperonyl alcohol to the fragrance compound piperonal. After reaction optimization, product titers of up to 245 mM were achieved within 3 h. Addition of catalase was imperative to re&#8208;introduce O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as co&#8208;substrate into the reaction, thereby diminishing oxygen limitation. On a preparative scale, space&#8208;time&#8208;yield of 9.5 g/l/h was achieved and 244.6 mg piperonal (85 % yield) with &gt;99 % purity were isolated via simple crystallization from &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;hexane extract. Under optimized reaction conditions four other substrates, cumic alcohol, 2&#8208;thiophenemethanol, &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;2,4&#8208;heptadienol and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;2&#8208;&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;6&#8208;nonadienol, at concentrations of up to 300 mM were converted to the corresponding aldehydes within 20 h. Our results demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;Pe&lt;/i&gt;AAO2 is a versatile and promising biocatalyst for the production of valuable aldehydes.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Aldol Reaction of Isocyanoacetic Acid Derivatives Enabled by Cooperative Participation of Classical and Nonclassical Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The silver&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric aldol reaction of isocyanoacetic acid derivatives with aldehydes has been developed by employing a chiral prolinol&#8208;phosphine as a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating P,N,O ligand. DFT calculations indicated that the reaction proceeds in a stepwise manner, involving C&#8211;C bond forming carbonyl addition and subsequent enantioselectivity&#8208;determining oxazoline ring formation. An O&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O/sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O two&#8208;point hydrogen bond donated by the prolinol moiety of the ligand activates the aldehyde in the C&#8211;C bond formation step and facilitates the subsequent cyclization under stereocontrol by the catalyst. The calculations further suggest that additional non&#8208;classical C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O hydrogen bonds as well as London dispersion interactions may also participate synergistically in the stereocontrol.</dc:description>

The reaction was conducted under environmentally friendly conditions using i&#8208;PrOAc as the solvent and a non&#8208;toxic fluorinating reagent. Moreover, the reaction was performed at room temperature and did not require a transition&#8208;metal catalyst or additives.

Abstract
A ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of allenoates with arylamines has been developed. This strategy provides an approach to synthesize E&#8208;allylic amines in good yields with high atom&#8208;economy and high levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and E&#8208;selectivities with a broad substrate scope.

Abstract
Organosilicon reagents are highly versatile and privileged scaffolds in modern synthetic chemistry, largely due to the range of transformations the groups are amenable to. The &#946;&#8208;Silicon effect is one of the fundamental phenomena underpinning the inherent reactivity of organosilicon reagents, allowing unsaturated organosilanes to undergo a range of electrophilic substitutions with a variety of nucleophiles. The application of the &#946;&#8208;Silicon effect in a range of organic transformations is reviewed with the discussion divided up based on the class of silane. The reactivity of these compounds towards carbon, heteroatom and metallic electrophiles is discussed from classical applications such as the Sakurai allylation to contemporary applications such as cross&#8208;coupling chemistry. In addition, examples of these transformations in the context of methodology development and natural product synthesis are provided.

         <title>Visible Light Mediated C&#8208;2 Functionalization&#8208; and
Deoxygenative Strategies in Heterocyclic N&#8208;Oxides
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Heterocyclic N&#8208;oxides are prevalent in numerous natural products with broad applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, material sciences, and asymmetric synthesis. Owing to their profound biological, physiological, and unique chemical reactivities, the importance of these compounds has stimulated a substantial interest of organic synthetic chemists. More importantly, C&#8208;2 functionalization of heterocyclic N&#8208;oxides including pyridine&#8208;, isoquinoline&#8208;, pyrazine&#8208;,  quinoxaline&#8208;, and quinoline N&#8208;oxides, etc.,  has been hailed as amongst the most important strategies for heterocyclic functionalization. Besides, deoxygenation of heterocyclic N&#8208;oxides has also emerged as a reaction of significance in organic chemistry. In the past decade, visible light photoredox catalyzed C&#8208;2 functionalization and deoxygenation of these heterocyclic N&#8208;oxides have drawn substantial attention owing to their mild reaction conditions. This review has been categorized based on visible light&#8208;mediated nondeoxygenative C&#8208;2 functionalization (alkylation, fluoroalkylation, arylation, acylation, and amination), deoxygenative C&#8208;2 functionalization (sulfonylation, alkynylation, alkylation, and acylation), and deoxygenation 	(without C&#8208;H functionalization) of heterocyclic N&#8208;oxides. For most part of the work, the substrate scope, limitation, and  mechanism of the reaction have been well discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined Ni&#8722;SNS Complex Catalysed Borrowing Hydrogenative &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Ketones and Dehydrogenative Synthesis of Quinolines</title>

Abstract
The &#8220;borrowing hydrogen&#8221; (BH) method for C&#8208;alkylation reactions using alcohol as alkylating agents is an important synthetic transformation. In this respect, designing cheap and bench stable earth abundant metal catalyst for borrowing hydrogen transformation is a key challenge to be witnessed. Herein we have presented a synthesis of non&#8208;phosphine, easily accessible and bench stable SNS&#8722;Ni complexes. The Ni&#8208;catalyst was successfully applied for the C&#8208;alkylation of ketone enolates to &#945;&#8208;alkylated ketones. Primary alcohol with different functional groups and various heteroaromatic alcohols are well tolerated. The present catalyst system was efficiently applied to gram scale synthesis and also the green chemistry metrics of the reaction were calculated. The present protocol was also extended successfully for the synthesis of biologically important quinoline moieties. Finally, various control experiments and deuterium labelled experiments suggest that the reaction proceeds via borrowing hydrogen pathway.

         <title>Recent Progress in Solid&#8208;Phase Total Synthesis of Naturally Occurring Small Peptides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Many naturally occurring small peptides have significant therapeutic properties. Total synthesis of these peptides is not only helpful in the identification of their structures and providing methods to synthesize their analogues, but also contributes to their biosynthetic studies. As solid&#8208;phase synthesis simplifies the tedious and time&#8208;consuming isolation of intermediates, it has been widely applied in peptide synthesis. This review has highlighted the recent progress in solid&#8208;phase total synthesis of both linear and cyclic naturally occurring small peptides from 2014 to July 2021.

         <title>Acidic Hydrogen&#8208;Tethered Allylic Carbonates for Phosphine&#8208;Catalyzed (4+2) Annulation of Sulfamate&#8208;Derived Cyclic Imines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The acidic hydrogen&#8208;tethered allylic carbonates were successfully applied in phosphine catalysis. Their (4+2) annulation reaction with sulfamate&#8208;derived cyclic imines under phosphine catalysis worked well to produce tetrahydropyridine&#8208;fused heterocyclic compounds in high yields. A moderate ee was obtained in the initial screening. The zwitterionic intermediate produced through in&#8208;situ deprotonation functioned as a four&#8208;membered synthon.

Abstract
Reported herein is a photocatalytic platform for the vicinal aminopyridylation of indoles. The accurate difunctionalization reaction undergoes a tandem process involving a radical&#8208;mediated 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddtion which generated from the single&#8208;electron oxidation of N&#8208;aminopyridinium ylides, a cleavage of the N&#8722;N bond as well as an oxidation of indoline ring. The electrophilic pyridyl and nucleophilic amino groups can be installed simultaneously into a wide range of indoles under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions. Moreover, the protocol shows high levels of step and atom economy.

         <title>Intramolecular Aerobic Ring Expansion of Cyclic Ketone: A Mild Method for the Synthesis of Medium&#8208;Sized Lactones and Macrolactones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An operationally simple protocol for the synthesis of medium&#8208;sized lactones and macrolactones via an intramolecular ring expansion of cyclic ketones has been developed. Using this method, a series of 10&#8208; and 12&#8208;membered lactones was synthesized under mild conditions. Preliminary mechanistic studies showed that a radical pathway might be involved in this reaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An operationally simple protocol for the synthesis of medium-sized lactones and macrolactones via an intramolecular ring expansion of cyclic ketones has been developed. Using this method, a series of 10- and 12-membered lactones was synthesized under mild conditions. Preliminary mechanistic studies showed that a radical pathway might be involved in this reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Direct Thioamination of Cyclohexanones via Difunctionalization with Thiophenol and Aniline</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A synthetic method of o&#8208;sulfanylanilines from cyclohexanones, amines, and thiophenols under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions is disclosed. This is the first report on the direct thioamination of cyclohexanones via N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) promoted oxidative dehydroaromatization. Non&#8208;aromatic cyclohexanones were smoothly dehydrogenated, and acted as an aryl source using oxygen as a green oxidant. The capacity of the resultant o&#8208;sulfanylanilines for synthesis of N&#8208;arylphenothiazines has been further demonstrated.

The front cover picture illustrates the Cinchona&#8208;alkaloid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric and ortho&#8208;selective Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction between activated phenols and trihaloacetaldehydes. The reaction scheme, accompanied by portraits of Charles Friedel (upper right) and James Mason Crafts (lower left), contains pictograms and a background image representing our faculty building with its departments. The catalytic process developed by our group features a reasonably general substrate scope and provides the resulting adducts in good yields and enantioselectivities. Moreover, the possible downstream transformations of products were surveyed. Further details can be found in the Research Article by Otevrel and co&#8208;workers (D. Svestka, J. Otevrel, P.

         <title>Selective 5&#8208;Exo&#8208;Dig versus 6&#8208;Endo&#8208;Dig Cyclization of Benzoimidazole Thiols with Propargyl Alcohols</title>

Abstract
We describe here the Lewis acid&#8208;promoted cyclization reaction of benzomidazole thiols with propargyl alcohols for the selective synthesis of benzoimidazolo thiazines and benzothiazolo imidazoles. The reaction is regioselective and the solvent controls the formation of products. The systematic study to determine the best reaction conditions revealed that the six&#8208;membered benzoimidazolo thiazines were obtained by reacting the benzoimidazole thiols with propargyl alcohols in the presence of boron trifluoride etherate, using dichloromethane as the solvent. Replacement of dichloromethane with dimethylformamide, by using the same starting material and reagents, gave selectively the five&#8208;membered benzothiazolo imidazoles. The mechanism of this cyclization was proposed based on the results obtained and several control experiments.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed, Chelation&#8208;Assisted C&#8722;H Alkenylation and Allylation of Organic Molecules with Unactivated Alkenes</title>

Abstract
Olefins are important building blocks and are widely utilized in synthetic organic chemistry. Owing to its omnipresence and unique reactivity, the functionalization of alkenes has become a powerful method for constructing complex organic molecules. In this context, direct chelation&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H olefination at the inert C&#8722;H bonds represents the most straightforward synthetic method for introducing the alkenyl group into organic compounds in a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner. Despite the remarkable advances in chelation&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H olefination reaction, most of the successful transformations are restricted to activated or electronically biased olefins such as acrylates, styrenes, acrylamides, vinyl sulfones, and vinyl phosphonates. Literature reports on chelation&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H olefination with unactivated or electronically unbiased alkenes are limited due to poor intrinsic reactivity and regioselectivity issues. Despite significant challenges, the past few years have witnessed tremendous growth. The present review describes the recent advances in the chelation&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H olefination and allylation of aromatics, alkenes, and heteroaromatics with unactivated alkenes via the concerted&#8208;metallation&#8208; deprotonation pathway.Transition metals such as palladium, rhodium, iridium and cobalt are widely used for these kind of transformations. The scope, mechanistic investigation, and limitation of the alkenylation and allylation reactions are discussed elaborately. The present review includes all the reported C&#8722;H olefination and allylation reactions with unactivated olefins via the base&#8208;assisted deprotonation pathway.

Abstract
Difunctionalization of alkenes enables construction of complex compounds in one pot. In this report, we presented an intermolecular, redox&#8208;neutral three&#8208;component dicarbofunctionalization of activated alkenes under mild reaction conditions. The mechanistic studies indicated tertiary alkyl radicals from oxalate salts were first added to alkenes in Giese&#8208;type fashion, followed by nucleophilic addition with aldehydes to produce the desired 1,2&#8208;dialkylation products. The catalyst system does not require any additives, with good functional group compatibility, regioselectivity, and constructs two tertiary carbon centers simultaneously.

         <dc:description>








Abstract
The direct asymmetric addition of heteroatom nucleophiles to imines represents one of the most efficient tools for the formation of carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds and has received much interest recently. The review is devoted to the asymmetric addition reactions of non&#8208;carbon nucleophiles to imines. The present review is divided into five main sections: reactions with N&#8208;nucleophiles; reactions with P&#8208;nucleophiles; reactions with O&#8208;nucleophiles; reactions with S&#8208;nucleophiles; reactions with Se&#8208;nucleophiles. It has been seen that chiral catalysts such as quinines, BINOLs, chiral phosphoric acids as well as various Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids are the source of asymmetry of the presented reactions of asymmetric addition of non&#8208;carbon nucleophiles to imines.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direct asymmetric addition of heteroatom nucleophiles to imines represents one of the most efficient tools for the formation of carbon-heteroatom bonds and has received much interest recently. The review is devoted to the asymmetric addition reactions of non-carbon nucleophiles to imines. The present review is divided into five main sections: reactions with N-nucleophiles; reactions with P-nucleophiles; reactions with O-nucleophiles; reactions with S-nucleophiles; reactions with Se-nucleophiles. It has been seen that chiral catalysts such as quinines, BINOLs, chiral phosphoric acids as well as various Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids are the source of asymmetry of the presented reactions of asymmetric addition of non-carbon nucleophiles to imines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
Substrate&#8208;induced synthesis of 6H&#8208;Chromeno[4,3&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;6&#8208;ones has been developed directly from anilines, 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins and DMSO under air without any catalysts and additives in one pot. This protocol highlights dual roles of 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins which were not only used as reactants but also activated DMSO to provide one&#8208;carbon unit in the desired products.

The front cover picture illustrates iodoarene as a precatalyst and dimethyl(fluoro)&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfane as a real oxidant derived from DMSO and F&#8208;TEDA&#8208;PF6, and the Japanese kanji stands for the initial letters of key elements, sulfur, iodine, and fluorine. A hypervalent iodine(III) catalyst, generated in&#8197;situ from these reagents, is effective on the dehydrogenative cycloisomerization/arylation reaction of N&#8208;propargyl carboxamides and arenes.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced [2+2+1] Dearomative Cascade Cyclization of Indole/Furan Alkynes to Synthesize Sulfonyl Polycycles</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced [2+2+1] dearomative cascade cyclization of indole/furan alkynes with NaHSO3, providing an array of diverse highly strained sulfonyl polycycles. Compared to our previous work, this method does not require the use of additional sacrificial oxidants and have wider reaction scope. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the indole moiety initiated the reaction, which proceeded via single&#8208;electron oxidation pathway. An alkenyl radical formed by intramolecular addition capture SO2, and the resulting specie is cyclized to furnish the final product. Also, DFT calculations disclosed that the groups on the indole ring or at the side chain probably affect the single electron distribution at the reaction site of IM&#8208;RC&#8208;I, and the distribution may be a decisive factor of spirocyclization.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam Coupling of NH&#8208;Diaryl Sulfondiimines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Sulfondiimines, which contain a tetrasubstituted sulfur centre bearing two nitrogens and two carbon substituents, are a class of underexplored scaffolds in organic chemistry. Fascinated by some unique yet intriguing properties, sulfondiimines appear as leads in discovery industry, but the lack of efficient synthetic approaches holds back their further uptake by medicinal chemistry. Herein, a general and practical copper&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam coupling of NH&#8208;diaryl sulfondiimines with arylboronic acids is presented. A simple copper catalyst efficiently facilitated the highly chemoselective construction of C&#8722;N bond, allowing the preparation of a variety of N&#8208;arylated diaryl sulfondiimines in good yields under mild and environmentally benign conditions. An array of protecting groups on imine moieties were well tolerated, offering diversified accesses to NH,NAr&#8208;diaryl sulfondiimines, a class of versatile building blocks. Moreover, an aza&#8208;analogue of an EphB4 inhibitor featuring a sulfondiimine&#8208;based pharmacophore was generated employing our Chan&#8208;Lam coupling as the key step.

Abstract
Arylation of tertiary aryl and alkyl phosphines bearing 2&#8208;cyanoethyl group with aryl(mesityl)iodonium triflates under blue light irradiation followed by retro&#8208;Michael reaction of the in&#8197;situ generated quaternary phosphonium salts initiated by DBU represent a novel efficient and general method for the preparation of distinctly substituted tertiary arylphosphines. An operationally simple, one&#8208;pot protocol features mild, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, high selectivity, broad functional group compatibility, as well as scalability and would be applied to substrates with different electronic and steric nature.

Abstract
A metal&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free strategy for the preparation of maleimide&#8208;fused carbazoles has been developed. This protocol started from 2&#8208;(indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)cyclohexanones and maleimides, providing various maleimide&#8208;fused carbazoles in 45&#8211;90% yields. The present approach was catalyzed by trimethylsulfoxonium iodide and involved a cascade of oxidation, [4+2] annulation, and dehydrogenative aromatization. Moreover, these maleimide&#8208;fused carbazole products could be further transformed into other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free photoinduced radical&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;oxy C&#8722;H cyclobutylation reaction of bicyclo[1.1.0]butane (BCB) compounds was described. In this protocol, &#945;&#8208;oxy C(sp3)&#8722;H motifs including ethers and alcohols were activated via photocatalytic conditions, releasing the ring strain of BCBs and generating 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutanes in 40&#8211;80% yields. Control experiments and Stern&#8208;Volmer quenching experiments indicated that the reaction proceeded through the generation of &#945;&#8208;oxy carbon&#8208;centered radical intermediates by photoinduced hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process.

         <title>Photogenerated Azido Radical Mediated Oxidation: Access to Carbonyl Functionality from Alcohols, Alkylarenes, and Olefins via Organophotoredox</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Azido radical mediated photocatalytic oxidation method for the selective oxidation of various well&#8208;known feedstocks, such as (hetero)aromatic or aliphatic alcohols, alkylarenes, and terminal alkenes, is successfully accomplished. Herein, the catalytic HAT and reversible addition/elimination strategies of azido radical have been explored to convert the commonly oxidizable functionalities into invaluable carbonyls or tertiary alcohols using an organic photocatalyst 4CzIPN with tetrabutyl ammonium azide (TBAN3) and air/O2 as an oxidant. Indeed, this mild, operationally simple, and productive method offers good to excellent product yields with a wide range of structurally diverse substrates, including pharmaceutical derivatives with good functional group tolerance. Several control experiments have been carried out to investigate the detailed reaction mechanism.

Abstract
The mechanochemical fluorination of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds has been achieved using N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide as both a precursor of the hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer reagent and a bench&#8208;stable fluorine source. The control experiments revealed that mechanical energy is essential for realizing this reaction.

Abstract
This review highlights the allylic C&#8722;H alkylation of alkenes (AAH) with nucleophiles under Pd0 or PdII catalysis and achiral or chiral conditions. The &#951;3&#8208;allylpalladium intermediates of these reactions are formed from the cleavage of an allylic hydrogen which becomes a leaving group, like the acetate moiety of allyl acetates during the classical Tsuji&#8208;Trost procedure. Most of these cross&#8208;dehydrogenative&#8208;couplings require quinones as key components; they may play the role of ligand, proton trap and oxidant. Efficient asymmetric allylic C&#8722;H alkylations (AAAH&#8217;s) have been performed. The diversity of the procedures, their limitation and application in synthesis are underlined as well as the proposed mechanisms with, in some cases, personal comments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review highlights the allylic C&#8722;H alkylation of alkenes (AA&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;) with nucleophiles under Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; or Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; catalysis and achiral or chiral conditions. The &#951;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-allylpalladium intermediates of these reactions are formed from the cleavage of an allylic hydrogen which becomes a leaving group, like the acetate moiety of allyl acetates during the classical Tsuji-Trost procedure. Most of these cross-dehydrogenative-couplings require quinones as key components; they may play the role of ligand, proton trap and oxidant. Efficient asymmetric allylic C&#8722;H alkylations (AAA&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&#8217;s) have been performed. The diversity of the procedures, their limitation and application in synthesis are underlined as well as the proposed mechanisms with, in some cases, personal comments. The data are grouped according to the reaction conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Defluorinative Alkylation of Trifluoromethyl Alkenes with Soft Carbon Nucleophiles Enabled by a Catalytic Amount of Base</title>

Abstract
Direct manipulation of readily accessible trifluoromethyl alkenes (TAs) represents an attractive approach to the preparation of diversified fluorine&#8208;containing compounds. In this study, defluorinative alkylation reactions of TAs with a broad array of soft carbon nucleophiles have been documented. Nucleophilic substitutions occur enabled by a catalytic amount of base, providing access to tertiary alkyl substituted gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrans. By extending the nucleophiles to silyl enol ethers, defluorination can be achieved in the absence of base to give gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. This process, which eliminates the requirement of organometallic reagents, transition metals, or strong bases for the C&#8722;F bond cleavage, is applicable to late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules.

         <title>Tartramide Ligands for Copper&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Arylation at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Readily accessible tartramide ligands have been demonstrated to promote copper&#8208;catalysed N&#8208;arylation under mild conditions. In addition, the coupling protocol employs cheap and readily available pre&#8208;catalyst, ligand, and base (NaOH), and overcomes many current limitations often associated with Ullmann coupling: it can be run with low catalyst loadings, does not require the use of excess amine, operates at room temperature, is fully homogeneous, and displays improved tolerance to air and moisture. Detailed kinetic studies using reaction progress kinetic analysis (RPKA) methods have provided insight into the factors influencing the reaction rate in terms of impact of ligand structure, reactant/catalyst dependence and catalyst (in)stability. These kinetic insights have been used in a quality&#8208;by&#8208;design approach for further optimization of the reaction protocol. The reaction scope was extended to 22 examples, showing broad applicability for a wide range of substituted aryl iodides with both primary and secondary amines.

         <title>N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidation of Aldehydes under Continuous Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The efficacy of synthetic methodologies is based not only on potent chemistries but also on processing strategies that amplify reaction performance and overall safety. The N&#8208;hydroxyphtalimide&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation of aldehydes is an environmentally reliable and inexpensive approach for the synthesis of valuable carboxylic acids. However, the reaction may lead to the accumulation of significant amounts of peracid in crude product mixtures thereby generating a considerable safety hazard. Also, in the case of deactivated substrates, long reaction times, high catalyst loading, and stoichiometric additives are required to promote oxidation. Therefore, we developed a flow chemistry&#8208;based process for N&#8208;hydroxyphtalimide&#8208;catalyzed aldehyde oxidations and exploited its benefits to minimize peracid buildup, thereby enhancing the process safety. By performing the aerobic oxidation of aldehydes under continuous flow conditions, chemically intensified and scalable carboxylic acid formation was obtained even in the reactions of deactivated substrates. Our findings are presented herein.

Abstract
A tertiary amino&#8208;thiourea catalyzed asymmetric aldol reaction between 2&#8208;isocyanatomalonate esters and isatins has been achieved. Optical active spirooxazolidinone oxindole derivatives could be obtained with excellent yields (80%&#8211;96%) and enantioselectivities (67%&#8211;99% ee) under mild conditions, providing an updated example to apply isatins as the electrophile in the asymmetric aldol reaction with 2&#8208;isocyanatomalonate esters.

         <title>Access to Nitrones from Amines via Electrocatalysis at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A self&#8208;enabled electrooxidative protocol for the synthesis of nitrones from bench stable amines has been developed under constant current electrolysis at room temperature, rendering metal and external oxidant&#8208;free protocol in an alkaline medium. The electrocatalysis steps of reported strategy involve anodic oxidation of benzyl amines followed by cathodic reduction of nitro&#8208;functional group in an undivided cell affording functional nitrones. The robustness of the electrocatalysis was reflected by tolerant substrate scope, oxidant&#8208;free conditions, and an operationally friendly procedure. Moreover, the cyclic voltammetry and control experiment studies also support the electrochemical process in alkaline medium.

Abstract
A method to synthesize benzofurylselenocyanates, benzothienylselenocyanates and indolylselenocyanates via electrophilic selenocyanogen cyclization was established. This sequential process was conducted under mild conditions in a short time. This protocol was successfully applied to late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules. Notablely, the selenocyanate can be converted into other valuable Se&#8208;containing compounds and showed antitumor activity to human hepatoma cells HepG2.

Notablely, the selenocyanate can be converted into other valuable Se-containing compounds and showed antitumor activity to human hepatoma cells HepG2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Here we present a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free radical cyclization of 2&#8208;arylbenzoimidazoles with unactivated alkanes. By using di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide (DTBP) to promote the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization, this approach enables assembly of various benzimidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolin&#8208;6(5H)&#8208;ones in aqueous media. This strategy can not only well tolerate a wide range of cyclic alkanes, straight&#8208;chain alkanes, toluene derivatives, as well as pharmaceutical molecule eudesmol, but also provides an approach for the functionalization of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in aqueous media under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free systems.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2] Cycloaddition of Hydroxy&#8208;Tethered Allylic Carbonates with Alkenes: Synthesis of Functionalized Tetrahydropyrans</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition of hydroxy&#8208;tethered allyl carbonates with five types of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes has been achieved, in which a type of new hydroxy&#8208;tethered allyl carbonates acted as valuable precursors for the formation of 1,4&#8208;C,O&#8208;dipole allylpalladium intermediates. The reaction proceeded efficiently under mild reaction conditions to provide the corresponding tetrahydropyran derivatives in moderate to high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities.

Abstract
The development of catalytic tools for the late&#8208;stage modification of amino acids within a peptide framework is a challenging task of capital importance. Herein, we report a Ru&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H hydroxylation of a collection of Tyr&#8208;containing di&#8208; and tripeptides featuring the use of a carbamate as a removable directing group and PhI(OCOCF3)2 (PIFA) as oxidant. This air&#8208;compatible tagging technique is reliable, scalable and provides access to L&#8208;DOPA (L&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine) peptidomimetics in a racemization&#8208;free fashion. Density Functional Theory calculations support a Ru(II)/Ru(IV) catalytic cycle.

         <title>Hypertransglycosylating Variants of the GH20 &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;Acetylhexosaminidase for the Synthesis of Chitooligomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Fungal &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylhexosaminidases of the CAZy family 20 of glycoside hydrolases are well&#8208;established tools for the enzymatic synthesis of a wide variety of natural and modified oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates. In order to increase their synthetic efficiency, the &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylhexosaminidase from Aspergillus oryzae (AoHex) was employed as a model enzyme for enzyme engineering aiming at shifting the reaction course from hydrolysis toward transglycosylation. Specifically, nine mutant variants of AoHex were designed by molecular modeling based on its crystal structure and molecular dynamics simulations. The selected mutation hotspots included the tyrosine residue at the active site, which stabilizes the transition state of the reaction, and two residues at the aglycone&#8208;binding site, which were replaced by tryptophan residues to increase the hydrophobicity of this subsite. Besides the individual mutants, combined double&#8208;mutant variants were also prepared and characterized. As a result, eight out of the studied new AoHex variants had transglycosidase activity, with V306W/Y445N AoHex being a superior transglycosidase with a transglycosylation&#8208;to&#8208;hydrolysis ratio greater than 110, which is entirely unique among the hypertransglycosylating glycosidase mutants including the GH20 &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylhexosaminidases.

         <title>Diarylprolinol with Trifluoromethyl Substituents and Diphenylprolinol&#8208;Derived Perfluoroalkanesulfonamide as Organocatalysts in the Cross&#8208;Aldol Reaction of Aldehydes</title>

         <dc:description>









Abstract
The asymmetric cross&#8208;aldol reaction of two different aldehydes is a synthetically relevant reaction. Diarylprolinol catalyst with trifluoromethyl substituents and sulfonamide catalyst derived from diphenylprolinol are organocatalysts for the cross&#8208;aldol reaction. The reactivity and stereoselectivity of these two catalysts were compared in the asymmetric cross&#8208;aldol reactions of propanal and acetaldehyde as nucleophilic aldehydes and several electrophilic aldehydes. Depending on the electrophilic aldehydes, the preferable catalyst differs. By the proper selection of these two catalysts, potentially synthetically useful chiral building blocks can be synthesized with diastereoselectivities of anti:syn=2.6:1&#8764;&gt;20:1 and enantioselectivities of 60&#8764;&gt;98% ee.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Oxidation of Diazenyl&#8208;Protected Tetrahydroisoquinolines and Isoindolines for the Synthesis of Functionalized Lactams</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced oxidation of diazenyl&#8208;protected tetrahydroisoquinolines and isoindolines for the synthesis of structurally diverse lactams is developed. The reaction was carried out with Eosin Y&#8208;Na2 as an organic photocatalyst and molecular oxygen as an oxidant, and the desired functionalized N&#8208;aryldiazenyl&#8208;lactams were obtained under mild and transition metal&#8208;free conditions. The utility of this method is showcased by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and deprotection of the N&#8208;aryldiazenyl&#8208;lactam product.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Reaction of (&#946;&#8208;Amino&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroethyl)phosphonates with Trifluoromethylated Ketones via Aza&#8208;Wittig Reagents</title>

Abstract
We report a one&#8208;pot reaction of (&#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroethyl)phosphonates involving aza&#8208;Wittig reagents, in which, difluoromethylphosphonate&#8208;containing diazo and trifluoromethylated ketones assemble to furnish azo&#8208;containing &#945;&#8208;fluorovinylphosphonates. Mechanism studies disclose a pathway, which contains an aza&#8208;Wittig reaction, water addition to hydrazone, and C&#8722;F bond cleavage with an aza&#8208;Wittig reagent as a key intermediate. This reaction is conducted at 60&#8201;&#176;C affording a series of &#945;&#8208;fluorovinylphosphonate compounds in 42&#8211;94% yields and Z&#8208;stereoselectivity. This work opens a vision for the difluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted diazos, and provides a strategy for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;fluorovinylphosphonate derivatives.

         <title>Asymmetric Organocatalyzed Friedel&#8211;Crafts Reaction of Trihalogenacetaldehydes and Phenols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the asymmetric organocatalyzed method for the Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction between activated phenols and trihaloacetaldehydes. An extensive three&#8208;phase screening including 41 compounds was employed to identify a catalyst structure based on 3,5&#8208;dinitrobenzamide of 9&#8208;amino&#8208;epi&#8208;cinchonidine as the lead catalytic molecule. Under the thoroughly optimized reaction conditions, the above catalyst conveniently offered trihalohydroxyalkylated adducts in yields ranging from 26 to 92% and enantiomeric ratios within 69:31&#8211;99:1. The reaction scope determined on 29 entries suggests a reasonable generality of the developed process. Moreover, several follow&#8208;up transformations of the enantioenriched products were accomplished.</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydrogenative Cycloisomerization/Arylation Sequence of N&#8208;Propargyl Carboxamides with Arenes by Iodine(III)&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Dehydrogenative cycloisomerization/arylation sequence of heteroatom nucleophile&#8208;tethered unactivated alkynes provides a facile and powerful approach to C&#8722;C bond formation between the generated heterocycles and unfunctionalized arenes. Here, we describe a hypervalent iodine(III)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of oxazoles concomitant with the introduction of aryl groups into side chain from N&#8208;propargyl carboxamides and arenes, representing first C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bond formation by the catalytic dehydrogenative cycloisomerization/arylation reaction in exo&#8208;dig modes.

         <title>Diastereospecific Enantiodivergent Allylation of Pyrazolones as an Entry to &#946;&#8208;Aminoamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A diastereospecific enantiodivergent allylation of pyrazolones is reported which is catalyzed by a planar chiral pentaphenylferrocene based palladacycle. With the same catalyst batch both product enantiomers were selectively available. The method is applicable to structurally diverse substrates and gave products with enantiomeric excesses between 85 and 94%. In addition, we could show that pyrazolones are transformable into &#946;&#8208;aminoamides.
