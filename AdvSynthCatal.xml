         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Ring&#8208;Opening Reactions of 2H&#8208;Indazoles with Alcohols to Obtain Ortho&#8208;alkoxycarbonylated Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy for synthesis of azo&#8208;derived compounds by electrochemical oxidative ring&#8208;opening reactions of 2H&#8208;indazoles with alcohols is reported. The reactions are carried out under galvanostatic electrolysis conditions in an undivided cell without the use of transition metal catalysts. On the basis of cyclic voltam&#172;metry and control experiments, a plausible mechanism for this ring&#8208;opening reaction involving the radical pathway is proposed. Furthermore, various 2H&#8208;indazoles and alcohols are suitable in this system, giving the desired ortho&#8208;alkoxycarbonylated azobenzenes in 9&#8208;84% yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Functionally Rich Spirooctahydroquinoline Oxindoles via Enynamide Cycloisomerisation/[4+2]&#8208;Addition Sequence</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Creating an expedient method for synthesizing biologically significant functionally rich octahydroquinoline is a highly sought&#8208;after yet challenging endeavour. In this report, we document an unprecedented approach to the construction of novel spirooctahydroquinoline oxindole architectures. The reaction proceeds through Pd (II) catalyzed cycloisomerisation and quinine catalyzed [4+2]&#8208;addition sequence to afford the desired adduct in moderate to excellent yield (up to 91%) in a single diastereomer with three contiguous stereocenters including one spirocenter. An overwhelming number of libraries were generated (35 examples) reflecting the synthetic versatility and functional groups/substituents tolerance. Further, the adduct is transformed into medicinally important fluoro&#8208;decahydroepoxyethanoquinoline spirooxindole scaffold with five contiguous stereocenters in excellent yield and selectivity (95% yield and &gt;99:1 dr) through a three steps sequence which signifies the synthetic utility of the developed methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;arylindoles and their fused analogues via intramolecular C&#8208;arylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;Aminobenzyl cyanide was reacted with nitrobenzenesulfonyl chlorides and alkylated under Mitsunobu or Fukuyama conditions. The resulting intermediates were exposed to basic conditions, which triggered a Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement, leading to intramolecular C&#8208;arylation. This reaction was followed by spontaneous cycloaddition, which yielded 2&#8208;aminoindole derivatives. The developed synthetic route represents a simple and metal&#8208;free approach for accessing 1&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;arylindoles. Furthermore, pyrimido[1,2&#8208;a]indoles and dihydrobenzo[6,7][1,3]diazepino[4,5&#8208;b]indoles were synthesized through the use of functionalized alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver&#8208;catalyzed Cascade Bis&#8208;heteroannulation Reaction of Enynones and o&#8208;Hydroxyphenyl Enaminones: Access to Highly Functionalized 3&#8208;Furylmethyl Chromones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general and efficient synthetic protocol was developed to synthesize highly functionalized 3&#8208;furylmethyl chromones from enynones and o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl enaminones via silver&#8208;catalyzed cascade bis&#8208;heteroannulation reaction. This strategy features broad substrate scope broad and good functional group tolerance. Furthermore, the 3&#8208;furylmethyl chromone skeleton shows the potential synthetic application value through further gram&#8208;scale synthesis and derivatization.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrohalogenation of alkynes is one of the fundamental reactions in organic chemistry, as described in textbooks that begins from old time as Reppe&#8217;s chemistry. This method, which directly affords haloalkenes in a single step, is attractive from both industrial and academic viewpoints. Despite the long history of this reaction, novel efficient catalysts and regioselective and/or stereoselective controlled reactions are still a challenging topic. This review addresses the recent (past decade) advances in this field of organic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Arylations of Ketimines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arylation of ketimines is the most straightforward strategy for the construction of chiral &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines, important structural motifs in natural products and biologically active compounds. This comprehensive review highlights the achievements in the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed and organocatalyzed asymmetric arylations of ketimines from the seminal report on catalytic asymmetric arylation of ketimines in 2010 till November 2023. The review is divided into three chapters: (1) Arylation of diaryl ketimines, (2) Arylation of aryl&#8208;alkyl and aryl&#8208;acyl ketimines, and (3) Arylation of acyl&#8208;alkyl and dialkyl ketimines. Each chapter is further divided into transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reactions (grouped by individual metals) and organocatalyzed reactions. Covered literature includes emphasis on the advantages of the reported methodology, its scope and limitations, and the description of the transition state (where applicable).</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Hydroxylation of &#945;&#8208;Bromoacetophenones: Access to &#945;&#8208;Hydroxyacetophenones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a new method has been developed for the synthesis of various &#945;&#8208;hydroxyacetophenones via an electro&#8208;oxidation process. It involves electrocatalytic hydroxylation via debromination of C(sp3)&#8208;Br bond. Here, simultaneous breaking of carbon&#8208;bromine (C&#8208;Br) bond and formation of a new carbon&#8208;oxygen (C&#8208;O) bond has been achieved through electrolysis of H2O using binary mixture of water and DMSO. The protocol features easy performance, oxidant and base&#8208;free mild conditions and short reaction time.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvated Electrons: Dynamic Reductant in Visible Light Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Open shell species are alluring significant attention owing to their unique physiochemical properties in redox chemistry for activating remarkably stable bonds. Solvated electrons are one of them that have been extensively investigated due to their high reduction potential (Ered = &#8208;2.9 V vs SHE in CH3CN), diverse substrate activation, and promising applications. If the activating species have a larger redox potential with a longer lifetime, then the broader range of substrates will be activated. Hence, the solvated electron qualifies as a super&#8208;reductant with these qualities. However, due to safety issues, generating solvated electrons by dissolving alkali metals in an ammoniated solvent limits its use towards complicated organic transformations. Instead photochemically generated solvated electron overcome this limitation and is identified as a user&#8208;friendly, sustainable, and much safer alternative approach for producing solvated electrons. In this minireview, we have comprehensively highlighted the recent key methods to generate the solvated electron photochemically, characterization techniques, and its application in organic transformations with selected examples. The minireview provides new opportunities for chemists to understand the conceptual, physical, and mechanistic chemistry principle of this super reductant for exploiting a new photochemical route for the transformations that are difficult to achieve by other means.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling C7 Methylation and Arylation of the Indolyl Core via P(III)&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Peripheral editing of complex molecules via C&#8722;H functionalization removes the pervasive retrosynthetic bias toward pre&#8208;functionalization and taps into the innate, often subtle, stereoelectronic differences between C&#8722;H linkages. Using this approach, bioactive molecules and residues can be modified without being beholden to lengthy sequences, thus allowing biochemical hypotheses to be interrogated on accelerated timelines. Herein, the C&#8722;H functionalization paradigm is leveraged to tackle C7&#8197;C&#8722;H functionalization of the biologically important tryptophan core. The devised process, which was expanded to indolyl (and related) systems, utilizes an N&#8208;bound unsymmetrical &#8220;designer&#8221; phosphine to direct C&#8722;H functionalization to the desired position while maintaining operational ease of directing group installation/removal. Quantum mechanically calculated steric properties and activation free energies suggest that this phosphine is hindered enough for favoring C&#8722;H functionalization over deactivation pathways but is still easily cleaved by nucleophiles. In addition, the process enables the direct C&#8722;H methylation, cyclopropanation, and arylation of tryptophan to yield unnatural amino acid (UAA) building blocks. As a testament to the versatility of this method, a solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS)&#8208;ready phosphinated tryptophan was incorporated into a pentapeptide and the C&#8722;H functionalization/dephosphination sequence was executed with ease. The utility of &#8220;on&#8208;peptide&#8221; editing was exhibited through the late&#8208;stage functionalization of several pentapeptides with a diverse set of C7 substituents on&#8208; and off&#8208;resin.

         <title>Application of Bertagnini's Salts in a Mechanochemical Approach Toward Aza&#8208;Heterocycles and Reductive Aminations via Imine Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Our research has demonstrated that mechanochemical activation is more effective with solid reagents. We have showcased the practicality of Bertagnini's salts, also called aldehyde&#8208;bisulfite adducts, which are crystalline, simplifying preparation and storage. These salts are stable substitutes for liquid aldehydes and ketones that have been employed in reductive amination, synthesizing aza&#8208;heterocycles and hydrazones within mechanochemistry. The technique&#8216;s effectiveness broadens the substrate scopes, simplifies purification, reduces reaction times, and yields the desired products ranging from 38&#8211;91%. Additionally, the thermal stability of the bisulfite adducts has been confirmed through TGA (Thermogravimetric analysis) analysis.

Abstract
Enantioselective access to polycyclic tetrahydroxanthone compounds was achieved through an organocatalyzed cascade reaction of alkene&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;diketones and alkenyloxindoles, using quinine&#8208;derived squaramide as an efficient catalyst. It afforded a variety of optically active spirooxindole&#8208;based tetrahydroxanthones with 18&#8211;94% yields, &gt;19:1 dr, and 86&#8211;99% ee.

Abstract
We report a strategy for stereoselective O&#8208;aryl&#8208;glycoside synthesis by copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of a variety of anomeric sugars and (hetero)aromatic iodides. Stereocontrol of the &#945;/&#946; selectivity can be successfully realized by slight structural modifications of the oxalic diamide ligands. Mechanistic studies indicated a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) reaction mechanism controlled by the ligand structures. This reaction could be performed on gram scale, and has also been applied to the synthesis of some natural products.

Abstract
We report an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution protocol for the one&#8208;pot asymmetric synthesis of substituted purine derivatives. The controllable N&#8208;9/N&#8208;7 substitution, which posed formidable challenges in organic synthesis, could be accomplished by choosing different types of enzymes as catalysts. This method was proved scalable and was used to prepare a series of prodrugs of medicinally active acids. In addition, the recyclability test of the biocatalysts indicated the potential of this strategy for applications in the pharmaceutical industry.

Abstract
Lewis base dependent (3+3) and (4+2) annulations of &#946;&#8242;&#8208;acetoxy allenoates with N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines offer m&#8208;teraryl and fused dihydropyridines with varying substituents depending on the tertiary amine as well as subtle changes in the reaction conditions. The triazabicyclodecene (TBD)&#8208;catalyzed (3+3) annulation involves 1,2&#8208;elimination followed by 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization as key steps in delivering fused 1,4&#8208;hydropyridines. The same reactants under DMAP catalysis offer m&#8208;teraryl via Mannich coupling, rather than 1,2&#8208;elimination followed by C&#8722;N bond cleavage/aromatization. Key intermediates have been identified by HRMS studies.

         <title>Regioselective Reductive Elimination from Bismuth(V) Compounds for Aryl Transfer to Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 366, Issue 5, Page 1128-1136, March 8, 2024. </description>

Abstract
We demonstrate that regioselective aryl transfer to the nucleophile occurs rapidly under mild conditions via reductive elimination and show that regioselectivity is primarily governed by steric factors imparted by ortho substituents on the recipient ring. Computational modeling and x&#8208;ray crystallography confirm that the recipient aryl ring is positioned in the equatorial coordination site and oriented orthogonally to the axial X&#8722;Bi&#8722;Ph bond (X=nucleophile) in a trigonal bipyramidal structure. The orientation of the ortho&#8208;substituted aryl ring allows the appropriate orbital to overlap between its ipso carbon and nucleophile, which enhances the rate of aryl transfer to the nucleophile and dictates the regioselective reductive elimination from Bi(V) compounds. This level of stereoelectronic control results in significantly enhanced reaction rate and selectivity and creates an opportunity to rationally design ligand systems for selective aryl transfer reactions.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted cascade difluoromethylation/cyclization reaction to access various difluoromethylated pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indolediones was developed using difluoromethyltriphenylphosphonium bromide salt as the difluoromethylating reagent. A possible radical mechanism has been investigated and proven as a	single electron transfer (SET) procedure.

Abstract
An asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of 2&#8208;oxazolones in the presence of a chiral diamine ruthenium catalyst with potassium formate as a hydrogen source and potassium carbonate as an additive in 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol is described. A series of chiral 2&#8208;oxazolidinones were obtained with 29%&#8211;95% yields and 86%&#8211;&gt;99% ee's. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale synthesis of chiral 2&#8208;oxazolidinone and its downstream derivatizations demonstrate the practicality of this method.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of 2-oxazolones in the presence of a chiral diamine ruthenium catalyst with potassium formate as a hydrogen source and potassium carbonate as an additive in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol is described. A series of chiral 2-oxazolidinones were obtained with 29%&#8211;95% yields and 86%&#8211;&amp;gt;99% ee's. Furthermore, gram-scale synthesis of chiral 2-oxazolidinone and its downstream derivatizations demonstrate the practicality of this method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
We report here a practical protocol for the asymmetric synthesis of amino acids (AAs) with a CF3&#8208;containing 3,2&#8217;&#8208;pyrrolidinyl spirooxindole skeleton with three defined carbon stereocenters via a sequential Michael/Mannich [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction. The coupling of a robust and stereochemically stable chiral dehydroalanine Ni(II) complex with various N&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethylisatin ketimines in the presence of triethylamine afforded a library of single diastereomeric complexes with a 3,2&#8217;&#8208;pyrrolidinyl spirooxindole moiety in 36&#8211;71% yields. In particular, the change of base to LiOH allowed to obtain predominantly the Michael addition product in 76% yield. Finally, the decomposition of the obtained Ni(II) complexes with 3&#8197;N HCl provided the target complex AA with a 3,2&#8217;&#8208;pyrrolidinyl spirooxindole core and (2S,4R)&#8208;2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;5,5,5&#8208;trifluoropentanoic acid &#8211; an (S)&#8208;norvaline derivative, together with easy recovery of the chiral auxiliary ligand for the synthesis of the starting dehydroalanine complex.

Abstract
This research presents a method for the oxidative selenylation and thiolylation of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman adducts through constant&#8208;current electrolysis in an undivided cell at room temperature. The reaction enables direct production of trisubstituted (Z)&#8208;allyl aryl selenides and sulfides with yields of 27&#8211;98%. A wide variety of different functionalities are well tolerated under these reaction conditions. This strategy could be carried out on gram scale and several synthetic transformations were accomplished for the construction of other allyl selenide derivatives. Control experiments and mechanistic studies indicate a radical or an ionic addition pathway for this electrochemical transformation.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced selenocyclization of ortho&#8208;vinylanilides to 4H&#8208;3,1&#8208;benzoxazines has been developed under controlled O2 atmosphere. The low O2 content in reaction medium promotes the aerobic selenol oxidation to diselenides for the full use of 2&#8197;equiv. selenyl radicals in a redox&#8208;neutral way, avoiding the aerobic oxidation of ortho&#8208;vinylanilides under higher O2 content. The developed visible light&#8208;induced selenocyclization of ortho&#8208;vinylanilides utilizes only visible light with low O2 content, eliminating the use of exogenous photocatalyst and chemical oxidant.

Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed heterocyclization/carbonylation/arylation cascade reaction between &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated N&#8722;Ts hydrazones and commercially available arylboronic acids as coupling partners is described, producing 2&#8208;pyrazoline&#8208;ketone derivatives in 11&#8211;78% yield. A detailed statistical analysis of reactivity patterns of boronic acids provided key information about the limitations of the method, highlighting the challenges of degradation pathways. Our methodology offers a tool for synthesizing diverse 2&#8208;pyrazoline&#8208;ketone derivatives, expanding the toolbox of accessible N&#8722;N&#8208;heterocycles.

Abstract
Chemobiocatalysis has recently emerged as a promising tool in organic synthesis; nonetheless, chemobiocatalytic transformations remain challenging due to the incompatibility between the two types of catalysts. Many enzymes, especially aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs), are readily inactivated under the chemocatalytic conditions. Herein, we present a robust NADP+&#8208;dependent p&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaHBDH) for integrated chemocatalysis and enzyme catalysis. Apart from good activities toward a number of aromatic aldehydes, PaHBDH showed excellent thermal and storage stability in the absence of any stabilizer, but was also highly tolerant toward various organic solvents. The usefulness of PaHBDH in integrated catalysis was demonstrated by the synthesis of a group of aromatic carboxylic acids in good yields by combining with photo&#8208;/electrochemical NADP+ regeneration. The photoenzymatic approach was further extended by integrating with a chemo(bio)catalytic cascade in one pot to allow for the conversion of furfural into value&#8208;added C4 chemicals. The finding of this work may expand the synthetic toolbox for integrated catalysis.

Abstract
An N&#8208;allylation of monosubstituted acyl hydrazines with allylic alcohols has been developed by using B(C6F5)3 catalysis. This protocol allows for convenient access to various synthetically useful N&#8208;allylated hydrazine products in 48&#8211;96% yields with broad substrate scope and wide functional group compatibility. The operationally simple reaction proceeds without calling for stringent removal of air and moisture, and can be readily scaled up to gram scale. Preliminary mechanistic studies support the generation of an allylic carbon cation that is involved in the catalytic cycle, and the reaction proceeds via the in&#8197;situ formation of diallyl ethers as intermediates.

Abstract
In this study, a synthetic method to access benzo[4,5]imidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines is developed by the reaction of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromoaryl)benzimidazoles with 1,3&#8208;diketones under basic conditions. A reaction pathway involving the initial formation of a C&#8722;C coupled intermediate by nucleophilic aromatic substitution and subsequent deacylative cyclocondensation is proposed for this process.

Abstract
Flavonoids and cannabinoids comprise two large families of natural products that contain a chromane moiety in their structure. Their therapeutic potential has been extensively investigated as potential treatments to several diseases, ranging from cancer to infectious and neurodegenerative diseases. Despite their relative structural simplicity, in recent years creative synthetic methodologies were designed to overcome limitations from the previous synthetic strategies applied to these compounds. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of all the enantioselective organocatalytic strategies that have been applied to the synthesis of flavonoids and cannabinoids to date.

Abstract
This review centers on the synthetic strategies employed with indolyl&#8208;ynones. Indolyl&#8208;ynone, owing to its highly reactive ynone moiety, frequently partakes in dearomatizing spirocyclization reactions and subsequent rearrangement reactions when subjected to various reaction conditions. Hence, various heterocycles such as densely functionalized spiroindolenines, carbazoles, quinolines and carbo&#8208;and hetero&#8208;cycle substituted indoles are synthesized from indolyl&#8208;ynones. In addition to this, the versatile spirocyclic indole scaffold exhibits the capability to produce tetracyclic and polyclic structures through intricate skeletal rearrangement processes. Moreover, the total synthesis of natural products using the indolyl&#8208;ynone moiety was also compiled in this review.

Abstract
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed vinylation reactions of aryl iodides using 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane is developed for the synthesis of styrenes and stilbenes. In these reactions, vinyl bromide is generated from 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane and then undergoes reductive cross&#8208;coupling with aryl iodides, affording styrene products. Under slightly modified reaction conditions, styrenes can continue reacting with vinyl bromide to form E&#8208;stilbenes, which provides a one&#8208;pot synthetic method for stilbenes. Alcohols, including iso&#8208;propanol and methanol, are employed as the reductant in these reductive cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

Abstract
Here, we report the organocatalytic enantioselective synthesis of dihydrothiopyran derivatives from trans racemic donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropane carbaldehydes (DACCs) and 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;arylethanone via formal thio (4+2) cycloaddition involving thia&#8208;Michael aldol condensation and annulation. Mechanistic studies indicate a typical kinetic resolution (KR) is involved in this transformation, which results in moderate yields and enantiomeric ratios. Remarkably, this method is characterized by its one&#8208;pot simplicity, mild reaction conditions, and resilience towards air and moisture interference.

Abstract
This study presents a protocol for the direct site&#8208;selective difunctionalization of pyrazoles under mild reaction conditions. This protocol showcase a notable site&#8208;selectivity and encompasses a wide substrate scope. Detailed mechanistic investigations elucidate the dual role of the sulfonium salt acting both as the reaction substrate and acid donor, thereby effectively catalyzing the reaction. The demonstrated one&#8208;pot synthesis, scale&#8208;up reaction and subsequent product modifications can assist in advancing the potential application of this protocol in organic synthesis and its associated domains.

Abstract
An organocatalytic remote stereocontrolled 1,8&#8208;conjugated addition of in&#8197;situ formed propargylic aza&#8208;p&#8208;QMs from &#945;&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl) propargylic alcohols and indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates was developed, affording axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes in 62&#8211;99% yield with 52&#8211;99% ee. The synthetic strategy not only enriches the chemistry of aza&#8208;p&#8208;quinone methides, but also provides an alternative tool for the preparation of axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes.

Abstract
We report herein a chiral CpXRh(III)&#8208;catalyzed domino cyclization/C3&#8208;arylation process using 2&#8208;alkynylanilines and 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones as viable substrates, delivering indole&#8208;based derivatives endowed with axial chirality. The method features high enantioselectivity, broad substrate scope, and robust functional group tolerance. Subsequent functionalization of the synthesized scaffolds underlines the practicality of this approach in the design of indole&#8208;derivated axially chiral frameworks, demonstrating its substantial promise in synthetic and medicinal chemistry applications.

Abstract
The synthesis of pyrimidine&#8208;spirofused indolines from 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes with 2&#8208;sulfonyliminoindolines has been achieved under catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions, in which five atoms of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes were introduced to the spiro&#8208;annulation products via a (5+1) pathway. Subsequently, this strategy was extended to 3&#8208;aminoindoles and 3&#8208;aminobenzothiophenes, but a different reaction pathway (3+3) was observed. In these cases, three&#8208;atoms of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes were incorporated into pyrimidine&#8208;fused indoles/benzothiophenes. These two transformations demonstrate the potential and versatility of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes to construct nitrogen&#8208;heterocycles.

Abstract
A designed chiral thiourea&#8208;iminophosphorane catalyst was developed to afford &#945;&#8208;acyloxythioesters through enantioselective acyl&#8208;transfer/protonation of &#945;&#8208;acyloxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketosulfides. The desired reaction proceeded in good yields with high enantioselectivities using a chiral thiourea&#8208;iminophosphorane bearing a pyrrolidine scaffold.

Abstract
Thanks to an unprecedented gem&#8208;dialkyl substituent effect, an efficient synthesis of tetrahydro oxepine derivatives is achieved by ring expansion of vinyl oxetanes using acceptor(&#8722;acceptor) diazo reagents under Cu(II)&#8208;catalysis. A large scope of 2&#8208;vinyl oxetanes and either diazo mono or diester reagents give access to a series of functionalized oxepines.

Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative annulation of 2&#8208;alkenylanilines with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl diazoester or diazoketones is described. The reaction has broad substrate scope, affording a range of gem&#8208;difluorocyclobutane&#8208;fused indolines in moderate to good yields with cis&#8208;configuration. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the reaction proceeds through a sequential N&#8722;H insertion/C&#8722;F bond cleavage/[2+2] cycloadditon process. &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazo reagents serve as gem&#8208;difluorinated C2 subunits by cleaving one C&#8722;F bond.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed &#947;&#8208;Arylation of Acylketene Synthons with Aryl Chlorides Enabled by Ylide&#8208;Functionalized Phosphines (YPhos)</title>

Abstract
A catalyst system based on palladium 2&#8208;methylnaphthyl complexes bearing ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines (YPhos) was found to enable the selective &#947;&#8208;arylation of 1,3&#8208;dioxinone derivatives with diversely functionalized aryl, heteroaryl, and vinyl chlorides. The products were further converted into 1,3&#8208;diketones and heterocycles, highlighting their function as synthetic hubs. Experimental and computational studies revealed that bulky, electron&#8208;rich YPhos ligands are uniquely effective because they enable the oxidative addition of aryl chlorides at room temperature while at the same time efficiently promoting the rate&#8208;limiting reductive elimination step of the thermally sensitive enolates.

These reactions afford chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted succinimides having all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters with 40%&#8722;99% ee.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An array of cyanopyridazine derivatives have been developed through a sequence of (3+3) cycloaddition/oxidative aromatization/derivatization steps. Investigation of the physicochemical properties of these compounds shows that four have interesting fluorescence properties and have the potential to be developed into bimodal photoredox catalysts. One has been confirmed to be an photoredox catalyst in the reactions of N&#8208;aryl&#8208; tetrahydroisoquinolines with phosphite, nitromethane, malonitrile and sodium thiocyanate, led to 22%&#8211;95% yields. The catalyst capabilities remain with recyclable using under the reaction conditions.

Abstract
In this work, we reported a method for construction of difluorocyclopropanes through visible light&#8208;promoted [1+2] cycloaddition reaction of aryl diazo esters with gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, encompasses a wide range of substrates (36 examples), exhibits good tolerance to various substituents, and demonstrates a diastereoselectivity of &gt;20:1. Additionally, antifungal activity evaluation revealed that these derivatives exhibited certain activity, the EC50 values for the products towards Botrytis cinerea and Rhizoctonia solani were measured to be 1.51 and 1.36&#8197;&#956;M, respectively, which are significantly lower than those of commercial fungicides Hymexazol and Azoxystrobin. This work not only provides an efficient method for the synthesis of difluorocyclopropanyl derivatives, but reveals their potential applications in fungicide creation.

This work not only provides an efficient method for the synthesis of difluorocyclopropanyl derivatives, but reveals their potential applications in fungicide creation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
The transmetalation triggered rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation and tandem annulation of 2&#8208;biphenylboronic acids with sulfoxonium ylides or iodonium ylides has been developed. Various products of phenanthrenes were constructed under redox&#8208;neutral conditions in 34&#8211;86% yields. Several mechanism exploration experiments and derivatization reactions were conducted in sequence to gain a deeper understanding of the process and the potential of this transformation. It offers an alternative approach for the synthesis of phenanthrene derivatives.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Production of Vanillin from Capsaicinoids through a Retrosynthetic Enzyme Cascade</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Vanillin is a key organoleptic component in vanilla, one of the most important natural flavors in the industry. The limited supply of natural vanilla, extracted from cured vanilla beans, elevates the commercial value of &#8216;natural&#8217;&#8208;labeled vanillin, producible by microbial conversion of natural precursors such as ferulic acid, eugenol, isoeugenol, lignin, and glucose. However, cellular toxicity and undesirable overoxidation of vanillin remain challenges to the microbial methods. Here, we developed a one&#8208;pot enzymatic conversion of capsaicinoids to vanillin by retracing the biosynthetic pathway found in Capsicum plants. The enzyme cascade consists of the hydrolysis of capsaicinoids by immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB) and the oxidative deamination of the resulting vanillylamine by &#969;&#8208;transaminase from Paracoccus denitrificans (PDTA). Process optimization of individual enzyme reactions was conducted on an analytical scale, enabling&gt;95% reaction yield of vanillin from capsaicinoids in the one&#8208;pot cascade reaction without undesirable accumulation of the oxidation byproduct and the inhibitory reaction intermediate, i.&#8201;e., vanillic acid and vanillylamine, respectively. To verify practical applicability, we performed a preparative&#8208;scale reaction starting with 1.75&#8197;g capsaicinoids and 2.75&#8197;g sodium pyruvate at 10&#8197;mg/mL CALB and 3&#8197;&#956;M PDTA, leading to an 81% reaction yield and a 57% isolation yield. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of one&#8208;pot production of vanillin from capsaicinoids, which might pave the way for cost&#8208;effective and sustainable access to natural&#8208;labeled vanillin from a renewable feedstock readily available from Capsicum fruits.

Abstract
Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed and solvent&#8208;switched [3+2]&#8208;spiroannulation and [4+n] (n=1, 2, 3) annulations of 2&#8208;aryl quinazolinone or 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophthalazine&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones with ynones or alkynyl alcohol or 1,3&#8208;diynes under mild reaction conditions have been analyzed. These reactions take place in the presence of the appropriate solvent and features a redox&#8208;neutral pathway. Ynone serves as an &#8216;atypical one&#8208;carbon unit&#8217; in [4+1] annulation and generates a tetrasubstituted carbon center bearing diverse heterocycles through [3+2] and [4+1] annulation strategies. Post transformations of the synthesized spiro&#8208;products augments the potential of the developed methodology.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a formal insertion of a metal carbene complex in a single carbon&#8208;carbon bond. This behavior occurs with the participation of an alpha&#8208;imino gold carbene complex, generated from benzofused triazapentalenes or, in a one&#8208;pot procedure, from their 1&#8208;propargyl&#8208;1H&#8208;bentrotriazole precursors, and gold&#8208;catalytically activated ynamides. As the result, 3H&#8208;indole derivatives were obtained, with formation of a quaternary center. A computational analysis carried out on the reaction mechanism indicates that the bulkiness of the gold ligand plays a key role forcing a conformation, which includes aromatic interactions, that favors the approximation of the carbenic carbon to the reactive site. In addition, a negative crossover experiment rules out a cationic arene migration pathway.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Alfa&#8208;aminonitriles are versatile and valuable intermediates in pharmaceutical chemistry. Until now, the Strecker reaction has remained the most efficient tool for synthesizing these compounds. Nevertheless, it is only applicable to aldehyde/imine systems and generally needs metal catalysts and external additives. Herein, an electrochemically driven oxidative Strecker reaction strategy was designed and accomplished for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles with alcohol as the alkylation reagent. The strategy is environmentally friendly, scalable, and compatible with a wide range of functional groups, encompassing aromatic primary amines, secondary amines, and even alkylamine. Utilizing the merits of electro&#8208;organic synthesis, it can be readily magnified from milligram to gram scale by simply adjusting the electrochemical parameters. Emphasized, it testified that a unique intermediate CH2*OH well&#8208;established in fuel cells was involved in the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Arylazoindoles through Iron(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Azolation of Indoles and Arylhydrazines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A variety of functionalized 3&#8208;arylazoindoles were prepared in good to excellent yields through an iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H azolation of 2&#8208;substituted indoles with arylhydrazines under mild reaction conditions. The reaction underwent an initial TBN&#8208;mediated nitrosation, 1,5&#8208;hydrogen migration, intramolecular condensation, and 1,5&#8208;hydrogen migration over four steps in one pot. A paracyclophane&#8208;derived 3&#8208;phenylazoindole could be prepared in 25% yield over three steps and some prepared 3&#8208;arylazoindoles showed a different fluorescence emission wavelength and existed obvious pH conditions response. The present method highlights broad substrate scope of easily available starting materials, wide range of functional group compatibility, gram scalable preparations, high atom economy, avoidance of unstable and explosive azolation reagents, and simple purification operations by extraction, washing, and recrystallization without flash column chromatography.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new Cp*Ir&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H arylation of 1&#8208;isoquinolinone and 2 pyridones to afford 6&#8208;phenylpyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and 3&#8208;phenylisoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones by using arylsilanes is described in this paper.

         <title>Catalytic Orthogonal Glycosylation Enabled by Enynal&#8208;Derived Copper Carbenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we present an approach for catalytic orthogonal glycosylation utilizing earth&#8208;abundant copper carbenes. This method operates under mild conditions and employs readily accessible starting materials, including benchtop stable enynal&#8208;derived glycosyl donors, synthesized at the gram scale. The reaction accommodates a variety of glycosyl acceptors, including primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols. The enynal&#8208;derived copper carbenes exhibit remarkable reactivity and selectivity, allowing for the formation of glycosidic linkages with different protecting groups and stereochemical patterns. This approach provides access to both 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208; and &#8208;trans&#8208;glycosidic linkages. The product stereoselectivity is independent of the anomeric configuration of the glycosyl donor, which also has orthogonal reactivity to widely used alkynes and thioglycoside donors. An iterative synthesis of a trisaccharide further demonstrates the application of this orthogonal reactivity.

Abstract
An intermolecular addition reaction involving an unconventional combination of a diarylmethyl anion and an electrophile, which is mediated by the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis, was developed. Diarylmethyl anions having a benzofuran moiety were generated through the rearrangement with the aid of a catalytic amount of phosphazene base P2&#8208;tBu. The resulting carbanion intermediates were trapped by various electrophiles, such as &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, aryl aldehydes, &#945;&#8208;ketoesters, and N&#8208;Boc imines, providing the corresponding diarylalkane derivatives in good yields.

         <title>Tetrafluoropyridinyl thiolate as a tool for enabling photoredox alkylation of 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for the radical functionalization of 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazoles using alkyl halides as precursors of radicals is described. The reaction efficiency is determined by potassium tetrafluoropyridinyl thiolate additive, which plays dual role. First, the thiolate converts alkyl halides into more reactive fluorinated aryl sulfides, which undergo photoredox activation of the C&#8208;S bond. Second, the thiolate decreases the unproductive loss of alkyl radicals by converting them back to the sulfides.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of quinine&#8208;inspired antimalarials by Ni&#8208;catalysed cross electrophile coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the efficient synthesis of novel dehydroxyquinines by arylation of quincorine bromide using Ni&#8208;catalysed cross electrophile coupling. The method demonstrates robust compatibility with (hetero)aryl bromides bearing diverse functional groups. Oxidation at C&#8208;9 of the dehydroxyquinines expediently provided quinine&#8208;inspired pseudo&#8208;natural products (&#8216;quinalogs&#8217;). Investigation of the compound collection against Plasmodium falciparum revealed a new insight into the structure activity relationship of quinine. Analogs bearing specifically functionalised pyridines, in place of the 6&#8208;methoxyquinoline ring of quinine, retained activity at the same order of magnitude, albeit not exceeding the activity of the natural product. This synthetic strategy conveniently enables iteration of the aromatic component of quinine for the first time, and holds promise for the development of effective new antimalarials.

         <dc:description>2&#8208;Exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones are useful synthetic intermediates with a unique indole scaffold. However, their synthesis has not yet been reported owing to their reactivity and instability. In this study, a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed method for generating 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivatives via the 5&#8208;&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;dig&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;selective cyclization of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;amino)phenyl alkynyl ketones with an alkyne terminus was developed. The subsequent pseudo&#8208;dimerization of the generated 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones and their [4+2] cyclization reactions with 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes afforded spiropseudoindoxyl and pyranoindole derivatives, respectively, in 21% to quantitative yields. Density functional theory calculations of the gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization provided insights into the 5&#8208;&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;dig&lt;/i&gt; selectivity. Furthermore, the reactive 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one was isolated for the first time based on the results from &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopic monitoring. The isolated product was applied to various transformations. Our synthesis method promotes the development of bioactive agents and functional materials with complex cyclic structures.</dc:description>

Recently, extensive attention has been paid to the hydroacylation reactions of the components containing an alkenyl moiety that can trigger a regioselective transformation in the presence of a transition metal catalyst. In this review, we summarize the constructive endeavors in rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed (formal) hydroacylation reactions from 2018, and the plausible pathway is also dissected to offer some insights into the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein successfully demonstrate the use of chiral isochalcogenoureas as Lewis Base catalysts for a variety of [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reactions of allenoates and different Michael acceptors. In all cases the same structural key&#8208;motive, a dihydropyran with a (Z)&#8208;configurated exocyclic double bond could be accessed as the major regio&#8208; and diastereoisomer in an enantioselective manner. Furthermore, these chiral dihydropyrans were successfully engaged in different follow&#8208;up transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical trifluoromethylalkoxylation of endocyclic enamides in batch and flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A regioselective electrochemical oxytrifluoromethylation of endocyclic enamides is reported. The 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization proceeds under mild conditions in an undivided cell and employs the inexpensive bench stable Langlois&#8217; reagent. This novel environmentally friendly multicomponent strategy gives access to a wide range of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;substituted amines by means of various alcohols as nucleophiles in high yield and with good functional group tolerance. In addition, an electrochemically induced C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of enamides has been developed. A practical continuous flow protocol using a commercial flow cell was also developed with improved reaction performance and efficiency over traditional batch versions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds are synthesized from 3&#8208;propargyl indoles, obtained by direct propargylation of indoles, via a gold&#8208;catalyzed tandem oxidation&#8211;1,2&#8208;indole migration reaction in the presence of pyridine N&#8208;oxides. Fine&#8208;tuning of the catalyst and oxidant enables the reaction of 3&#8208;propargyl indoles bearing different substituents. The order of oxidation and indole migration is determined by the terminal or internal nature of the alkyne moiety. In addition, the process can be coupled with additional reactions, allowing a rapid increase in molecular complexity or the design of more elaborated tandem reactions. In this sense, indole derivatives bearing an alkenyl substituent at the alkyne position evolve through a gold&#8208;catalyzed tandem oxidation&#8211;1,2&#8208;indole migration&#8211;Nazarov cyclization producing &#945;&#8208;indolyl cyclopentenones.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruppert&#8208;Prakash Reagent (TMSCF3)&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Esterification of Weinreb Amides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward TMSCF3&#8208;catalyzed conversion of Weinreb amides into esters through the treatment with sodium alkoxides is reported. The procedure documents a genuine selectivity for the esterification of primary alcohols with Weinreb amides featuring diverse substitution pattern. The constitutive N&#8208;methoxy fragment of these acylating agents is responsible for the unique reactivity they display, thus enabling to explore alkoxides as competent nucleophilic elements.  The protocol is compatible with the fully transfer of stereochemical information embodied in the starting material, as well as, guarantees the preparation of pharmaceuticals. Mechanistic investigations revealed that under the adopted reaction conditions (NaOR, R primary) TMSCF3 does not release the trifluoromethyl (CF3&#8208;) anion &#8211; as occurs with tertiary alkoxides &#8208; but rather it catalytically activates the amidic bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Ball&#8208;milling to access dinucleoside polyphosphates and analogues</title>

         <dc:description>Dinucleoside 5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;polyphosphates (NpnNs) play essential roles in various biological processes. Access to these high value&#8208;added compounds, while avoiding the many drawbacks of solution phase synthesis, is a challenge that has been overcome thanks to mechanochemistry. A straightforward solid&#8208;state synthesis based on activation of phosphate or pyrophosphate sodium salts to their diimidazolides, followed by coupling with commercially available nucleotides, under air conditions, gave symmetrical NpnNs. The scope ranged from Np3Ns to highly challenging Np6Ns. The methodology has also been implemented using medronic acid and imidodiphosphate to obtain NpnNs analogues, some of which are unprecedented.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photoinduced direct synthesis of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;indenones via radical cascade cyclization strategy is demonstrated. The methodology involves a domino reaction between 2&#8208;alkynylarylnitrile and N&#8208;aminopyridinium salt and captures the reactivity of in&#8208;situ generated nitrogen&#8208;centered radical (NCR) in visible light. Multiple bond&#8208;forming events including C&#8208;N, C&#8208;C, and C&#8208;O take place sequentially on 2&#8208;alkynylarylnitrile enabling construction of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;indenone core at room temperature in 35&#8208;76% yields. A preliminary biological screening of synthesized compounds is indicative of their potent anti&#8208;cancer property.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to tetrahydrothiopyrano[2,3&#8208;b]indole derivatives via zinc&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3 + 3] annulation of indoline&#8208;2&#8208;thiones with yne&#8208;enones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein an enantioselective [3 + 3] annulation of indoline&#8208;2&#8208;thiones with yne&#8722;enones by chiral dinuclear zinc catalysts via a Br&#248;nsted base and Lewis acid cooperative activation. This transformation proceeded through sequential conjugate addition, allenyl ketone formation and intramolecular sulfa&#8208;Michael 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization. A range of enantioenriched tetrahydrothiopyrano[2,3&#8208;b]indole derivatives bearing an exocyclic double bond were obtained in moderate yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 20 : 1 dr, 20:1 Z/E ratio and 95% ee). Late&#8208;stage functionalization, large&#8208;scale experiment and further derivatizations were also explored.</dc:description>

Late-stage functionalization, large-scale experiment and further derivatizations were also explored.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A solely&#8208;Fe&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira&#8208;type coupling of non&#8208;activated secondary alkyl iodides with terminal alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An iron&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling of non&#8208;activated secondary alkyl iodides with terminal alkynes is described. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions in N&#8208;MethylPyrrolidone without auxiliary ligand or co&#8208;catalyst. This procedure allowed the obtention of 28 coupling products. Moreover, slow addition of LiHMDS base allows to achieve up to 89% yields. This method enables the conversion of non&#8208;activated alkyl iodides in a Fe&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling, which was so far not achievable with iron catalysts. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest the implication of a key single electron transfer in the catalytic process.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A visible light&#8208;mediated strategy for the preparation of aromatic stannanes from aryl halides (mostly aryl bromides) is presented herein. The reaction proceeds under metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions and exhibits a broad substrate scope. The products obtained have been employed in the C&#8208;C bond formation via Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

         <title>Recyclable Iridium Catalyst Supported on Porous Organic Polymer for Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Silylation: Synthesis of Ring&#8208;Fused Oxasilacycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct conversion of specific C&#8211;H bonds to C&#8211;Si bonds in alkanes or aromatics via catalytic methods has attracted growing research interest. Herein, we report the preparation of a new iridium catalyst supported on a naphthyridine&#8208;based porous organic polymer and its successful application in the dehydrogenative silylation of 2&#8208;arylphenols or alcohol and hydrosilanes to access ring&#8208;fused oxasilacycles. The synthetic method exhibits broad substrate scope and good functional group compatibility while avoiding the use of hydrogen acceptors. In addition, this organic polymer supported iridium catalyst could be easily recovered from the reaction system and reused for at least seven times without apparent deactivation. This research provides new insights for the further design of heterogeneous nanocatalysts and contributes to the synthesis of silicon&#8208;substituted functional molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Organophotocatalytic Carbamoylation of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Carbonates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and modification of structures containing the amide functionality play a significant role in the development of pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds. While conventional amidation strategies primarily relies on C&#8208;N bond formation, the strategic integration of photoredox catalysis for synthesizing these compounds through C&#8208;C bond formation is in accordance with the principles of green chemistry and sustainability. Herein, we demonstrate that carbamoyl radicals generated through an organophotocatalytic protocol from 4&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;dihydropyridines (carbamoyl&#8208;DHPs) can be incorporated into Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) carbonates, affording a range of polyfunctionalized scaffolds. Reaction monitoring experiments, scale&#8208;up, reuse of the organophotocatalyst, and the hydrogenation of the succinamic ester&#180;s alkene moiety was also conducted, in order to showcase the mechanistic features and the robustiness of this new photochemical protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Synthesis of Atropoisomers via Non&#8208;canonical Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction stands as a powerful synthetic tool for C&#8208;H functionalization of aromatic feedstocks, which is conventionally realized through electrophilic alkylation and acylation. The burgeoning interests in axially chiral compounds across diverse fields have spurred extensive exploration of this classic transformation for catalytic atroposelective synthesis. Consequently, the past decade has witnessed the rapid expansion of various non&#8208;canonical Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions, including electrophilic arylation, alkenylation, halogenation, sulfenylation, and amination of aryl C&#8208;H bonds, thereby delving into new chemical spaces. A range of catalytic atroposelective synthetic methods have been devised for these significant arene C&#8208;H functionalization. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the cutting&#8208;edge catalytic synthesis of atropoisomers through non&#8208;canonical Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions, categorized into three parts based on the type of bond formation on the aromatics: C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8208;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bond formations, C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8208;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) bond formations and C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8208;heteroatom bond formations. The richness of electrophiles and the modulation of atroposelectivity by diverse chiral organocatalysts, particularly chiral Br&#248;nsted acids, are elucidated. We anticipate that the repertoire of asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction will continue to flourish and to be demonstrated in not only scientific researches but also industrial organic synthesis.</dc:description>

</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl halides are one of the most important chemical feedstocks in pharmaceuticals due to its easy accessibility, inexpensiveness, and widely utilized as aryl radical precursors in organic synthetic chemistry. Conventionally, the stoichiometric reagents such as AIBN/n&#8208;Bu3SnH were used for generation of aryl radical from aryl halides, and suffered from requirement of toxic radical initiators, high temperature and thus, the development of simple, mild strategies for the generation of aryl radical from aryl halides are highly desirable. Recently, visible light 	mediated strategies received considerable attention, allowing the generation of aryl radical from aryl halides under mild reaction conditions. The present review described the recent breakthroughs and advancements in visible light mediated photocatalyst&#8208;free C&#8208;B/C/O/P/Se/S bond formation of aryl halides.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances and Strategies towards Synthesis of Indolyl and Tryptophan&#8208;C&#8208;Glycoside Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, C&#8208;glycosidic bonds have emerged as pivotal elementary units present in many naturally occurring alkaloids as well as in pharmaceutically active molecules. Because of the stability and great utility of C&#8208;glycosides, synthetic approaches en route to the C&#8208;C bond formation have gradually become a center of attraction in carbohydrate chemistry. Towards these researches, C&#8208;glycosylation with heteroaryl moieties like indole, and tryptophan can remarkably expand the functional and structural evolution, which has great value for medicinal chemists and chemical biologists. The indolyl and tryptophan&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides have unique structures and biological activities that have attracted a number of synthetic studies. Therefore, these motifs have possessed an extensive interest in the direction of efficient synthesis. Herein, this review systematically summarizes the classical approaches to C&#8208;heteroaryl glycosides mainly focusing on indole and tryptophan synthesis. Furthermore, highlighted the recently developed metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H functionalization and photoinduced cross&#8208;coupling strategies that aim to control the regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity of the reaction in carbohydrate chemistry. 	In view of reaction type, mechanism, and status, this review will cover the synthesis of indole and tryptophan C&#8208;heteroaryl glycosides with diverse regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity from four perspectives which include a) conventional approach, b) heterocyclization and C&#8208;glycosylation sequence, c) metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H functionalization, and d) photoinduced cross&#8208;coupling.

         <dc:description>We described a base&#8208;promoted O&#8208;arylation of N3&#8208;hydroxyl quinazolinones with diaryliodonium salts and sequential BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and visible light&#8208;controlled [3,3]&#8208; or [1,3]&#8208;rearrangements of quinazolinone N&#8208;O aryl moieties to prepare a variety of 2&#8208;(quinazolin&#8208;4&#8208;yloxy)phenols and atropisomeric 3&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)quinazolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones in 44%&#8208;75% yields and 28%&#8208;70% yields, respectively. Mechanistic studies showed that HBF4 generated in situ from BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and water served as the catalyst in this process and aryloxyquinazolinium salts are vital intermediates promoting the [3,3]&#8208; or [1,3]&#8208;rearrangements. The N&#8208;O aryl moieties of aryloxyquinazolinium salts were found to undergo solely [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement with heating whereas [1,3]&#8208;rearrangement occurred via a radical process under irradiation of visible light.

         <dc:description>Dihydroquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones, recognized for their significant bioactive properties, feature a unique six&#8208;membered structure with nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. A breakthrough method has been developed to synthesize enantioenriched 3,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives. This innovative approach utilizes an asymmetric [4+2]&#8208;cyclization process, combining 2&#8208;amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes with azlactones, and is facilitated by a bifunctional squaramide&#8208;based organocatalyst. This innovative approach has enabled the creation of novel chiral 3,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones with complex structures, including chiral quaternary centers. The process is remarkably efficient, delivering high yields (up to 91%), excellent enantiomeric excess (up to 97% ee), and superior diastereoselectivity (up to 19:1 dr).</dc:description>

Abstract
A photoredox/copper co&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening cross&#8208;coupling of aryl azides with cyclopropanols has been developed with fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 as the photocatalyst. The reaction involves intermediacy of the anilino radical generated through reduction of the azido group by fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3* and [CuII]&#8208;enabled oxidative ring&#8208;opening of the cyclopropanol. An array of &#946;&#8208;aminoketone compounds were synthesized under redox&#8208;neutral conditions by using this method.

         <title>Recent Progress in Functionalization of the Pyridine Ring through C&#8722;S Bond Formation under Transition Metal Catalyst Free Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Pyridines and quinolines substituted with sulfur&#8208;containing functional groups are widely used as drugs, drug candidates, organic materials, N,S&#8208;ligands and others. Traditional synthetic routes to produce these compounds are based on nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions of (pseudo)halopyridines. While effective in many cases, both approaches are limited due to using forcing conditions and expensive, specifically designed catalytic systems. In the last decade, a number of innovative methods for the functionalization of the pyridine ring via the formation of a C&#8722;S bond have been developed. Most of these methods proceed through the direct or indirect C&#8722;H functionalization of unfunctionalized pyridines, thus avoiding the use of oftentimes not readily available halopyridines as the starting materials. Deoxygenative C&#8722;H functionalization of pyridine&#8208;N&#8208;oxides and deaminative transformation of aminopyridines have been also employed for the introduction of diverse organosulfur functionality into the pyridine ring. All these processes can be easily performed under mild conditions, typically affording value pyridines and quinolines in good to high yields. Usually being highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective, these methods allow the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules including drugs and natural products. In this Review, we summarize the most recent synthetic methods for functionalization of pyridines and fused pyridines with sulfur&#8208;containing functional groups reported mostly since 2018. For a better understanding of the processes, the mechanisms of the described reactions are briefly discussed.

Deoxygenative C&#8722;H functionalization of pyridine-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxides and deaminative transformation of aminopyridines have been also employed for the introduction of diverse organosulfur functionality into the pyridine ring. All these processes can be easily performed under mild conditions, typically affording value pyridines and quinolines in good to high yields. Usually being highly chemo- and regioselective, these methods allow the late-stage functionalization of complex molecules including drugs and natural products. In this Review, we summarize the most recent synthetic methods for functionalization of pyridines and fused pyridines with sulfur-containing functional groups reported mostly since 2018. For a better understanding of the processes, the mechanisms of the described reactions are briefly discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Herein, we report a photocatalytic method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;quinolones under mild conditions by employing &#945;&#8208;diazo acetamide as substrates. The use of Eosin Y as a photocatalyst allows an economical and environmentally benign synthetic method. The process involves the generation of radicals from diazo compounds promoted by a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism. The method demonstrates a broad substrate scope to provide various aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;quinolones. To support the proposed mechanism, a series of mechanistic experiments were conducted.

         <dc:description>








Abstract
Mn(II)&#8208;catalyzed alkylations of methyl N&#8208;heteroarenes was reported via borrowing hydrogen strategy with alcohols as the alkylating reagent. The developed geometry&#8208;constrained benzimidazole&#8208;iminopyridyl ligand played a key role in promoting the transformation and stablizing the metal center. A wide range of alcohols (aromatic, heteroaromatic and aliphatic) and methyl N&#8208;Heteroarenes could be able to apply in the current catalytic system, with TON up to 7400.

         <title>Tandem Hydrogen&#8208;Borrowing Dehydrogenative Coupling and Hydrodefluorination</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Dehydrogenative coupling (DC) is an attractive approach to constructing new C&#8722;N bonds using alcohols as electrophiles. In &#8216;hydrogen&#8208;borrowing&#8217; variants of DC, the H2 liberated can be used to re&#8208;hydrogenate unsaturated intermediates to produce saturated products. Here, we show how so&#8208;generated H2 can also be used to replace fluorine atoms with hydrogens in CF3 groups in a tandem dehydrogenative coupling/hydrodefluorination process.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Enabled Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Manganese (Mn) is the third most abundant transition metal on Earth and is known for its exceptional biocompatibility. The development of novel catalytic mode for Mn is of great significance to advancing organic synthesis. In this study, the first manganese (Mn)&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of alkynes is achieved with the aid of visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis. Photoredox catalysis is proposed to promote the transformation by in&#8197;situ reduction of high&#8208;valent Mn(II) complex to Mn(0) species, thereby initiating the reaction. Additionally, a photooxidation&#8208;induced reductive ellimination step is also suggested. This system is further distinguished by its notable tolerance towards both terminal and internal alkynes as counterparts of diynes.

Abstract
Due to amine derivatives widely existing in numerous clinical medicines and bioactive compounds, their synthesis has received considerable attention over the past few decades. Traditional methods for the synthesis of amine derivatives largely relied on the reduction of nitroarenes, amides, hydrazines, nitriles, and azides. Recently, the discovery of 2&#8208;azaallyl anions as super&#8208;electron&#8208;donors (SEDs) has opened up new possibilities for the construction of diverse carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds through radical coupling strategies. This breakthrough highlights the potential of generating 2&#8208;azaallyl radicals as versatile intermediates in organic synthesis. Then, hydrolysis of the coupling product can easily separate the corresponding amine derivatives. Thus, tremendous attention has been paid to the C&#8722;H functionalization of ketimines as an alternative strategy for the synthesis of amine derivatives. Herein, we comprehensively summarize the recent progress in radical coupling strategies enabled by 2&#8208;azaallyl anions as SEDs. Their proposed mechanistic pathways, advantages, and limitations are also discussed in detail. 1. Introduction 2. C&#8722;C Bond Formation 2.1. Vinylation of Ketimines 2.2. Arylation of Ketimines 2.3. Alkylation of Ketimines 2.3.1. Methylation of Ketimines 2.3.2. Other Alkylation of Ketimines 3. C&#8722;X Bond Formation 3.1. C&#8722;P and C&#8722;S Bonds Formation 3.2.

Abstract
A tert&#8208;butyl nitrite (TBN) promoted visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced one&#8208;pot C&#8722;N cross coupling reaction of 3&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles with benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine was explored. Simultaneously, the indoline motif of 3&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles as well as 3&#8208;ylidene oxindoles are regioselectively nitrated at the C&#8208;6 position by in&#8208;situ formed NO2 radical. (E)&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;(aryl)&#8208;2&#8208;oxoethylidene)oxindole and (E)&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene oxindole produce distinct nitrated diastereomeric coupling products, a phenomenon influenced by the steric bulk of the functional group. The experimental findings suggest the potential involvement of a radical pathway in this reaction.

(&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-3-(2-(aryl)-2-oxoethylidene)oxindole and (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-3-ylidene oxindole produce distinct nitrated diastereomeric coupling products, a phenomenon influenced by the steric bulk of the functional group. The experimental findings suggest the potential involvement of a radical pathway in this reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Herein, we report a photochemical synthesis of 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl containing quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones through consecutive photoredox catalysed reactions. A wide range of C3&#8208;modified quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones were obtained in 53&#8211;91% yields by this approach. Mechanistic studies including radical trapping, EPR studies, D&#8208;labelling investigations, and many other control experiments well explained the proposed consecutive photoredox mechanism.

Abstract
Herein, we report a chemo&#8208; and regioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed redox C7&#8208;spiroannulation reaction of N&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole indolines with maleimides, resulting in a series of N&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole indoline fused azaspirocycles in up to 92% yield. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by the synthesis of highly functionalized nitrogen&#8208;containing spiropolycyclic skeletons. The annulation reaction could also be performed with maleic esters and acrylates. The products were purified by simple filtration. The Rh catalyst can be recycled, and the reaction could be performed at gram&#8208;scale using 0.5&#8197;mol% of catalyst, which makes this protocol potentially applicable in industry. Moreover, the efficient post&#8208;modification of pharmaceutical molecules demonstrates its practicability.

Abstract
An acylative fluorination of two different alkenes is developed, assisted by the interaction of silver catalyst and Selectflour. Various &#945;&#8208;ketonic acids can be decarboxylated to form acyl radicals at 35&#8201;&#176;C, sequentially add to the electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208; rich alkenes to provide the benzyl fluorinated compounds containing diversified functional groups.

         <title>The Reaction of Aryl Thiols or Thioureas with o&#8208;Diiodoarenes/NaH to Access o&#8208;Iodoaryl Thioethers</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein we report a method for the synthesis of thioethers by forging C(aryl)&#8208;S bond via an aryne mechanism. The active aryne species can be generated from o&#8208;diiodoarenes and NaH in THF at room temperature, then lead to the arylations of a wide range of aryl thiols and thioureas. Different from transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, no disubstituted byproduct is formed in our protocol. The o&#8208;iodoaryl thioether products are intermediates that could be transformed into pharmaceutically interesting molecules.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Sonogashira Couplings: Extending the Reaction Scope to Aryl Bromides and Chlorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The alkyne motif is present in several naturally occurring molecules and specialty chemicals. The Sonogashira reaction is recognized as one of the most exploited methods for the synthesis of substituted alkynes. While palladium catalysts have been traditionally employed, recent efforts have been directed towards developing alternatives based on Earth&#8208;abundant metals such as nickel. However, nickel&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira couplings still present important substrate limitations. While more reactive aryl iodides have been well documented, the coupling of more challenging yet cost&#8208;effective aryl bromides and chlorides lags significantly behind. Herein, we present a method for the nickel&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling of aryl bromides and chlorides, whose discovery was accelerated thanks to high&#8208;throughput experimentation. Fine&#8208;tuning of the bipyridine ligand was essential to activate chemoselectively C(sp2)&#8722;Br or C(sp2)&#8722;Cl bonds. A wide range of functionally diverse alkynes, including examples of active ingredients and their intermediates, were accessed in a single step and with yields up to 98%. The developed methodology is expected to be widely adopted by academia and industry, marking a step forward in the field of base metal catalysis.

Abstract
Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkenylation and arylation of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines with alkenyl and aryl carboxylic acids under microwave assistance have been realized. Using [Rh(CO)2(acac)] as the catalyst and Piv2O as the acid activator, 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines undergo C8&#8208;selective decarbonylative C&#8722;H alkenylation with a wide range of alkenyl and aryl carboxylic acids, affording the C8&#8208;alkenylated or arylated 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines. This method enables the synthesis of C8&#8208;alkenylated 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines that would otherwise be difficult to access by means of conventional C&#8722;H alkenylation protocols. Moreover, this catalytic system also works well in C8&#8208;selective decarbonylative C&#8722;H arylation of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines with aryl carboxylic acids. The catalytic activity strongly depends on the choice of the N&#8208;directing group, with the readily installable and removable N&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrimidyl) group being optimal. The catalytic pathway is elucidated by mechanistic experiments.

Using [Rh(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(acac)] as the catalyst and Piv&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O as the acid activator, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines undergo C8-selective decarbonylative C&#8722;H alkenylation with a wide range of alkenyl and aryl carboxylic acids, affording the C8-alkenylated or arylated 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines. This method enables the synthesis of C8-alkenylated 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines that would otherwise be difficult to access by means of conventional C&#8722;H alkenylation protocols. Moreover, this catalytic system also works well in C8-selective decarbonylative C&#8722;H arylation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines with aryl carboxylic acids. The catalytic activity strongly depends on the choice of the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-directing group, with the readily installable and removable &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(2-pyrimidyl) group being optimal. The catalytic pathway is elucidated by mechanistic experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Access to Chiral Phthalides: Enantioselective Synthesis of Escitalopram</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A method for the asymmetric synthesis of phthalides containing a stereogenic &#947;&#8208;carbon has been described. The protocol, based on the arylogous Michael addition to chiral alkenoyl oxazolidinones catalyzed by a crown ether under phase&#8208;transfer conditions does not require anhydrous conditions and uses commercially available materials. A complete syn&#8208;stereocontrol is achieved and facial diastereoselectivities are moderate to excellent (62:38 to 99:1 dr). Purification of the major diastereomer by chromatography and selective cleavage of the chiral auxiliary affords enantiopure Michael products. The protocol has been applied to the formal synthesis of escitalopram.

         <title>Oxidative Alkenylation of (Hetero)aromatics with Unactivated Alkenes: Control of the Reaction Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkenylbenzene skeletons represent one of the most widely occurring structural motifs in pharmaceutical drugs, natural products, and advanced materials. The construction of alkenylbenzenes is promising through the use of a straightforward oxidative alkenylation protocol, particularly from unactivated alkenes. This is significant because unactivated alkenes are inexpensive raw materials that can be obtained in bulk quantities from petrochemical feedstocks and renewable resources. However, controlling the reactivity and regioselectivity of olefination with unbiased olefins remains a significant challenge, necessitating continuous efforts and potentially having a substantial impact on both organic synthesis and the industry. This review aims to provide an overview of the latest advances in regiocontrol strategies for oxidative alkenylation reactions with unactivated alkenes, which can be categorized into three types: 1) ligand&#8208;promoted/accelerated reactions; 2) prefunctionalized olefins&#8208;facilitated reactions; 3) directing group&#8208;induced reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;light Catalysed Trifluoromethylthiolation and Related Dearomative Spirocyclizations</title>

Abstract
We conceptualized a radical cyclization approach for the synthesis of SCF3, SAr, SO2Ar and COAr featured spirocyclic [4.5] and [5.5] trienone between biaryls and ArSO2H or ArCOCO2H in presence of RFTA as a photocatalyst whereas the insertion of ArSSAr or AgSCF3 devoid of photocatalyst via an energetically demanding dearomative transformation under visible&#8208;light catalysis. The photo&#8208;excited charge transfer complex with biaryl tethered ynones provides a way to promote S&#8208;centered radical generation followed by its insertion to enable a wide range of biologically important molecules.

Abstract
Herein, we describe a base&#8208;promoted regioselective and chemoselective cascade cyclization, ynamide N&#8722;Csp bond cleavage, selective intramolecular 1,3&#8208;migration, and simultaneous N&#8208;desulfonylation strategy for the synthesis of 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3&#8208;(phenylethynyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indole derivatives.

A gram&#8208;scale experiment as well as postsynthetic transformations of the synthesized 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3&#8208;(phenylethynyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indole were performed to exhibit the advantages of this synthetic methodology.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Vicinal Amino Alcohol Derivatives via Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Ring Opening of Aziridines with Alcohols and Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Under the catalysis of a Cu(I) or Ag(I) salt with a chiral diphosphine ligand, the enantioselective nucleophilic ring opening of racemic 2&#8208;styrenylaziridines via kinetic resolution or dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) and of meso aziridines via desymmetrization with alcohols was realized. The reaction provided a range of chiral vicinal amino ether derivatives in 47%&#8208;98% yields and with 50%&#8211;98% ee. The reaction could be extended to aliphatic carboxylic acids as nucleophiles. The synthetic utility was demonstrated in a four&#8208;step formal synthesis of a diastereomer of the antirythmetic agent vernakalant.

         <title>Synthetic Route to Benzostannoles via Al&#8722;Li&#8208;dimetal Intermediate and Their Application to Dibenzofulvene Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Benzostannoles were synthesized from commercially available and easily accessible substrates. The ring construction proceeds via an Al&#8722;Li&#8208;dimetal intermediate generated in&#8197;situ from 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;(silylethynyl)benzenes. This methodology provided various 2&#8208;silylbenzostannoles in 32% to 97% yields. The benzostannoles obtained were converted into dibenzofulvenes by treatment with 1,2&#8208;dibromobenzenes in the presence of a Pd catalyst. This transformation yielded various types of symmetrical and unsymmetrical dibenzofulvenes, with combination of the benzostannoles and 1,2&#8208;dibromobenzenes.

The ring construction proceeds via an Al&#8722;Li-dimetal intermediate generated in&#8197;situ from 1-bromo-2-(silylethynyl)benzenes. This methodology provided various 2-silylbenzostannoles in 32% to 97% yields. The benzostannoles obtained were converted into dibenzofulvenes by treatment with 1,2-dibromobenzenes in the presence of a Pd catalyst. This transformation yielded various types of symmetrical and unsymmetrical dibenzofulvenes, with combination of the benzostannoles and 1,2-dibromobenzenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoinduced C&#8722;O Bond Formation through C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage of Alcohols by Suppressing Alcohol Oxidation</title>

Abstract
Herein, we present a photoinduced deconstructive alkoxyamination of alkyl alcohols catalyzed by iron salts. This transformation involves the initiation of alkoxy radicals through chlorine radical&#8208;induced alkoxy radical formation, followed by &#946;&#8208;scission and trapping of the resulting carbon radicals with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl (TEMPO). This reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope (40 examples), including primary and secondary alcohols that are prone to oxidation by the combination of TEMPO and iron. Mechanistic investigations have revealed that enhanced coordination of the chloride ion with the iron center inhibits the OH oxidation process, thereby enabling the tolerance of primary and secondary alcohols.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Amino Esterification of Cyclic Ketones to Access Distal Amino Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
This study developed a method of synthesizing distal amino acid derivatives by the ring&#8208;opening reaction of cyclic ketones, following the amino esterification functionalization of both terminals. To achieve this goal, we performed the ring&#8208;opening reaction of cyclic ketones with an aminating reagent and alcohol under metal&#8208; and photocatalysis&#8208;free conditions in a single step. The method directly afforded distal amino acid derivatives bearing C4&#8722;C6, C8, and C12 carbon main chains, such as &#947;, &#948;, and &#1013;&#8208;amino esters. The obtained amino esters were simply transformed into amino acids by hydrolysis.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Arylsilanes via Barbier&#8208;Type Reaction between Aryl Halides and Chlorosilanes with Magnesium</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The reaction of chlorosilanes with organometallic reagents is an old and well&#8208;developed approach to organosilicon compounds, however, its application was limited due to the sensitivity of organometallic reagents to air, water. Here we display a mechanochemical access to arylsilanes via Barbier&#8208;type reaction of chlorosilanes with aryl halide with magnesium. By treatment of the two halides with Mg powder under electromagnetic milling, a series of arylsilanes are obtained within 15 minutes. Taking the advantages of the electromagnetic milling, this protocol features transition&#8208;metal free, good functional group tolerance, air stable and mild conditions.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfonaminoformyloxylation of Alkenes with N&#8208;Aminopyridinium Salts and DMF</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component sulfonaminoformyloxylation reaction between alkenes, N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts and DMF has been developed, which avoids the usage of erosive formic acid as the formyloxylation reagent. Besides DMF, alkyl and aryl carboxylic acids proved to be feasible nucleophiles to afford various &#946;&#8208;amino esters. The robustness of this method was further demonstrated by its applicability in the late&#8208;stage modification of biological molecules. Control experiments suggested that a sulfonamidyl radical was involved in this reaction.

         <title>Organocatalytic Atroposelective Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Involving Ring Manipulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Axially chiral architectures exist widely in natural products, biologically relevant molecules, chiral ligands and catalysts as well as functional materials. Therefore, catalytic asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers has become one of the most fast&#8208;growing fields in the community of chemistry and rapid advances have occurred. Among different methods reported, the organocatalytic atroposelective dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) involving ring manipulations stands out as a cutting&#8208;edge technology to construct axial chirality from the point of atom/step economy. In this DKR strategy, the configurational lability of starting materials originates from chirally&#8208;labile ring structure of cyclic substrates/intermediates or transient ring formation through noncovalent interactions from acyclic substrates. The two atropisomers of starting material are in equilibrium in the reaction medium, ensuring the constant transformation of the less reactive atropisomer into the more reactive one, and then to a single enantiopure product in the presence of an appropriate organocatalyst. This review summarizes recent advancements on this topic, including their scopes, limitations, mechanisms, applications and provides some insights into further developments.

Abstract
Herein, we describe a copper&#8208;catalyzed sequential C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H annulation of indoles with propargylic alcohols for the synthesis of diversely functionalized hydrobenzo[b]carbazole scaffolds. The reaction involves a Friedel&#8208;Crafts addition, 1,5&#8208;H shift, 6&#960; electrocyclization, and dearomatization&#8208;aromatization cascade. Importantly, this is a report of the use of 2&#8208;(diarylmethyl)indoles as three&#8208;carbon synthons in a (3+3) annulation reaction involving C(sp3)&#8722;H indole functionalization under oxidant&#8208;free conditions.

Abstract
Copper&#8208;catalyzed silylarylation of N&#8208;(arylsulfonyl)acrylamides via a tandem silyl radical addition/1,4&#8208;aryl migration/desulfonylation sequence has been developed. This method employs silanes as the precursor of silyl radical and di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide (DTBP) as the initiator. By using this cascade procedure, a series of &#946;&#8208;silyl amide&#8208;pharmaceutical hybrids which contain an &#945;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter were facilely synthesized.

Abstract
An asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkylated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated 2&#8208;acyl imidazole with nitrones or N,N&#8217;&#8208;cyclic azomethine imines to construct chiral &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkylated &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols or chiral &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkylated 1,3&#8208;diamino compounds has catalyzed by chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal rhodium complexes is reported. The corresponding products with three contiguous tertiary stereocenters were obtained in 62%&#8211;98% yields with stereoselectivities up to &gt;20:1 dr and 99% ee. Remarkably, as low as 0.06&#8197;mol% of chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal rhodium complex can promote a gram&#8208;scale reaction with nitrones or N,N&#8217;&#8208;cyclic azomethine imines.

         <title>Organocatalytic Activation of Pyruvates Toward Michael Addition to Nitroalkenes: Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) Derivatives</title>

Abstract
Despite the significant role of pyruvic acid in biotransformations, the utilization of pyruvates in the field of catalytic asymmetric synthesis has been unexpectedly limited. This statement also applies to enamine catalysis, in which pyruvates seem to be challenging substrates. Recently, the first illustration of the asymmetric addition of pyruvic acid to &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes, catalyzed by a NahE enzyme using the enamine mechanism, has appeared in the literature. Now, we demonstrate pyrrolidine&#8208;based catalyst can mimick enamine mechanism used by this enzyme to activate pyruvates in the asymmetric addition to structurally diverse nitroalkenes to produce highly enantioenriched Michael adducts without the limitations in substrate structures associated with biocatalysts. In addition to confirming that optically pure pyrrolidines can serve as ultimately small organic catalysts in pyruvate activation, we present an exceedingly simple and versatile method for the synthesis of optically pure &#947;&#8208;nitro acids, which are precursors for well&#8208;known active pharmaceutical ingredients namely GABA derivatives

         <title>Nitrosonium Ion Catalyzed Oxidative Bromination of Arenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A nitrosonium catalyzed bromination of electron&#8208;rich arenes has been developed, using bromide salts as bromine sources, oxygen gas as a terminal oxidant and Br&#248;nsted acids (sulfuric acid, TFA or HBr). This arene bromination process is free of transition metals, proceeding in acetic acid and under mild temperatures (25&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C) to give brominated arenes with good to excellent yields. Our mechanistic studies indicated that this oxidative bromination of arenes reaction is catalyzed by nitrosnium ion (NO+), without the involvement of Br2 or Br+. The kinetic isotope effect of this reaction was measured using pentadeuteriophenyl phenyl ether (kH/kD=1.1).

         <title>Synthesis of Vinyl and 1,3&#8208;Dienyl Sulfones Enabled by Photochemical Excitation of Halogen&#8208;Bonding Complexes</title>

Abstract
The photochemical catalyst&#8208;free radical&#8208;based synthesis of vinyl and 1,3&#8208;dienyl sulfones is disclosed. Mechanistic investigations support that the transformations rely on a visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted activation of a halogen&#8208;bonding complex, which is formed between an alkenyl (or 1,3&#8208;dienyl) bromide and a sodium sulfinate salt. The reactions exhibit a wide functional group tolerance (compatible with heteroatoms, electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating groups), finding application in the structural modification of biologically relevant molecules. Eventually, a continuous flow protocol was developed to upscale these transformations.

Abstract
This study describes the palladium&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective amination of chloro(hetero)aryl triflates in the C&#8722;Cl bond for the first time. A newly designed and synthesized alkyl&#8208;pyrazole&#8208;based phosphine ligand, L26 (BirdPhos), which is featured with the pyrazole ligand core and the cyclohexyl group at the C3 and C5 positions, was key to the success of this reaction. A variety of chloro(hetero)aryl triflates coupled with aromatic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic amines smoothly afforded the corresponding products up to 97% yields with general chemoselectivity (&gt;99%) in the C&#8722;Cl bond. Drug analogs were also synthesized via the chemoselective intermolecular amination. This study attempts to investigate the structure&#8208;activity relationship of this new class of ligand through experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Application of Solid Me3SiZnI for the Synthesis of Aryl and Alkyl Trimethylsilanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Silylzinc reagents are desirable for the synthesis of organosilanes due to their compatibility with functional groups; however, the use of pyrophoric silyllithium and dissolved lithium salts in their production hinders their development. Our solid Me3SiZnI circumvents these limitations, and herein, we demonstrate its significance in the synthesis of aryl and alkyl trimethylsilanes via cross&#8208;coupling of aryl and alkyl bromides. The milder reaction condition tolerates functional groups such as MOM, Boc, Bpin, and aldehydes.

Abstract
We report the development of the diastereoselective rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular conjugate addition (Hayashi&#8208;Miyaura reaction) of robust and easily handled 4&#8208;pinacolboronic ester D&#8208;tryptophan derivatives tethering an activated alkene as the acceptor. This methodology provides, access to the functionalized chiral tricyclic core of the ergoline skeleton diastereoselectivity and allows further modification for the cyclization of the fused fourth ring present in several clavine alkaloids.

         <title>A Three&#8208;Component Domino Reaction Enabled by Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis for the Assembly of 3&#8208;Thioquinoline&#8208;2,5&#8208;Diones</title>

Abstract
A three&#8208;component phase&#8208;transfer catalytic domino reaction involving cyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione&#8208;derived enaminones, 5&#8208;alkenyl rhodanines, and haloalkanes has been developed. This protocol produces a wide range of 3&#8208;thioquinoline&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones in yields of 52&#8211;81%. The construction of a C&#8722;S bond at the C&#8208;3 position of the quinoline&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione framework expands its structural diversity. Studies into the reaction mechanism revealed that the reaction undergoes a conjugate addition, ammonolysis, elimination, and nucleophilic substitution sequence. The synthetic potential of the reaction was demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale syntheses of representative products. Chloroalkyl chains were installed on the sulfur atoms of most products obtained in this reaction. Diversified product derivatives were obtained by exploiting the favorable leaving nature of the chloride moiety.

Abstract
Herein, we report a modular photocatalytic platform for the site&#8208;selective pyridination of saturated hydrocarbon compounds employing organic photoredox catalysis to forge new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. The site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H pyridination could couple benzylic/allylic C&#8722;H bonds with pyridylphosphonium salts, which installed directly and regioselectively from C&#8722;H heteroarenes through a radical&#8208;radical cross coupling mechanism. This synthetic methodology could tolerate a variety of functional groups, complex heteroarenes, even late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals selectively.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed norbornene&#8208;mediated regioselective direct C&#8722;H glycosylation of free N&#8722;H pyrrole and electron&#8208;deficient pyrrole derivatives has been developed. The reaction involves the use of a PdII catalyst and norbornene as a transpositional co&#8208;catalyst, in which a pyrrole&#8208; and norbornyl&#8208;fused palladaheterocycle forms as the key intermediate. The 2&#8208;substituted pyrroles, and other 2,3&#8208;disubstituted pyrroles underwent the selective C5 glycosylation. This reaction is compatible with various types of glycosyl chlorides including D&#8208;mannose, L&#8208;rhamnose, D&#8208;mannofuranose, and D&#8208;ribofuranose. The viability of this strategy is showed by gram&#8208;scale, various synthetic transformation and functionalization.

Abstract
An exclusive anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamination as well as hydroalkoxylation of allylic alcohols catalyzed by a simple catalyst Y(CH2SiMe3)3(THF)2 has been developed, providing a variety of &#947;&#8208;amino and &#947;&#8208;alkoxy alcohols in good yields under mild conditions. Moreover, this protocol is applied to the synthesis of drug molecules Propipocaine and Proroxan. The rare&#8208;earth metal catalyst features readily available, wide substrate compatability, exclusive anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity, and performs in the absence of a base or an additive.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exclusive &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-Markovnikov hydroamination as well as hydroalkoxylation of allylic alcohols catalyzed by a simple catalyst Y(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(THF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been developed, providing a variety of &#947;-amino and &#947;-alkoxy alcohols in good yields under mild conditions. Moreover, this protocol is applied to the synthesis of drug molecules &lt;i&gt;Propipocaine&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Proroxan&lt;/i&gt;. The rare-earth metal catalyst features readily available, wide substrate compatability, exclusive &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-Markovnikov selectivity, and performs in the absence of a base or an additive.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Both furan and 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine (1,4&#8208;DHP) are key structural motifs in pharmaceuticals. Herein, we report the synthesis of 4&#8208;(furan&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines from pyridiniums and furfural derivatives under NHC catalysis. This reaction involves the generation of NHC&#8208;bounded trienolates from furfural derivatives and following addition to the C&#8208;4 position of N&#8208;aryl pyridinium salts. This protocol features good yields (41&#8211;99%), and high levels of regioselectivity (&gt;20:1 for all cases).

The front cover picture visualises the colourful beauty of the synthesised compound class of 11H&#8208;indeno&#8208;[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes. In contrast to their colourless structural isomer naphthalene, azulenes are known for exhibiting vibrant colours, resulting from their non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbon nature. Whereas the unsubstituted azulene is blue, the presented indenoazulenes show a range of dark green emerald&#8208;like shades. The golden highlights depict the elegance and eternity of gold in its elemental state, emphasising the crucial role of the metal as a catalyst in the presented methodology. Details can be found in the Research Article by Hashmi and co&#8208;workers (A. V. Mackenroth, A. Ahrens, J. F. Wunsch, R. Berger, F. Rominger, M. Rudolph, A. S. K. Hashmi, Adv. Synth.

         <title>Hydroformylation of Alkynyl Sulfides: A Stereo&#8208; and Regioselective Route to &#945;&#8208;Sulfenyl Acroleins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation of alkynyl sulfides at 40&#8201;&#176;C under 5 bars of syngas is described. The method gives access to &#945;&#8208;sulfenyl acroleins with &#945;/&#946; regioselectivities up to 89/11 and is applicable to alkyl or aryl substituted substrates. It is effective even on more complex substrates, such as cysteine and cholesterol derivatives. To demonstrate the synthetic potential of the obtained products, (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;cyclohexyl&#8208;2&#8208;methylsulfenyl acrolein was selected as an example and its sulfur atom selectively oxidized to the corresponding sulfoxide or sulfone. Acid&#8208;promoted (Z) to (E) isomerization of the double bond occurred during oxidation. The three obtained sulfenyl&#8208;, sulfinyl&#8208;, and sulfonyl&#8208;functionalized acroleins have been then used as dienophiles to access cyclohexene carbaldehydes.

Abstract
Mg&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition reactions between 2&#8208;aminobenzaldehydes and ynones offered an array of 2&#8208;arylquinoline motifs merged with a CF3&#8208;acyl group. Furthermore, with Mg&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation as the key step, DDD107498, DDD102542, and Hit analogues were assembled. Finally, a computational study of the reaction mechanism was conducted.

Abstract
A cascade reaction between 2&#8208;styrylbenzaldehydes and indoles has been developed for the synthesis of 1H&#8208;indenes. An iodine&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic addition of indoles to an aldehyde group of 2&#8208;styrylbenzaldehydes leads to the formation of carbocation intermediates that undergo 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization to give indenes with a trisubstituted double bond. These indenes are transformed into thermodynamically more stable products with a fully substituted double bond under the reaction conditions. Minor quantities of indolylbenzo[b]carbazoles are also produced as by&#8208;products.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalyzed [3+3] Annulation for the Enantioselective Synthesis of Benzopyranothiazinones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The design, inspired by the core&#8208;structure of oxicam has allowed the enantioselective synthesis of benzopyranothiazinone motifs employing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. The NHC&#8208;mediated transformation involves the reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes with suitable substituted benzothiazinone derivatives. This process encompasses the initial formation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acylazoliums from ynals and concurrent generation of enolates from benzothiazinone. The culmination of these reactions results in an efficient annulation, yielding the desired products with reasonable yields and high stereoselectivities. This study underscores the potential of NHC catalysis in the streamlined synthesis of complex heterocyclic structures.

&lt;p&gt;The design, inspired by the core-structure of oxicam has allowed the enantioselective synthesis of benzopyranothiazinone motifs employing N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. The NHC-mediated transformation involves the reaction of &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehydes with suitable substituted benzothiazinone derivatives. This process encompasses the initial formation of &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated acylazoliums from ynals and concurrent generation of enolates from benzothiazinone. The culmination of these reactions results in an efficient annulation, yielding the desired products with reasonable yields and high stereoselectivities. This study underscores the potential of NHC catalysis in the streamlined synthesis of complex heterocyclic structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A substrate&#8208;induced synthesis of coumarin&#8208;fused quinolinones is achieved from 4&#8208;(phenylamino)&#8208;2H&#8208;chromen&#8208;2&#8208;ones using N&#8208;alkyl amines as the solvent and a carbon source under air conditions without any catalysts in one pot. This protocol highlights the special roles of 4&#8208;(phenylamino)&#8208;2H&#8208;chromen&#8208;2&#8208;ones which were not only used as reactants but also as an internal oxidant selectively activated N&#8208;&#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond. This reaction features catalyst&#8208;free, broad substrate scopes (N&#8208;alkyl amines 27 examples and quinolinones 24 examples), operationally simple for the one&#8208;step synthesis, and recovery and recycling of the solvent.

Abstract
We demonstrate the application of chiral magnesium complexes in an asymmetric carbon&#8208;sulfur bond&#8208;forming reaction. Enantioselective and cost&#8208;effective methodology under mild condition for the thia&#8208;Michael addition, utilizing an in&#8197;situ generated chiral dinuclear magnesium&#8208;ProPhenol complex, has been developed. The versatility of this protocol is demonstrated with a broad range of thiol nucleophiles and a wide selection of enones. Enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;ketosulfides are obtained in good to excellent yields and moderate to excellent enantioselectivity. The presented catalytic system exhibits excellent tolerance for structurally different substrates while maintaining high enantioselectivity. This observation aligns with proposed mechanism, wherein the sulfur atom coordinates to the catalyst in close proximity to the reaction center.

Abstract
The prospect of developing methods to control the reactivity of metal(oxo) holds appeal for both synthetic and bioinorganic chemistry. In this study, we observed that carboxylic acids enhance reactivity in C&#8722;H oxidation by forming hydrogen bonds with the oxo ligand, thereby increasing the basicity and electrophilicity of the oxo intermediate. Additionally, we discovered that H&#8208;dicarboxylate ligands, such as oxalate, malonate, and maleate, significantly improve the catalyst turnover frequency (up to 760/h) in unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H oxidation. Furthermore, the addition of maleic acid was also found to activate Fe and Mn(pdp)&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H oxygenation. Notably, Ru(bpga)(H&#8208;maleate)2 3&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization exhibited a broad functional group tolerance, including bromine, hydroxyl, benzoate, nitro, nitryl, sulfonate, imide, sulfonylamide, and carbamate, yielding up to 98% in a site&#8208; and chemoselective manner with only 0.1&#8211;2.0&#8197;mmol% loading.

Abstract
Elaborated molecular architectures, specifically those bearing one or more carbon stereocenters, stand as an important class of carbocyclic and heterocyclic frameworks because they are frequently occurring core structures in numerous natural products and biologically active pharmaceutical molecules. Over the past few decades, the development of versatile synthetic approaches via cascade cyclization reactions of 1,6&#8208;enynes for the construction of a series of fused and spiro compounds has been the focus of a great deal of research initiatives. These synthesis strategies are peculiarly fascinating in the context of the assembly of a wide array of pharmaceutical molecules, natural products, agrochemicals, and functional materials. In this review, recent developments in the transformations of 1,6&#8208;enynes with diverse coupling reagents are summarized since 2018, which could be divided into five categories: 1) Introduction; 2) Transition metal catalyzed cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes; 3) Metal&#8208;free cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes; 4) Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes; 5) Electrocatalytic cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes.

         <title>Borylated Cyclopentanes via Atom Transfer Radical [3+2] Annulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An atom transfer radical [3+2] annulation (ATRAn) reaction involving alkenyl boronic esters and homoallylic iodides provides a rapid access to polysubstituted borylated cyclopentanes. A variety of &#945;&#8208;substituted vinylboronic esters are suitable substrates and offer unique opportunities for further modification of the formed 5&#8208;membered ring. For instance, the oxidation of the boronic ester to an alcohol allows the preparation of products that corresponds to an annulation involving the enol form of acetone. Substitution of the iodide by a nucleophile such as lithium methoxide without modifying the boronic ester moiety is also feasible. Finally, by using a (3&#8208;acetoxyprop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;yl)boronic ester, a facile 1,2&#8208;elimination reaction provided a methylenecyclopentane. In this case, the alkenylboronate radical trap acts as an equivalent to allene, a building block so far elusive for preparative radical reactions.

Abstract
A light&#8208;driven radical oxy&#8208;functionalization of non&#8208;acidic aliphatic and benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds was achieved with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) in a single&#8208;step by employing an aryl ketone as a sole catalyst. The transformation was initiated by homolysis of a C(sp3)&#8722;H bond in the starting substance by the photo&#8208;excited aryl ketone. The derived carbon radical was then promptly trapped by TEMPO leading to the formation of the TEMPO&#8208;adduct. The derived TEMPO&#8208;adduct is synthetically versatile as an alcohol equivalent since it can be readily converted to the corresponding ketone by oxidation and to the corresponding alcohol by reduction. The key to realizing the present catalytic reaction relies on the distinctive triple role of TEMPO, which acts as the precursor of the oxygen functionality, the oxidant to regenerate the aryl ketone, and the protective group for the derived TEMPO&#8208;adduct from over&#8208;oxidation.

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds was achieved with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) in a single-step by employing an aryl ketone as a sole catalyst. The transformation was initiated by homolysis of a C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond in the starting substance by the photo-excited aryl ketone. The derived carbon radical was then promptly trapped by TEMPO leading to the formation of the TEMPO-adduct. The derived TEMPO-adduct is synthetically versatile as an alcohol equivalent since it can be readily converted to the corresponding ketone by oxidation and to the corresponding alcohol by reduction. The key to realizing the present catalytic reaction relies on the distinctive triple role of TEMPO, which acts as the precursor of the oxygen functionality, the oxidant to regenerate the aryl ketone, and the protective group for the derived TEMPO-adduct from over-oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>N&#8208;Heterocyclic compounds, in particular, quinolines and quinazolines are frequently used in medicinal chemistry. Therefore, the direct and clean synthesis of these valuable scaffolds has been a great interest for many years. 2&#8208;Aminobenzyl alcohols as an alternative reactant instead of unstable and expensive 2&#8208;aminobenzaldehydes can be used in the construction of N&#8208;fused heterocycles including quinolines, quinazolines, oxazines, thiazines, selenazines, imidazoles, diazepines, etc. In this review article, we have discussed recent developments in the use of 2&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohols in the synthesis of diverse heterocycles</dc:description>
