         <title>Aldehyde Dehydrogenase from Klebsiella pneumoniae: A Robust Biocatalyst for Preparing Heteroatom&#8208;Containing Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterocyclic scaffolds have broad applications in organic synthesis, resulting in the
production of essential compounds utilized in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and
dietary products. In this study, we present the characterization of a discovered succinic
semialdehyde dehydrogenase from Klebsiella pneumoniae (KpSSADH) and elucidate
its crystallographic structure. Further investigation into the catalytic performance of
KpSSADH reveals its remarkable efficiency in converting various heteroatomcontaining
(including N, S, O, and their combinations) cyclic aldehydes into the
corresponding acids with conversions reaching up to 99%. To expand the range of
available substrates, we designed cascade reactions by integrating thiol oxidase from
Methylovorus sp. MP688 or unspecific peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita with
KpSSADH. Through this approach, the desired acids via alcohol oxidation and C&#8208;H
bond oxyfunctionalization were obtained, respectively. The discovery of KpSSADH and
the envisioned cascade reactions have significantly broadened the biocatalytic toolbox
for synthesizing heteroatom&#8208;containing carboxylic acids, thereby holding potential for
applications in the modern pharmaceutical industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective and Practical Stereoselective Synthesis of Nutlins Precursors by Immobilization of Privileged Chiral Mono&#8208;Amidine Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy for the immobilization of Johnston&#8217;s Mono(AMidine) catalyst (&lt;b&gt;MAM&lt;/b&gt;) onto polystyrene, silica and hybrid silica&#8208;polystyrene nanoparticles is presented. The catalyst activity was evaluated in the stereoselective aza&#8208;Henry reaction leading to the pivotal &#946;&#8208;amino nitroalkane precursors of the anti&#8208;cancer agents Nutlins (with Nutlin&#8208;3a as the most active drug). The effect of the support and the linker on the catalytic performance was investigated, observing an interesting match/mismatch effect when using a chiral linker. The polystyrene&#8208;supported 3&#8208;pyrrolidinol&#8208;linked &lt;b&gt;PS&#8208;(&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;Pyr&#8208;MAM&lt;/b&gt; organocatalyst showed the best activity among the tested catalysts, behaving very similarly to the homogeneous counterpart in the synthesis of a library of Nutlins precursors: yield up to 95%, &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; up to 99%, and dr up to &gt;99:1. The catalyst recyclability was also assessed through simple filtration, yielding a satisfactory 93% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; after 5 cycles, showing only a moderate decrease in conversion efficiency (ca. 5% after each cycle), which resulted in an accumulated turnover number (TON) of 69.7.</dc:description>

Abstract
Gem&#8208;difluoroethylene moiety holds pivotal roles in drug research owing to its unique ability as a bioisostere of the carbonyl group. Here, magnesium&#8208;mediated reductive defluorinative cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrene with carbon&#8208;centered electrophiles was developed. This method featured readily accessible reagents, mild conditions, and wide substrate scope, enabling the efficient production of gem&#8208;difluoroallyl carboxylic acid and ketones. The establishment of this protocol will offer a general alternative for the acquisition of gem&#8208;difluoroethylene compounds.

         <title>Synthesis of Layered Copper&#8208;Based 2D&#8208;MOFs for Enhanced Catalytic Regioselective Phosphorylation of Alkynes and P&#8722;H Bonds</title>

Abstract
A functionalized heterogeneous Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Cu&#8208;2D&#8208;MOF) was synthesized through the reaction of Cu(NO3)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O with 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoroterephthalic acid and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine. The synthesized material underwent comprehensive characterization using various techniques, including FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy, N2 physical adsorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Subsequently, the catalytic performance of Cu&#8208;2D&#8208;MOFs was assessed in the hydrophosphorylation and aerobic oxidative dehydrogenative coupling reactions involving alkynes and P&#8722;H bonds. The catalyst demonstrated remarkable catalytic activity in both transformations, effectively yielding a wide variety of (E)&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;phosphoryl and alkynyl&#8208;phosphoryl compounds, respectively. Notably, the incorporation of this MOF material facilitated the phosphorylation reaction to proceed seamlessly, eliminating the necessity for supplementary small molecular organic ligands. Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrated ease of recovery and recyclability through a simple recovery process. Employing a systematic approach of sequential control experiments, we have delineated the potential transformation pathway of the reaction and consequently hypothesized a probable reaction mechanism for the observed transformation.

         <title>Combined Electrooxidation and Proline Catalysis for Asymmetric Formal Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling of Benzylic Alcohols with Ketones</title>

Abstract
This article presents a method for asymmetric formal cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of benzylic alcohols with ketones through combined electrooxidation and organocatalysis. Employing inexpensive and environmentally friendly proline as a chiral organocatalyst, various benzylic alcohols and simple ketones serve as substrates to directly obtain diverse chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxycarbonyl compounds with moderate to good yields (up to 85%) and excellent stereoselectivity (up to 99% ee and 99:1&#8197;dr). The reaction proceeds under mild conditions at room temperature in air, without oxidants or additives, demonstrating robust functional group tolerance and atom efficiency. Hydrogen gas released at the cathode is the sole byproduct. Using L&#8208; or D&#8208;proline allows straightforward access to both chiral configurations of &#946;&#8208;hydroxycarbonyl compounds.

Abstract
Functionalized pyridines and 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines are crucial organic entities in natural products, organic materials, drugs and catalysts. Despite progress, a facile and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis remains desirable so far. In this context, we disclose a novel visible light&#8208;promoted radical cascade sulfonylation&#8208;cyclization&#8208;aromatization of N&#8208;propargyl enamides with selenosulfonates. This approach avoids the use of metal&#8208; or photocatalyst, bases and external oxidants, marking a significant advance in sustainable and green chemistry accords. Utilizing this protocol, we successfully synthesized a diverse range of sulfonated 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines and pyridines, featuring good functional group compatibility, simple operation and mild condition.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced 3&#8208;Alkylation of Coumarins with Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A method for the direct 3&#8208;alkylation of coumarins utilizing alkyl halides as the alkylating agents has been achieved. This versatile reaction is compatible with a range of alkyl halides, including activated alkyl bromides, perfluoroalkyl iodides, and unactivated alkyl iodides. We propose a mechanism involving photoinduced electron transfer between alkyl halides and coumarins in the first singlet excited (S1) state, which generates alkyl radicals essential for the 3&#8208;alkylation process.

         <title>The Latest Insights into Multiply Selective Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions Using a Chiral&#8208;Cavity&#8208;Structured Lewis&#8208;Acidic Boron Catalyst</title>

Abstract
The latest insights into multiply selective Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) reactions is presented, where a chiral&#8208;cavity&#8208;structured Lewis&#8208;acidic boron catalyst is employed. The catalyst ((R)&#8208;1) is capable of recognizing both dienes and dienophiles, primarily due to the influence of the suitable steric factors of its cavity. By taking advantage of the structural and exo&#8208;product&#8208;inducing properties of (R)&#8208;1, even in the presence of a mixture of inseparable dienes, the target products were successfully obtained in high yield with high enantioselectivity. As (R)&#8208;1 exhibited the capacity to differentiate between three&#8208;dimensional isomeric transition&#8208;state structures in DA reactions, this work contributes to the advancement of artificial enzyme&#8208;like catalysis, which has so far remained elusive.

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of a Cobalt&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework in Carbodiimide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of carbodiimides via nitrene transfer to isocyanides has garnered significant attention in recent years. However, this reaction predominantly relies on homogeneous catalytic systems with high catalyst loadings. In this study, we employed ZIF&#8208;67 MOF as a heterogeneous catalyst for carbodiimide synthesis and conducted an in&#8208;depth analysis of its stability. Our findings reveal the non&#8208;innocent role of catalyst leaching, demonstrating that even as little as 0.04 mol% of leached cobalt species is sufficient to catalyze this reaction. This result is in contrast with previous reports, where 5&#8211;10 mol% of cobalt&#8208;loading is required. Furthermore, this study highlights that lower catalyst loadings are more efficient, particularly in cases where isocyanides exhibit limited stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Electrochemical Dehalogenative Carboxylation without a Sacrificial Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A scalable electrochemical procedure for the synthesis of carboxylic acids from organic halides has been developed using a spinning cylinder electrode electrochemical reactor. The electrochemical process is based on the reductive dehalogenation of the starting material followed by trapping of the resulting carbanion with CO2. The protocol is compatible both with organic chlorides and bromides and uses inexpensive graphite and stainless steel as electrode materials. As sacrificial metal anodes are avoided, the method can be readily scaled up in flow mode. The procedure is compatible with a wide range of substrates (24 examples), including aryl and alkyl halides as well as heterocyclic compounds. Multigram scale preparations in flow mode have been demonstrated by processing 600&#8197;mL of reaction mixture in an electrolyte recirculation setup.

Abstract
A molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenation of sulfoxides, pyridine and quinoline N&#8208;oxides, N&#8208;hydroxybenzotriazoles, as well as the reduction of nitroarenes to anilines, has been developed using monocyclic terpenes such as &#947;&#8208;terpinene as an environmentally benign hydrogen surrogate. The only byproducts generated are water and p&#8208;cymene, under neat reaction conditions in which the terpene acts as both solvent and reducing agent. These features make this approach a highly attractive and sustainable alternative for the reduction of S&#8208;O and N&#8208;O containing compounds. Additionally, the reaction exhibited excellent chemoselectivity, tolerating a wide variety of functional groups.

Abstract
A method has been developed for the synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical aryl 1, 2&#8208;diketones at room temperature, without the need for transition metals or photocatalysts. This protocol employs aromatic terminal alkynes or alkenes to react with aryl iodides under conditions involving formate, air, and DMSO. Mechanistic studies indicate that formate, air, and DMSO are all necessary conditions, and that the highly reactive carbon dioxide radical anion (CO2&#8901;&#8722;) generated under these conditions plays a key role in the reaction.

         <title>NFSI&#8208;TEMPO Catalysed Stereoselective Synthesis of 2&#8208;Deoxyglycosides from Glycals</title>

Abstract
2&#8208;deoxyglycosides are prominent constituents of diverse naturally occurring glycans and are known to participate in crucial biological pathways. We herein demonstrate NFSI&#8208;TEMPO as an efficient organocatalyst for the formation of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glycosides from glycals. For the first time a catalytic behaviour of NFSI&#8208;TEMPO combination has been observed. The reaction conditions have been found suitable for the generation of glycosides from commercial alcohols, amino acid, sterol, phenols and monosaccharide derived alcohols. Broad range of protecting groups on both glycal and glycosyl acceptors as well as alcohols of varied reactivity were found to be compatible for the generation of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glycosides in moderate to good yields. The synthetic potential of the newly established transformation was illustrated by application in trisaccharide synthesis and gram&#8208;scale reaction.

         <title>Second&#8208;Generation One&#8208;pot Enantioselective Heck&#8208;Matsuda Arylations of Unactivated Olefins Directly from Anilines and Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly improved second generation of the one&#8208;pot enantioselective Heck&#8208;Matsuda reaction directly from anilines and nitroarenes is reported. This practical arylation method, featuring 56 examples, relies on the in situ diazotization of anilines and 3&#8208;aminothiophenes, or from the in situ reduction&#8208;diazotization of nitrobenzene derivatives. The in situ diazotization of the aniline, directly or from the in&#8208;situ reduction of the nitroarene, synchronizes smoothly with the enantioselective Heck&#8208;Matsuda reaction under mildly acidic conditions, bypassing the synthesis and handling of some unstable and/or difficult&#8208;to&#8208;prepare arenediazonium salts. The protocol was applied to the desymmetrization of unactivated olefins leading to the synthesis of functionalized spirocyclopentenyl hydantoins, aryl cyclopentenes, and &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones, in high yields (up to 99%) and er (up to 99:1). The efficiency of the method is showcased by the formal total synthesis of the bioactive compound VPC01091, a potential drug candidate for multiple sclerosis treatment at the gram scale in excellent yield (94%), in 97:3 er and 20&gt;1 dr.</dc:description>

Abstract
The cyclization reaction and hydrosulfonylation reaction of ynones have been simultaneously realized through a single operation. Under the mediation of cesium carbonate, different S&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;hydroxyaryl) aryl thiosulfonates reacted with various ynones to produce functionalized vinyl sulfones in 37%&#8211;83% yields with E&#8208;selectivity. At the same time, a variety of benzoxathiins were formed in 42%&#8211;97% yields.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergent C&#8722;H Alkynylation of 2&#8208;Pyridylthiophenes</title>

Abstract
Different catalysts are presented to overcome or augment a substrate's innate regioselectivity. Rhodium was found to overcome the innate C3&#8208;selectivity via chelation&#8208;assisted rhodation. Conversely, palladium was found to enhance the innate C5&#8208;selectivity via electrophilic palladation. These reactions allow for the formation of a diverse range of synthetically versatile C3&#8208; and C5&#8208;alkynylated products from 2&#8208;pyridylthiophenes. Notably, this strategy was successfully employed in the straightforward synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended functionalized 2&#8208;pyridylthiophenes, which could be converted into more valuable compounds.

Abstract
We, herein, report a base free, photocatalytic decyanation of &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles. A range of amides and lactams were obtained in 52&#8211;95% yields. Control experiments indicate O2 as an amide/lactam oxygen source and the reaction (lactam formation) follows radical pathway via dioxetanimine species. This methodology also applied for &#945;&#8208;ester/aldehyde substituted pyrrolidines in the presence of a base, probably via decarboxylation pathway.

Abstract
Chiral C&#8208;Glycosyl amino acids are prevalent structural motifs found in pharmaceuticals and natural products, making them a significant dimension for exploration in modern pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. However, the current synthesis methods for these compounds face numerous environmental and practical challenges, highlighting the critical need to establish more sustainable approaches. Herein, we report a simple and powerful strategy for the stereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;glycoamino acids derivatives. This method features the design and use of (&#8722;)/(+)&#8208;camphorsultam as an ideal chiral auxiliary, shielding one prochiral face of the glycine &#945;&#8208;carbon efficiently and imposing a high kinetic barrier for the epimerization of thus&#8208;generated chiral &#945;&#8208;carbon that two configuration products of R and S could be achieved independently. It proceeds under mild conditions, shows broad scope, and allows for the direct stereoselective glycosylation without metal and chiral ligand.

Abstract
Herein, hydrogen&#8208;acceptor&#8208;free C2&#8208;selective iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H silylation of indoles and pyrroles with hydrosilanes via C(sp2)&#8722;H bond activation to generate the desired silylated products is presented. The developed protocol allows for the C&#8722;H silylation of a wide range of functionalized indoles with monohydrosilanes under iridium catalysis. Significantly, this process represents a rare silylation of C&#8722;H bonds using S&#8208;directing groups.

Abstract
With a number of biologically active members, 2&#8208;aroylchromones are valuable synthetic targets. A direct route towards 2&#8208;aroylchromones from 2&#8208;(methylsulfonyl)chromones and aldehydes via NHC&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond formation was developed. Yields of the synthesized 2&#8208;aroylchromones were up to 85%. Chromones with angioprotective or antibacterial properties were easily synthesized using the method developed. Additionally, the synthetic utility of the afforded chromones was demonstrated by using them to synthesize the anticancer compound wrightiadione and analogues of it.

Abstract
This work describes gold&#8208;catalyzed annulations of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;(dimethoxymethyl)phenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;prop&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;yl acetate substrates with &#945;&#8208;diazo esters and anilines, respectively yielding substituted naphthoates and indeno[1,2&#8208;b]quinoline derivatives. Our mechanistic analysis indicates 1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indenes as their common intermediates. In the formation of naphthoates, &#945;&#8208;diazo ester attacks at gold&#8208;bound intermediate via an SN2 pathway to enable a allylic methoxy substitution. For indeno[1,2&#8208;b]quinoline derivatives, there are two main reactions, including (i) a reversible formation between intermediate and a double amine addition product and (ii) an arylation reaction of intermediate. Species N&#8208;(phenyl((2E)&#8208;1&#8208;(phenylimino)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;inden&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)methyl)aniline was converted to indeno[1,2&#8208;b]quinoline in the presence of gold catalyst.

         <title>Visible Light Photocatalyzed Norrish Type II Reaction of Acrylamides for the Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Lactams</title>

Abstract
Here, we present a strategy for the visible&#8208;light&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams based on the Norrish type II reaction. This protocol uses acetonitrile as solvent and commercially available photocatalyst to drive the reaction. Notably, various challenging substrate types reported in previous studies undergo conversion. DFT calculations further elucidate the reaction mechanism, while discussing the competitiveness between [2+2] cycloaddition and the Norrish II reaction.

&lt;p&gt;Here, we present a strategy for the visible-light-catalyzed synthesis of &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-lactams based on the Norrish type II reaction. This protocol uses acetonitrile as solvent and commercially available photocatalyst to drive the reaction. Notably, various challenging substrate types reported in previous studies undergo conversion. DFT calculations further elucidate the reaction mechanism, while discussing the competitiveness between [2+2] cycloaddition and the Norrish II reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Herein, we reported the straightforward synthesis of thiomethylnaphthalenes via the reaction of propargyl alcohols with dimethyl sulfoxide/thionyl chloride (DMSO/SOCl2), which also provided easy access to deuterated thiomethyl and other thioalkyl scaffolds when deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide and dialkyl sulfoxides were used, respectively. In addition, the thiomethyl group can be readily derivatized to the corresponding sulfoxide, sulfone, and sulfoximine of interesting photophysical properties.

         <title>Tropone Hydrazides in [10+2]&#8208;Hetero&#8208;Higher&#8208;Order Cycloaddition for the Synthesis of Tetrahydropyridazine Derivatives</title>

Abstract
[10+2]&#8208;Hetero&#8208;higher&#8208;order cycloaddition between tropone hydrazides (acting as 10&#960;&#8208;components) and 3&#8208;alkylidene oxindoles (acting as 2&#960;&#8208;components) has been established. Under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis the reaction proceeded in a fully peri&#8208; and diastereoselective manner with the stereochemical outcome governed mainly by electronic interactions. Following such a strategy, a series of structurally diverse tetrahydropyridazines were prepared in 30&#8211;70% yields. Furthermore, the potential of the obtained cycloadducts has been confirmed in selected chemoselective transformations.

Abstract
Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed and K2S2O8&#8208;mediated synthesis of diverse sulfonylated 5&#8208;aroyl&#8208;2&#8208;arylpyridines was developed through one&#8208;pot stepwise annulation of two molecules of &#946;&#8208;ketosulfones and N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) under the sealed tube conditions. In the overall process, DMF acts as the synthon of one carbon and one imino moiety in the construction of pyridine skeleton via cascade formation of single (C&#8722;C/C&#8722;N) and double (C=C/C=N) bonds under refluxing DMF conditions. Plausible reaction mechanism is proposed and discussed.

Abstract
A synthetic method to prepare &#948;&#8211;&#954;&#8208;chloroketones, &#8208;esters and &#8208;amides that relies on the copper(I)&#8208;mediated chlorination at the unactivated tertiary &#948;&#8211;&#954;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of ketones, carboxylic esters, and amides by dichloramine&#8208;T is presented. By exploiting the ability of the N&#8208;chloramide to act as both the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and chlorination reagent, the reactions were shown to be site&#8208;selective with halogenation only occurring at the unactivated tertiary carbon center situated four to ten C&#8722;C bond distances away from the carbonyl functional group in the substrate. The site&#8208;selectivity of the chlorination protocol was further exemplified by the installing of the C&#8722;Cl bond at the distal position of one example containing two tertiary carbon centers and the late&#8208;stage functionalization of two drug molecules.

Abstract
Conjugation of amino acids to bioactive molecules has emerged as a promising strategy for optimizing pharmacological profiles of lead candidates in drug discovery. This study describes a photocatalytic Minisci&#8208;type transfer reaction of N&#8208;acyl amino acids into various N&#8208;heterocycles. Notably, this protocol enables direct conjugation of amino acids into heterocyclic C&#8722;H bonds, eliminating the need for prefunctionalized substrates. A diverse array of N&#8208;heterocycles, amino acids, oligopeptides, and drugs were used to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach. In addition, the importance of this approach is demonstrated through its application in the DNA&#8208;encoded library chemistry. Various synthetic transformations and preliminary mechanistic investigations were also explored.

         <title>Photocatalytic Silylation of Aryl Alkynoates: Synthesis of Silylated Coumarins</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report the photocatalytic synthesis of 3&#8208;silyl coumarins using hydrosilanes as the silyl radical source with aryl alkynoates. Readily prepared N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts act as hydrogen atom transfer reagents for generating silyl radicals under photoredox catalysis. The reaction proceeds through a silyl radical addition to alkyne followed by radical cascade cyclization/migration with subsequent oxidation and aromatization to give the desired 3&#8208;silyl coumarins in 34&#8211;89% yield.

         <title>Recent Advances in Photoredox/Chromium Dual&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonyl Addition Reactions: A Review</title>

Abstract
The chromium&#8208;catalysed Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama&#8208;Kishi (NHK) reaction is a very dependable technique for alcohol synthesis and is extensively used in the complete synthesis of natural compounds. The majority of these reactions occur via a reductive&#8208;radical&#8208;polar crossover (RRPCO) mechanism, which is crucial for the transformation of reactive radical intermediates. The production of radicals using photoinduced catalytic reactions is now among the most effective approaches. The photoinduced chromium&#8208;catalysed addition reaction to carbonyl compounds is an effective technique for alcohol synthesis that integrates the benefits of photocatalysis with chromium catalysis. Photocatalysis significantly enhances the diversity of radical production, hence broadening the substrate scope in the chromium&#8208;catalysed NHK reaction. This paper primarily examines the photoredox chromium dual&#8208;catalysed carbonyl addition process for alcohol synthesis, including numerous methods for radical generation.

Abstract
We report herein a palladium&#8208;catalyzed, site&#8208;selective cyclative annulation of o&#8208;alkynyl arylamides with maleimide for the stereoselective construction of succinimide&#8208;fused benzoxazine derivatives. This operationally simple and modular protocol provides access to polycyclic frameworks. The other associated features are high functional group compatibility, gram&#8208;scale synthetic potential, and downstream transformations. Control and labeling experiments were conducted to get insights into the mechanism.

Abstract
We describe a fluorinative ring&#8208;cleavage reaction that breaks C&#8722;C bonds in cyclic &#946;&#8208;diketones bearing an aryl moiety by using N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) in the presence of inorganic carbonates (Cs2CO3 or K2CO3) in methanol at room temperature within one hour. The generated fluorinated keto acid esters bearing ortho&#8208;nitro aryl groups were transformed into fluorinated dihydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indolones (DHPIs) via reductive cyclization using B2(OH)4 followed by amidation in the presence of K2CO3. This &#8220;cut&#8208;to&#8208;fuse&#8221; strategy enables the reconstructive synthesis of valuable fused heterocycles from relatively simple cyclohexadiones.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;/Regioselective [5+1] Annulation with gem&#8208;Difluoromethylene Allenes for the Assembly of Fluorinated 2H&#8208;Chromenes and Dihydroquinolines</title>

Abstract
A variety of fluorinated 2H&#8208;chromenes and dihydroquinolines was synthesized by virtue of gem&#8208;difluoromethylene allenes as versatile coupling partners to participate in the transition metal&#8208;catalysed cascade C&#8722;H activation/[5+1] annulation of 2&#8208;alkenylphenols/anilines. This protocol features specific chemo&#8208;/regioselectivity, redox&#8208;neutral manner and good compatibility, providing a straightforward synthetic route to intriguing motifs with the equipment of attractive fluoroalkenyl moiety. The distinctive gem&#8208;difluorine effect induced an unexpected protonolysis of &#963; carbon&#8208;metal bond, thus accounting for the observed selectivity via sequential C&#8722;H activation/allene insertion/protonolysis/cyclization/&#946;&#8208;F elimination process.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed carbo&#8208;/protoboration of boryl enynes is disclosed, providing access to an array of penta&#8208; and hexasubstituted diboryl dienes in a chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner. All six positions of the dienes can be manipulated using this methodology. The hexasubstituted diene boronates adopt a skew conformation. An iterative Suzuki coupling of the products provided highly conjugated trienes and tetraenes.

Abstract
We have developed a synthesis for tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines involving cascade sigmatropic rearrangements. The substrates were conveniently prepared from parent anilines via a [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement and cyanomethylation. Silver&#8208;mediated decyanation afforded the corresponding iminium cation, which underwent a cascade consisting of an aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement, an aza&#8208;oxa&#8208;Cope rearrangement, an aromatization, and a Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction, and tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines were obtained as the single product. The reaction involved seven bond scissions and four bond formations and was triggered by a single reagent.

Abstract
A metal&#8208;free base&#8208;promoted [4+3] cycloaddition reaction of N&#8208;thioacyl imines in&#8197;situ generated from &#945;&#8208;amido sulfones with &#945;&#8208;chlorohydroxamates is described. The reaction allows the straightforward synthesis of 1,3,5&#8208;thiadiazepin&#8208;6(7H)&#8208;one derivatives in 44~90% yields. Moreover, a gram&#8208;scale reaction and a product transformation were conducted, which further increased the diversity of products.

Abstract
Here, we present 3,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2,5,6&#8208;trifluorophenyl glycosides as bench&#8208;stable, and reactive electron&#8208;deficient fluoroarene based glycosyl donors that can be prepared in one&#8208;step and be activated with catalytic amounts of TMSOTf. The glycosylation reaction conditions show tolerance towards acid/base sensitive protecting groups and have a different substrate scope with 68&#8211;89% yields. The electron&#8208;deficient fluoroarene&#8208;containing glycosyl donor enables the construction of O&#8208; and C&#8208;glycosides using both free alcohols and silylated alcohols, as well as C&#8208; nucleophiles as acceptors.

Abstract
An electrochemical cascade radical cyclization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl indoles with sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate as a coupling partner has been explored, which afforded the unexpected bis&#8208;trifluoromethylated indole[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines as products. Experimental results and DFT calculations disclose that this reaction involves trifluoromethylation&#8208;triggered cyclization and the second trifluoromethylation as the key steps. This strategy does not need any transition&#8208;metal catalysts or oxidants with a readily available trifluoromethylating reagent enabling facile synthesis of bis&#8208;trifluoromethylated indole&#8208;fused tricycles.

         <title>Selective 1,2&#8208;Carboimination of Isothiocyanates to Access S&#8208;Substituted Isothioureas via Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 3, February 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we introduce a novel method for the synthesis of S&#8208;substituted isothiourea compounds via the selective 1,2&#8208;carboimination between oxime esters as bifunctional reagents and the C=S bond of isothiocyanates under visible&#8208;light catalysis. This approach deviates from conventional methods by precisely modulating the substrate electronics to selectively functionalize the C=S bond of isothiocyanates over the C=N bond, eliminating the need for strong bases and high temperatures and bypassing the formation of thiourea intermediates. Consequently, this protocol enables the efficient one&#8208;step synthesis of S&#8208;alkyl isothioureas, with featuring mild reaction conditions, operational simplicity and broad substrate scope.

Abstract
Camphorsultam was utilized for the optical resolution of P&#8208;chiral phosphorous compounds. After chromatographic separation of diastereomeric RP&#8208; and SP&#8208;phosphonamidate intermediates, subsequent substitution reactions with phenol derivatives yielded P&#8208;chiral phosphonic acid aryl esters with excellent enantioselectivities. In these processes, chiral sulfonamide of camphorsultam demonstrated superior abilities as an optical&#8208;resolving agent and a good leaving group. This method was applied to the synthesis of P&#8208;chiral phosphinic esters, phosphonamidates, and thiophosphonate diesters.

Abstract
Herein we present a method for base&#8208;mediated sequential annulation reaction of conjugated dienes. The method offers an efficient pathway for the effective construction of bicyclo[4.1.0]heptenes. Notable features of this approach include good yields, remarkable stereoselectivity, as well as a broad substrate scope and significant step efficiency. In addition, the reaction could be effectively scaled up to a gram scale under standard condition.

Abstract
Herein, an electroreductive aryl radical enabled 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization of N&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;halobenzamides is presented, providing a convenient route for the synthesis of a variety of 3&#8208;iminoisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones in 30&#8211;75% yields. Simply by employing zinc plate instead of graphite rod anode, the products of the electrosynthesis are switched to diverse 3&#8208;aminoisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones through aryl&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization and subsequent reductive hydrogenation. Furthermore, this anode material determined divergent 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization features mild electrochemical conditions, excellent substrate scopes, and good functional group tolerance.

         <title>Photoinduced Methylthio Radical Generation from Methylthiophosphonium Salt</title>

Abstract
The production of methylthio radical typically relies on gaseous methanethiol or dimethyl disulfide. Herein, we present a new and straightforward method for the photogeneration of methylthio radical from methylthiophosphonium salt, enabling the synthesis of methylthiophenanthridines via charge transfer complex strategy. In this approach, the methylthiophosphonium salt acts as the electron acceptor, while 2&#8208;isocyanobiaryls serve as the electron donors. This strategy is distinguished by its simplicity in both conditions and operation, and can be extended for the generation of various alkyl(aryl)thio radicals.

Abstract
A regioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed protoboration of alkynes has been developed, utilizing diboron as the borylation source for the efficient synthesis of alkenylborates. The reaction proceeds via cobalt&#8208;boryl intermediates, diverging from conventional Co&#8722;H chemistry. By fine&#8208;tuning the phosphine ligand side chains, we achieved excellent reactivity and regioselectivity across a wide range of internal and terminal alkynes. This Co&#8208;catalyzed method offers significant advantages in terms of both efficiency and environmental impact, making it an attractive approach for the synthesis of complex organic molecules.

         <title>Modular Chiral Bithiophene&#8208;2NO Ligands: Synthesis and Application in Asymmetric Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalysed Friedel&#8208;Crafts Alkylation</title>

Abstract
The development of privileged thiophene&#8208;type ligand remains highly desirable, owing to the high coordination ability of sulfur atom to most of the soft metals. Herein, a new class of C2&#8208;symmetric rigid chiral tertiary amine&#8208;derived dioxide ligands with a coordinating bithiophene bridge was developed in a convenient synthetic route with 25&#8211;62% overall yields. The bithiophene&#8208;2NO&#8208;palladium(II) catalyst system was generated in&#8197;situ and found to be highly capable catalyst in the asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of indoles. Excellent yields (up to 92%) and high enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99% ee) are obtained for a wide range of substrates under mild conditions. Control experiments and DFT calculations revealed the origins of the enantioselectivity. This represented the first example of chiral thiophene ligands coordinating with soft metal Pd(II) in the asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation. Experiments revealed that the counteranion is involved in the stereoselectivity&#8208;determining step in this soft palladium(II) catalysis, and the additional NO and thiophene in ligands can act as the second chelation site and thus reduce the amount of free metal ions for suppressing background reaction in the catalytic system.

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of privileged thiophene-type ligand remains highly desirable, owing to the high coordination ability of sulfur atom to most of the soft metals. Herein, a new class of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-symmetric rigid chiral tertiary amine-derived dioxide ligands with a coordinating bithiophene bridge was developed in a convenient synthetic route with 25&#8211;62% overall yields. The bithiophene-2NO-palladium(II) catalyst system was generated &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; and found to be highly capable catalyst in the asymmetric Friedel-Crafts alkylation of indoles. Excellent yields (up to 92%) and high enantioselectivities (up to &amp;gt;99% ee) are obtained for a wide range of substrates under mild conditions. Control experiments and DFT calculations revealed the origins of the enantioselectivity. This represented the first example of chiral thiophene ligands coordinating with soft metal Pd(II) in the asymmetric Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Experiments revealed that the counteranion is involved in the stereoselectivity-determining step in this soft palladium(II) catalysis, and the additional NO and thiophene in ligands can act as the second chelation site and thus reduce the amount of free metal ions for suppressing background reaction in the catalytic system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Organic synthesis has long been fascinated by phenolic compounds, especially their exploration of selectively hydroxylating arenes utilizing H2O as a hydroxyl source. However, phenols&#8242; low redox potential and strong reactivity frequently result in unwanted overoxidation byproducts. Here, we present an electrochemical strategy to overcome this difficulty by using electricity as an oxidant and facilitating the para&#8208;selective hydroxylation of N&#8208;protected anilines. This process exhibits excellent regio&#8208;selectivity, compatibility with diverse functional groups, and adaptability by handling an extensive range of substrates. Noteworthily, the technique provides a sustainable substitute for paracetamol synthesis and terminal acetylene&#8208;holding hydroxylated products, proving the suitability of this strategy for drug synthesis. Significantly, mechanistic investigations suggest the possible radical pathway and water as a hydroxyl source for this strategy.

Abstract
Cyclobutenones constitute an appealing class of substrates in catalytic asymmetric transformations leading to diversely substituted enantioenriched four&#8208;membered carbocycles, which are eliciting a growing interest in medicinal chemistry. Whilst several synthetically useful enantioselective conjugate addition reactions have been reported, the catalytic enantioselective reduction of the carbonyl group of simple cyclobutenones remains an elusive transformation. Herein, we disclose the discovery of a novel allylic reduction&#8208;asymmetric transfer hydrogenation cascade, catalyzed by a Noyori&#8208;Ikariya ruthenium complex, from readily available gem&#8208;dichlorocyclobutenones, leading to 2&#8208;chlorocyclobutenols with high optical purities, which can be engaged in postfunctionalization reactions enabling access to substituted four&#8208;membered rings.

         <title>Selective Enzymatic C&#8722;H&#8208;Oxyfunctionalization for the Efficient Synthesis of Grevillic Acid</title>

Abstract
In this study, a selective C&#8722;H&#8208;oxyfunctionalization using an unspecific peroxygenase (UPO) enabled an efficient biosynthetic route for the synthesis of grevillic acid (GA), a natural antioxidant. The route commenced with the release of o&#8208;coumaric acid (oCA) from trans&#8208;2&#8208;coumaric acid glucoside (trans&#8208;CAG) using commercially available &#946;&#8208;glucosidase from almonds. In addition, a cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans photoisomerization of cis&#8208;CAG was implemented to increase the synthetic access of oCA. The key step, the para&#8208;hydroxylation relative to the existing hydroxyl group of oCA, was accomplished by an UPO with full conversion and 93% isolated yield. Despite its name, the UPO turned out to exhibit excellent regioselectivity in this C&#8722;H functionalization, requiring only H2O2 as a cosubstrate.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrative C2&#8208;Arylation of Oxazoles, Benzoxazoles, and Benzimidazoles with Nitroarenes</title>

Abstract
A step&#8208;economic method for C2&#8208;arylated azoles via Pd&#8208;catalyzed denitrative arylation of nitroarenes and azoles is reported. This protocol employs synthetically upstream nitroarenes as arylating reagents and proceeds through the selective cleavage of the C&#8722;NO2 and C&#8722;H bonds. Various nitroarenes and nitroheteroarenes were coupled with oxazoles, benzoxazoles, and methylbenzimidazoles, achieving yields of up to 95%. The method's utility is exemplified by its application in the synthesis of Flunoxaprofen. This strategy reduces synthetic steps and minimizes pollution, offering substantial cost&#8208;effectiveness and environmental benefits. Furthermore, the relatively inert C&#8722;NO2 bond in nitroarenes enables late&#8208;stage functionalization or stepwise coupling reactions, providing a complementary method for C2&#8208;arylation of azoles.

         <title>Biomimetic Orthogonal Removal of Arylacyl Protecting Groups from the C&#8208;Terminus of Substituted Amino Acids and Oligopeptides via Flavin N(5)&#8208;iminium Covalent Adducts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavin co&#8208;factors and other flavin derivatives are traditionally associated with one&#8208; or two&#8208;electron redox reactions. Flavins also form covalent intermediates with a variety of substrates. While extensive attention has focused on reactions at the C(4a) position of the flavin ring, recent interest has shifted toward the dynamic potential of the N(5) atom. In our study, we demonstrate the formation of artificial flavin N(5)&#8208;iminium covalent adducts via nucleophilic attack by enolates derived from arylacyl esters at the flavin N(5) position. This interaction mimics the biosynthesis of ether phospholipids catalysed by alkyl&#8208;dihydroxyacetone phosphate synthase via an N(5)&#8208;FAD iminium adduct formation and fatty acid release. Accordingly, we developed a method for the selective removal of phenacyl and 2&#8208;naphthylacetyl protecting groups from the C&#8208;terminus of &#945;&#8208;amino acids and di&#8208; and tripeptides using biomimetic flavin organocatalysis. Although many approaches are currently available for protection of C&#8208;terminus of peptides, their removal often requires harsh conditions, which cause racemization and the loss of optical purity, together with other side reactions. Our method is versatile, mild, orthogonal to most functional and protecting groups and maintains optical purity of &#945;&#8208;amino acids. From general point of view, the method signifies the groundbreaking application of the non&#8208;canonical reactivity of flavins in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

Abstract
A base&#8208;mediated one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step, four&#8208;component reaction has been developed to synthesize imidazole&#8208;4(2H)&#8208;ones, utilizing commercially available amino acid esters, aldehydes, alkynes, and amino alcohols. Control experiments and isolation of the intermediate revealed the mechanistic details. This four&#8208;component reaction proceeds via imine formation, followed by the nucleophilic addition of alkyne to form a propargylamine precursor. Subsequently, the propargylamine precursor under undergoes base&#8208;mediated conversion into 1&#8208;azadiene, followed by in situ ketene formation to generate (allylideneamino)prop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;one. The nucleophilic addition of amino alcohol and subsequent intramolecular cyclization provides imidazole&#8208;4 (2H)&#8208;ones exclusively.

         <title>Imidazolium&#8208;Dithiocarboxylate Zwitterions Catalysed Ring&#8208;Opening Additions of Cyclopropenones</title>

Abstract
Imidazolium&#8208;dithiocarboxylate zwitterions (NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2), a novel organocatalyst that derived from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC), was used to activate cyclopropenones. Under the catalysis of 10&#8197;mol% NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2, a range of phenols, alcohols, primary and secondary amines react with cyclopropenones to produce trisubstituted &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters and amides in 46&#8211;95% yield. More than 68 products, including 7 natural product derivatives have been synthesized through this method. Mechanism study showed NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2 act as a Lewis base to activate the C=C double bond of cyclopropenones and trigger the ring&#8208;opening reaction. HRMS analysis indicated the formation of the key adduct of NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2 and cyclopropenone. More importantly, this study demonstrated completely different catalytic activity of NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2 and NHC catalysts, the latter one cannot catalyse these reactions.

         <title>Au(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Hydroarylation of Allenes for the Synthesis of Tetrahydrodiazepines or Tetrahydrodiazonines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Allenes tethered to pyrroles undergo Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation leading to tetrahydrodiazepines or tetrahydrodiazonines. The regioselectivity of the reaction is governed by both the substitution pattern of the allene and the nature of the Au(I) ligand. Hence, alkyl&#8208;gem&#8208;disubstituted allenes preferentially lead to tetrahydrodiazepines via 7&#8208;exo&#8208;cyclizations, while aryl&#8208;substituted allenes preferentially lead to tetrahydrodiazonines via 9&#8208;endo&#8208;cyclization when a phosphite ligand is used. Enantioselective reactions have been developed with the SEGPHOS chiral ligand, leading to chiral heterocycles with high enantioselectivity (up to 96% ee). In addition, DFT calculations have streamlined the regioselectivity (7&#8208;exo vs 9&#8208;endo) of these gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations.

Abstract
A chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of axially chiral alkenes was developed via an enantioselective and para&#8208;selective Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction between phenols and 1&#8208;alkynylnaphth&#8208;2&#8208;ols. This methodology features an efficient hydroarylation with high functional group tolerance, complete para&#8208;selectivity, excellent yields (up to 99%), and enantioselectivities (up to 94% ee) in the presence of a N&#8208;triflylphosphoramide catalyst. DFT calculations were performed to investigate para&#8208;selectivity and results indicate that both kinetics and thermodynamics parameters are more favorable compared to ortho&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Controlling Catalyst Speciation to Achieve Room Temperature Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Aminations with Aryl and Heteroaryl Chlorides</title>

Abstract
The amination of aryl halides with palladium catalysts (Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination) is a widely used transformation in synthetic and drug discovery chemistry. In this report, we demonstrate that a monometallic 2&#8208;phosphinoimidazole Pd catalyst exhibits comparable or enhanced reactivity when compared to all ligands screened for room temperature amination of aryl chlorides with secondary amines. The di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine derivative showed extremely high reactivity while the di&#8208;isopropyl variant led to almost complete loss of catalytic activity. Computational and experimental mechanistic and kinetic studies indicate that a monometallic Pd structure rather than a bimetallic Pd structure is key to fast catalysis. The di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine ligand has fast catalysis because it thermodynamically disfavors the formation of a much less active bimetallic Pd complex. A wide substrate scope is demonstrated for the arylation of secondary amines with aryl chlorides using our new catalyst system.

In this report, we demonstrate that a monometallic 2-phosphinoimidazole Pd catalyst exhibits comparable or enhanced reactivity when compared to all ligands screened for room temperature amination of aryl chlorides with secondary amines. The di-tert-butylphosphine derivative showed extremely high reactivity while the di-isopropyl variant led to almost complete loss of catalytic activity. Computational and experimental mechanistic and kinetic studies indicate that a monometallic Pd structure rather than a bimetallic Pd structure is key to fast catalysis. The di-tert-butylphosphine ligand has fast catalysis because it thermodynamically disfavors the formation of a much less active bimetallic Pd complex. A wide substrate scope is demonstrated for the arylation of secondary amines with aryl chlorides using our new catalyst system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The electrochemical catalyst&#8208;free generation of carbon radicals bearing three electron&#8208;withdrawing groups from the corresponding C&#8208;H nucleophiles remains unexplored. To this end, we report a direct electro&#8208;oxidation strategy to access these electrophilic carbon radicals under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. Enabled by this strategy, the radical 1,2&#8208;alkylarylations of allylic alcohols was realized, affording &#946;&#8208;quaternary ketones with high functional group compatibility. This protocol is operationally simple and also easy to scale up.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;free, Selective Ortho&#8208;Deuteration of N&#8208;heterocyclic Oxides
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Replacing hydrogen with deuterium raises the activation energy for C&#8210;D bond cleavage. This approach has gained attention in drug design, especially to protect the ortho&#8208;position of pyridines, which are susceptible to enzymatic oxidation. Until now, direct hydrogen isotope exchange has been largely restricted to the use of reactive organolithium reagents or metal&#8208;catalysed deuteration methods. In this work, we present a metal&#8208;free, selective ortho&#8208;deuteration of N&#8208;heterocycles starting from their N&#8208;oxides, proceeding at room temperature in just 5 minutes. This method achieves high deuterium incorporation across a broad range of N&#8208;heterocycles, including bioactive compounds. Experimental and computational studies have elucidated the mechanism of the reaction, showing that regioselectivity is driven by a successful increase in acidity at the ortho&#8208;position, enabling deprotonation by the in&#8208;situ generated dimsyl anion.

Abstract
A general protocol for the efficient synthesis of a variety of highly functionalized pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ones has been developed through a sequential Wolff rearrangement and [3+3] annulation reaction of enaminones and diazo compounds. This straightforward approach features wide substrate applicability, good substrate tolerance, moderate to excellent yields, and without any catalyst, and enables access to structurally diverse pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;one skeletons. Additionally, scale&#8208;up experiments and synthetic derivatizations demonstrated the potential synthetic utility of the transformations.

         <title>Alkylation of Imines with Alkyl Halides under Electrochemical Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An electrochemical protocol for the alkylation of imines was developed by using easily available alkyl halides as the alkyl sources, graphite felt (GF) as anode and zinc plate as cathode. Various substituted imines, alkyl bromides and alkyl iodides were suitable for this reaction and a series of &#945;&#8208;branched amines were obtained in moderate to good yields. This method provides a green way for the addition of imines to avoid the need for metal reagents, chemical oxidants and reductants, which makes it has a good application prospect in drug synthesis.

         <title>Organic Photoredox Catalytic Sulfonylation of Enaminones to Access 3&#8208;Sulfonyl Chromones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we disclose a readily available phenothiazine derivative as an oxidizing organic photocatalyst, that serves to induce radical cascade sulfonylation/cyclization reaction of enaminones. A variety of 3&#8208;sulfonyl chromones have been obtained with moderate to excellent yields. This catalytic platform proceeds under metal&#8208;free conditions with a wide substrate scope and broad functional group compatibility, which unlocks the new reactivity of phenothiazine derivatives and adds significant synthetic values to O&#8208;heterocycles.

         <title>1,3&#8208;Iodoesterification of 2&#8208;Substituted Indoles via Csp2&#8722;H/Csp3&#8722;H Retained Dual Functionalization Using Hypervalent Iodine(III)</title>

Abstract
A 1,3&#8208;iodoesterification of 2&#8208;substituted indoles with trihaloacetic acid, iodination reagent, and hypervalent iodine(III) compound was developed as an acid&#8208;promoted Csp2&#8722;H/Csp3&#8722;H dual functionalization reaction to furnish 3&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8208;trihaloacetoxymethyl indoles. The one&#8208;pot 1,3&#8208;iodoesterification/hydrolysis of the trihaloester group provided 3&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8208;pivaloylmethyl indoles via the rearrangement of the pivaloyl group. The reaction proceeded through a trihaloacetic acid&#8208;assisted electrophilic activation of the iodination reagent after the formation of an indolyl(mesityl)iodonium trihaloacetate.

         <title>Photoinduced Catalytic Alkylation of Active Methine Compounds with Nonactivated Alkenes Using Yttrium Triflate as a Lewis Acid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Photoinduced catalytic alkylation reactions of active methine compounds with nonactivated alkenes have been developed using an organophotocatalyst, a metal Lewis acid, an arylthiol, and an amine base catalyst system. The alkylation reactions proceeded smoothly under ambient conditions with blue light irradiation, affording the desired products bearing quaternary carbon centers in high yields. Furthermore, enantioselective alkylation with an nonactivated alkene was achieved using a chiral Lewis acid.

         <title>Mg(SPh)2 as a Catalyst for Efficient Photocatalytic Alkylation Reactions of Active Methylene Compounds with Nonactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Mg(SPh)2 has been found to be a highly active catalyst in photocatalytic alkylation reactions of active methylene compounds with nonactivated alkenes. The desired reactions proceeded smoothly to afford the corresponding alkylated products in high yields with low catalyst loadings (0.2&#8211;0.3&#8197;mol%). This protocol is applicable to a continuous&#8208;flow system. Notably, magnesium is an earth&#8208;abundant metal, and Mg(SPh)2 exhibits higher catalytic activity than the previously reported LiSPh.

         <title>2&#8208;Aminoindoles and 2&#8208;Iminoindolines as Viable Precursors of Indole&#8208;Fused Nitrogenated Polyheterocycles</title>

Abstract
The synthesis of architecturally complex polyheterocyclic structures embedding the indole ring represents a growing field of interest. Carbolines and their partially dehydro derivatives, pyrazinoindoles, indoloindoles, azepinoindoles and other medium&#8208;sized derivatives are only some examples of indole&#8208;containing polycyclic compounds featured by enhanced pharmacological and photophysical properties. Among various synthetic protocols to prepare these important target compounds those based on the utilization of 2&#8208;aminoindoles and 2&#8208;iminoindolines are gaining increasing interest because of the ease of their preparation. The presence of a couple of reactive sites in these derivatives is instrumental for the assembling of polyheterocyclic structures exploiting single step operations featured by efficient cascade or tandem processes. Several of these methods employ catalyzed reactions which can be developed for the asymmetric synthesis of enantiopure compounds. This review provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date report on the currently available methods for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aminoindoles and 2&#8208;iminoindolines and their application to the preparation of polyheterocyclic derivatives.

         <title>Preparation of Mesoporous Cu2O Nanospheres for Green Synthesis in the Enantioselective Boron Conjugate Addition of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Chiral Compounds in Aqueous Phase</title>

Abstract
Chiral organoboron compounds are essential intermediates in various significant reactions. However, there are still few efficient catalysts for their synthesis. This paper reports a novel catalytic material for chiral asymmetric boron conjugate addition reactions: mesoporous Cu2O nanospheres (M&#8722;Cu2O). M&#8722;Cu2O is approximately 0.55&#8197;&#956;m, exhibiting dense and uniformly distributed worm&#8208;like pores. It features a specific surface area of 15.7&#8197;m2/g and an average pore size of 14.3&#8197;nm. Under the conditions of Toluene:H2O=9:1, with a chiral ligand amount of 3.6&#8197;mol% and no additional base, it achieves a high yield (98% yield) and impressive enantioselectivity (99% ee) for the template substrate chalcone using only 3.0&#8197;mol% of the catalyst. Notably, the catalyst can be easily recovered and maintains robust catalytic performance after seven cycles, yielding 92% and an ee value of 90%. This work presents a mild and effective method for synthesizing chiral boron compounds in an aqueous phase, significantly enhancing the application potential of mesoporous copper oxide nanospheres.

         <dc:description>We reported an electrochemical oxidative carbonylation of N&#8208;phenylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amine derivatives under mild condtions without an external oxidant. Our approach demonstrated a novel electrochemical oxidative carbonylation reaction mode in which the simultaneous reaction of catalyst and substrate with the anode has been developed. Furthermore, an electrochemical C&#8208;H activation for the synthesis of cyclized pyridinium ion has also been realized. Mechanistic investigations suggested that the process involved a &#8220;PdII/PdIII/PdI/PdII&#8221; catalytic cycle, and H2 was generated at the cathode.</dc:description>

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Analysis of Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Semihydrogenations of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes has historically been an essential technique in organic chemistry. In this context, researchers often employ transition metal complexes to achieve this conversion. Given the pronounced polarization of results, often yielding either very high or very low values, it remains challenging to discern the factors influencing reactivity and selectivity in many cases. In this work, we combine different sub&#8208;disciplines of digital chemistry with experimental outcomes to rationalize the results of a model Ni&#8208;catalyzed semihydrogenation that leads to E&#8208;alkenes. First, we analyze the main factors behind successful reactions using a machine learning classification model. The descriptors are computed directly from the SMILES strings of the reacting alkynes using an automated protocol that relies on structural features, molecular mechanics, and semi&#8208;empirical techniques. This workflow requires minimal human intervention and provides a fast yet useful approach. Next, we couple the same descriptors with activation barriers calculated with density functional theory, generating a regression model that explains reactivity based on the properties of the alkyne substrates. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of using a combination of digital chemistry techniques to uncover reaction trends in Ni&#8208;catalyzed semihydrogenations of alkynes, an area where human intuition proves limited in application.</dc:description>

Abstract
Herein, an iron&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the aromatization&#8208;driven deconstruction and decarboxylation of ketone&#8208;derived dihydroquinazolinones in reaction with unsaturated carboxylic acids is reported. A diverse range of fluoroacrylic acids and cinnamic acids reacted effectively with dihydroquinazolinones, yielding essential monofluoroalkenes and alkenes with excellent stereoselectivity. Additionally, spiro&#8208;dihydroquinazolinones served as suitable substrates, facilitating the synthesis of valuable quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones featuring alkene motifs. This protocol is notable for its operational simplicity and versatility, enabling the chemical diversification of active molecules.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Deoxygenation of Nitroarenes to Access N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we present the example of iron&#8208;catalyzed reductive amination of nitroarenes under the iron/borane system, providing diverse N&#8208;heterocycles in moderate to good yields. This transformation has high efficiency, broad substrate scope, and good functional group compatibility. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that hydroxylamines derived from nitrosoarenes may serve as crucial intermediates rather than anilines, and free organic radicals may not participate in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Intramolecular Crossed [2+2] Cycloaddition through Visible&#8208;Light Triplet Sensitization: Expedient Access to Bridged Bicyclic Alkene</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced intramolecular crossed [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of allene&#8208;tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes was reported in this paper. The reactions were conducted under mild conditions using Iridium(III) catalyst FirPic as a photosensitizer for energy transfer, affording bridged bicyclic alkenes in moderate to good yields with excellent regioselectivity and stereoselectivity through the regulation of substituents at the olefin's terminal position. Meanwhile, the computational study explained the special region control assisted by sulfonyl radicals in detail.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization Amination of Propargylamine and 1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A novel and efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization amination of propargylamines and 1,3&#8208;dienes is reported for the first time, yielding a series of chloromethylene pyrrolidines with high efficiency and excellent selectivity. This method was successfully applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and drug molecules, providing molecular backbones with potential applications. The reaction was shown to achieve regioselective modulation of the product molecules through the resonance between the solvent and allylpalladium. Additionally, the E&#8208;form products were found to be thermodynamically stable.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Cascade Synthesis of 5&#8208;Alkylidene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;Lactams via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Hydro&#8208;Oxycarbonylation</title>

Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrofunctionalization of alkynes and, more precisely, the intramolecular hydro&#8208;oxycarbonylation (cycloisomerization) of acetylenic acids, has been widely employed as a key step in cascade processes for the construction of valuable and complex molecules. However, in contrast with other aminonucleophiles, no method has been reported for the reaction between primary monoamines and non&#8208;activated alkynoic acids. Hence, a procedure has been devised for the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective preparation of 5&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams via a copper&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction between alkynoic acids and amines. The developed protocol proves to be scalable and demonstrates significant tolerance to a wide range of structurally diverse alkynoic acids and amines bearing various functional groups, as evidenced by 60 high&#8208;yielding examples. An exhaustive experimental and computational analysis of the reaction is also provided to unravel the nature and role of the copper catalyst, the observed regioselectivity and the mechanism of the reaction.

         <title>Divergent Hydroelementation of Unsaturated C&#8722;C Bonds Using 3d Transition Metal Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Divergent hydroelementation reactions offer a cost&#8208;effective synthetic protocol to prepare two or more products starting from same set of reactant molecules by altering one or more reaction parameters. This strategy is quite helpful in functionalizing unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds into several value&#8208;added chemical compounds by using various organic and metal&#8208;based catalysts. In this regard, catalysts derived from 3d metals have come to the fore, providing an alternative to heavier transition metals and rare&#8208;earth elements. In this review, we summarize and elucidate the recent developments of divergent hydroelementation of alkenes and alkynes using the first&#8208;row transition metal complexes by categorizing them into three classes: (1) Catalyst and ligand&#8208;controlled; (2) Reaction component&#8208;controlled and (3) Substrate&#8208;controlled. Given the importance of hydroelementation reactions, we hope this review will be helpful to the organic chemistry community.

Abstract
Selective access to densely functionalized boranes, with identical or distinct functional groups at the boron center, has great potentials in materials science, organic synthesis and drug discovery. However, assembling multifunctional boranes was heavily dependent on hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (HAT) at high temperatures, hazardous radical initiators, metal photocatalysts and HAT reagents, respectively. Simultaneously, competitive side reactions such as polymerizations and regioisomers formation remain highly challenging. Herein, a programmable multifunctionalization of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) boranes is developed for the first time powered by a single, metal&#8208;free photocatalyst, in which boryl radicals from sequential substituted boranes are generated instead of polymerizations. This robust and versatile catalytic system leads to an extremely broad variety of boranes incorporated with diverse alkyl or alkenyl groups in high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities.

         <title>Enzymatic Asymmetric Synthesis of All Stereoisomers of Aliphatic, Vicinal Diols in Conventional and Non&#8208;Conventional Media</title>

Abstract
Chiral, vicinal diols are of high interest for academic research and industrial applications. For synthesizing chiral diols, enzymes are important catalysts due to their high selectivity and ability to work under tolerable temperature and no pressure. In this study, two consecutive enzyme&#8208;catalyzed steps were used for the asymmetric synthesis of aliphatic, vicinal diols with high product concentrations and chiral purity. The reaction comprised a ligation step employing lyases and a subsequent reduction step using oxidoreductases. Either in an aqueous buffer or an organic solvent, the potentially biobased aldehydes acetaldehyde, propanal, butanal, and pentanal were used as substrates. Here, all possible stereoisomers of 2,3&#8208;butanediol, 3,4&#8208;hexanediol, 4,5&#8208;octanediol, and 5,6&#8208;decanediol were produced with isomeric content values between 72% and &gt;99%, and concentrations between 4.1 and 115&#8197;mM. This work shows how four symmetric, chiral, vicinal diols can be synthesized by combining enzymes in a modular way, including exemplarily scaling.

         <title>Photoinduced Hydrogen Atom Transfer Activation of Benzylic C&#8722;H Bonds Functionalization</title>

Abstract
Visible light, as an efficient and renewable resource, has gained significant attention in organic synthesis due to its mild, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly nature. Among the various photocatalytic processes, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) has become a crucial mechanism for the activation of C&#8722;H bonds, with a particular focus on the functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. This review shows recent developments in the area of photoinduced HAT and its use in benzylic C&#8722;H bonds functionalization. We discuss halogen atom radicals, N&#8208;centered radical, O&#8208;centered radical, S&#8208;centered radical and C&#8208;centered radical in HAT processes, and influence on reaction selectivity and substrate versatility. The potential of photoinduced HAT to bypass the need for transition metal catalysts and directing groups positions it as a promising approach for constructing intricate organic molecules with high atom economy and sustainability. This review aims to offer a detailed summary of the current state of photoinduced HAT, providing insights into its potential uses in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aminoquinazolines through I2&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of 2&#8208;Aminoaryl Ketone Oximes and Isocyanides</title>

Abstract
An I2/cumene hydroperoxide (CHP)&#8208;mediated tandem cyclization of 2&#8208;aminoaryl ketone oximes with isocyanides has been developed. Various 2&#8208;aminoquinazolines were obtained in 49&#8211;96% yields under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, and the resulting 4&#8208;phenylquinazolin&#8208;2&#8208;amines show typical fluorescent emission properties. The key to the success of this strategy involves the formation of iminyl radical via the N&#8722;O bond cleavage of hydroxy oxime.

Abstract
Phosphorus Fluoride Exchange (PFEx) is a new click chemistry technology that hinges on the creation of innovative hubs to unlock its potential and broaden its applications. In this study, we outline some guiding principles for PFEx hub development and validate these principles by developing a new hub, 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyclotriphosphazenes (SACPs). These SACPs serve as versatile PFEx hubs with stable functionality and orthogonal reactivity, exemplifying their utility within the Diversity Oriented Clicking (DOC) framework. We demonstrate that SACPs interact with various 1,3&#8208;dipoles, enabling the synthesis of phosphorus&#8208;rich compounds through sequential cycloaddition and PFEx reactions, thus pioneering new synthetic routes for wide application of click chemistry.

         <dc:description>Herein, we present a Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective C7&#8208;H dienylation of indolines at room temperature employing allenyl carbinol acetate as an efficient dienylating reagent. The reaction proceeds via C&#8208;H activation, regioselective 2,1&#8208;migratory insertion of the allene followed by &#946;&#8208;acetate elimination, resulting in a diverse array of C7&#8208;dienylated indolines. The methodology was further extended to C2&#8208;H dienylation of indoles, affording either branched or linear dienes, contingent on the nature of the substituent present at the allenylic carbon. In addition, hydroarylation of allenes was also successfully achieved with tri&#8208;substituted allenes, which was elusive so far under cobalt catalysis.</dc:description>

Its application potential is exemplified through the implementation of scale-up operations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Engineering of Oleate Hydratase for the Synthesis of Small Chiral Alcohols without Decoy Molecule</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Small and chiral secondary alcohols are sought&#8208;after compounds that are frequently used in the synthesis of biologically active compounds. However, their stereochemically correct synthesis remains a challenge for the chemical industry. Synthetic routes are restrained by multiple steps and thus low atom efficiency. Here we employ engineered variants from the oleate hydratase from E. meningoseptica to produce chiral C5&#8208;C8 secondary alcohols within a single step. First, we established a two&#8208;phase system (2&#8208;PS) to trap the volatile substrates/products which facilitated semi&#8208;rational mutagenesis in the active site and tunnel of the enzyme. These efforts led to variants with an up to 20&#8208;fold increase in catalytic activity and &gt;99% ee, notably, without the use of a decoy molecule. Computational analysis indicated structural changes in the tunnel radius, ligand transport and energy profiles, which gave us hints to explain the enhanced performance of the variants. Interestingly, scaling up the reaction volume demonstrated significant increases in product concentrations, leading up to a 100&#8208;fold increase in comparison to the current benchmark. This new 2&#8208;PS and the engineered enzyme variants offer a promising approach for a scalable, asymmetric hydration of small unactivated alkenes, which would drastically ease the access to chiral alcohol&#8208;based pheromones or drugs.

         <title>Organophotocatalytic Site&#8208;Selective Radical Deuteration at Sterically Hindered Benzylic Positions by Consecutive Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond activation or exchange labeling with hydrogen isotope are of vital importance, in particular for high&#8208;specific&#8208;selectivity deuteration of pharmaceuticals. While catalytic approaches relying on closed&#8208;shell manifolds have been well documented for efficient delivery of deuterium at sterically less hindered benzylic positions, complementary strategies target sterically bulky benzylic positions remain a long&#8208;standing challenge. We herein disclose a mild, versatile approach to achieve efficient and selective radical deuteration by merging organophotoredox catalysis and bromine radical catalysis. This open&#8208;shell strategy provides the unparalleled ability of the convergent unification of readily available quinoxalinones and para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) and D2O through a simultaneous highly cross&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and chem&#8208;selective radical coupling&#8208;H/D exchange approach. Furthermore, the long&#8208;standing challenge of the incorporation of deuterium to sterically bulky benzylic positions has been addressed through this approach.

         <title>Photoredox Hydroacylative Dearomatization of Indoles with Aromatic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein we reported for the first time a photocatalytic dearomative hydroacylation reaction of electron&#8208;deficient indoles with readily available aromatic acids through a phosphoranyl radical&#8208;assisted deoxygenative process. A range of racemic and optically active 2&#8208;acylindoline derivatives were obtained in good yields (up to 94%) with good diastereoselectivity. The synthetic robustness is highlighted by the enantioselective dearomatization of indoles and the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and pharmaceutical molecules. This protocol features broad substrate scope and mild reaction conditions, providing a reliable entry to developing deoxygenative strategies in dearomatization reactions. Preliminary mechanistic studies and DFT calculations suggest that a Giese&#8208;type radical addition pathway should be involved.

         <title>Disclosing the Intra&#8208;Catalyst Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in Tetrahydropyran&#8208;Based Dipeptidic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we describe how minor structural modifications to our bifunctional organocatalysts based on sugar amino acids (SAAs) can alter the network of non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) within the catalyst, leading to significant changes in their catalytic activity. This is attributed to the intra&#8208;catalyst NCIs, which induce conformational changes that are reflected in the transition state of the rate&#8208;determining step of the Michael addition of aldehydes to trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes. Through kinetic experiments, conformational analysis, and DFT calculations, we found that the presence of a methoxy group at the C4 position of the tetrahydropyran ring reduces the catalytic activity by a factor of five compared to the catalyst without the methoxy group. Additionally, we have identified the different intra&#8208;catalyst NCIs, both attractive and repulsive, that drive the conformational changes, ultimately modifying the energy levels of the transition states of the rate&#8208; and enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step of the reaction.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;C Coupling of Alkenyl Boronates and Bromodifluoroacetates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The reaction of alkenyl boronates and bromodifluoroacetates in the presence of copper powder and TMEDA as the catalytic system was developed. The corresponding C&#8722;C coupling products were obtained in 35&#8211;93% yield. The method tolerated a variety of functional groups, namely, phenol, (thio)ether, protected amino&#8208;, hydroxy&#8208;, ketone, and carboxylic acid moieties, as well as various saturated carbo&#8208; and heterocycles, and was compatible with multigram scale&#8208;up (to 76&#8197;g). The diastereoselectivity of the process was typically low so that ca. 1:1 E/Z isomeric mixtures were formed from pure E or Z alkenyl boronates. Further functional group transformations demonstrated the utility of the prepared compounds as valuable building blocks for synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Based on the obtained results and the literature data, a plausible reaction mechanism was proposed involving the formation of radical and organocopper intermediates.

&lt;p&gt;The reaction of alkenyl boronates and bromodifluoroacetates in the presence of copper powder and TMEDA as the catalytic system was developed. The corresponding C&#8722;C coupling products were obtained in 35&#8211;93% yield. The method tolerated a variety of functional groups, namely, phenol, (thio)ether, protected amino-, hydroxy-, ketone, and carboxylic acid moieties, as well as various saturated carbo- and heterocycles, and was compatible with multigram scale-up (to 76&#8197;g). The diastereoselectivity of the process was typically low so that ca. 1:1 &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; isomeric mixtures were formed from pure &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; alkenyl boronates. Further functional group transformations demonstrated the utility of the prepared compounds as valuable building blocks for synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Based on the obtained results and the literature data, a plausible reaction mechanism was proposed involving the formation of radical and organocopper intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>First Bromide&#8208;Catalyzed Selenylation of 2&#8208;Alkyn&#8208;1&#8208;One O&#8208;Methyloximes Enabled the Synthesis of 4&#8208;Selenylated Isoxazoles</title>

Abstract
A series of 3,5&#8208;diaryl&#8208;4&#8208;selanylisoxazoles were synthesized in 56&#8211;97% yields (most cases&gt;80% yield), which was first accomplished via bromide&#8208;catalyzed selenylation of 2&#8208;alkyn&#8208;1&#8208;one O&#8208;methyloximes using element Se and boronic acids as the selenyl source. Compared to traditional strategies, this method proceeded under simple catalytic system. Broad substrate scope, good functional group compatibility, metal&#8208;free conditions, and easy operation was showed in this protocol. Additionally, this method was easily amendable to gram&#8208;scale reaction and synthetic transformations. Furthermore, preliminary mechanistic experiments demonstrated that a radical pathway was possibly involved in this work.

Abstract
An iodine&#8208;catalyzed C3&#8208;arylation of indoles with cyclohexanones to selectively synthesize 2&#8208;(indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenols has been described. Mechanism studies indicate that the oxygen atom in 2&#8208;(indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenols is originally from DMSO. This cascade involving dehydration condensation, selective oxygenation, dehydrogenation, and aromatization was achieved in one pot under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Organoselenyl Quinolines through the Reduction of Alkynes Mediated by Electrophilic Organoselenium Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A methodology for the synthesis and functionalization of quinolines was developed. This approach involves the cyclization of 2&#8208;amino arylalkynyl ketones to 3&#8208;(organoselanyl)&#8208;4&#8208;iodoquinolines through a sequential reaction pathway. The process includes: (i) in&#8197;situ formation of an electrophilic organoselenyl species, (ii) activation of the alkyne&#8216;s carbon&#8208;carbon bond via a seleniranium ion intermediate, (iii) anti&#8208;nucleophilic attack of iodide on the activated triple bond, and (iv) subsequent condensation. The resulting 3&#8208;(organoselanyl)&#8208;4&#8208;iodoquinolines were demonstrated to be versatile substrates, efficiently undergoing Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling to produce 4&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;quinolines and Ullmann&#8208;type reactions to yield the corresponding sulfides. Furthermore, the 4&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;quinolines were readily converted into selenophene derivatives via halogen&#8208;promoted electrophilic cyclization, highlighting the broad applicability of the developed method.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Difluoroalkylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds with Trimethylsilyl Chloride as a Dual&#8208;Function Reagent</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a mild, operationally simple method for synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroketones through selective single defluorination of trifluoroketones and subsequent difluoroalkylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds at room temperature within a single step. By successfully difluoroalkylating unfunctionalized ethers and benzyl radical precursors, we demonstrated the broad applicability of this method. The mechanistic study supports that the success of the reaction is probably attributed to the dual roles of trimethylsilyl chloride under the photocatalyzed conditions: 1) fluoride anion scavenger; and 2) chlorine radical source which promote hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction.

         <title>Research Progress on Organocatalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Atropisomeric Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The burgeoning field of asymmetric catalysis has significantly advanced the construction of axially chiral compounds, recognized for their distinct three&#8208;dimensional structures that are relevant in drug discovery, catalyst design and material science. Particularly, the atropisomeric aldehydes, characterized by a chiral axis and the presence of an aldehyde functionality, are of increasing value and interest in chemistry&#8208;related domains, such as serving as privileged chiral catalysts for activation of amines. In recent years, elegant environmentally&#8208;friendly metal&#8208;free catalytic asymmetric methodologies based on de novo formation of (hetero)aromatic rings, dynamic kinetic resolution and desymmetrization have been established to build this fascinating class of atropisomers. In this review, we would like to highlight recent research progress on enantioselective synthesis of atropisomeric aldehydes by means of organocatalysis and biocatalysis, including their scopes, limitations, mechanisms, synthetic applications and provide some insights into future development.

Abstract
Owing to multiple reactive sites, such as an acidic &#945;&#8208;carbon and an isocyano group, isocyanide esters can successfully participate in the synthesis of various five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles through the cycloaddition reactions under metal&#8208;catalyzed systems. Considering the unique and versatile functionality of this synthon, in this review, we have highlighted silver and copper&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions of isocyanide esters over the last decade.

Abstract
A variety of structurally diverse spirocyclohexane oxindoles featuring a quaternary carbon centre have been successfully constructed through an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation of isatin&#8208;derived enals with &#945;&#8208;cyano&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methylenones. This domino process exhibits a wide substrate tolerance, operates under mild conditions, and yields products with high enantioselectivities.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Powder&#8208;Mediated Tandem Hydroamination Cyclization&#8208;Hydrocyanation of Alkyne&#8208;Tethered Ketoximes Toward Cyano&#8208;Substituted Cyclic Nitrones</title>

Abstract
A copper&#8208;powder&#8208;mediated tandem hydroamination cyclization&#8211;hydrocyanation of alkyne&#8208;tethered ketoximes is described by using TMSCN as a commercially available cyanating reagent. This methodology provides an alternative strategy for the synthesis of a series of structurally important cyano&#8208;substituted cyclic nitrones. The hydrocyanation process exhibits distinct regioselectivity depending on the substituent pattern of the alkyne moiety. Moreover, the synthesized products were shown to be capable of undergoing various derivatization reactions.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Acyl and Thiocyano Pyridylation of Alkenes with Aldehyde and NH4SCN</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
&#946;&#8208;pyridinyl ketones and &#946;&#8208;pyridinyl thiocyanates are commonly used as an essential organic synthesis intermediate and widely present in various drug molecules and bioactive molecules. Herein, a photoredox catalyzed acyl and thiocyano pyridylation of alkenes with aldehydes and NH4SCN via HAT and SET strategy respectively is described. This protocol employs more readily accessible aldehydes and NH4SCN as radical precursors under redox&#8208;neutral conditions. Moreover, high atom economy, simple and accessible starting materials, late&#8208;stage modification and wide substrate scope including primary, secondary alkyl aldehydes and aromatic aldehydes enable the potential application in the organic synthesis.

Abstract
An approach for the synthesis of quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diamines is reported using a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction of o&#8208;phenylenediamines and isocyanides. Various quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diamines could be obtained in 25%&#8211;95% yields at 100&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8197;h. The key to the success of this protocol involves the formation of two C&#8722;N and one C&#8722;C bonds via the double insertion of isocyanide.

         <title>Efficient Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Alkylation and Application in the Total Synthesis of Phallotoxins and Virotoxins</title>

Abstract
Asymmetric alkylation is one of the most important methods for synthesis of chiral unnatural &#945;&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;amino acids. Herein, we reported the asymmetric alkylation catalyzed by Cu/(4S,2R)&#8208;tBu&#8208;Phosferrox catalyst. This catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic performance in the asymmetric alkylation at catalyst loading as low as 1.0&#8197;mol %, giving the desired products with up to 95% yield and &gt;99% ee, which is the best result to date. Furthermore, this method was successfully applied to the scalable practical synthesis of unnatural amino acid 4,5&#8208;OH&#8208;Leu, which could be directly used in the total syntheses of phalloidin, phallacidin, other four phallotoxins and six virotoxins.

         <title>Decyanative Arylation via Radical Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Arenes, especially heteroarenes, are crucial structural motifs in organic chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, and materials science. The introduction of (hetero)aryl groups using readily available feedstocks to modify organic chemicals is a significant topic. Nitriles are ubiquitous and versatile building blocks in organic synthesis. This review summarizes recent advances in decyanative arylation via radical cross&#8208;coupling reactions. In these transformations, (hetero)aromatic nitriles undergo one&#8208;electron reduction to form persistent radical anion intermediates. Simultaneously, transient carbon centered radicals are generated through cleavage of C&#8722;H, C&#8722;C, C&#8722;X (where X=B, N, Si, S, Br) bonds through single electron transfer or hydrogen atom transfer processes. Finally, a radical&#8208;radical coupling reaction followed by CN elimination leads to the formation of aromatized products.

         <title>Manganese Promoted Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Phosphine Chlorides with Disulfides for the Synthesis of Thiophosphanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Herein we reported a manganese promoted reductive cross&#8208;coupling approach to construct P&#8722;S bond. This is a practical method for the synthesis of mono&#8208;thiophosphanes, bis&#8208;thiophosphanes and tri&#8208;thiophosphanes under mild conditions. The strategy featured a wide range of substrate scope including various disulfides and phosphine chlorides, constructing diverse sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds from inodorous and readily available starting materials. The employment of reductive conditions avoided the generation of phosphorothioates (PV) by&#8208;products. Ultimately, gram&#8208;scale synthesis and applications were explored. Extensive experiments indicated that the phosphine radical cascade process was involved in the catalytic cycle.

&lt;p&gt;Herein we reported a manganese promoted reductive cross-coupling approach to construct P&#8722;S bond. This is a practical method for the synthesis of mono-thiophosphanes, bis-thiophosphanes and tri-thiophosphanes under mild conditions. The strategy featured a wide range of substrate scope including various disulfides and phosphine chlorides, constructing diverse sulfur-containing organophosphorus compounds from inodorous and readily available starting materials. The employment of reductive conditions avoided the generation of phosphorothioates (P&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;) by-products. Ultimately, gram-scale synthesis and applications were explored.

Abstract
Herein, we report regiodivergent nucleophilic attack of Grignard reagents to 2&#8208;alkynyl aziridines. Under the catalysis of a Cu(I)&#8208;diphosphine complex, benzylic Grignard reagents add to the carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond of the aziridines to deliver &#945;&#8208;allenylamines in moderate to excellent yields; the direct addition of the Grignard reagents to the aziridines in the absence of catalyst provided homopropargylic amine derivatives. Both reactions could proceed in highly enantiospecific ways. Further synthetic manipulations of these products enable rapid access to diverse useful heterocyclic molecular scaffolds.

Abstract
Here, we present an innovative approach to achieve Minisci&#8208;type alkylation of cyclic N&#8208;ketimines, enabling access to a diverse range of valuable alkylated sulfonyl ketimines via iron hydride hydrogen atom transfer. More than 35 examples are shown with a wide range of substrates. Additionally, this system is easy to operate and can be efficiently scaled up. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the alkyl radical process involved and the air acts as the sole oxidant in this system.

         <title>Mechanochemical Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of In&#8208;Situ Generated Reformatsky Zn&#8208;Enolates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;arylations of carbonyl compounds have shown to be a useful strategy for the late&#8208;stage synthesis of &#945;&#8208;arylesters. However, the use of strong basic conditions and difficult handling necessary for the in&#8208;situ preparation of enolates is a major disadvantage. On the other hand, using Reformatsky zinc&#8208;enolates can overcome these challenges. Moreover, mechanochemical in&#8208;situ activation of zinc is even more beneficial. Herein, we report mechanochemical Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling between in&#8208;situ generated Reformatsky Zn&#8208;enolates and aryl halides. This operationally simple procedure affords &#945;&#8208;arylated esters or amides using an affordable catalytic system. Reactions were carried under air and ambient conditions using granulated zinc without the need for its pre&#8208;activation. Less reactive and commercially more affordable aryl bromides afforded the desired products in good to excellent yields in comparison to aryl iodides. The optimized conditions were applied in scale&#8208;up reaction and in the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;arylated esters, amides, and derivatives of natural products.

Abstract
A copper and DMAP relay&#8208;catalyzed strategy has been achieved for the modular synthesis of 2&#8208;alkoxy quinolines from a three&#8208;component coupling of terminal alkynes, anthranils, and alcohols. In this protocol, a novel quinoline pyridine salt is formed and serves as a key intermediate in the formation of 2&#8208;alkoxy quinolines. The reaction has a broad substrate scope of each reaction partners, affording diversified 2&#8208;alkoxy quinoline products in generally good yields.

         <title>Regioselective Hydrothiolation of Terminal Alkynes using Half&#8208;Sandwich Ni(ii) Catalysts bearing Bidentate NHC&#8208;Carboxylate Ligands</title>

Abstract
A half&#8208;sandwich nickel complex containing an NHC&#8208;carboxylate chelate ligand (i.&#8201;e., [Ni(&#951;5&#8208;Cp)(&#954;2&#8208;C,O&#8208;NHC)]) derived from the (S)&#8208;leucine has been identified for the selective hydrothiolation of terminal acetylenes toward challenging Markovnikov&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;vinyl thioethers, even with aryl alkynes. The activity and selectivity exhibited by the nickel complex are comparable, if not superior, to those of complexes of rhodium reported to be the best catalysts to date for the Markovnikov addition in the thiol&#8208;yne reaction. The experimental data are consistent with the participation of the coordinated carboxylate group in the catalytic reaction as an intermolecular acid&#8208;base co&#8208;catalyst, favoring the formation of nickel&#8208;thiolate intermediates.

The activity and selectivity exhibited by the nickel complex are comparable, if not superior, to those of complexes of rhodium reported to be the best catalysts to date for the Markovnikov addition in the thiol-yne reaction. The experimental data are consistent with the participation of the coordinated carboxylate group in the catalytic reaction as an intermolecular acid-base co-catalyst, favoring the formation of nickel-thiolate intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8209;Chloroindoles via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Chlorocyclization of Unmasked 2&#8209;Alkynylanilines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Described herein is the discovery of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed chlorocylization strategy for the synthesis of 3&#8209;chloroindoles tolerated with a wide range of functional groups in moderate to excellent yields. In this transformation, the solvent effect is so important that only THF presents the positive effect. Furthermore, the present method provides an essay access to the N&#8208;unprotected 3&#8208;chloroindoles. A mechanism study showed that 2&#8208;alkynlanilines were catalyzed by palladium to from corresponding indoles, followed by copper&#8208;mediated oxidation chlorination to deliver the 3&#8208;chloroindoles products.</dc:description>

A mechanism study showed that 2-alkynlanilines were catalyzed by palladium to from corresponding indoles, followed by copper-mediated oxidation chlorination to deliver the 3-chloroindoles products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Raney Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Deuterium Labeling of Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Heterocycles and Pharmaceuticals under Continuous Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deuterium&#8208;labeled compounds play a pivotal role in physical organic chemistry, life sciences, and materials science. This has resulted in a surge of interest in deuterium&#8208;labeled active pharmaceutical ingredients in recent years. In this study, we present a continuous flow Raney nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange process that boasts compatibility with a wide spectrum of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles and pharmaceutical compounds. The broad applicability of the developed method was demonstrated through successful labeling of various purine bases, imidazoles, pyridines, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including complex structures like abacavir and remdesivir. Control experiments revealed Raney nickel's crucial role in the exchange process, showcasing the superiority of the continuous flow approach over batch reactions. Furthermore, a scaled&#8208;up experiment demonstrated the robustness of the catalyst.</dc:description>
