      <title>Recent Advancements on Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed, Chelation&#8208;Induced &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Hydroxylation of Arenes</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract: The phenols are key intermediates as well as desired products in many target oriented syntheses. The conversion of C&#8208;H bond to C&#8208;O bond is one of the most challenging tasks in organic synthesis. In last few decades, the hydroxylation of aromatic compounds has drawn a considerable attention because of their importance in Pharmaceutical industry, material chemistry, polymers and in agrochemicals. Indeed, transition metal catalysed coordination assisted regio&#8208; and chemoselective ortho&#8208;hydroxylation of arenes has become very efficient and popular strategy to obtain good yields of phenols with tolerance of a wide range of functional groups. This review is the comprehensive summary of recent advancement on Pd, Ru, Rh, Cu and Ir catalyzed chelation controlled regioselective ortho&#8208;C&#8208;H bond hydroxylation of aromatic compounds in presence of diverse hydroxylating agents. The Review has been classified on the sources of hydroxylating agents used in reaction.

      <title>Emerging Nickel Catalysis in Heck Reactions: Recent Developments</title>
      <dc:description>The synthetic application of nickel catalysts in Heck&#8208;coupling reaction is quite prominent and noticeable of late in organic synthesis. It shows great interest over the other transition metal catalysts due to its unique characteristic that prepares them more significantly applicable in different fields of synthetic application. The usefulness of nickel&#8208;catalysts relies in the fact that they are abundant in nature, relatively less precious and environment friendly. Nickel plays pivotal role in different kind of Heck reactions known such as intramolecular&#8208;, intermolecular&#8208;, reductive&#8208;Heck type reaction producing mainly carbocycles and hetero cycles of biological significance. Carbocyclization or hetero&#8208;cyclization reaction occurred under optimized reaction conditions developed and come up with the formation of various structural building blocks of naturally occurring compounds. Via reductive Heck cyclization large membered ring of carbo&#8208; or hetero&#8208;cyclic system was formed which performed key role as building blocks in pharmaceutical synthesis and bioactive molecule formation. Intermolecular Heck type reactions were comparatively more explored. Silyl&#8208;Heck, carbonyl&#8208;Heck, and other miscellaneous type reactions were covered up through nickel&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular Heck reaction. Asymmetric versions of Heck&#8208; coupling reactions are also reported to proceed even with unactivated alkenes, offering molecules having quaternary stereogenic center in a regio&#8208; and enantioselective manner. This manuscript intends to cover these entire concepts.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Abstract. A catalytic asymmetric C3&#8208;indolylation of N&#8208;protected spiro&#8208;epoxyoxindoles has been developed for the access of 3&#8208;(3&#8208;indolyl)&#8208;oxindole methanols with excellent enantioselectivity (ee up to &gt;99%).

      <title>Recent Advances in Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Fluorinated &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
      <dc:description>Enantioenriched fluorinated &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;amino acids are often encountered in numerous pharmaceuticals and bioactive molecules, and also of great importance as probes in PET and NMR for studying the behavior of enzymes and for incorporation into peptides and drug candidates.

      <title>Recent Advances in Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Annulations to Benzazepines and Benzodiazepines</title>
      <dc:description>Benzazepines and benzodiazepines, benzofused seven&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles, compose an important family of natural products and pharmaceuticals. Although certainly important and effectives, classical synthetic methods of these cyclic compounds involve methodologies that often require multistep procedures, with generation of waste materials and lack of sustainability.

      <title>Propargylic Alcohols as Coupling Partners in Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Arene C&#8208;H Activation</title>
      <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed site selective arene C&#8208;H bond activation concomitant functionalization with various coupling partners gain magnificent attraction in synthetic organic chemistry as complementary to traditional transformations. Mechanistically, these C&#8208;H functionalization approaches involve directing group assisted concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation (CMD), migratory insertion, and reductive elimination sequences. In this realm, diverse categories of coupling partners were employed as C&#8208;H functionalization buddies. Particularly alkynes gain enormous  attention as annulating agents. These units coordinates with metalcycle through &#7467;&#8208;interaction produce annulation outcomes in a straightforward manner.
Very recently, propargylic alcohols were appointed as valuable archetypes in arene C&#8208;H activation armoury, as they have shown regio&#8208; and chemoselective migratory insertion into primary metalcycle species via hydroxy chelation. The influential regioselectivity was drawn by dual coordination of metal complexes with the pendent directing group and a propargylic hydroxyl group. In this review, we focused on annulations and functionalization of arenes and propargylic alcohols, which afford intricate cycles as well as complex acyclic motifs in a trouble&#8208;free manner. We categorized these transformations based on number of atoms  of propargylic alcohols involved in annulation along with some addition reactions. We anticipate to pave a way towards enhanced endeavours for discovering novel reaction avenues.</dc:description>

      <title>Ynamides in Free Radical Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. In this review we present the transformations that have been developed with ynamides and free radicals. These reactions involve carbon&#8208;, heteroatom&#8208; or even metalloid&#8208;centered radicals and include inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;molecular reactions. The scope and mechanism of these transformations	are discussed in details, including the most recent examples relying on photoredox catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Semi&#8208;Synthetic Sialic Acid Probes for Challenging the Substrate Promiscuity of Enzymes in the Sialoconjugation Pathway</title>
      <dc:description>A series of unusual sialic acid analogs were prepared using an unprecedented semi&#8208;synthetic strategy. Truncation of natural N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid was followed by diastereoselective carbon backbone reconstruction using Barbier&#8208;type carboligations as well as different functional group interconversions, which provided access to a variety of functional motifs in the terminal carbon backbone, including examples of saturated and unsaturated, linear and branched alkyl chains, partially deoxygenated sialic acids, sialic diacids and a first truncated legionaminic acid analog. The synthetic sialic acid probes were studied for nucleotide activation by the CMP&#8208;sialic acid synthetase from Neisseria meningitidis using a universal pH&#8208;shift assay for kinetic analysis. One&#8208;pot enzymatic nucleotide activation and sialyltransfer to lactose was performed using a selection of five probes together with an engineered &#945;2,3&#8208;sialyltransferase from Photobacterium phosphoreum to furnish five new&#8208;to&#8208;nature analogs of the GM3 trisaccharide, which were finally utilized to test the substrate tolerance of two bacterial sialidases. The obtained set of sialic acid analogs and neo&#8208;sialocojugates provides interesting opportunities for further glycobiology studies.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>As a kind of readily available and stable difluorocyclopropanol precursors, the synthetic application of siloxydifluorocyclopropanes is desired. Herein, we report a catalytic defluorinative ring&#8208;opening indolylation of siloxydifluorocyclopropanes at first. It was found that AgBF4&#8208;catalyzed reaction of siloxydifluorocyclopropanes 1 with indoles 2 could be controlled to deliver &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;indolyl&#8208;propanones 3 within 1.5 hours at room temperature. The unique structural characters of products 3 encouraged us to further design a new route to carbazoles. Thus, the annulation of these &#945;&#8208;fluoroketone derivatives 3 were carried out in the presence of trifluoroacetic anhydride in toluene at room temperature.

      <title>Photocatalytical and Photochemical Generation of Imidoyl Radicals: Synthetic Applications
</title>
      <dc:description>In the last few decades, the development in the field of radical chemistry has gained great attention. The majority of these radical strategies mainly depend on the in situ generation of reactive radical species by employing radical initiators such as oxidants and metal salts or methods such as photocatalysis and electrochemistry etc. This review covers the literature on the generation of imidoyl radicals using photoredox catalysis. In the majority of the reactions, the spontaneity of the underlying SET transitions is correlated by the compiled redox potential data of the reacting species for a better understanding of the readers. Besides, the applications of these reactive imidoyl radicals to access a variety of heterocycles such as benzothiazoles, indoles, quinoxalines, phenanthridines, isoquinolines, pyridines, and amides are also addressed.</dc:description>

      <title>NAD(P)H&#8208;Dependent Enzymes for Reductive Amination: Active Site Description and Carbonyl&#8208;Containing Compound Spectrum</title>
      <dc:description>The biocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of amines from carbonyl compounds and amine precursors presents an important advance in sustainable synthetic chemistry. Oxidoreductases (ORs) that catalyze the NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent reductive amination of carbonyl compounds directly to amines using amine donors present advantages complementary to those of amine transaminases (ATAs) with respect to selectivity, stability and substrate scope. Indeed some ORs accept alkyl and aryl amines as reaction partners enabling access to chiral secondary amine products that are not directly accessible using ATAs. Moreover, superior atom economy can usually be achieved as no sacrificial amines are required as with ATAs. In recent years a number of ORs that apparently catalyze both imine formation and imine reduction in the reductive amination of carbonyls has been identified using structure informed protein engineering, sequence analysis from natural biodiversity and increasingly a mixture of both. In this review we summarize the development of such enzymes from the engineering of amino acid dehydrogenases (AADHs) and opine dehydrogenases (OpDHs) to become amine dehydrogenases (AmDHs), which are active toward ketones devoid of any requisite carboxylate and/or amine functions, through to the discovery of native AmDHs and reductive aminases (RedAms), and the engineering of all of these scaffolds for improved or altered activity. Structural and mechanistic studies have revealed similarities, but also differences in the determinants of substrate binding and mechanism in the enzymes.  The survey reveals that a complementary approach to enzyme discovery that utilizes both natural genetic resources and engineering can be combined to deliver biocatalysts that have significant potential for the industrial synthesis of chiral amines.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Developments in the Polychloroalkylation by Use of Simple Alkyl Chlorides</title>
      <dc:description>Owing to their easy availability and cheapness, simple alkyl chlorides are good raw materials for introducing complex polychlorinated groups. Polychlorinated hydrocarbons units, such as di&#8208; or trichloromethyl groups, not only widely found in pesticide and bioactive molecule, but also can be as a precursor to converted into different functional groups such as &#8208;COOH, &#8208;CHO and &#8208;CO. The direct polychloroalkylation reaction by using simple alkyl chlrides has been considered to be an important tool for synthesizing complex polychlorinated compounds. This review summarizes recent developments, especially free radical strategies, in the polychloroalkylation of different substrates (such as 2&#8208;acylpyridines, benzyl tertiary amines, alkenes, imine and 1,n&#8208;enynes ). We hope that this review provides a new perspective on this field and also provides a reference to develop environmentally friendly and sustainable methods.</dc:description>

      <title>Iron catalyzed intermolecular functionalization of non&#8208;activated aliphatic C&#8208;H bonds via carbene transfer</title>
      <dc:description>The modification of strong Csp3&#8208;H bonds via iron carbene intermediates under mild reaction conditions has been an important challenge with attractive prospective in organic synthesis. In this work, we show the efficient combination of an electrophilic iron catalyst with a lithium Lewis acid for the functionalization of strong Csp3&#8208;H bonds of cyclic and linear alkanes by the activation of commercially available ethyl diazoacetate (EDA). The reaction proceeds with good yields, under mild reaction conditions (40&#186;C) and large excess of substrate is not needed. In addition, excellent activity is observed in the cyclopropanation of challenging aliphatic olefins.</dc:description>

The electrophilic dichlorocyanomethyl radical, which is generated from readily available trichloroacetonitrile via a copper&#8208;catalyzed single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process, undergoes radical addition with the electron&#8208;deficient C=C bonds of N&#8208;arylacrylamides, followed by intramolecular cyclization, to provide dichlorocyanomethyl&#8208;functionalized oxindoles.

      <dc:description>A process for the de novo synthesis of imino&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides is described. The methodology is based on the reaction of 1&#8208;C&#8208;stannylated iminosugars with various electrophiles under the conditions of Migita&#8211;Kosugi&#8211;Stille cross&#8208;couplings, which gives 1&#8208;C&#8208;substituted iminosugar derivatives in a stereoretentive process. The required iminoglycosyl stannanes are obtained by way of the highly stereoselective addition of tributylstannyllithium to (SR)&#8208; or (SS)&#8208;N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl glycosylamines, followed by an activation cyclization sequence.	Most interestingly, the methodology is tunable: the configuration of the tin adduct is controlled exclusively by the tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl auxiliary, thus giving access after ring formation to &#8216;&#945;&#8217;&#8208;configured or &#8216;&#946;&#8217;&#8208;configured iminoglycosyl stannanes.

      <title>Zinc/Indium Lewis Acid Relay Catalysis for Constructing 1,1&#8208;Disilylalkenes</title>
      <dc:description>
The front cover picture, designed by Tsuchimoto and Tani, illustrates the world of the relay reaction catalyzed by zinc and indium Lewis acids. Firstly, ZnX2, assisted by a pyridine base cocatalyst, catalyzes dehydrogenative silylation reaction of terminal alkynes with bis(hydrosilane)s. The intermediate formed in situ is relayed to InX3, which continuously catalyzes intramolecular hydrosilylation reaction to deliver 1,1&#8208;disilylalkenes [X=N(SO2CF3)2 or Br]. This is the first relay catalysis achieved by the zinc and indium pair. Details of this work can be found in the full paper on pages xxxx&#8211;xxxx (T. Tani, Y. Sohma, T. Tsuchimoto, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2020, 362, xxxx&#8211;xxxx; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202000501).

In 1&#8208;3 the benzhydryl ligands are linked with the metal centres in &#951;4&#8208;coordination mode. For diamagnetic complexes 1 and 3 a fluxional behaviour was detected in solution. Complexes 1&#8722;3 proved to be thermally stable: no decomposition was observed even after heating their solutions in toluene&#8208;d8 at 140 &#176;C during 72 h. The reactions of 1 and 2 with B(C6F5)3 allowed for the synthesis of base&#8208;free cationic complexes [(p&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4)2CH]2Ln[(p&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4)2CHB(C6F5)3] (Ln = La (4), Nd (5)) which adopt the structure of a contact ion pair.

These catalysts enable highly challenging transformations such as hydrobenzylation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted and internal C=C bonds.</dc:description>

      <title>Disulfide promoted C&#8208;P bond cleavage of phosphoramide: novel &#8220;P&#8221; surrogates to synthesize phosphonates and phosphinates</title>
      <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free C&#8208;P bond cleavage reaction is described herein. Phosphoramides, a phosphine source, can react with alcohols to produce phosphonate and phosphinate derivatives in the presence of a disulfide. P&#8208;H2, P&#8208;alkyl, and P,P&#8208;dialkyl phosphoramides can be used as substrates to obtain the corresponding pentavalent phosphine products.</dc:description>

      <title>A Strategy for Accessing Aldehydes via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;O/C&#8208;N Bond Cleavage in the Presence of Hydrosilanes</title>
      <dc:description>We report the catalytic reduction of both active esters and amides by selective C(acyl)&#8211;X (X = O, N) cleavage to access aldehyde functionality via a palladium&#8208;catalyzed strategy. Reactions are promoted by hydrosilanes as reducing reagents with good to excellent yields and with excellent chemoselectivity for C(acyl)&#8211;N and C(acyl)&#8211;O bond cleavage. Carboxylic acid C(acyl)&#8211;O bonds are activated by 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;4,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (CDMT) to form triazine ester intermediates, which further react with hydrosilanes to yield aldehydes in one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step procedures. We demonstrate that C(acyl)&#8211;O cleavage/formylation offers higher yields and broader substrate scopes compared with C(acyl)&#8211;N cleavage under the same reaction conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrochemical Nonacidic N&#8208;Nitrosation/N&#8208;Nitration of Secondary Amines through a Biradical Coupling Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
The front cover picture, designed by Peng&#8208;Cheng Wang and co&#8208;workers, illustrates the electrochemical N&#8208;nitrosation/N&#8208;nitration of cyclic aliphatic amines and N&#8208;heteroaromatic compounds, respectively, under acid&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. The electrocatalysis method enables the preferential activation of the N&#8208;H bond and shows high selectivity for specific N atoms. It exhibits a broad scope and provides a green and straightforward approach to generate useful N&#8208;nitroso/nitro compounds in good yields. Details of this work can be found in the full paper on pages XXXX&#8211;YYYY (J.&#8208;P. Zhao, L.&#8208;j. Ding, P.&#8208;C. Wang, Y. Liu, M.&#8208;J. Huang, X.&#8208;L. Zhou, M. Lu, Adv. Synth.
