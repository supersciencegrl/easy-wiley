         <title>Organocatalytic regioselective aldol reaction of hydroxyacetone with aliphatic aldehydes for the synthesis of linear products</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present an organocatalyst that addresses the reactivity issue of aliphatic aldehydes with hydroxyacetone, leading to the formation of a linear product. Previous proline&#8208;based catalysts required a significant excess of hydroxyacetone and could only be applied to aromatic aldehydes. The proposed sulphonamide containing a proline moiety effectively controls the reaction, generating a new stereogenic center dependent on the catalyst's configuration and does not require a large excess of the ketone. We demonstrated that this methodology can be effectively utilized in the synthesis of natural compounds, as confirmed by obtaining the 2&#8208;keto&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;gluconic acid (KDG) methyl ester from optically pure glyceraldehyde and protected hydroxyacetone.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of indoles with a trifluoromethyl group has attracted a lot of attention because they are promising structural subunits for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. As part of our project aimed toward the upcycling of hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), we developed a
method to construct a CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;bearing indole ring system through the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of a brominated HFO&#8208;1234ze(&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;) (CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH=CHF) with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;tosylated &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;borylanilines, followed by nucleophilic 5&#8208;&lt;i&gt;endo&#8208;trig&lt;/i&gt; cyclization at the vinylic position of the generated fluorostyrenes. We found that the Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(dba)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SPhos catalyst system in the presence of K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and water in toluene afforded the corresponding 3&#8208;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;indoles in high yields in a one&#8208;pot operation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;aminopyridine derivatives via a tandem CuAAC/ring&#8208;cleavage/[4 + 2]&#8208;cycloaddition/rearrangement reaction sequence</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2H&#8208;Azirines are an important class of small&#8208;ring heterocycle that have been employed as versatile synthetic building blocks. Herein, a one&#8208;pot CuAAC/ring&#8208;cleavage/[4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/rearrangement reaction sequence involving terminal ynones, sulfonyl azides and 2H&#8208;azirines is reported that leads to 2&#8208;aminopyridine derivatives. In the first step, highly reactive N&#8208;sulfonyl &#945;&#8208;acylketenimines are generated, via a CuAAC/ring&#8208;cleavage process, from sulfonyl azides and terminal ynones and these undergo inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8722;Alder cycloaddition reactions with 2H&#8208;azirines to form (isolable) 1,3&#8208;oxazines that themselves undergo base&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;cleavage and rearrangement reactions to afford the title compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Benchmarking methanophosphocines as versatile PIII/PV redox organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PIII/PV redox cycling has recently emerged as a valuable strategy to minimized the chemical waste generated by phosphine&#8208;mediated reaction, as well as enabling asymetric transformation. In this article, we detail our contribution to this field by designing a series of diversely functionalized, electron&#8208;rich bridgehead phosphine oxides with structural features that make them well&#8208;suited for PIII/PV redox organocatalysis. Their catalytic performance has been assessed in various model reactions, including Wittig or Staudinger reactions, along with the reduction of activated alkenes and allenes. For each of these scenarios, we performed a comparative analysis with existing catalysts in order to demonstrate the applicability and limitation of methanophosphocines.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Aerobic Dearomatization of Naphthylamines under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The dearomatization of aromatic substrates via photocatalytic methodologies has gained escalating prominence to access molecular complexity. Although much focus has been put on non&#8208;active arenes, naphthols and N&#8208;based heteroaromatics, arylamines have so far remained in the background. Herein, we report a photocatalytic strategy for the aerobic, dearomative hydroxylation of naphthylamines under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Our investigation highlights singlet oxygen generation as a viable mechanism for aromaticity disruption, mitigating selectivity issues deriving from the direct oxidation of targeted arylamines. Finally, we showcased the synthetic value of the obtained dearomatized products in a late&#8208;stage diversification campaign.

         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, external photocatalyst&#8208;free, site&#8208;selective C&#8208;H arylation of 4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones and various 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes has been developed to provide ortho arylated products  41&#8208; 95% yield at room temperature. A mechanistic study using controlled experiments, UV&#8208;visible study, DFT study, and observation of colored aggregates suggest that in situ generated Ag&#8208;palladacycle complex of 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes is responsible for absorbing the visible light and generating aryl radicals from aryldiazonium salts. Further, this methodology demonstrates its versatility by transforming various 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes, including 2&#8208;phenylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;one, 3&#8208;phenylquinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one, 2&#8208;phenylpyridines, pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines, 2&#8208;phenylquinolines, 2&#8208;phenylisoquinolines, and 2&#8208;phenylbenzo[d]thiazoles, into their respective regio&#8208;selective C&#8208;H arylated products under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component allylic alkylation reaction of &#945;&#8208;diazo ketones, water and allyl carbonate under the cooperative catalysis of Rh2(OAc)4, Pd2(dba)3 and Br&#248;nster acid was disclosed. This method provids an expeditious access to &#945;&#8208;keto homoallylic alcohols in good to high yields. Controlled experiments support that the transformations proceed through cross&#8208;interception of two active intermediates Pd&#8208;allyl species and enol intermediates derived from oxonium ylides. Moreover, synthetic transformations of the generated products enable the creation of motifs enriched with dense functional groups, underscoring their potential as valuable building blocks.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A photoinduced palladium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydroarylation of furans to form functionalized indenes was achieved via an intramolecular reductive coupling of aryl bromide with furan using silane as the reductant.

This fluorinated byproduct is inert in the reaction conditions, and no other is expected because the Ar and X groups are the same in the catalyst, the intermediates and  the products. The application of &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; in catalysis (&lt;i&gt;e.g.&lt;/i&gt; with 1% catalyst ratio) consists of a first step (formation of 1% tailor&#8208;made catalyst) where 100 ArX + 1 &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; (or &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;) + 1 L in THF gives a solution with 99 ArX + 1 [Pd(Ar)(X)(L)] + (Ar&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The only other byproduct is THF or NCMe. In the second step,  addition of the nucleophile, 100 Q(Nu), triggers and completes the catalytic cycle yielding 100 Ar&#8208;Nu + 100 Q(Br) + 1 [Pd0(L)]. The 100% yield is theoretical, but the tested catalysis (Ar&#8211;Me Negishi coupling, C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;alkynyl Stille coupling and Ar&#8208;naphthyl Suzuki coupling) using &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; as precursor, SPhos as ligand, and 1000:1 reagents:catalyst ratio, afford 95&#8208;99% yield. In contrast, aryl&#8208;amination requires 1000:5 ratio to give 96% yield (or 1000:50 for 99% yield) because PhNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; eventually blocks the catalyst. As a bonus, the presence of F in the precursors facilitates stepwise &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR monitoring of formation of the [Pd(Ar)(X)(L)] catalyst with different phosphines, facilitating analysis of weaknesses or strengths of each of them to produce the catalyst, and helps in the choice of the most convenient one for the case. The &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;  catalyst formation is ideal for serial two&#8208;step catalysis with different phosphines or different nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Orthogonal and Chemocontrolled Synthesis of [4&#8208;7&#8208;6] Tricycles from 1,5&#8208;Diynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a one&#8208;pot cascade sequence catalyzed by gold starting from 1,5&#8208;diynes and a zwitterion (source of Tf2C=CH2), which allows the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective preparation of cyclobutene&#8208;fused [4&#8208;7&#8208;6] tricycles and displays orthogonal reactivity of the 1,5&#8208;diyne system, zwitterion and metal catalyst. Moreover, the obtained tricyclic bis(triflyl)cyclobutenes [triflyl = (trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl] can be easily converted into more complex structures such as bridged ketal and fused 1,3&#8208;oxazine tetracyclic systems, demonstrating the potential of our protocol.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A copper&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;induced annulation&#8208;halocyanomethylation of indole&#8208;linked 1,6&#8208;enynes has been established using haloacetonitrile as radical precursors, enabling the synthesis of 21 cyanomethylated pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles with yields ranging from 42% to 81% and a Z/E ratio exceeding 19:1. Moreover, by adjusting the reaction temperature, a variation of the annulation&#8208;bromobicyanomethylation process was achieved, resulting in the production of 12 bicyanomethylated pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indole isomers in the yields of 41&#8208;68%. The stereoisomeric mixture of bicyanomethylated products could be purified to their pure configurations through recrystallization. The proposed reaction mechanism was formulated through a series of controlled experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization Using Chlorine Radicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Converting any desired C&#8722;H bond to the intended C&#8722;Z bond in a given organic molecule could be the final peak of the C&#8722;H functionalization methodology. Among the three types of C&#8722;H bonds, the functionalization of the ubiquitous C(sp3)&#8722;H bond has gained particular attention, especially in the last two decades. There are different ways to transform C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds into desired C&#8722;Z bonds. The use of chlorine radicals is one of these methods with a promising future. The literature review shows that different sources have been used for chlorine, including chloride ions (HCl or chloride salts), coordinated chlorides (transition metal complexes), and organic chlorides (organochlorine compounds). However, HCl and FeCl3 have gained the most attention among these sources. There are three major ways to convert chlorine from these sources to chlorine radicals: 1) oxidation of hydrogen chloride or chloride salts, 2) photolysis of metal chloride, and 3) transition metal insertion into C&#8722;Cl bonds. This review summarizes published research papers on the use of chlorine radicals for C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds functionalization. Therefore, chlorination reactions of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and reactions in which chlorine radicals do not play a direct role in C(sp3)&#8722;H bond cleavage are not within the scope of this review.

         <title>Endogenous Group&#8208;Directed Late&#8208;Stage C&#8722;H Functionalization of Peptides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Peptides are diverse in terms of their functional groups and side&#8208;chain functionalities, and late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization plays a crucial role in their design. Approaches for such synthesis require pre&#8208;installation and post&#8208;removal of the directing group (DG). In recent times, chemical methods have been developed, focusing on the external DG&#8208;free C&#8722;H functionalization of peptides. These approaches utilize the inherent native functionality of peptides as DG to simplify synthetic routes, reducing synthetic steps, waste generation, enhancing sustainability, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and operational flexibility. Such approaches facilitate late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization of both natural and unnatural amino acid&#8208;containing peptides.

Abstract
A catalyst&#8208;free electrochemical alkylacetoxylation reaction of terminal alkynes with (thio)xanthenes and carboxylic acids is developed. Treating the addition products with K2CO3 as a base in methanol affords the ketones in moderate to good yields. Preliminary experimental and computational studies indicate that the benzylic cation generated from the (thio)xanthenes triggers the electrophilic addition to alkynes.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of Multisubstituted Fluoropyrazoles via Silver&#8208;Catalyzed One&#8208;Pot Cyclization Reaction of Diazo Reagents with Fluoronitroalkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A silver&#8208;catalyzed regioselective one&#8208;pot cyclization reaction of diazo reagents with fluoronitroalkenes was developed. This transformation presents a method for accessing a series of 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;fluoropyrazoles that are substituted with various groups such as trifluoromethyl, carboxylic ester, nitrile, and phosphonate ester. Further synthetic transformations offered the corresponding fluorinated and trifluoromethylated analogues of two fungicide compounds.

This transformation presents a method for accessing a series of 4-aryl-3-fluoropyrazoles that are substituted with various groups such as trifluoromethyl, carboxylic ester, nitrile, and phosphonate ester. Further synthetic transformations offered the corresponding fluorinated and trifluoromethylated analogues of two fungicide compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On&#8208;off Pulsed Ultrasound Promote Asymmetric Noncovalent Organocatalysis &#8220;on Water&#8221;: An Investigation in Michael Addition and Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>

Abstract
Pulsed ultrasonic irradiation with on&#8208;off modulation remarkably enhances asymmetric noncovalent organocatalysis &#8220;on water&#8221;, specifically for Michael addition and Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. This approach effectively addresses challenges associated with solid reactant dispersion encountered in &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221; reactions and mitigates overheating issues caused by continuous ultrasound exposure, thereby significantly augmenting reaction rates and stereoselectivities.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aminothiophenes by Au(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Reaction Including Hydrothiolation, Thio&#8208;Claisen Rearrangement, and Cycloisomerization</title>

Abstract
The cascade reaction of ynamides with propargyl thiols by Au(I) catalysis involving regioselective hydrothiolation, thio&#8208;Claisen rearrangement, and cycloisomerization to generate 2&#8208;aminothiophenes in a one&#8208;pot manner is described. In this reaction, the selection of reaction temperature is crucial, with the initial step, namely hydrothiolation, conducted at a low temperature (40&#8201;&#176;C), followed by the subsequent reaction requiring an increase in temperature (&gt;110&#8201;&#176;C). Furthermore, it was revealed that multi&#8208;substituted anilines could be synthesized from the resulting 2&#8208;aminothiophenes.

         <title>Synthesis of Sulfonyl&#8208;Containing spiro[5,5]trienones from Sodium Metabisulfite</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An efficient three&#8208;component reaction of biaryl ynones, sodium metabisulfite and aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates is developed. The reaction occurs at room temperature without any additives, thus offering a sustainable approach to access sulfonyl&#8208;containing spiro[5,5]trienones. This protocol features mild conditions, broad substrate scope and high functional group compatibility, furnishing the target products in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction undergoes a 6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig dearomative spirocyclization process which is initated by an aryl radical with the insertion of sulfur dioxide.

Abstract
An Iridium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H cyclization of N&#8208;arylphthalazinones with &#945;&#8208;diazotized Meldrum's acid afforded tetracyclic phthalazine derivatives with a carbonyl group in 98% yield in only 30&#8197;min. The initial formation of tetracyclic phthalazine derivatives also provided access to a powerful building block. The utility of this method is emphasized by the synthetic transformation into a series of potentially bioactive derivatives.

Abstract
An intermolecular annulation reaction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;indandions with alkynes was reported using Pd(OAc)2 to access spirobi[indene]&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones. Under palladium catalysis, the substrates form a homocoupling dimer intermediate through a catalytic dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling process. The palladium(II) species could come from dimer or 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;indandion. Notably, this pathway is not typically observed in enol&#8208;directed formal sp3 C&#8722;H functionalization/oxidative annulation palladium chemistry. This transformation provides a route to access a class of functionalized spiro carbocyclic indenes.

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component reaction strategy for the selective synthesis of 5&#8208;trifluoromethyl pyrimidine derivatives has been established. This method avoids the inherent selectivity challenges in direct pyrimidine trifluoromethylation. The reaction demonstrates tolerance to various functional groups, yielding 5&#8208;trifluoromethyl pyrimidine derivatives with up to 80% yields. Moreover, the practicality of this method has been underscored through scale&#8208;up reactions.

         <title>Diradical Polar Reactivity Induced by Electricity&#8208;Mediated Ground State Triplet Nitrenium Species</title>

Abstract
It is extremely rare for reactive intermediates to possess a ground state triplet character. Excited state triplet intermediates are generally accessed by means of photon transfer from a tunable light source or by using any triplet sensitizers. N&#8208;acyl N&#8208;alkoxy nitreniums are an important class of reactive intermediates in the synthetic organic community due to their prolonged lifetime and ground&#8208;state singlet character. Herein, we report an external oxidant and toxic catalyst&#8208;free mild electrochemical protocol to access nitrenium reactive intermediate. Experimental findings of the mechanistic pathway suggested a theoretically predicted triplet reactive intermediate that is energetically favorable compared to the singlet pathway.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed [3+6+3+6] Macrocyclizations of Aryl &#945;&#8208;Diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Ketoesters</title>

Abstract
Thanks to Pd(II)&#8208;catalysis, an efficient synthesis of unsaturated macrocycles is achieved by [3+6+3+6] condensation of cyclic ethers with aryl &#945;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters. The presence of the electron&#8208;rich aryl ester moieties forbids the use of dirhodium complexes as these diazo decomposition catalysts provoke unforeseen intermolecular Csp2&#8722;H insertion reactions that derail the targeted reactivity. However, with Pd(acac)2, using high concentration conditions (1&#8197;M), a variety of 18&#8208;membered macrocycles (16 examples) is afforded with both aryl and alkyl diazo reagents. Catalyst selection for either electrophilic aromatic substitution (Rh) or ylide (Pd) pathways are explained by computational approaches.

         <dc:description>Vicinal halohydrins are key building blocks to produce bioactive molecules and drugs, especially if they can be obtained in enantiomerically pure form. In this study, we present a bi&#8208;enzymatic sequence that allows to obtain vic&#8208;halohydrins through a photochemoenzymatic olefin hydroxy halogenation followed by a lipase catalysed kinetic resolution. The absolute configuration of the resulting products was determined using Mosher&#8217;s method.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Classical methods for the synthesis of tertiary alcohols mainly rely on the nucleophilic addition of organometallic reagents to carbonyl compounds. Here, we disclose a strategy for synthesizing tertiary alcohols via electroreductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of aromatic carbonyl compounds and alkyl bromides (allyl, propargyl, benzyl and cyclohexyl bromides). This procedure features good substrate tolerance and friendly conditions (undivided cell, cheap and reusable carbon electrodes, reaction in open air, room temperature, without any external transition metal/activating reagent). Using this method, 32 desired products can be obtained with moderate to good yields, and gram&#8208;scale synthesis is feasible, demonstrating the practicality of this approach.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein reported, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced K2S2O8 mediated cascade reaction of 3&#8208;(2&#8208;isocyanoethyl)indoles with &#945;&#8208;oxocarboxylic acids leading to diastereoselective synthesis of polycyclic spiroindolines bearing an N&#8208;formyl unit derivative utilising the alkali metal salt K2S2O8 as a catalyst under mild reaction conditions. This study offers an illustration of &#945;&#8208;oxocarboxylic acids and 3&#8208;(2&#8208;isocyanoethyl)indoles&#8208;based reactions as it shows the involvement of glyoxolate ions without decarboxylation to access polycyclic spiroindoles bearing an N&#8208;formyl unit analogue. The batch process can be extended to a continuous flow system using a glass tube loaded with K2S2O8 placed between the PFA capillary reactor, which can greatly advance the reaction efficiency and can even be promoted to gram&#8208;scale synthesis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed thioesterifications of (aza)indole&#8208;tethered aryl iodides, Mo(CO)6, and sulfonyl chlorides are reported. A series of C2 thioester&#8208;group substituted indoline&#8208;fused ring compounds are efficiently constructed using intramolecular Heck&#8208;cyclization and carbonylation chemistry involving N&#8208;(2&#8208;iodobenzoyl)indole. The salient features of this three&#8208;component cascade sequence include the use of solid Mo(CO)6 as the carbon monoxide source and good functional group tolerance.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted strategy for the decarboxylative C&#8208;3 carbamoylation of quinoxalinone scaffolds is developed. This approach initiates through the formation of an EDA complex between oxamic acid and quinoxalinone. Successive SET and decarboxylative carbamoylation construct the C&#8210;C bond. This method utilizes aerial oxygen as the green oxidant and eradicates the process from the use of external photocatalysts and transition metals. Detailed synthetic and photophysical studies enlighten the reaction pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to &#946;&#8208;Lactam Sulfonamides from Sulfamoyl Chlorides via Photoredox Catalyzed C&#8211;S Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfonyl chlorides are a synthetically attractive source of sulfonyl radicals in photoredox catalysis and are useful precursors in the synthesis of sulfones. Sulfamoyl chlorides, on the other hand, remain poorly represented despite their similar potential. In this study, N&#8209;chlorosulfonylated &#946;&#8208;lactams were prepared from readily available precursors and utilized in an atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction with a variety of olefins, producing &#946;&#8208;lactam sulfonamides in 49&#8211;95% yields. &#946;&#8208;Lactams fused to a dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;thiazine ring which closely resemble carbacephems, a widely used class of antibiotics, were also synthesized by an intra&#8208;molecular ATRA reaction. This methodology enables the preparation of &#946;&#8208;lactam sulfonamides, a class of compounds that are of great interest in pharmacology.</dc:description>

Abstract
An array of cyanopyridazine derivatives have been developed through a sequence of (3+3) cycloaddition/oxidative aromatization/derivatization steps. Investigation of the physicochemical properties of these compounds shows that four have interesting fluorescence properties and have the potential to be developed into bimodal photoredox catalysts. One has been confirmed to be an photoredox catalyst in the reactions of N&#8208;aryl&#8208; tetrahydroisoquinolines with phosphite, nitromethane, malonitrile and sodium thiocyanate, led to 22%&#8211;95% yields. The catalyst capabilities remain with recyclable using under the reaction conditions.

Abstract
An iodine/DMSO&#8208;promoted approach has been developed for the synthesis of indoloquinolines via a sequential sp3 C&#8722;H oxidation/intramolecular cyclization using 2&#8208;(1H&#8208;indol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)anilines and aryl methyl ketones. A wide range of aryl methyl ketones, including drugs and complex bioactive molecule&#8208;derived substrates were compatible in the present reaction with yields in the range of 30&#8211;96%. This protocol proceeds through sp3 C&#8722;H oxidation of aryl methyl ketones to phenylglyoxals, subsequent imine formation, and cyclization to furnish the indoloquinolines. Further, the reaction is applicable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis and is operationally simple.

Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed difunctionalization of olefins has attracted considerable attention as a method to construct carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;hetero bonds. Herein, the copper&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component radical cross&#8208;coupling of oxime esters, styrenes and AgSCF3 through a visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted iminyl radical&#8208;mediated carbon&#8208;carbon bond cleavage strategy has been described. Utilizing low&#8208;cost copper salt as both photosensitizers and cross&#8208;couplers, this protocol delivers diverse target products, providing a supplementary approach for cyanoalkylation and trifluoromethylthiolation of drug molecules.

Herein, the copper-catalyzed three-component radical cross-coupling of oxime esters, styrenes and AgSCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; through a visible-light-promoted iminyl radical-mediated carbon-carbon bond cleavage strategy has been described. Utilizing low-cost copper salt as both photosensitizers and cross-couplers, this protocol delivers diverse target products, providing a supplementary approach for cyanoalkylation and trifluoromethylthiolation of drug molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
2&#8208;Aminobenzyl cyanide was reacted with nitrobenzenesulfonyl chlorides and alkylated under Mitsunobu or Fukuyama conditions. The resulting intermediates were exposed to basic conditions, which triggered a Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement, leading to intramolecular C&#8208;arylation. This reaction was followed by spontaneous cycloaddition, which yielded 2&#8208;aminoindole derivatives. The developed synthetic route represents a metal&#8208;free approach for accessing 1&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;arylindoles. Furthermore, pyrimido[1,2&#8208;a]indoles and 7,8dihydrobenzo[6,7][1,3]diazepino[4,5&#8208;b]indoles were synthesized through the use of functionalized alcohols.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalysed C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation and Hydrogen Isotope Exchange via Nitrogen&#8208;Based Carbonyl Directing Groups</title>

Abstract
Growing interest in improved structural diversity within the pharmaceutical industry has led to a focus on more sp3&#8208;rich drug frameworks. Meanwhile, spiralling pharmaceutical research and development costs continue to require expedited adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity studies, which are heavily reliant on the use of molecules incorporating deuterium and tritium. Herein, we report an iridium catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H activation and hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) methodology capable of utilizing pharmaceutically ubiquitous nitrogen&#8208;based carbonyl directing groups. High levels of deuterium incorporation (&gt;80% in 37 of the examples) are demonstrated across a range of substrates (5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;membered lactams, cyclic carbamates and ureas, acyclic amides), with tolerance of a range of common functional groups (aryl, alkoxy, halogen, ester, alcohol, sulfonamide) and predictable regioselectivity. The applicability of this methodology was demonstrated with up to 98% deuterium incorporation observed in a range of challenging bioactive molecules such as Nefiracetam, Praziquantel, and Unifiram. Density functional theory has provided mechanistic insight into the C&#8722;H activation and HIE at both the expected site of incorporation and an unexpected aryl labelling via a 7&#8208;membered metallocyclic intermediate.

Abstract
We have developed an approach for the construction of naphthofuran&#8208;2&#8208;carboxaldehyde derivatives utilizing the synergy of electrochemical oxidation and organo&#8208;selenium catalysis at room temperature. The compatibility of various functional groups and scalability of this protocol demonstrate the practicality of the electrochemical strategy. The synthetic utility of this strategy is furthermore demonstrated by synthesizing diversified molecules through downstream transformations.

Abstract
The CPAPhosAuCl bifunctional complexes catalyse the enantioselective tandem cycloisomerization&#8208;nucleophilic addition reactions between 2&#8208;alkynylenones and naphthols, where naphthols behave mainly as O&#8208;nucleophiles. The inherent acidity of the catalysts induces then the isomerization of the O&#8208;addition&#8208; into the C&#8208;addition products with concomitant decrease of their enantiomeric excesses. In depth mechanistic studies have provided insights into these processes. Subsequently, the undesired racemization pathways could be suppressed by using substituted naphthols as nucleophiles, which delivered a large series of chiral bicyclic furanes in high enantioselectivities.

Abstract
A photochemical synthesis of biologically relevant benzyl oxindoles is presented via electron&#8208;donor acceptor (EDA) complex strategy. This exogenous photocatalyst&#8208;free method describes the formation of a new electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex based on potassium carbonate and thianthrenium salts for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation. This transition&#8208;metal free reaction allows a rapid increase in oxindoles molecular complexity chemical space, tolerating different functional groups as well as sophisticated biomolecules. The scalability and sustainability of this method is highlighted by an important waste recovery protocol. Mechanistic investigations support the formation of an EDA complex that induces a radical chain, and the applicability of this method is showcased by straightforward derivatization reactions.

Abstract
Peptidols were prepared through the reductive cleavage of benzotriazole intermediates obtained from the on&#8208;bead activation of 3,4&#8208;diaminobenzoyl linkers. Remarkably, this method used commercially available amino acid residues and resins without further modification. Pure peptidols were collected with only filtration in 49%&#8211;87% yield. Only the derivatives with aspartic acid as the first C&#8208;terminal residue required sophisticated chromatography purification. Esters and carboxylic acids were identified as side products and were suppressed by additional reduction or reduction in DMF. Remarkably, the reduction of peptides with the first aspartic acid residue at the C&#8208;terminal afforded a C&#8208;terminal lactone, which could be reduced by deprotection at 0&#8201;&#176;C. For the synthesis of branched peptidols, the bulky wedge structures of the branched peptides resulted in low total yields, which were improved to 23%&#8211;28% by using peripheral Boc groups and SPPS on the Tental gel resin. In addition, this method gave two peptaibols, SPF&#8208;5506&#8208;A4 and Ac&#8208;Gramicidin A, in 11% and 46% yields, respectively.

Abstract
An organocatalyzed three&#8208;component protocol using diazoacetonitrile to access a wide range of cyanopyrazole derivatives is reported here. This strategy, which proceeds through a piperidine&#8208;catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation/formal [3+2] cycloaddition/dehydrocyanation sequence, provides an efficient route to construct dicyanopyrazoles from aldehydes, malononitrile, and diazoacetonitrile regioselectively. Interestingly, by engaging cyanoacetate and cyanoacetamide in this protocol, we could achieve cyanopyrazole esters and carboxamides.

Abstract
A method for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuro[3,2&#8208;c]quinolines via TfOH or TMSOTf mediated condensation of 2&#8208;aminoaryl cyclopropyl ketones with aldehydes has been developed. The reaction proceeds under transition metal or halogen free conditions, giving access to the target molecules in 27&#8211;90% isolated yields. Mechanistic study indicates that the reaction sequence involves imine formation, intramolecular Mannich condensation, Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement, and auto&#8208;oxidation.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed two&#8208;fold annulation reaction of 2,6&#8208;dihalogenobiphenyls with o&#8208;chloroaromatic carboxylic acids has been developed. This method enables the synthesis of various dibenzo[fg,op]tetracenes and azadibenzo[fg,op]tetracenes. Preliminary investigations indicate that the resulting product, dimethyl 5,6,12,13&#8208;tetrakis(hexyloxy)dibenzo[fg,op]tetracene&#8208;2,9&#8208;dicarboxylate, demonstrates favorable liquid&#8208;crystalline properties.

Abstract
A palladium catalyst system based on PdCl2(PPh3)2 or PdCl2(dppf) is reported for Suzuki&#8208;type coupling of both N&#8208;aryl and alkyl benzotriazinones with aryl/alkenyl boronic acids to afford a series of ortho&#8208;aryl/alkenyl benzamides in yields up to 99%, showing improvements on catalytic efficiency, substrate scope and practicality. Scope and limitations of the improved protocol have been demonstrated with more than 40 examples, including a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of activated o&#8208;biphenyl amide. Large electronic and steric effects from the boronic acid counterpart have been observed, implying the transmetallation from boron to palladium should be involved in the rate&#8208;determining step in catalytic cycle.

The front cover picture, made by painter Monika Tomanov&#225; and reproduced with permission, illustrates that nitrobenzenesulfonamides prepared from 2&#8208;aminobenzyl cyanide and alkylated with various agents can be converted to N&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;nitroarylindoles. The reaction proceeds via base&#8208;catalyzed Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement leading to metal&#8208;free intramolecular C&#947;&#8208;arylation followed by spontaneous cyclization. The process is as simple as developing a black and white photo in a darkroom chamber. Details can be found in Research Article by Miroslav Soural and co&#8208;workers (K. Zakova, P. Kralova, M.

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of Chiral Heterocycles via Asymmetric Carbon&#8208;Heteroatom Bond Formation</title>

Abstract
Chiral heterocyclic compounds play a crucial role in the pharmaceutical science, materials science, and agrochemical industries. The critical step for synthesizing chiral heterocycles is the formation of asymmetric carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds, which can be achieved in a chiral environment under thermal or photochemical conditions. However, photochemical asymmetric transformation has become an area of immense growth in the past 15&#8197;years. In the drug discovery and development era, chiral photochemical transformations have drawn the attention of researchers to develop new synthetic strategies for chiral heterocycles via asymmetric carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond formation. Chiral photochemistry in the pathway of asymmetric synthesis requires a chirality source which is transferred to the products. A catalytic chiral metal complexing agent or a chiral photosensitizer that generally follows a single electron transfer (SET) or oxidative and reductive quenching cycle has been widely exploited to achieve this goal. In this review, we have demonstrated the recent development of photochemical synthesis of chiral heterocycles via asymmetric carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond formation by using a chiral metal catalyst, asymmetric organocatalyst, or dual catalytic system based on their plausible mechanism.

Abstract
This contribution offers a comprehensive overview of methods for forging sp C&#8722;Si bonds. Over time, alkynylsilanes (silylacetylenes), once considered mere byproducts of hydrosilylation processes, have become essential building blocks in organic synthesis. This literature review traces the evolution of their synthesis, from traditional methodologies relying on organolithium and organomagnesium compounds to more advanced cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving hydro&#8208; and carbosilanes. Focused primarily on the past 25&#8197;years (2000&#8211;2024), it also extensively references significant historical breakthroughs. By analyzing synthetic methodologies, the review not only offers a comprehensive survey of the current state of knowledge but also identifies areas for improvement. Furthermore, to emphasize the importance of 1&#8208;alkynylsilanes (1&#8208;silyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkynes), selected applications of these compounds are highlighted, confirming their significant potential in organic synthesis.

Abstract
This study reports the copper&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;indolmethylation of 2&#8208;pyridylacetates with 3&#8208;indoleacetic acids. This reaction offers an approach to generating alkylideneindolenine electrophiles via the oxidative decarboxylation of 3&#8208;indoleacetic acids. The developed reaction system demonstrates good versatility, extending beyond the indolmethylation of 2&#8208;pyridylacetates to include activated esters and nitroalkanes. Moreover, a biological evaluation revealed that several products exhibited antiproliferative activity against different cancer cell lines.

Abstract
n&#8208;Bu4NI/K2S2O8 mediated transformylation from p&#8208;anisaldehyde to primary amides is reported. The mechanistic studies suggest the reaction occurs via a single electron transfer pathway. Based on the DFT electronic structure calculations of various reaction pathways, the most plausible mechanism involves the formation of a phenyl radical cation and an arenium ion as the key intermediates. It represents the first example where p&#8208;anisaldehyde is employed as a formyl source via a non&#8208;metal mediated Csp2&#8722;Csp2 bond cleavage.

Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed conditions for diazidation or acetoxy/hydroxylation of N&#8208;allyl sulfonamides by using Pd(OAc)2 as the catalyst combined with Mn(OAc)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O have been developed. The 1,2&#8208;diazidation reaction of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond occurs in mild conditions (i.&#8201;e. NaN3 as azide source in THF at room temperature), whereas the 1,2&#8208;acetoxy/hydroxylation requires an excess of Mn(OAc)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O. The well&#8208;known ability of this reagent to act through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) makes plausible a radical mechanism involving high valent palladium complexes.

Abstract
An iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction, involving cyanoalkylsulfonylation and cyclization, has been devised to enable the synthesis of functionalized sulfonylated quinolino&#8208;quinazolinone alkyl nitriles. This three&#8208;component radical transformation exhibits excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity while functioning without the need for external oxidizing or reducing agents. The cost&#8208;effectiveness of this catalytic system, together with its broad substrate application, which includes drug molecule derivatives, make this approach efficient and adaptable.

Abstract
Two N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin&#8208;phosphines (NHOP), and the corresponding ruthenium complexes were synthesized and structurally characterized. One of the cationic complexes [(BzIM)(NHOP)Ru(p&#8208;cymene)Cl2]I was employed as a catalyst in N&#8208;benzylbenzamides/alkyne coupling reactions. With this catalytic protocol a variety of substituted isoquinolones were synthesized through ortho&#8208;selective double C&#8722;H bond functionalization involving oxidative annulation followed by olefination reactions. All these products were achieved in one&#8208;pot manner without the use of additives.

Abstract
A Mn&#8208;electrocatalytic ring&#8208;opening azidation of tert&#8208;cyclobutanols has been developed. The regioselective method is applicable for the azidation of a diverse array of cyclobutanols to provide practical &#947;&#8208;azido ketones in 23&#8211;91% yields under chemical oxidants&#8208;free reaction conditions. Detailed mechanistic studies suggest the process of Mn&#8208;mediated alkoxy radical generation followed by &#946;&#8208;scission to form carbon&#8208;centered radical species is possibly involved in this transformation.

Abstract
Complexes of borane with six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes derived from readily accessible 1,3,5&#8208;triazinium salts are described. Similar to the widely used imidazolium&#8208;type borane complex, the obtained complexes behave as agents for the hydrogen atom transfer in the Giese reaction and as sources of the boryl radicals in addition to imines. The amine nitrogen of these complexes does not undergo alkylation, but it can bind with another borane molecule.

Abstract
Inexpensive cobalt&#8208;catalyzed, pivalic acid&#8208;assisted oxidative C&#8722;H functionalization of benzimidates or NH&#8208;benzaldimines with ynamides is presented, providing an access to 3&#8208;aminoisoquinoline derivatives. The procedure is compatible with various substrates featuring alkyl, alkoxy, acyl or halogen as substituents, heteroaryl structures, and diverse ynamides. The reaction has been scaled up, with subsequent transformation of the yielded products. Control experiments and mechanistic investigations corroborate the regioselectivity of this conversion, positioning the amine group proximal to the nitrogen atom in isoquinolines.

Abstract
We described the protein engineering of the halohydrin dehalogenase HheG to enhance its R enantioselectivity for the synthesis of chiral 4&#8208;aryloxazolidinones via &#945;&#8208;regioselective ring&#8208;opening of aryl epoxides with cyanate. Additionally, we achieved the inversion of its regioselectivity and enantioselectivity, resulting in a HheG variant tailored for the synthesis of chiral 5&#8208;aryloxazolidinones via &#946;&#8208;regioselective and S&#8208;enantioselective ring&#8208;opening of aryl epoxides with cyanate. Leveraging these engineered mutants, we developed a biocatalytic platform capable of synthesis of both chiral 4&#8208;aryloxazolidinones (up to 47% yield, 98% ee, and 99% regioselectivity) and chiral 5&#8208;aryloxazolidinones (up to 46% yield, &gt;99% ee, and 98% regioselectivity). Furthermore, a collaborative approach utilizing two regio&#8208; and enantioselective HheG mutants has been demonstrated to enable the simultaneous synthesis of chiral 4&#8208;aryloxazolidinones and chiral 5&#8208;aryloxazolidinones.

Abstract
An enantioselective Si&#8722;H insertion between &#945;&#8208;arylvinyldiazoesters and silanes has been developed by employing rhodium(I)/chiral diene complex as the catalyst. This protocol offers a catalytic asymmetric approach to various chiral silanes containing &#945;&#8208;arylvinyl functionality at room temperature with good enantiocontrol (89&#8211;99% ee). Transformation of the resulting enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;arylvinyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silyl esters led to a variety of other valuable building blocks. The deuterium kinetic isotope effect experiments revealed a rhodium(I)&#8208;mediated concerted Si&#8722;H insertion mechanism.

Abstract
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed vinylation method for alkenyl ethers has been developed. In this strategy, both chain and cyclic alkenyl ether substrates were applicable, and the target products were obtained in up to 95% yields and with the E/Z selectivities of &gt;98:2. Furthermore, we have successfully applied this method to directly vinylate the C&#8208;2 position of protected glucals, offering a valuable tool for their functionalization. Moreover, through the utilization of alkenyl alcohols as substrates, we accomplished a 1,2&#8208;alkenyloxylation of alkenyl double bond, enabling the synthesis of functionalized cyclic ether compounds with five or six&#8208;membered rings.

Abstract
Hydrocarboxylation of methyl 2&#8208;octynoate, a chemical commercially available at a low cost, with N&#8208;protected amino acids was developed with a gold&#8208;zinc cooperative catalyst constructed with a 5&#8208;[(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridin)&#8208;5&#8208;yl]imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene to prepare &#945;&#8208;methoxycarbonyl enol esters as acylating reagents. The &#945;&#8208;methoxycarbonyl enol esters were isolable through silica&#8208;gel column chromatography and storable without precautions regarding moisture. Acylation of free amines with the &#945;&#8208;methoxycarbonyl enol esters proceeded without epimerization of the stereogenic center derived from the enol esters, affording analytically pure dipeptide compounds through filtration and hexane&#8208;washing.

         <dc:description>The enantioselective introduction of gem&#8208;difluorinated carbonyl (i. e. &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro carbonyl) moieties into organic structures is a synthetically valuable but highly challenging approach. During the past decades, continuous efforts have been made for the developments of synthetic strategies for constructing C(sp3)&#8211;CF2R chiral centers with high levels of enantioselectivities. 	This review summarizes and discusses the recent advance in the enantioselective construction of gem&#8208;difluorinated carbonyl moieties, which are organized according to the reaction categories.

         <title>Biocatalytic Recycling Cascades Combining Aldolases and Transaminases for the Stereo&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Recycling cascades combining aldolases and transaminases from biodiversity were designed for the stereoselective synthesis of various isomers of &#947;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids. Aldolases with opposite enantioselectivities were combined with a D&#8208;&#945;&#8208;transaminase to prepare in a single step, D&#8208;syn or D&#8208;anti&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyglutamic acid with high yield and stereoselectivity. Bioactive (2S,3R,4S)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;isoleucine was also efficiently prepared via an aldolase&#8208;transaminase recycling cascade. In that case, the 	unexpected high stereoselectivity was shown to result from the thermodynamically&#8208;driven formation of a stable derivative of the product. This novel approach was applied to the synthesis of l&#8208;syn and d&#8208;syn&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxynorvaline as well as for 3 new &#946;&#8208;branched&#8208;&#947;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids, analogues of 4&#8208;hydroxyisoleucine.

         <title>Merging Organolithium Chemistry and Stereoselective Biocatalysis: Transformation of Aromatic Nitriles into Chiral Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of RLi&#8208;mediated organic transformations (under air and at room temperature) with a subsequent stereoselective biocatalytic reaction is for the first time presented. Most of the previous asymmetric chemoenzymatic routes have been limited to the concomitant or sequential combination of transition metals/organocatalysts with enzymes. However, the use of polar organometallic reagents (RLi) in the design of these stereoselective hybrid protocols has been totally neglected, as far as we are concerned.
Thus, in this work, the combination of organolithium chemistry and asymmetric biocatalysis is described for the first time in a one&#8208;pot fashion. The chemoenzymatic approach converts a series of nitriles into chiral alcohols consisting of two steps, where the key item was the finding of suitable conditions to adapt the reactivities of organolithiums and alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) in the same recipient. The organolithium addition occurred with total chemoselectivity (no side reactions were observed) under neat conditions and room temperature leading to the corresponding imines, which were hydrolyzed using a buffer, and adjusting the pH for the subsequent ADH action. Commercial and made in house overexpressed ADHs allowed to produce chiral alcohols with excellent selectivities and good overall yields. The different behavior displayed for the reductive enzymes in the presence of diethyl ether clearly influenced in the decision to let the organolithium solvent evaporate under open&#8208;air conditions before developing the bioreduction step.
Our results demonstrate the importance of the fine orchestration of the reaction conditions for the development of efficient hybrid chemoenzymatic cascades without the need of intermediate isolation/purification steps or compartmentalization of the different synthetic systems.

         <title>Construction of Difluorinated Cycloheptadienones via Substrate&#8208;Controlled Regioselective Conjugate Addition of Difluoroenoxysilanes to Tropones and Their Anticancer Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The substrate&#8208;controlled regioselective conjugate addition (1,8&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;addition) of tropones with difluoroenoxysilanes is reported, which offered an approach for the selective synthesis of multifunctional seven&#8208;membered 3,5&#8208;cycloheptadien&#8208;1&#8208;ones and 1,3&#8208;cycloheptadien&#8208;1&#8208;ones featuring a gem&#8208;difluoroketone moiety. Moreover, these fluorinated cyclo&#8208;heptadienones exhibit effective anti&#8208;proliferative activities (IC50 &lt; 1 &#956;M) for human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells in vitro, thus providing potential lead compounds for developing new anticancer agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of Primary Phosphine Oxides in Domino&#8208;Phospha&#8208;Aldol Reactions of Diketones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An approach for the preparation and stabilization of primary phosphine oxides is presented complementing previous methods of in situ generation. Specifically, RP(O)H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; where R = benzyl (Bn), cyclohexyl (Cy), 2&#8208;naphthyl (2&#8208;Naph), phenyl (Ph), &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;butyl (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Bu) was prepared by controlled oxidation of the corresponding primary phosphine in presence of ferrocene as stabilizing reagent. The primary phosphine oxides were characterized using NMR and MS and studied in twofold hydro phosphorylation of diketones. The domino&#8208;phospha&#8208;aldol reaction catalysed with 5 mol% of sodium methoxide yielded five&#8208;, six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered heterocyclic tertiary phosphine oxides with a high degree of stereoselectivity, as confirmed by single X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The decarboxylative oxygenation of readily available carboxylic acids has been accomplished through visible light using g&#8208;C3N4 as a robust and recyclable catalyst. The scalable protocol furnishes an array of precious aldehydes and ketones under mild reaction conditions, requiring only molecular oxygen as an oxidant. Notably, no addition of stochiometric amounts of base is required, and furthermore, the reaction proceeds efficiently open to the air.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Oxaspirocyclohexadienones via Lewis&#8208;acid Catalyzed [2+3]&#8208;Annulations of p&#8208;Quinone Methides and Iodonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Herein, we report a mild and significant method for the synthesis of oxaspirocyclohexadienones by using a combination of Lewis acid&#8208;HFIP mediated [2+3]&#8208;annulation of p&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) and iodonium ylides. The proposed mechanism proceeds through a one&#8208;pot sequence of carbonyl activation/cyclopropyl formation/Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement to provide a broad range of oxaspirocyclohexadienones in moderate to high yields. Interestingly, the spiro&#8208;annulated products were further converted to tetrahydroxanthane derivatives via BF3.OEt2 mediated dienone&#8208;phenol rearrangement pathway. Moreover, the spiro&#8208;annulated derivatives also showed a moderate anti&#8208;tuberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra ATCC25177.</dc:description>

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Markovnikov Hydroarylation of Arylcyclobutene: A Route to gem&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;Substituted Cyclobutanes</title>

Abstract
A regioselective Markovnikov hydroarylation of arylcyclobutene has been developed using Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis through a protonation/Friedel&#8208;Crafts sequence. The metal&#8208;free catalytic reaction is operationally simple and feasible compared to previous reports that utilized elaborate arylcyclobutene and specific polyfluorinated reagents, affording a variety of gem&#8208;diaryl&#8208; substituted arylcyclobutene in good yields. The possible mechanism of the reaction has been explored through step&#8208;by&#8208;step control experiments. This protocol involving indole in gem&#8208;diaryl&#8208;substituted cyclobutene scaffolds not only enriches the applications of Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed hydroarylation, but also paves the way for a more extensive access to potential bioactive cyclobutanes structures.

         <dc:description>We are reporting the preparation and use in cross coupling reactions of a newly developed, bench&#8208;stable (1 fluorocyclopropyl)metalloid reagent. The Stille cross coupling reaction described for this &#945;&#8208;fluorinated stannane reagent is amenable to a wide range of aryl and alkenyl (pseudo)halides bearing a variety of functional groups. An enantioenriched cross&#8208;coupled product was also obtained from the corresponding 1&#8208;fluorocyclopropyltin reagent bearing an ester handle. Finally, the chemical stability of the 1 fluorocyclopropyl moiety was also demonstrated by performing several post&#8208;functionalizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Furans: Three&#8208;Component Reactions Involving Ketene Dithioacetals, Acetylenes, and Phosphines to Generate Phosphorus Ylides or &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Acyliminophosphoranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of new polysubstituted furans incorporating reactive phosphorus ylides or &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8209;acyliminophosphoranes was achieved by the heterocyclization of flexible &#945;&#8208;acyl ketene dithioacetals. This one&#8208;pot tandem reaction was initiated by acyl&#8208;directed desulfurative Sonogashira coupling, followed by 1,6&#8208;addition of phosphine to the in situ&#8208;generated enynone and subsequent 5&#8208;&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;dig&lt;/i&gt; cyclization, as well as phosphoranation. The selectivity toward the two products, i.e. &#945;&#8208;phosphorus ylides vs. &#945;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8209;acyliminophosphoranes&#8208;substituted furans, was determined by both electron&#8208;deficient acetylenes and copper salts.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Induced Halogen Bond Assisted Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reaction of Indole and Chalcones</title>

Abstract
The use of halogen bonding interactions as an alternative to acid and metal catalysts for substrate activation has gained popularity in recent years. In this work we demonstrate a halogen bond assisted activation of chalcones under visible light irradiation for the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction with indole to yield &#946;&#8208;indolylketones. The simple and scalable protocol uses the readily available CBr4 as halogen bond catalyst. The targets are produced in 31&#8211;94% of yield with excellent functional group tolerance. The proposed mechanism of the reaction is supported by UV&#8208;vis, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopic studies. Further it is demonstrated that the &#946;&#8208;indolylketones can be oxidised to indole substituted &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones by DDQ or cyclized to thieno[2,3&#8208;b]indoles in the presence of elemental sulfur and base.

         <title>Decarbonylative and Dehydrogenative Cascade Annulation of N&#8208;(o&#8208;Cyanobiaryl)acrylamides with Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Decarbonylative and dehydrogenative cascade annulation of aldehydes with N&#8208;(o&#8208;cyanobiaryl)acrylamides was developed for the synthesis of a broad spectrum of alkyl&#8208; and carbonyl&#8208;substituted pyrido[4,3,2&#8208;gh]phenanthridines. Secondary and tertiary aldehydes can undergo the decarbonylative cascade under DTBP/malonic acid conditions, while aryl, primary, and secondary aldehydes can undergo dehydrogenative reaction under TBHP system. Such transformations were triggered by alkyl and acyl radicals, and the annulations were accomplished through intramolecular additions of carbon&#8208;centered radical to nitrile group and iminyl radical to aromatic ring.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Arylations of Ketimines.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover image was created and painted by the young and talented artist Helena Bosnar (used with permission). The artwork depicts the asymmetric arylation of ketimines as a metamorphosis from a caterpillar into a butterfly. In this metaphor, the caterpillar symbolizes the planar nature of ketimine. As it progresses to the chrysalis stage (catalyst), the caterpillar utilizes stored food (aryl group) to undergo transformation into a butterfly, symbolizing the optically pure three&#8208;dimensional nature of chiral &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines. Details can be found in Review by Matija Gredi&#269;ak and co&#8208;workers (K. Vlahovi&#269;ek&#8208;Kahlina, M. Marijan, M. Mati&#353;i&#263;, M. Gredi&#269;ak, Adv. Synth.

         <dc:description>Indan&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones stand as versatile precursors to a plethora of complex molecules with wide applications; however, their direct cross&#8208;coupling methodologies remain largely unexplored.

The successful synthesis of a neolignan natural product and the key intermediate of Indatraline (antidepressant) showcased the synthetic utility of the methodology. The strategy enabled tuning the electronic characteristics of indenones and benzofulvenes, modulating the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps. The photophysical properties of these molecules were studied, and the experimental results were compared with the predictions obtained from the DFT studies.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular dehydrative amination method has been developed to synthesize diverse cyclic sulfamides efficiently. Reactions proceed smoothly at room temperature using a combination of (IPr)AuCl (5 mol%) and AgBF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (5 mol%). This method showcases a broad substrate scope, encompassing challenging seven&#8208;membered ring structures, and exhibits functional group compatibility. Moreover, the reaction demonstrates high stereoselectivity, allowing the synthesis of enantiomerically enriched cyclic sulfamides from chiral secondary allylic alcohols. The synthesized cyclic sulfamides serve as valuable intermediates for generating 1,3&#8208;diamines. This approach provides an improved route for cyclic sulfamide synthesis and a strategic entry point for obtaining essential 1,3&#8208;diamine derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Organocatalyzed Glycosylation of Glycosyl Trichloroacetimidate Donors: Thiouracil as Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report thiouracil&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;selective O&#8208;glycosylations employing easily accessible glycosyl trichloroacetimidate donors without using any co&#8208;catalyst or additive. A variety of alcohol nucleophiles including saccharides, and amino acids with different protecting groups containing glycosyl trichloroacetimidate donors were successfully &#945;&#8208;glycosylated using an operationally simple protocol. Moreover, mechanistic investigations suggest that thiouracil functions as Br&#248;nsted acid/base catalysis in this glycosylation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep Study of Thiocarbamoyl Fluorides: Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiocarbamoyl fluoride is an understudied fluorinated group, mainly due to the paucity of data on its properties. Herein, an in&#8208;depth study of the stability of thiocarbamoyl fluorides, especially under near&#8208;physiological conditions, is described. Since efficient and easy to implement syntheses of these compounds are still under&#8208;described, a new method, based on the use of a trifluoromethanesulfenamide, a well&#8208;described and versatile reagent, has also been developed.
This trifluoromethanesulfenamide turned out to be able to generate in situ difluorothiophosgene, which was able to react rapidly with amines to efficiently provide various thiocarbamoyl fluorides.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Decarboxylative Mannich Reaction for the Synthesis of Non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids Bearing Akynyl Groups</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric decarboxylative Mannich addition of &#946;&#8208;keto acids or malonic acid half&#8208;esters to &#946;,&#947;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketimino esters catalyzed by cinchona alkaloid&#8208;derived squaramide has been developed. The reaction proceeded by forming a nucleophilic enolate after decarboxylation, followed by its addition to &#946;,&#947;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketimino esters facilitated by the bifunctional catalyst. A broad range of substrates with various substituents are tolerated in this reaction, yielding a series of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acid derivatives bearing alkynyl functional groups in high yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities. The practicality of this method was demonstrated by a gram&#8208;scale reaction and subsequent elaboration of the Mannich adducts.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanocellulose as Reaction Media for FeCl3&#8208;mediated Mechanochemical Deaminative Fluorination of (Hetero)aromatic Amines.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of an efficient alternative to the widely employed Balz&#8208;Schiemann deaminative fluorination method (i.e. without using aryl diazonium tetrafluoroborate salt) is a challenging task. Herein, we report a convenient one&#8208;pot method for the FeCl3&#8208;nanocellullose mediated mechanochemical synthesis of fluoroarenes through the selective substitution of an aromatic amino group by fluorine group using pyrylium tetrafluoroborate (Pyry&#8208;BF4) and sodium fluoride (NaF) via in situ formation of pyridinium salt intermediate. The scope of the present protocol includes synthesis of twenty&#8208;eight organofluorine compounds with excellent yields via a selective substitution (SNAr) of an amino group by fluorine. The presented concise methodology opens a pathway to access new chemical spaces for the late&#8208;stage functionalization in pharmaceutical industries.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative rearrangement approach for the ring contraction of N&#8211;H piperidines to pyrrolidines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a method for ring contraction of N&#8211;H piperidines using oxidative rearrangement with PhI(OAc)2. The reaction forms iminium ion intermediates that are effectively trapped by nucleophiles (e.g., NaBH4, H2O) yielding the corresponding pyrrolidine derivatives. Additionally, we propose an ionic mechanism supported by experiments and density&#8208;functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Catalytic Protocols for the Synthesis of CF2&#8208;Containing Quinazolinones via Domino Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;catalyzed and visible&#8208;light catalytic difluoroalkylation reactions of N&#8208;cyanamide alkenes have been developed. Various &#945;&#8208;bromodifluoromethyl substituted esters, amides and heterocycles were employed as the CF2 source. Both protocols are characterized by medium to high yields, good functional group compatibility, and applicable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Comparable studies of copper catalysis and photoredox catalysis demonstrate minimal differences between the two protocols. Preliminary mechanism suggest that both transformations involve tandem radical cyclization process.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of CF3&#8208; Pyrano[3,4&#8208;c]quinolones from Hetero&#8208;Dendralenes and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we demonstrate Oxa&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 3&#8208;trifluoroacetyl&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;quinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one with aldehydes in the presence of a base to engineer the functionalized pyrano[3,4&#8208;c]quinolones. This reaction proceeds through an in&#8208;situ generated hetero dendralene intermediate and features perfect stereoselectivity on a wide range of substrates with excellent atom economy. The high electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of CF3&#8208;group is responsible for making the methyl group present in quinolone moiety more acidic to furnish the corresponding hetero dendralene intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Oxazoles: Aminotrifluoromethylation of Alkynes/in&#8208;situ Cyclization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the development of a four&#8208;component electrochemical method for the synthesis of CF3&#8208;oxazoles, utilizing alkynes and NaSO2CF3 in MeCN. The method leverages the simplicity and mildness of the reaction conditions, despite the inherent complexity of utilizing four distinct components through aminotrifluoromethylation of alkyne followed by in&#8208;situ cyclization. Notably, in addition to MeCN solvent, the presence of residual water in the reaction mixture also contributed as a coupling partner. The synthesis involves a sequence of four controlled oxidation steps under constant potential with graphite electrodes, facilitated by the mediator TMEDA, highlighting the precision achievable in electrochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid catalysts in photoredox arylation of sodium arylsulfinates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Complexes [(bpy)2Ru(BL)](PF6)2 (Ru(BL), BL = N,N&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthrolinamine) have been investigated in the coupling reaction of aryl halides and sodium arylsulfinates under visible light irradiation. The position (3, 4 or 5) of the nickel&#8208;coordinating di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amine fragment in the 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline system has a strong influence on the activity of the catalytic system. The advantage of binding fragments of photocatalyst and metal complex into one molecule in the systems with bridging ligands N,N&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthrolin&#8208;3&#8208;amine (BL1) and N,N&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthrolin&#8208;4&#8208;amine (BL2), in comparison with mixed catalytic systems, is shown. With Ru(BL2) photocatalysts it is possible to reduce the loading to 0.1 mol%, instead of the commonly used 1&#8211;2 mol%, and to eliminate the use of the additional ligand for nickel. Under these conditions, more than 20 diarylsulfones of different structures were synthesized in 25&#8211;95%yields.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An In(III)&#8208;catalyzed [2+3+1] annulation strategy is developed for the diastereoselective construction of diversely functionalized tetrahydroxanthones bearing chromone rings. This protocol is based on a three&#8208;component reaction involving various 3&#8208;formylchromones and &#945;&#8208;methylstyrenes via a carbonyl&#8208;ene and formal [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. Notable features of this reaction include its wide substrate scope, high tolerance towards functional groups, atom economy, and excellent diastereoselectivity. In addition, the synthesized tetrahydroxanthones are readily transformed into 2&#8208;hydroxybenzophenone products.</dc:description>

Abstract
Mono&#8208; and dichloro acetamides were prepared via a hydrodechlorination reaction of trichloroacetamides under controlled electrochemical conditions. The reactions were carried out in an undivided cell with constant current flow using n&#8208;Bu4NI as supporting electrolyte and methanol as solvent and proton source. Deuterodechlorination of trichloroacetamide was also successful when methanol&#8208;d4 was used as solvent under identical electrochemical conditions.

         <title>Engineering Styrene Oxide Isomerase Towards Enhanced Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of (S)&#8208;Flurbiprofen</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The conventional synthesis of (S)&#8208;flurbiprofen, a valuable non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID), involves inefficient chiral resolution with low&#8208;yielding multiple reaction steps, or asymmetric synthesis with low enantioselectivity and/or regioselectivity. Here, we developed high&#8208;yielding, enantioselective, and sustainable synthesis of (S)&#8208;flurbiprofen via two chemoenzymatic approaches from a simple alkene: (A) enzymatic epoxidation&#8208;isomerization&#8208;oxidation cascade and Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation; and (B) chemical epoxidation, enzymatic isomerization&#8208;oxidation cascade, and Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation. Styrene oxide isomerase (SOI)&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;retentive Meinwald rearrangement was the key step in the two pathways, but SOI suffers from low activity. SOI was engineered via two rounds of iterative saturation mutagenesis and screening with a three&#8208;enzyme cascade assay, generating a double&#8208;mutant SOIDM (N99A/D95A) with 5.5&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM). In Pathway A, cascade biotransformation of 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylstyrene with engineered E. coli strain expressing SOIDM, styrene monooxygenase (SMO) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), and subsequent Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation afforded (S)&#8208;flurbiprofen in 98% yield and 91% ee. In Pathway B, chemical epoxidation (Sharpless dihydroxylation and ring&#8208;closing), cascade conversion using an engineered E. coli strain expressing SOIDM, ALDH and NADH oxidase (NOX), and Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation produced (S)&#8208;flurbiprofen in 83% yield and 98% ee. Compared to conventional synthesis, the developed methods reduced reaction steps, minimized waste generation and improved enantioselectivity or overall yield.

         <title>Ambiphilic Reactivity of SF5&#8208;Alkynes Applied to Regioselective and Stereodivergent Halogenation Reactions: An Experimental and Theoretical Case Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We explored the ambiphilic reactivity of SF5&#8208;alkynes, and we proved they can act as both nucleophiles and electrophiles. We selected halogenation reactions as benchmark reactions and developed highly selective stereodivergent hydrohalogenation (I, Br, Cl, F) reactions of SF5&#8208;alkynes. The stereochemistry is finely controlled thanks to the nature of the acids used (strong or soft) in the presence of halide source, while the high regioselectivity is governed by the strong polarization of SF5&#8208;alkynes. Mechanistic studies supported by DFT calculations shed light on two different reaction mechanisms responsible of the excellent stereocontrol. This stereoselectivity was quantitatively rationalized with the ASM and EDA methods. A few dihalogenation reactions are reported and DFT calculations rationalize this cis&#8208;stereoselectivity. Relative configuration of all the SF5&#8208;haloalkenes was unambiguously determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Noteworthy, several post&#8208;functionalization reactions such as cross&#8208;couplings, cyanation and reductions are described to strengthen the synthetic potential.

         <title>Asymmetric Boracarboxylation of Styrenes Using Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The boracarboxylation reaction has potential for the production of natural products and drug candidates, but the development of an asymmetric version of this transformation is challenging. We report an enantioselective boracarboxylation of styrenes, enabled by a copper catalyst containing chiral phosphines. Our experimental conditions provide yields between 31&#8211;76% and enantiomeric ratios from 80:20 up to 98:2 for electron&#8208;rich styrenes. Oxidation of a boracarboxylation product gives (S)&#8208;tropic acid, an intermediate towards several tropane alkaloids. A computational analysis of the mechanistic details shows a complex pattern of competing reaction pathways, highlighting challenges encountered when developing asymmetric reactions using CO2.

         <dc:description>With phenacyl chlorides as simple nucleophilic species, the asymmetric Darzens reaction of isatins using Ni(acac)2 as the Lewis acid and imidazolidine&#8208;pyrroloimidazolone pyridine as the ligand is reported. In the presence of 1 mol% of catalyst, diverse spiro&#8208;epoxyoxindoles with two new contiguous stereocenters were afforded in 82&#8208;99% yields, &gt;20:1 dr, and 91&#8208;99% ee. Chiral spiro&#8208;epoxyoxindoles could undergo ring&#8208;opening reactions in further transformations. The developed method was applied to the derivatization of complex molecules including indomethacin, gemfibrozil, and febuxostat&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;chloroketones. A strong positive nonlinear effect was observed, which was caused by the precipitation of a less&#8208;soluble racemic catalyst complex.</dc:description>

The selective formation of aforesaid products is based on the variable reactivity, intramolecular ortho&#8208;cyclization or dearomative ipso&#8208;annulation, guided by the substituent on N&#8208;aryl group of the substrate. The ortho&#8208;annulation is mediated by electrophile, while the ipso&#8208;annulation is promoted by the radical, enabling the functionalization (selenyl or iodo) on sultams.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Naphthalenone Spiroindanediones or 4&#8208;Acyl&#8208;1&#8208;naphthols from Aryl Enaminones Featuring Reuse of Dimethylamine</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Presented herein is a switchable synthesis of naphthalenone spiroindanediones or 4&#8208;acyl&#8208;1&#8208;naphthols via condition&#8208;controlled divergent cascade reactions of aryl enaminones with diazoindanediones. When the reaction was carried out in the presence of an oxidative additive, naphthalenone spiroindanedione was formed through C(sp2)&#8211;H alkylation followed by simultaneous spiroannulation and elimination of dimethylamine. When the reaction was carried out in the presence of an acid additive, on the other hand, 4&#8208;acyl&#8208;1&#8208;naphthol was formed through ring opening of the spiroindanedione moiety attacked by the in situ released dimethylamine. In addition, the reactions are suitable for gram&#8208;scale applications and compatible with a variety of substrates. Moreover, the naphthol products allow structural elaborations and hybridization with clinic drug, thus further enhancing the value of this developed method.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrochemical method with high faradaic efficiency was developed for the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;regioselective aroylation of quinoline N&#8208;oxides under oxidant&#8208;free conditions by using aryl &#945;&#8208;ketoacids as the aroylation reagent. A series of 8&#8208;aroylquinoline N&#8208;oxides were effectively synthesized in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. Furthermore, the proposed method was successfully applied to the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a tubulin polymerization inhibitor. Additionally, a plausible reaction mechanism for the decarboxylation radical acylation was proposed on the basis of the results of cyclic voltammetry and control experiments. Overall, this method provides a novel solution for the C8&#8208;regioselective aroylation of quinoline N&#8208;oxides.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced method was developed to synthesize selenylated cyclic boronic esters through intermolecular oxyselenenylation. This method can be performed under additive&#8208;free and photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions and generates potentially pharmaceutically useful heterocycles. A plausible reaction mechanism was proposed based on several control experiments and previous reports.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Fluorinated Spiroindolenines by Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Indole Dearomatizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy to access fluorinated spiroindolenines has been developed, involving a selective functionalization of indoles with fluorinated moieties and subsequent catalytic dearomatization. Trifluomethylthio (SCF3), diethyl phosphono(difluoromethyl)thio (SCF2P(O)(OEt)2) and (phenylsulfonyl)difluoromethyl (CF2SO2Ph) groups were embedded at the C2 position of indole derivatives substituted with alkynes, allenes, and allyl carbonate moieties at the C3 position. A gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization gave access to six spiroindolenines, and an enantioselective palladium catalyzed cyclization provided 10 fluorinated spirocyclic products with up to 77% ee.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A class of novel chiral&#8208;bridged biphenyl monophosphine ligands with a benzofuran moiety (He&#8208;phos) has been successfully synthesized and reported. These ligands exhibited good performance in the gold&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cycloaddition reaction of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones with nitrones, resulting in the successful preparation of a series of polyaryl&#8208;substituted heterocyclic compounds with high enantioselectivities (up to 99% yield, 98% ee). The wide substrate adaptability (53 examples) and mild reaction conditions demonstrate the practicability of He&#8208;phos in this reaction.</dc:description>

Abstract
In this study, we have developed a metal&#8208;mediated synthetic method for incorporating the 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl (CF2CF2H) motif into unactivated, electron&#8208;rich alkenyl iodides using cross&#8208;coupling reactions. We discovered that the stable Cu(CF2CF2H)(PPh2Me)3 complex, while unreactive with these substrates, serves as a P&#8208;ligated reservoir for the formation of solvent&#8208;stabilized &#8220;ligandless&#8221; and reactive CuCF2CF2H species. This transformation occurs upon addition of CuBr, which partially scavenges the P&#8208;ligand in the form of CuBr(PPh2Me)3. The resulting in&#8197;situ generated solvent stabilized &#8220;ligandless&#8221; system significantly enhances the reactivity of the complex, particularly towards challenging electron&#8208;rich substrates. This advancement enables the synthesis of HCF2CF2&#8208;glycals, as well as nucleosides/nucleobases and arenes.

Abstract
Here in, we describe the photochemical decarboxylative alkylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones using commercially accessible carboxylic acids with oxygen as sole oxidant through energy transfer process. The coupling of diverse array of alkyl carboxylic acids (1&#176; to 3&#176;) and bioactive acids with quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones is successfully accomplished to achieve the desired alkylated products.

Abstract
Herein, we present a (NH4)2S2O8 mediated difunctionalization reaction of aryl alkenes with quinoxalinones and P(O)SH compounds. This method enables the synthesis of various phosphorothioate&#8208;containing quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives (46 examples) in 37&#8211;79% yields. The reaction is compatible with a range of functional groups and is easily adaptable to large&#8208;scale synthesis. Preliminary studies suggest the involvement of phosphorothioate radicals in these transformations.

         <title>A Mild Metal&#8208;Free Approach for the Direct Synthesis of Carbamoyl Azides from Carboxylic Acid Redox Active Esters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Carbamoyl azide is a pivotal compound used in the transformation into urea and amines, as well as in nitrene insertion reactions. In this study, we present a pioneering method for synthesizing carbamoyl azide directly from acid redox active esters without the use of metals or oxidants. This approach demonstrates tolerance for various functional groups, enhancing its applicability. Furthermore, this technique facilitates late&#8208;stage modifications of natural products and pharmaceuticals, thereby accelerating the development and identification of novel drug candidates.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura/Allylic Substitution: A Regioselective Synthesis of (2&#8208;Arylallyl) Aryl Sulfones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A one&#8208;pot Pd&#8208;catalyzed tandem process to prepare (2&#8208;arylallyl) aryl sulfones has been developed. This strategy is based on the modular assembly of a boronic acid, a sodium sulfinate and 2&#8208;bromoallyl acetate. The reaction is completely regioselective towards the terminal alkene, yielding (2&#8208;arylallyl) aryl (or alkyl) sulfones with yields ranging from 56 to 93%. Control experiments together with DFT calculations allowed to propose a plausible reaction mechanism of the tandem reaction. The usefulness of this methodology has been demonstrated with the formal synthesis of the marketed drug Apremilast and of several natural products by asymmetric hydrogenation. Using the commercially available UbaPHOX iridium complex, chiral &#946;&#8208;methyl sulfones with up to 98% ee were obtained

         <title>Regioselective C6&#8208;Arylation of Thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazole Heterocycles with Aryl Iodides</title>

Abstract
Regioselective C6&#8208;arylation of thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazoles with aryl iodides as coupling partners has been developed. This strategy was performed in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 as catalyst in combination with AgOTf as an oxidant and TFA in dimethylacetamide. In all experiments, only the C6&#8208;arylated thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazole was isolated since its C5&#8208;regioisomer was not observed, indicating the high regioselectivity of this approach. The catalytic system used is compatible with a variety of 3&#8208;functionalized thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazoles and iodoaryl electrophiles, providing access to 3,6&#8208;disubstituted thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazoles in yields ranging from 49% to 94%.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Ugi&#8208;Type Reaction for the Synthesis of 3,3&#8208;Disubstituted Phthalides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The synthesis of diverse phthalides containing quaternary carbon centers remains poorly exploited, requiring stepwise reactions with toxic reagents under high temperatures. Herein, we describe a visible&#8208;light promoted, photo&#8208; and metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free protocol for the modular synthesis of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted phthalides with water as the sole by&#8208;product. This process featured an open&#8208;flask operation of a three&#8208;component reaction involving an isocoumarin as the self&#8208;photosensitizer for aerobic ring contracting rearrangements, allowing the convenient preparation of 3&#8208;(1&#8242;&#8208;indolyl)&#8208;phthalides in moderate to good yields. The mechanistic investigations suggested that singlet oxygen (1O2) was generated through an energy&#8208;transfer pathway.

         <title>Synthesis of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Hydrazines by Electrocatalytic Addition of Hydrazines to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyl Compounds</title>

Abstract
A strategy for the synthesis of N,N&#8208;disubstituted hydrazines via the electrocatalytic addition of hydrazine to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds is reported. The reaction was carried out under constant current electrolytic conditions in an undivided cell. Using this methodology, various N,N&#8208;disubstituted hydrazines were prepared in 57&#8211;94% yield in 40&#8197;minutes. By adding cyclohexanone and acetic acid to the reaction mixture of N,N&#8208;disubstituted hydrazines and heating for 2&#8197;hours, a one&#8208;pot synthesis of N&#8208;substituted indoles was also developed. Furthermore, based on cyclic voltammetry and control experiments, a plausible mechanism involving a radical pathway is proposed.

Abstract
An iron&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the synthesis of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole heterocyclic structures is disclosed employing isatins and non&#8208;nucleophilic N&#8208;methoxybenzamides. This reaction class is associated with broad scope and tolerates numerous functionalities, such as fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo, trifluoromethyl, nitrile, ester, ether, and alkenyl, including heteroaryl &#8211; thiophene, benzothiophene, carbazolyl, indolyl, eugenol, and polycyclic cholesterol moieties. Detailed mechanistic investigations reveal that the reaction proceeds via iron&#8208;catalyzed N&#8722;O bond cleavage in N&#8208;methoxybenzamides, generating formaldehyde and benzamide, and through the intermediacy of isatin&#8208;ketimines and N&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)benzamides. Overall, this amidation reaction involves one C&#8722;C and two C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming tandem processes, providing a range of &#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;oxindoles (45 examples) in up to 88% yields.

Abstract
Tetrasubstituted 2,3&#8208;trans&#8208;dihydrofuran and furan are important heterocyclic scaffolds in natural product, bioorganic and medicinal chemistry as well as in material science. The synthesis of both of these heterocycles starting from common and readily available starting materials are challenging. We found that in&#8197;situ generated deoxybenzoin&#8208;chalcone Michael adducts underwent oxidative annulation upon heating with molecular iodine in DMSO to provide selectively 2,3&#8208;trans&#8208;dihydrofurans at 80&#8201;&#176;C and furans at 120&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Phospholanes via Twofold C&#8208;H&#8208;Addition to Phospholes</title>

Abstract
A synthetic route towards phospholanes via twofold C&#8722;H&#8208;addition of a DMSO molecule to &#946;&#8208;H substituted phospholes is described. The resulting fused phospholane oxothiolane system in case of symmetric &#945;&#8208;substitution possesses four stereogenic centers or rather six in case of asymmetric &#945;&#8208;substitution. The reaction conditions are shown to be applicable for a variety of phospholes with different P&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;substituents always leading to stereoselective formation of the fused heterocyclic ring system. All phospholane derivatives with one exception are sufficiently air stable for purification with column chromatography and are fully characterized by NMR and elemental analysis and mass spectrometry. With the help of X&#8208;ray crystallography, the different configurations of the isomers could be demonstrated. For one model system derivatization reactions are presented. When oxidizing or reducing the sulfoxide group only a single diastereomer is observed.

         <title>Synthesis of Bridged Bicyclic Systems peri&#8208;Annulated to the Indole Ring: Tropane&#8208;Fused Indoles</title>

Abstract
Ytterbium triflate catalysed domino reaction of (3&#8208;formyl&#8208;4&#8208;indolyl)&#8208;derived donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane with primary amines provides a simple approach to an unprecedented tetracyclic skeleton in which tropane system is peri&#8208;annulated with an indole core. This process involves the formation of an imine and its (3+2)&#8208;cross&#8208;cycloaddition with donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane moiety, yielding tropane&#8208;fused indole core under mild reaction conditions. These products are of significant interest for pharmacology as potential hybrid molecules with a dual mode of action.

         <title>Selective Hydrosilylation and Hydroboration of Allenes Catalyzed by Cobalt&#8208;Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Achieving precise control over regioselectivity and stereoselectivity in the hydroelementation of terminal allenes presents a formidable challenge. Despite the existence of various catalytic methods for their functionalization, this entire class of reactions remains significantly underdeveloped and demands extensive research. Here, we report a method for the hydroelementation of allenes using inexpensive PN5P pincer cobalt complexes built on a triazine backbone. Depending on the substituent at the ring, the method enables the selective synthesis of E&#8208;alkenylsilane or Z&#8208;allylborane derivatives. In the presented approach, silanes and pinacoloboranes play a dualistic role of simultaneous activator and substrate excluding the need for the addition of external bases. Finally, the application potential of the obtained compounds was demonstrated by performing further functionalizations of the obtained compounds.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Nitrocyclopropanes Bearing a Thioester Group and Three Stereogenic Centers</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A two&#8208;stage protocol was developed for accessing nitrocyclopropanes that bear a thioester group and three stereogenic centers. This protocol achieves practical overall yields ranging from 54% to 75%, along with high levels of stereoselectivity (single diastereomer with up to 98% ee). Brominated monothiomalonate (Br&#8208;MTM) is used as an &#945;&#8208;bromo thioacetate equivalent, which reacts efficiently with nitroolefins in the presence of a low catalyst loading (0.5&#8197;mol%) of cinchona alkaloid squaramide under both &#8220;on water&#8221; and organic homogeneous conditions. The obtained &#945;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitrothioesters undergo an anti&#8208;selective decarboxylation and intramolecular SN2 cyclization process, leading to the formation of desired cyclopropanes. Control experiments were conducted alongside computational studies in order to gain insights into the observed stereoselectivities.

         <title>Selectivity Switch in Non&#8208;Directed Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Olefination of Chlorobenzene Derivatives</title>

Abstract
A palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8722;H olefination of chlorobenzene derivatives, which favored the functionalization at the ortho&#8208;to&#8208;chlorine position, was reported. The catalytic system employed a commercially available quinoline ligand to access a wide panel of olefinated aryl chlorides in moderate to high yields from feedstock chemicals (42 examples, 28 to 93% yields). The synthetic utility of the method was further demonstrated by the coupling of various bio&#8208;relevant acrylate partners offering straightforward access to structurally diverse complex molecules. A computational study of the reaction allowed us to confirm that the C&#8722;H activation step, occurring through a Concerted Metalation&#8208;Deprotonation mechanism, determined the site&#8208;selectivity of the transformation. The regioselectivity was controlled by the pKa of the C&#8722;H bond (more acidic position) and the lower distortion of chlorobenzene in the key transition structure.

Abstract
One&#8208;pot access to sulfonyl 2,3&#8208;diarylnaphthalenes was developed via tBuOK&#8208;mediated (4+2) benzannulation of o&#8208;bis&#8208;sulfonylmethyl arenes, employing diverse diarylacetylenes. A plausible mechanism is proposed and discussed. The advantages of the system include the use of inexpensive reagents, wide substrate scope, and mild reaction conditions. The synthetic route allows for the formation of two carbon&#8211;carbon double bonds (C=C).

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the presence of multiple reactive sites, including an alkyne, an alkene, and a ketone, 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)&#8208;2&#8208;alken&#8208;1&#8208;ones (yne&#8208;enones) can successfully participate in the synthesis of various carbo&#8208;, and heterocycles, as well as acyclic  compounds. In this regard, a wide variety of transition metal catalysts and organocatalysts are utilized in cycloaddition and functionalization reactions of yne&#8208;enones with other coupling partners. Considering the versatility of this synthon, in this review, we have described metal&#8208;catalyzed and non&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations of yne&#8208;enones over the last decade.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Heterocycles are important compounds existed in diverse advanced chemicals, functional materials, bioactive molecules and natural products. Different strategies through transition metal&#8208;catalyzed alkyne cyclization have been developed to synthesize various heterocycles. The merger of alkyne cyclization and metal nanoparticle catalysis has emerged as an important approach to diverse heterocycles. By using different kinds of metal nanoparticle catalysts, such as gold, silver, copper and palladium nanoparticles, a number of heterocycles are prepared with high yield and selectivity in a green, sustainable and highly efficient manner. This review summarizes and discusses recent achievements in metal nanoparticle&#8208;catalyzed alkyne cyclization for the synthesis of heterocycles.</dc:description>

Under the optimized conditions, N&#8208;trifluoroalkyl amides were obtained with yields up to 87%. Control experiments and computational studies reveal that the reaction proceeds through the generation of diazo, in situ formation of nitrile ylide, water addition and final enol tautomerism. This approach features mild reaction conditions, wide substrate tolerance, and scale&#8208;up applicability, which provides an efficient and practical strategy for amide synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction of glycals with base&#8208;labile protecting groups as a new route to glycoporphyrins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycoporphyrins are considered promising photosensitisers of new generation. Herein, we describe the original, metal&#8208;catalysed method towards porphyrin&#8208;carbohydrate C&#8208;C conjugates. The protocol of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction has been developed and it was compatible with peracetylated 2&#8208;iodoglycals. The utility of the reaction was exemplified on 15 different (C&#8208;2)&#8208;arylated sugar derivatives. Then it was applied on more challenging starting materials, namely, porphyrin boronates in which we addressed the issues of difficult transmetalation step usually observed on palladium&#8208;catalysed processes of porphyrin derivatives. The efficiency of the protocol was finally applied to synthesize the library of glycoporphyrins proving the versatile character of this strategy.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Amino Sulfones from Vinyl Sulfones and Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;amino sulfones through visible light&#8208;induced oxidative decarboxylation and radical reductive addition is described. Various readily available N&#8208;protected natural amino acids react with aromatic/aliphatic vinyl sulfones to directly produce &#947;&#8208;amino sulfone derivatives. This reaction is also applicable to &#945;&#8208;N(O)&#8208;acids and other aliphatic carboxylic acids, resulting in the corresponding sulfone derivatives. The method operates without the need for sacrificial reducing agents or additional hydrogen atom donors. The sole by&#8208;product is CO2 released from decarboxylation, rendering the process both atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Access to &#946;&#8208;gem&#8208;Difluorinated Alcohols Through Enzymatic Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
We report here a mild process to access diversely functionalized enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluorinated (S)&#8208;alcohols by using biocatalytic reduction in &gt;99% yield and enantiomeric excesses ranging from 96% to &gt;99%. This novel approach involves enzymatic reduction of &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluorinated heterocyclic and carbocyclic ketone derivatives as well as an acyclic gem&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;ketosulfone and proceeds under mild conditions at 30&#8201;&#176;C under aqueous conditions to produce a range of high added value enantioenriched difluorinated alcohols including 3,3&#8208;difluorochromanol, 3,3&#8208;difluorothiochromanol, 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;dihydroquinolinol, and &#945;&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfone derivatives. A comparative study between enzymatic reduction and metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation was carried out as well.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Formation of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes Using Oxime Esters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
In this manuscript a general photocatalytic approach for the synthesis of alkyl&#8208;substituted gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes using readily available oxime esters and 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoroprop&#8208;2&#8208;ene (BDFP) has been established. This strategy involving a radical bromo elimination provides access to a large variety of value&#8208;added fluorinated molecules. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with many functional groups including complex natural products or drug molecules. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic investigations indicate that the efficiency of the process relies on the crucial role of imine radical, which is formed after photoexcitation via energy transfert (EnT) and decarboxylation of the oxime ester. Indeed, the imine radical would either behave as a bromine radical scavenger or an XAT promoter in this reaction.

         <title>TBHP&#8208;Mediated Hydroxyperfluoroalkylation of Alkenes with Perfluoroalkyl Iodides to Construct &#946;&#8208;Perfluoroalkyl Alcohols</title>

Abstract
A three&#8208;component strategy for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl allyl alcohols from 1,3&#8208;dienes is developed. A diverse range of synthetically valuable &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl allyl alcohols are obtained in moderate to high yields. Broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance are observed. This method is also applicable to mono&#8208;olefins and 1,3&#8208;enynes. The control experiment results demonstrate that the hydroxyl group OH in the product comes from TBHP. In addition, the practicality and mild reaction conditions make these synthetic transformations attractive and valuable for organic synthesis.

         <title>Recent Advances in Radical Transformations of Propargylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Propargylic alcohols are regarded as a class of readily available and versatile synthons in organic synthesis. Due to their unique bifunctional character, the transformation of propargylic alcohols has been widely utilized as a powerful strategy for the construction of various functionalized frameworks over the past few decades. Recently, the radical transformation of propargylic alcohols has attracted considerable attention in synthetic chemistry. This review summarizes recent progress in the radical transformation of propargylic alcohols. Based on the different mechanisms of radical formation underlying these transformations, this review has been divided into four parts: (1) transition&#8208;metal catalyzed radical transformation; (2) photo&#8208;induced radical transformation; (3) electro&#8208;induced radical transformation; and (4) metal&#8208;free or oxidant&#8208;mediated radical transformation of propargylic alcohols.

Abstract
A scalable procedure for the synthesis of 4,6&#8208;difluorotryptophan is reported based on a deaminative coupling of a 4,6&#8208;difluorogramine with 2&#8208;benzylthio&#8208;1,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;imidazolone as glycine equivalent. Thus prepared 4,6&#8208;difluorotryptophan was incorporated into the C&#8208;terminal domain of the HIV&#8208;1 capsid protein (CA&#8208;CTD), and 19F spectra of the 4,6&#8208;difluoro Trp CA CTD were recorded and compared to the singly fluorinated counterparts.

Abstract
We report herein a palladium&#8208;catalyzed, site&#8208;selective cyclative annulation of o&#8208;alkynyl arylamides with maleimide for the stereoselective construction of succinimide&#8208;fused benzoxazine derivatives. This operationally simple and modular protocol provides access to polycyclic frameworks. The other associated features are high functional group compatibility, gram&#8208;scale synthetic potential, and downstream transformations. Control and labeling experiments were conducted to get insights into the mechanism.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report herein a palladium-catalyzed, site-selective cyclative annulation of &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-alkynyl arylamides with maleimide for the stereoselective construction of succinimide-fused benzoxazine derivatives. This operationally simple and modular protocol provides access to polycyclic frameworks. The other associated features are high functional group compatibility, gram-scale synthetic potential, and downstream transformations. Control and labeling experiments were conducted to get insights into the mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Arylations of Ketimines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Arylation of ketimines is the most straightforward strategy for constructing chiral &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines, important structural motifs found in natural products and biologically active compounds. This comprehensive review highlights the achievements in the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed and organocatalyzed asymmetric arylations of ketimines from the seminal report published in 2010 till November 2023. The review is divided into three chapters: (1) Arylation of diaryl ketimines, (2) Arylation of aryl&#8208;alkyl and aryl&#8208;acyl ketimines, and (3) Arylation of acyl&#8208;alkyl and dialkyl ketimines. Each chapter is further divided into transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions (grouped by individual metals) and organocatalyzed reactions. The covered literature includes emphasis on the advantages of the reported methodology, its scope and limitations, and the description of the transition state (where applicable).

Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric dearomative arylation of 2&#8208;naphthols enabled by the unconventional reactivity of o&#8208;quinone diimides, i.&#8201;e. the 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition on quinone sp2 hybridized carbon, has been established. Under the catalysis of chiral phosphoric acid, various cyclohexaenones bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter have been prepared with excellent yields and enantioselectivities.

Abstract
The direct diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective Ru(II)&#8208; catalyzed cyclopropanation reaction of alkenes with ((2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoroethyl)sulfinyl)benzene was described. The desired enantioenriched PhSO2CF2&#8208;cyclopropanes were obtained in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities in the presence of a chiral ruthenium complex Ru(II)&#8208;Pheox (17&#8211;94% yields, &gt;20:1 d.r. and 83:17&#8211;98:2 e.r.). The robustness of the approach was showcased and This methodology gave access to chiral 1,2&#8208;trans difluoro&#8208;methylcyclopropanes.

         <title>Tetrafluoropyridinyl Thiolate as a Tool for Enabling Photoredox Alkylation of 1,2,4&#8208;Oxadiazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A method for the radical functionalization of 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazoles using alkyl halides as precursors of radicals is described. The reaction efficiency is determined by potassium tetrafluoropyridinyl thiolate additive, which plays dual role. First, the thiolate converts alkyl halides into more reactive fluorinated aryl sulfides, which undergo photoredox activation of the C&#8722;S bond. Second, the thiolate decreases the unproductive loss of alkyl radicals by converting them back to the sulfides.

         <title>Electrochemical Trifluoromethylalkoxylation of Endocyclic Enamides in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A regioselective electrochemical oxytrifluoromethylation of endocyclic enamides is reported. The 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization proceeds under mild conditions and employs the inexpensive bench stable Langlois&#8217; reagent. This multicomponent strategy gives access to a wide range of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;substituted amines by means of various alcohols as nucleophiles in high yields and with good functional group tolerance. In addition, an electrochemically induced C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of enamides has been developed. A continuous flow protocol using a commercial microflow electrochemical reactor was also developed with improved reaction performance and efficiency over traditional batch versions without any supporting electrolyte.
