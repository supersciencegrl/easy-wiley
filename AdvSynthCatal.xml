         <title>A Rh(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Cyclization of 1,5&#8208;Bisallenes and Alkynes for the Formation of cis&#8208;3,4&#8208;Arylvinyl Pyrrolidines and Cyclopentanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cascade cyclization reactions of 1,5&#8208;bisallenes grant access to a great variety of products by precisely tuning the catalyst system and/or the reagents involved. Herein, we present our findings that 1,5&#8208;bisallenes react with two molecules of dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate to afford, in a completely diastereoselective manner, cis&#8208;3,4&#8208;arylvinyl pyrrolidines and cyclopentanes. DFT calculations have been used to postulate a mechanism for the developed reaction which encompasses a [2+2+2] cycloaddition reaction of the two alkynes and the external double bond of one allene, followed by a cycloisomerization involving the internal double bond of the second allene.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bio&#8208;based Silane Coupling Agents by the Modification of Eugenol
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple method for the synthesis of new bio&#8208;based silane coupling agents (SCAs) with a terpene aromatic core by the functionalization of cheap, natural eugenol and its sulfur derivatives using the hydrosilylation of the C=C bonds with HSi(OEt)3,  followed by nucleophilic substitution reactions of OH/SH groups is presented. The obtained alkoxysilanes possess different polymer&#8208;reactive functionalities (alkenyl, epoxide, thiirane, thiocarbamoyl, thioester, thioether moieties). This new group of biogenic SCAs was fully characterized using 1H, 13C, 29Si NMR, FT&#8208;IR, GC&#8208;MS, and HRMS or elemental analysis. Examples of their application as additives to tire rubbers and their influence on several factors are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Recyclable, Immobilized Transition&#8208;Metal Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The use of transition&#8208;metal complexes as photocatalysts have allowed the performance of diverse organic transformations in an outstanding manner, characterized not only by high yields, TOF, and selectivity values, but also by modulating and providing access to novel molecular structures that, without them, would be difficult if not impossible. However, one of the biggest concerns regarding the use of these photocatalysts relies on the difficulties associated with their isolation from reaction media and reutilization once the chemical process ends. The above, besides contaminating reaction products and requiring out tedious purification processes, prompts the inevitable loss of the catalyst, directly affecting its recyclability. In addition, this situation results in negative outcomes from an economic and environmental perspective, since transition&#8208;metal complexes are usually expensive materials, and their unsuccessful recovery could result in leakage into the environment. These drawbacks served as inspiration for the elaboration of the present review focused on the development of novel strategies developed during the last decade for the successful recovery of these species. The strategies summarized herein, whether for homogeneous or heterogeneous systems, are based on the use of thermotropic solvents, changes in the hydrophilic balance of the catalyst, the employment of polymers, copolymers, porous macromolecular structures, and inorganic nanostructures as support of these entities. Moreover, the use of organized and confining media, such as micelles and gels in this context, is also discussed. We hope that this review will motivate the search for new strategies to develop novel catalytic systems, understanding that high performance is based not only on yields but also on recyclability, sustainability, and responsibility to the environment.

         <title>Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective C&#8722;H Allylation and Prenylation of Indoles at C4&#8208;Position</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Herein, Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C4&#8208;selective C&#8722;H allylation and prenylation of indoles by using a weak carbonyl coordination directing group have been reported. By employing 5&#8208;methylene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxan&#8208;2&#8208;ones, 4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolan&#8208;2&#8208;ones and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;butadiene as scalable cross&#8208;coupling partners, these divergent synthesis protocols proceed smoothly under redox&#8208;neutral reaction conditions, delivering various allylated and prenylated indoles in moderate to satisfied yields. This transformation exhibits high functional&#8208;groups compatibility and broad substrate scope. Scale&#8208;up experiment and mechanistic studies were also accomplished.

         <title>From Stoichiometric Reagents to Catalytic Partners: Selenonium Salts as Alkylating Agents for Nucleophilic Displacement Reactions in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The ability of chalcogenium salts to transfer an electrophilic moiety to a given nucleophile is well known. However, up to date, these reagents have been used in stoichiometric quantities, producing a substantial amount of waste as byproducts of the reaction. In this report, we disclose further investigation of selenonium salts as S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) surrogates for the alkylation of nucleophiles in aqueous solutions. Most importantly, we were able to convert the stoichiometric process to a catalytic system employing as little as 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% of selenides to accelerate the reaction between benzyl bromide and other alkylating agents with sodium cyanide in water. Probe experiments including 77Se NMR and HRMS of the reaction mixture have unequivocally shown the presence of the selenonium salt in the reaction mixture.

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyzed (3+2)&#8208;Cycloaddition of Thioketones and Indole&#8208;2&#8208;Carbinols Toward Thiazolo[3,4&#8208;a]indoles</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed approach to access the yet unknown heterocyclic motif of thiazolo[3,4&#8208;a]indoles in a one&#8208;pot reaction under very mild conditions. A broad range of thiazolo[3,4&#8208;a]indoles was generated from indole&#8208;2&#8208;methanols and thioketones with 45&#8211;99% yield and good functional group tolerance. The practicality of the process and the synthetic potential of the products were demonstrated with an upscaling experiment and further transformations. Additional control experiments provided mechanistic insights into this cycloaddition.

     alt="Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyzed (3+2)-Cycloaddition of Thioketones and Indole-2-Carbinols Toward Thiazolo[3,4-a]indoles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report a Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed approach to access the yet unknown heterocyclic motif of thiazolo[3,4-a]indoles in a one-pot reaction under very mild conditions. A broad range of thiazolo[3,4-a]indoles was generated from indole-2-methanols and thioketones with 45&#8211;99% yield and good functional group tolerance. The practicality of the process and the synthetic potential of the products were demonstrated with an upscaling experiment and further transformations. Additional control experiments provided mechanistic insights into this cycloaddition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Single Electron Transfer&#8208;Induced Selective &#945;&#8208;Oxygenation of Glycine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Modification of amino acids is an important strategy in organic and bioorganic chemistry. In contrast to common side&#8208;chain functionalization, backbone modification is much less explored. Especially glycine units seem to be attractive and versatile since a wide range of functionality can be potentially introduced. We report here oxidative modification of glycinates that are stable and enable further functionalization. Selective glycinate enolate oxidation by TEMPO or a FeCp2PF6/TEMPO reagent combination provides stable alkoxyamines in good to excellent yields. The methodology is expanded to glycine&#8208;containing dipeptides demonstrating selective oxygenation at the glycine unit. The orthogonal reactivity potential of oxygenated glycines for transformation to other amino acid derivatives is explored.

Abstract
A microwave&#8208;assisted, base&#8208;promoted, tandem cyclization reaction strategy has been developed for the synthesis of cyclohepta[b]chromones and spiro cyclohepta[b]chromones. Readily accessible &#947;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;diketones undergo intramolecular cyclization and 7&#8208;endo&#8208;trig carbocyclization to afford various cycloheptane&#8208;annelated chromones in one&#8208;pot reactions. This metal&#8208;free protocol also led to the generation of polycyclic ring with a new C&#8722;C bond and a new C&#8722;O bond.

Abstract
Enantioselective Michael addition of &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds toward nitroalkenes were realized by using an immobilized, N&#8208;terminal&#8208;guanidinylated peptide, H2N&#8722;C(=NH)&#8722;Trp&#8722;Trp&#8722;(Leu&#8722;Leu&#8722;Aib)3&#8722;PEG&#8722;PS&#8208;resin (Aib=2&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid), as catalyst. Viable nucleophiles were acetylacetone, dimethyl malonate, and &#946;&#8208;ketoesters. The electrophiles include the &#946;&#8208;nitrostryrenes with various substituents on the benzene ring and the aliphatic nitroalkenes. Sterically congested &#945;&#8208;ethoxycarbonyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostryrene also successfully reacted. The resin&#8208;supported catalyst could be recycled for five times.

         <title>Asymmetric Addition and Cycloaddition Reactions with Ylidene&#8208;Five&#8208;Membered Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Five&#8208;membered heterocycles bearing an exocyclic double bond have been successfully used as substrates in asymmetric addition and cycloaddition reactions. Ylidene&#8208;heterocycles are attractive substrates due to their high functionalization and the presence of an electrophilic conjugated exocyclic double bound that can participate in nucleophilic addition reactions as well as cycloaddition reactions, which may be triggered by the formation of aromatic intermediates or products in many cases. During the last decades, catalytic methodologies have been developed using ylidene&#8208;heterocycles as substrates in order to synthesize useful optically active heterocyclic derivatives. 4&#8208;Ylidene&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones, isoxazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ones, 2,3&#8208;dioxopyrrolidines, rhodanines, oxazolidindiones, Erlenmeyer&#8208;Ploch azlactones and 5&#8208;ylidene&#8208;thiazolones have been successfully used as substrates in asymmetric reactions. This review collects the powerful research in asymmetric addition and cycloaddition reactions where ylidene&#8208;five&#8208;membered heterocycles have been used.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Methyl Ketones from Allylic Alcohols and Methanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
One&#8208;pot synthesis of &#945;&#8208;methyl ketones starting from 1,3&#8208;diaryl propenols or 1&#8208;aryl propenols and methanol as a C1 source is demonstrated. This one&#8208;pot isomerization&#8208;methylation is catalyzed by commercially available Pd(OAc)2 with H2O as the only by&#8208;product. Mechanistic studies and deuterium labelling experiments indicate the involvement of isomerization of allyl alcohol followed by methylation through a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing pathway in these isomerization&#8208;methylation reactions.

An asymmetric addition of arylboronic acids to pyrazolinone ketimines is reported using palladium/chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;disulfonyl bisimidazoline (Bim) catalytic system, producing 25&#8197;examples of enantioenriched 4&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;pyrazolones bearing one quaternary carbon stereocenter with 60&#8211;91% yields and 81&#8211;98%&#8201;ee. The reaction demonstrates remarkable compatibility regarding pyrazolinone ketimines and arylboronic acids, rendering an enantioselective access to chiral aza&#8208;heterocycles bearing &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines.

Abstract
A gold&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular tandem cyclization of alkynol&#8208;tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes was reported in this paper, providing a synthetic route to access naphthalene&#8208;fused eight&#8208; to eleven&#8208;membered cyclic ether derivatives in moderate to good yields. On the basis of control experiments and DFT calculations, a reasonable reaction mechanism involving a gold carbene intermediate was proposed, which was formed via the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig enyne cyclization process.

Abstract
Oxazolidinone represents a class of most important five&#8208;membered cyclic carbamates. They are of great significance for modern organic synthesis and are widespread as pharmacologically active compounds. This review summarizes recent advances in the chemistry of 2&#8208;oxazolidinones, with an emphasis on their synthesis, employing different catalytic systems or catalyst&#8208;free conditions, as well as on their ring&#8208;opening transformations through decarboxylative coupling, covering the period from 2010 to early 2021. Detailed mechanistic aspects are highlighted, hoping to help researchers to explore the hidden opportunities for reaction discoveries.

         <title>Dimsyl Anion Enables Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Charge Transfer in Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of Aryl Halides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A methodology is reported for visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted synthesis of unsymmetrical chalcogenides enabled by dimsyl anion in the absence of transition&#8208;metals or photoredox catalysts. The cross&#8208;coupling reaction between aryl halides and diaryl dichalcogenides proceeds with electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;poor, and heteroaromatic moieties. Mechanistic investigations using UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations, and control reactions suggest that dimsyl anion forms an electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex capable of absorbing blue light, leading to a charge transfer responsible for generation of aryl radicals from aryl halides. This previously unreported mechanistic pathway may be applied to other light&#8208;induced transformations performed in DMSO in the presence of bases and aryl halides.

         <title>Photocatalytic Atom&#8208;Transfer Radical Addition of Activated Chlorides to Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A protocol for performing atom transfer radical addition of activated alkyl chlorides to alkenes is described. The reaction is promoted by blue light in the presence of an organic photocatalyst (3DPA2FBN), serving to generate free radicals, and a copper complex (IMesCuCl), which facilitates the chlorine transfer step. The reaction works efficiently with fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated &#945;&#8208;chloroesters.

         <title>Regioselective Hydroperoxylation of Aziridines and Epoxides Only with Aqueous Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A catalyst and organic solvent&#8208;free regioselective hydroperoxylation of aziridines and epoxides, including spiroaziridine&#8208; and spiroepoxy oxindoles have been explored with commercially available 50% aq. H2O2. This method provides an access to secondary benzylic &#946;&#8208;hydroperoxy amines and &#8208;alcohols and tertiary 3&#8208;hydroperoxy oxindoles. The protocol is also applicable to the less reactive alkyl aziridines. Furthermore, an acid&#8208;catalyzed Kornblum&#8208;DeLaMare type rearrangement of secondary benzylic hydroperoxide has also been revealed to afford amino&#8208; and hydroxyl ketones.

Abstract
We presented a palladium&#8208;catalyzed domino cyclization/phosphorylation of gem&#8208;dibromoolefins, which utilize H&#8208;phosphinates and secondary phosphine oxides as the phosphine sources, respectively. A variety of phosphorylated heteroaromatics were obtained in moderate to good yields with wide functional group compatibility. This one&#8208;pot reaction enables multiple bond&#8208;forming events including C&#8722;X (X=O, N, S) and C&#8722;P bonds using easily available starting materials. Moreover, this protocol can be easily applied to large&#8208;scale preparation and late&#8208;stage functionalization.

         <title>Transannulation of Pyridotriazoles with Naphthoquinones and Indoles: Synthesis of Benzo[f]Pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]Indoles and Indolizino[3,2&#8208;b]indoles</title>

Abstract
Ruthenium catalysed denitrogenative transannulation of pyridotriazoles with naphthoquinones provided the transannulated benzo[f]pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indoles derivatives in good to excellent yields. While pyridotriazoles with indoles in presence of PivOH and oxone yield indolizino[3,2&#8208;b]indoles under metal&#8208;free conditions. Quinone annulation proceeds through ruthenium&#8208;carbenoid intermediate while indole annulation may proceed via a diazo&#8208;pyridinium intermediate. Control experiments suggest that both the transformations follow the ionic mechanism.

Abstract
The Cu&#8208;catalyzed high&#8208;chemoselective trifluoromethylation reactions of unactivated cycloalkenes via the modulation of appropriate ligands have been explored. The Cu(I)/appropriate ligands&#8208;catalytic systems overcome the key challenge in differentiating two pathways involving radical intermediates and provide a ligand&#8208;controlled approach for site&#8208;specific spiro&#8208;aryltrifluoromethylation and chlorotrifluoromethylation to afford trifluoromethylated spiro&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline compounds and vicinal Cl&#8208;containing trifluoromethyl cycloalkanes. Moreover, compared with reported chlorine sources, 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane is used as more green and economical feedstock for chlorotrifluoromethylation.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of N&#8208;Substituted &#947;&#8208;Amino Esters and &#947;&#8208;Lactams Containing &#945;,&#947;&#8208;Stereogenic Centers via a Stereoselective Enzymatic Cascade</title>

Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Amino esters and &#947;&#8208;lactams containing &#945;,&#947;&#8208;stereogenic centers are widely used as chiral intermediates in various bioactive compounds, while their efficient synthesis remains a challenge. Herein, an enzymatic cascade reaction involving an ene reductase (ERED) and an imine reductase (IRED) for accessing to &#945;,&#947;&#8208;stereospecific &#947;&#8208;amino esters and &#947;&#8208;lactams from &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;ketoesters has been developed. 21 EREDs and 13 IREDs have been identified with high activity and stereoselectivity toward various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;ketoesters and the corresponding chiral &#947;&#8208;ketoesters, respectively. By employing suitable ERED and IRED, (1S,3S), (1S,3R), (1R,3S), and (1R,3R) stereoisomers of methyl 3&#8208;(cyclopropyl amino) cyclohexane&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylate were obtained as a single stereoisomer in 63&#8211;72% yield, and (3R,5R)&#8208; and (3R,5S)&#8208;1&#8208;cyclopropyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one and 1&#8208;cyclopropyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;dipropylpyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one were also prepared as a single stereoisomer in 60&#8211;65% yields. This study establishes an environmentally friendly enzymatic route for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;amino esters and &#947;&#8208;lactams containing &#945;,&#947;&#8208;stereogenic centers.

         <title>Tailoring the Reactivity of the Langlois Reagent and Styrenes with Cyanoarenes Organophotocatalysts under Visible&#8208;Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The selective one&#8208;step access to fluoroalkylated hexestrol derivatives, nonsteroidal estrogens, is achieved in good to excellent isolated yields under organophotoredox conditions by using the stable and easy to handle Langlois reagent. Furthermore, the challenging selective hydrotrifluoromethylation of styrenes proceeds under mild reaction conditions without the requirement for any additive. We assume that the solvent drives the reaction pathway towards either the reduction or the dimerization of the radical intermediate generated after initial addition of the fluoroalkyl radical to the styrene. The versatility of the developed system is also extended to encompass radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling as exemplified here using cyanopyridine. Mechanistic investigations including luminescence and EPR spectroscopy allow to shed light on the different mechanisms.

Abstract
This report discloses an electrochemical oxidative C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross coupling method for the synthesis of C&#8208;2/C&#8208;3 azolated halo&#8208;indoles/thiophenes under metal catalyst&#8208;free and external chemical oxidant free condition. Hydrogen gas was the only byproduct of this C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The synthetic utility of this electrochemical approach is highlighted by its easy scalabity and compatibility with highly functional indoles and azoles.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report discloses an electrochemical oxidative C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross coupling method for the synthesis of C-2/C-3 azolated halo-indoles/thiophenes under metal catalyst-free and external chemical oxidant free condition. Hydrogen gas was the only byproduct of this C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross-coupling reaction. The synthetic utility of this electrochemical approach is highlighted by its easy scalabity and compatibility with highly functional indoles and azoles. The retention of halogen on the heterocycles could serve as a useful functional group for future late-stage modifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
An approach for the synthesis of selenaheterocycles starting from aryl diazonium salts was developed. The one&#8208;pot process and subsequent visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated silver&#8208;catalyzed cyclization enabled the synthesis of selenaheterocycles in the absence of a photocatalyst. The reactions were carried out under mild conditions without the use of toxic or sensitive reagents.

         <title>Enzyme access tunnel engineering in Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases to improve oxidative stability and biocatalyst performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide is involved in a variety of enzyme catalysis as an oxidant or toxic by&#8208;product. Thereby, attenuation of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;driven oxidative stress is one of the key issues for preparative biocatalysis. Here, a rational approach to improve the robustness of enzymes, in particular, Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) against H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was investigated. The enzyme access tunnels, which may serve as exit paths for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the active site to the bulk, were predicted by using the CAVER and/or protein energy landscape exploration (PELE) software for the phenylacetone monooxygenase variant (PAMO_C65D) from &lt;i&gt;Thermobifida fusca &lt;/i&gt;and the BVMO from &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas putida&lt;/i&gt; KT2440. The amino acid residues, which are susceptible to oxidation by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (e.g., methionine and tyrosine) and located in vicinity of the predicted H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; migration paths, were substituted with less reactive or inert amino acids (e.g., leucine and isoleucine). This led to design of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;resistant enzyme variants, which became robust biocatalysts for synthetic applications. For instance, the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;resistant &lt;i&gt;P. putida&lt;/i&gt; BVMO reached turnover numbers of 4,100 for the BV oxygenation of 4&#8208;decanone, which is 2.8&#8208;fold greater than the parent enzyme. Moreover, the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;resistant &lt;i&gt;P. putida&lt;/i&gt; BVMO allowed 2&#8208;fold enhancement in titer of 9&#8208;(nonanoyloxy)nonanoic acid (&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;) formation in a cascade fatty acid biotransformation. Therefore, it was assumed that the CAVER/PELE&#8208;based H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; migration path engineering represents an efficient rational design approach to improve not only oxidative stability but also biotransformation performance of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;forming or utilizing enzymes (e.g., BVMOs, oxidases, and peroxidases).</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the method for synthesis of indole&#8208; and pyrrole&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered nitrogen heterocycles by means of acid&#8211;base switchable cyclization reactions. The reactions involved cleavage of amide C&#8211;N bonds, chemoselective N&#8208;1 or C&#8208;3 acylation, and 1,4&#8208;Michael addition. This method could be used to construct two different kinds of seven&#8208;membered rings in one step from the same starting material without the need for a transition&#8208;metal catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>A Unified Approach for Divergent Synthesis of Heterocycles via TMSOTf&#8208;Catalyzed Formal [3+2] Cycloaddition of Electron&#8208;Rich Alkynes</title>

Abstract
We present a synthetic protocol for the construction of polysubstituted five&#8208;membered heterocycles via TMSOTf&#8208;catalyzed formal [3+2] cycloaddition of electron&#8208;rich alkynes, which features free from any metal, atom economy and water as the main by&#8208;product. Furthermore, alkenyl ether adduct has been verified as the key intermediate. Notably, by utilizing this approach, we can synthesize a broad range of polysubstituted furans, thiophenes and pyrroles, and extend this transformation to deliver fused&#8208;polyheterocycles. This reaction can be achieved on a gram scale and the corresponding products are intermediates for producing diverse potentially useful scaffolds.

Abstract
The o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketone skeleton is prevalent in many biologically active natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Herein, a two&#8208;step protocol has been developed for synthesis of various &#946;&#8208;substituted o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketones. A base&#8208;mediated ring opening of 4&#8208;chromanone was used to introduce the &#946;&#8208;ethoxyl o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketone intermediary, followed by nucleophile substitution under BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O assisted conditions to give the desired &#946;&#8208;carbon, nitrogen, or thiol substituted o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketones. With the aid of this protocol, a silica&#8208;supported cobalt(II) salen complex was successfully prepared and its structure was confirmed by FTIR, 13C MAS NMR, UV&#8208;Vis absorption, and XPS spectra. The immobilized cobalt(II) salen catalyst not only displayed comparable catalytic activity in the synthesis of several heterocycles including 1,3&#8208;oxazolidine, benzimidazole, and benzoxazole as compared with their homogeneous counterparts, but also could be recycled for several times without obvious loss of its catalytic activity.

Abstract
Recent years have witnessed a continuous development of photocatalysts to satisfy the growing demand of photophysical and redox properties in photoredox catalysis, with complex structures or alternative strategies devised to access highly reducing or oxidising systems. We report herein the use of peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene (PXX), a simple and inexpensive dye, as an efficient photocatalyst. Its highly reducing excited state allows activation of a wide range of substrates, thus triggering useful radical reactions. Benchmark transformations such as the addition of organic radicals, generated by photoreduction of organic halides, to radical traps are initially demonstrated. More complex dual catalytic manifolds are also shown to be accessible: the &#946;&#8208;arylation of cyclic ketones is successful when using a secondary amine as organocatalyst, while cross&#8208;coupling reactions of aryl halides with amines and thiols are obtained when using a Ni co&#8208;catalyst. Application to the efficient two&#8208;step synthesis of the expensive fluoro&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrido[4,3&#8208;b]indole, a crucial synthetic intermediate for the investigational drug setipiprant, has been also demonstrated.

         <title>Stereo&#8208; and Regioselective [3+3] Annulation Reaction Catalyzed by Ytterbium: Synthesis of Bicyclic 1,4&#8208;Dihydropyridines</title>

Abstract
An ytterbium catalyzed formal [3+3] cycloaddition of cyclic enamines and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones catalyzed is reported. The reaction proceeds with a &#8216;head to tail&#8217; regioselectivity through a conjugate addition of the enamine moiety followed by an amine&#8208;carbonyl condensation. In addition the use of chiral enamines provided a high degree of stereoselectivity, driven by a possible balance between steric and &#960;&#8208;stacking effects. The resulting bicyclic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines were evaluated as antiproliferative agents against A549 (carcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cell) and SKOV3 (human ovarian carcinoma) human tumor cell lines. Good toxicities were found for some of the compounds against A549 and SKOV3 cell lines, with best IC50 values of 0.89&#8197;&#956;M for A549 and 6.69&#8197;&#956;M for SKOV3, and a very good selectivity was observed towards MRC5 (non&#8208;malignant) cell lines.

The reaction proceeds with a &#8216;head to tail&#8217; regioselectivity through a conjugate addition of the enamine moiety followed by an amine-carbonyl condensation. In addition the use of chiral enamines provided a high degree of stereoselectivity, driven by a possible balance between steric and &#960;-stacking effects. The resulting bicyclic 1,4-dihydropyridines were evaluated as antiproliferative agents against A549 (carcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cell) and SKOV3 (human ovarian carcinoma) human tumor cell lines. Good toxicities were found for some of the compounds against A549 and SKOV3 cell lines, with best IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 0.89&#8197;&#956;M for A549 and 6.69&#8197;&#956;M for SKOV3, and a very good selectivity was observed towards MRC5 (non-malignant) cell lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
An enantioselective phosphine&#8208;catalyzed transformation has been developed for the synthesis of chiral cyclobutene triesters and fluorinated spirocyclic compounds. The strategy involved a P(III)/P(V) redox cycling process, via in&#8197;situ reduction of phosphine oxide with phenylsilane. This catalytic methodology has enabled the enantioselective synthesis of functionalized cyclobutenes (24 examples, up to 94% ee). On the occasion of the extension of this study to &#945;&#8208;ketoester indenone substrates, a surprising reactivity has been discovered for the synthesis of spiro&#8208;indenone products.

         <title>Protein Engineering of d&#8208;Succinylase from Cupriavidus sp. for d&#8208;Amino Acid Synthesis and the Structural Implications</title>

Abstract
d&#8208;Amino acids are important chiral building blocks for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Previously, we have used d&#8208;Succinylase (DSA) from Cupriavidus sp. P4&#8208;10&#8208;C and N&#8208;succinyl amino acid racemase (NSAR, EC.4.2.1.113) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus NCA1503 to produce d&#8208;amino acids via the dynamic kinetic resolution of N&#8208;succinyl&#8208;dl&#8208;amino acids. However, the use of this bioconversion system remains challenging for industrial application due to the insufficient enantioselectivity of DSA toward N&#8208;succinyl&#8208;d&#8208;amino acids. Therefore, we screened DSA mutants for improved enantioselectivity by directed evolution. Several mutants showed improved enantioseletivity compared to wild&#8208;type DSA. L182E mutant had superior enantioselectivity, and the thermal stability was also remarkably improved by this single mutation. We solved the crystal structure of the L182E mutant in complex with succinic acids at a resolution 2.0&#8197;&#197;. The mutated residues in all generated mutants that showed improved enantioselectivity (including the substituted Glu182 in the L182E mutant) are found very close to the active site. The solved crystal structure also provides some rationale to explain the higher thermostability of the L182E mutant compared to wild&#8208;type DSA. d&#8208;phenylalanine and d&#8208;tryptophan were produced in high conversion (approximately 90%) with 98.8% ee and 99.6% ee, respectively, using coupled L182E DSA and NSAR with the one&#8208;pot enzymatic method. These data suggested that L182E DSA may be a useful biocatalyst for industrial d&#8208;amino acids production.

Abstract
The pyridone fragment in the ligand [2, 2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridin]&#8208;6(1H)&#8208;one (bipy&#8208;6&#8208;OH) enables the oxidative Heck reaction of simple arenes with oxygen as the sole oxidant and no redox mediator. Arenes with either electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing groups can be functionalized in this way. Experimental data on the reaction with toluene as the model arene shows that the C&#8722;H activation step is turnover limiting and that the ligand structure is crucial to facilitate the reaction, which supports the involvement of the pyridone fragment in the C&#8722;H activation step. In the case of fluoroarenes, the alkenylation of mono and 1,2&#8208;difluoro benzenes requires the presence of bipy&#8208;6&#8208;OH. In contrast, this ligand is detrimental for the alkenylation of 1,3&#8208;difluoro, tri, tetra and pentafluoro benzenes which can be carried out using just [Pd(OAc)2]. This correlates with the acidity of the fluoroarenes, the most acidic undergoing easier C&#8722;H activation so other steps of the reaction such as the coordination&#8208;insertion of the olefin become kinetically important for polyfluorinated arenes. The use of just a catalytic amount of sodium molybdate as a base proved to be optimal in all these reactions.

Abstract
A series of pyridinium and bipyridinium salts were prepared and their catalytic properties were evaluated in the aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between imines and Danishefsky diene. Depending on the substituents of the pyridinium/bipyridinium rings and on the nature of the counterion, two mechanisms of activation were demonstrated. In case of non&#8208;substituted rings, the substrate is activated through charge transfer involving the aryl ring on the C&#8208;side of the imine. When halogen atoms were introduced on the catalysts, the activation mode switched to halogen bond involving the imine nitrogen lone pair. Moreover, alternative activation modes based on hydrogen bonding and radical cation were ruled out. This work allowed us to develop two families of catalysts whose potential was demonstrated in the cycloaddition of various imines with Danishefsky diene. The first family is composed of the simple methyl pyridinium triflate and dioctyl bipyridinium triflate. The former is active only with imines bearing a p&#8208;methoxyphenyl group on the C&#8208;side and the latter was found to be efficient with imines bearing different substituents on both the N&#8208; and C&#8208;sides of the imines. The second family is based on halogenated pyridinium salts which proved active with almost all considered imines.

The front cover picture illustrates the photophysical and practical properties of PXX (peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene) as novel photocatalyst. A synthetic experiment is portrayed as a video game where you need to choose the right components to start your game: PXX has now been unlocked as a photocatalyst with high reducing power, moderate oxidizing power, high versatility and low cost. In this work, Bonifazi and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the use of PXX in a variety of synthetic transformations, from radical additions, to organocatalytic reactions, to nickel&#8208;catalysed cross couplings. Details can be found in the Research Article by Bonifazi and co&#8208;workers (C. Pezzetta, A. Folli, O. Matuszewska, D. Murphy, R. W. M. Davidson, D. Bonifazi, Adv. Synth.

Abstract
Radical cascade cyclization of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazones/oximes has recently emerged as an efficient and powerful protocol for the construction of diverse and valuable functionalized pyrazolines and isoxazolines. In this review, three catalytic ways of radical cascade cyclization of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazones/oximes are summarized and classified; these are transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed systems, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free systems, and photo&#8208;/electrocatalytic systems, respectively. Through these methods, various functional groups are installed on the pyrazoline and isoxazoline skeletons to enrich the small organic molecule library.

Abstract
As an important branch of the Michael addition reaction, the aza&#8208;Michael addition cascade reaction has been developed rapidly in recent years. This is because the reaction serves as an important method for effectively constructing functionalized C&#8722;N bonds, which can be widely used in the synthesis of chiral drugs and their intermediates and natural products. Given the importance of this topic, this review highlights the recent developments of aza&#8208;Michael addition triggered cascade reactions in asymmetric synthesis, including aza&#8208;Michael/Michael, aza&#8208;Michael/Aldol, aza&#8208;Michael/Henry, aza&#8208;Michael/hemiacetal, aza&#8208;Michael/Mannich, aza&#8208;Michael/alkylation, aza&#8208;Michael/cyclization, aza&#8208;Michael/ring&#8208;opening, aza&#8208;Michael&#8208;IED/HAD, aza&#8208;Michael/INCR, and aza&#8208;Michael/1,6&#8208;conjugate addition reactions. In this paper, the reaction mechanism and derivatization experiments of different reactions are timely introduced to provide a more comprehensive theoretical basis for subsequent studies.

Abstract
A diastereoselective and enantioselective construction of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds is reported. Nishiyama's RuPhebox complex (2.0&#8197;mol% catalyst loading) serves as a chiral Lewis acid catalyst in conjunction with BrCCl3 and a base for the oxidative homocoupling of 2&#8208;acyl imidazoles via the stereocontrolled reaction of intermediate Ru enolates with in&#8197;situ brominated 2&#8208;acyl imidazoles. Cleavage of the achiral imidazole auxiliary provides optically active 2,3&#8208;disubstituted succinic acids which are useful intermediates in the synthesis of chiral compounds like the natural product class of lignans.

Abstract
An iridium/f&#8208;diaphos catalytic system for the enantioselective hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;ketoesters via dynamic kinetic resolution is reported. The desired anti &#946;&#8217;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino esters were obtained in moderate to good yields (60&#8211;95%) with 72&#8211;99% ees and 91:9 to 99:1 drs. This protocol tolerates various functional groups and could be easily conducted on gram scale with lower catalyst loading (TON up to 9100).

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalysed electrophilic N&#8208;imination of aryl(alkenyl) boronic acids with a stable hypervalent iodine(III) reagent containing a transferable (diarylmethylene)amino group is developed. The electrophilic C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling reaction proceeds smoothly at room temperature under oxidant&#8208;free and base&#8208;free conditions, which is further characterized by the broad functional group compatibility, thereof, extending the N&#8208;electrophile scope of electrophilic C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling outside the limitation of N&#8722;O and N&#8722;Cl reagents.

Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed amination to access diarylamines has been developed through C&#8722;CN bond activation of aryl nitriles with anilines. In this developed catalytic protocol, various aromatic and heteroaromatic nitriles could be utilized as the electrophiles to couple with substituted anilines. A diversity of diarylamines were obtained in 15&#8211;95% yields.

Abstract
The reactivity of N&#8208;tosyl vinylaziridines toward arynes has been demonstrated under mild and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions to yield 2&#8208;(phenanthren&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;sulfamides in moderate to good yields. The selective synthesis of N&#8208;H and N&#8208;aryl products was accomplished using CsF in MeCN and KF/18&#8208;C&#8208;6 in 1,4&#8208;dioxane, respectively. This cascade process involves a sequential Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, ring&#8208;opening aromatization, ene&#8208;reaction, and selective N&#8208;arylation reaction.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidative azo&#8208;ene cyclization has been developed. The developed CuI/DMAP/O2 system efficiently facilitates the aerobic oxidation of ene&#8208;containing hydrazides to azo compounds, which undergo azo&#8208;ene cyclizations for the synthesis of oxazolidinones. In addition, the present approach enables the synthesis of lactams, as well as a nitroso&#8208;ene cyclization. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that two carbonyl groups were essential for the successful azo&#8208;ene cyclization and that a concerted mechanism might be plausible for this azo&#8208;ene cyclization.

         <title>Optimizing the Iodide/Iodonium/O2 Oxidation Cycle Enhances the Scope, Selectivity, and Yields of Hydroiodic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Multicomponent Cyclocondensation Reactions</title>

Abstract
Catalytic iodine in the presence of water acts indirectly as a source of Br&#248;nsted acid and, concurrently, generates iodonium ion and hydrogen peroxide, which mediate the final oxidative aromatization step in the multicomponent cyclocondensation of an aromatic amine and two aliphatic aldehyde compounds. The oxidative cycle in this and related iodine&#8208;catalyzed reactions is seldom discussed, generally unoptimized, and rarely investigated in detail. This work establishes that two independent catalytic cycles (H+ and I&#8722;/I+) drive such multicomponent cyclocondensation/ oxidation reactions, provided that the oxidant is generated in sufficient concentration to inhibit oxidation of the dihydroquinoline by the intermediate iminium cation. The complementary dual catalytic cycles, when optimized, act in concert to suppress side product formation, which simplifies isolation and purification of the self&#8208;aggregating products, and increases the efficiency and scope of the Wang&#8208;Kozlov multicomponent reaction.

         <title>Allenamides Playing Domino: A Redox&#8208;Neutral Photocatalytic Synthesis of Functionalized 2&#8208;Aminofurans</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A photoredox catalytic synthesis of functionalized 2&#8208;aminofurans is proposed starting from &#945;&#8208;halo carbonyl substrates and N&#8208;allenamides. The protocol proves to be efficient and sustainable thanks to: i) the use of visible light as green energy source, ii) the redox&#8208;neutral nature of the transformation, allowing to avoid additives and strong oxidants, iii) the mild reaction conditions and the functional groups tolerance, iv) the low photocatalyst loading and the absence of excess reagents, v) the one&#8208;pot formation of three new bonds in a domino sequence. According to our mechanistic hypothesis, the transformation is configured as a double radical&#8208;polar crossover reaction, in which the photocatalyst is excited, oxidized and reduced twice for each molecule of 2&#8208;aminofuran produced. The novelty of the designed synthetic approach also lies in the use of N&#8208;allenamides as substrates, which, after the addition of the first electrophilic radical, preserve a further reactive &#960;&#8208;system, making possible the addition of a second &#945;&#8208;keto radical and enabling the installation of a keto functionality at a remote position. The good yields, the broad scope, and the possibility to further synthetically elaborate the obtained furans make this protocol particularly promising for the construction of useful products.

         <title>Synthesis of Diverse Heterocyclic Scaffolds by (3+3) and (3+4) Cycloannulations of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Vinylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed (3+3) and (3+4) cycloannulations between vinylcyclopropanes and various (hetero)aromatic aldehydes are reported. The use of phosphonate&#8208;substituted vinylcyclopropanes provides access to a variety of bi&#8208; or tricyclic heteroaromatic scaffolds via an allylation/olefination cascade.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palladium-catalyzed (3+3) and (3+4) cycloannulations between vinylcyclopropanes and various (hetero)aromatic aldehydes are reported. The use of phosphonate-substituted vinylcyclopropanes provides access to a variety of bi- or tricyclic heteroaromatic scaffolds via an allylation/olefination cascade. The nature of the mechanism was investigated by various control experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Access to Unsymmetrically Substituted Diaryl Gold N&#8208;Acyclic Carbene (NAC) and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) Complexes via the Isonitrile Route</title>

Abstract
A variety of unsymmetric diaryl gold N&#8208;acyclic carbene (NAC) complexes was synthesized via the isonitrile route by three different methods: (a) solvent free in a melt, (b) mechanochemically and (c) in THF at room temperature. The latter method can also be used to synthesize unsaturated gold NHC complexes. These methods overall offer access to a broad array of new complexes and remove one of the previous limitations of the isonitrile route to NAC and NHC complexes of gold, namely the inability to react with the less nucleophilic aromatic amines. The new complexes also proved to be successful as pre&#8208;catalysts in the gold&#8208;catalyzed phenol synthesis.

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Cyclic Acetals with Spirooxindole Skeleton</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An organocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of cyclic acetal with spirooxindole skeleton has been developed via a domino reaction between isatin and &#947;&#8208;hydroxy enones. Bifunctional squaramide catalyst with adamantyl motif was found to be the most effective for the cascade reaction. With 10 mol% of the catalyst, the desired products were obtained in 1.8:1 to 9:1 diastereo&#8208; and 86% to &gt;99% enantioselectivities from a range of substituted isatins and &#947;&#8208;hydroxy enones.</dc:description>

Abstract
An iodine&#8208;catalyzed double [4+2] oxidative annulation of ketones and diamines is described. A multi&#8208;pathway coupled domino strategy has been developed for the synthesis of substituted dimeric pyrazines under metal&#8208;free conditions. One C&#8722;C and four C&#8722;N bonds are formed during this double [4+2] oxidative annulation process from two ketones and two diamines.

The front cover picture, designed by Pavel G. Sergeev and Daria I. Filina, illustrates the comparison between reactivities of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes and styrylmalonates in the Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed formal cycloadditions with conformationally non&#8208;rigid azadienes. On transition from one synthetic analogue to another, the regioselectivity of the addition can change dramatically from the (3+2)&#8208; to the (4+2)&#8208;pathway. The choice of styrylmalonates has been shown to be preferred in these reactions. The (4+2)&#8208;cycloaddition between styrylmalonates and azadienes was optimized to provide access to the diastereoselective synthesis of substituted tetrahydropyridines in high yields. Details can be found in the Research Article by P. G. Sergeev, R. A. Novikov and Y. V. Tomilov. (P. G. Sergeev, R. A. Novikov, Y. V. Tomilov, Adv. Synth.

         <title>Fabrication of &#969;&#8208;Transaminase@metal&#8208;organic Framework biocomposites for efficiently Synthesizing Benzylamines and Pyridylmethylamines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, ten &#969;&#8208;transaminases (&#969;&#8208;TAs) have been investigated to efficiently catalyze the synthesis of twenty&#8208;four functionalized benzylamines and pyridylmethylamines. We optimized the reactions, screened suitable amino donors and compared &#969;&#8208;transaminases activities for all aromatic aldehyde substrates. Under the optimized conditions, eighteen aromatic amines have been obtained with 60.4%&#8208;96.6% conversions and isolated only via simple extraction and recrystallization with 18.5%&#8208;81% yields on a preparative scale. Furthermore, we first immobilized the Bm&#8208;STA onto the MOFs via the physical adsorption to overcome the limitation of free enzyme and improve their industrial applications. The obtained Bm&#8208;STA/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 composites exhibited not only high enzymes loading (80.4 mg&#183;g&#8208;1) and enzyme activity recovery (95.8%), but also the better reusability, storage stability, pH stability and the tolerance to acetone and DMF.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Functionalization of Imidazopyridine and Indazole: An Overview</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis offers a mild, simple, and efficient tool for the preparation of interesting and useful molecules, thus eluding severe chemical oxidizing and reducing agents used in conventional synthetic methods. In particular, electrochemical C&#8722;H activation is expected to play an important role in the direct functionalization of heterocyclic compounds. Over the past few decades, the research interest in imidazopyridine and indazole has increased significantly due to their multipurpose uses in medicinal and industrial chemistry. Therefore, structural modification of these heterocycles using electro&#8208;oxidation has become one of the important research topics among synthetic organic chemistry in recent time. This review provides a comprehensive discussion of electrochemical functionalization of indazoles and imidazopyridines published so far. A summary of the current challenges and the future direction for the development of efficient and green electrochemical methods for functionalization of these heterocycles is also presented.

         <title>Mechanochemical Transformation of CF3 Group: Synthesis of Amides and Schiff Bases</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
We communicate two mild, solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical coupling transformations of CF3 group with nitro compounds into amides or Schiff bases employing Ytterbia as a catalyst. This process proceeds via C&#8722;F bond activation, accompanied with utilisation of Si&#8208;based reductants/oxygen scavengers &#8208; reductants of the nitro group. The scope and limitations of the disclosed methodologies are thoroughly studied. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first example of mechanical energy promoted transformation of the inert CF3 group into other functionalities.

         <title>Iodine Catalyzed C2&#8208;H Formamidation of Quinoline N&#8208;Oxides using Isocyanides: A Metal&#8208;Free Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A molecular iodine catalyzed regioselective insertion of isocyanide into C2&#8208;H of quinoline N&#8208;oxides has been developed. The reaction proceeds through the nucleophilic addition of isocyanide on quinoline N&#8208;oxides followed by rearrangement in presence of iodine. This metal&#8208;free reaction affords rapid access to quinoline 2&#8208;formamides with exceptional functional group tolerance, broad substrate scope and 100% atom&#8208;economy. A library of 33&#8197;N&#8208;(2&#8208;quinolinyl)formamides are synthesized, which may find applications in pharmaceuticals and synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Regioselective Deaminative Alkylation of Coumarins via Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
3&#8208;Alkylated coumarins have many applications in medicinal chemistry, however, methods access to such structures are still limited. Herein, we report a site&#8208;selective photocatalytic deaminative alkylation of coumarins utilizing pyridinium&#8208;activated aliphatic primary amines as alkylation reagents. The protocol was highlighted by its mild reaction conditions, operational simplicity, and broad functional group compatibility. Moreover, this strategy enables late&#8208;stage modification of some pharmaceuticals and natural products, thus providing an appealing approach to valuable molecules in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Copper Catalyzed Synthesis of 3&#8208;Nitro&#8208;Quinolines from Nitro&#8208;Olefins and Anthranils: Its Application in the Synthesis of Quindoline</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Copper&#8208;catalyzed routes have been achieved for the synthesis of 3&#8208;nitroquinolines from readily available nitroolefins and anthranils. This reaction proceeds via the [4+2] cycloaddition between anthranils and nitro&#8208;styrenes under mild reaction conditions to obtain biologically important heterocycles. A wide range of diversely substituted nitro&#8208;olefins and anthranils are successfully employed in this reaction to access a series of 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;quinolines in 81&#8211;93% yields. The synthetic utility of the present methodology is also illustrated in this manuscript.

         <title>Cobalt Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Selective Dioxygenation of Styrenes Using N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide with Molecular Oxygen</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed selective dioxygenation of styrenes with N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) was developed using molecular oxygen as the terminal oxidant. Alcohol and ketone products can be selectively formed from identical substrates by catalyst control. The reaction was applicable to a broad range of styrenes and exhibited good functional group tolerance. It provided a method for preparation of 1,2&#8208;diol or &#945;&#8208;hydroxyketone derivatives.

Abstract
Herein, we describe an isolable, air&#8208;stable, homogeneous, nickel catalyst that performs dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling reaction between secondary and primary alcohols to result &#945;&#8208;alkylated ketone products selectively. The sequence of steps involve in this one&#8208;pot reaction is dehydrogenation of both alcohols, condensation between the ketone and the aldehyde, and hydrogenation of the in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone. Preliminary mechanistic investigation hints a radical mechanism following borrowing hydrogen reaction.

Abstract
A strategy for the immobilization of chiral 2,3&#8208;bisaminocyclopropenium salt (pre&#8208;catalyst) onto polystyrene and silica supports is presented together with a suitable procedure for the conversion into the corresponding cyclopropenimine superbase catalysts. The activity and recyclability of polystyrene&#8208; and silica&#8208;supported cyclopropenimines were initially tested under batch conditions in a model Michael addition detecting comparable efficiencies but a superior stability of the latter heterogeneous catalyst (5 cycles, accumulated TON of 27.1). The preferred silica&#8208;supported cyclopropenimine behaved very similarly to the soluble counterpart in the reaction of glycine imine with different Michael acceptors (48&#8211;92% yield; 60&#8211;98% ee) and it could be utilized as packing material for the fabrication of fixed&#8208;bed mesoreactors (pressure&#8208;resistant stainless&#8208;steel columns). Continuous&#8208;flow experiments were performed with satisfactory long&#8208;term stability (24&#8197;h on stream) with unaltered conversion efficiency and enantioselectivity.

Abstract
A metal&#8208;free oxidative cyclization of readily available trifluoroacetimidohydrazides with D&#8208;glucose for the assembly of 3&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoles has been disclosed. D&#8208;glucose is applied as C1 synthon to provide methine source in the reaction. Control experiments have been conducted to shed light on the reaction mechanism. The synthetic utility of the protocol has been explored by the implementation of scale up reaction and the synthesis of the key skeleton of NKI&#8208;receptor ligand.

         <title>Organocatalytic Trans Semireduction of Primary and Secondary Propiolamides: Substrate Scope and Mechanistic Studies</title>

Abstract
We report a chemoselective, phosphine&#8208;catalyzed semireduction of primary and secondary propiolamides. In the presence of stoichiometric pinacolborane and catalytic n&#8208;tributylphosphine, a variety of propiolamides were successfully converted to the corresponding acrylamides in excellent yield with (E)&#8208;stereoselectivity. The reaction condition is tolerant of various functional groups including alkene, alkyne, ketone, or ester. Deuterium labeling studies established that the hydride from activated pinacolborane is added to the &#945;&#8208;carbon and the proton on the amide nitrogen is abstracted by the &#223;&#8208;carbon to furnish the (E)&#8208;acrylamides. DFT calculations revealed a clear energetic driving force for the (E)&#8208; over the (Z)&#8208;isomer.

         <title>A Cross&#8208;coupling Reaction between Aliphatic Aldehydes and Sulfonium Salts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted electron&#8208;deficient alkenes is often accomplished via cross&#8208;coupling of diazo compounds in the presence of a metal catalyst. Herein, we report an organocatalytic protocol that enables the direct coupling of aliphatic aldehydes with sulfonium ylides. A key carbene mimetic, &#945;&#8208;iodoenamine/enol, is believed to engage in direct cross&#8208;coupling with a sulfonium ylide, delivering &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds with a formyl substituent. The reaction demonstrated remarkably mild conditions, convergence, and control of olefin geometry.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Sulfonyl Fluorides from Arylazo Sulfones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Sulfonyl fluorides are useful motifs for a wide range of applications in organic synthesis including sulfur (VI) fluoride exchange&#8208;based &#8220;click chemistry.&#8221; Herein, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthesis of sulfonyl fluorides from arylazo sulfones is described. In the present study, K2S2O5 and N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) were used as the sulfonyl source and fluorinating agent, respectively, for visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated fluorosulfonylation of arylazo sulfones to prepare various sulfonyl fluorides in 60&#8211;85% yield.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfonyl fluorides are useful motifs for a wide range of applications in organic synthesis including sulfur (VI) fluoride exchange-based &#8220;click chemistry.&#8221; Herein, a visible-light-mediated synthesis of sulfonyl fluorides from arylazo sulfones is described. In the present study, K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) were used as the sulfonyl source and fluorinating agent, respectively, for visible-light-mediated fluorosulfonylation of arylazo sulfones to prepare various sulfonyl fluorides in 60&#8211;85% yield. This protocol is a synthetic approach to provide useful sulfonyl fluoride structures at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Propargylic glycols, 2&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;1&#8208;(indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols, react with thiols undergoing a complex but selective gold&#8208;catalyzed transformation that gives rise to &#945;&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl &#945;&#8208;((Z)&#8208;2&#8208;thioalkenyl) ketones. The sequence is triggered by the regioselective thiolation of indolyl diols followed by an attack of the sulfur instead of the indole over the activated alkyne. The final compounds are obtained in remarkably high yields and arise from simple starting materials such as indolyl acyloins, ethynyl magnesium bromide and thiols.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Alkynylation of C&#8722;H Bonds</title>

Abstract
Alkynylation reactions are one of the most sought&#8208;after synthetic methodologies due to the versatility of C&#8722;C triple bond diversifications. Sonogashira coupling was widely used for the synthesis of alkynylated molecules; however, this methodology requires the use of previously halogenated substrates, which is a major drawback. To overcome this issue, a complimentary method, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkynylation, was emerged as an alternative tool in the recent years. Though the initial reports required the use of either specific directing groups or strong alkynylating agents for effective functionalization, recent studies indicate that transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed site selective alkynylations can be carried out using mild and readily available alkynylating agents under moderate reaction conditions. In this review, we explain the transition metal cataluyzed site selective alkynylation both C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds by emphasizing to the reaction mechanism.

Abstract
A polyprenyl side chain could be introduced into the heterocyclic quinoline moiety through Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of the corresponding quinoline&#8208;N&#8208;oxide with a polyprenyl boronic acid. This tool could be utilized for the synthesis of the natural product Aurachin B from the myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca. This prenylated quinoline could then be transformed into the related Aurachin A through an epoxidation&#8208;ring opening cascade.

Abstract
A Ag(I)&#8208;catalyzed annulation of 1&#8208;aminobutadiynes with anilines was described. By tuning the steric and electronic properties of anilines, 2&#8208;aminoquinoline scaffold was constructed instead of the literature&#8208;reported 2&#8208;amidopyrroles. Notedly, the reactions of polyaromatic amines also proceed smoothly to afford nitrogen&#8208;containing polyaromatics.

Abstract
A phosphine&#8208;mediated reaction for the construction of spirocyclopenta[c]chromene&#8208;indolinones is reported via a Rauhut&#8208;Currier (RC)&#8208;type/acyl transfer/Wittig sequence. This methodology attributes the chemoselective phosphine addition to the alkynoate which generates the phosphorus zwitterion via RC&#8208;type reaction, and that further undergoes O&#8208;acylation to form the seven&#8208;membered betaine intermediate with acyl chloride in the presence of base. Extensive investigations reveal that the exceptional &#948;&#8208;acylation occurs through the C&#8722;O bond cleavage upon the seven&#8208;membered betaine, and the subsequent Wittig reaction preferentially result in the aforementioned spiro compounds. Furthermore, our protocol could also be applicable to different alkynoates to provide a series of spirocyclopenta[c]chromenones bearing privileged skeletons.

The selective &#945;&#8208;deuteration of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitriles using the strong base tBuOK or a metal&#8208;ligand cooperative Ru pincer catalyst is described. With D2O as deuterium source and glyme as solvent at 70&#8201;&#176;C, tBuOK is an efficient catalyst for deuteration at the &#945;&#8208;C(sp2) position of cinnamonitriles, providing access to a broad range of deuterated derivatives in good to excellent yields and with very high levels of deuterium incorporation. While the tBuOK&#8208;catalysed protocol does not tolerate base&#8208;sensitive functional groups, cinnamonitrile derivatives containing a benzylic bromide or ester moiety were deuterated in excellent yields using Milstein's ruthenium PNN pincer catalyst. Moreover, the activity for H/D exchange of the metal&#8208;ligand cooperative Ru catalyst is found to be significantly higher than that of tBuOK, allowing reactions to proceed well even at room temperature. A mechanistic proposal is put forward that involves deprotonation of the cinnamonitrile &#945;&#8208;CH position when using tBuOK as catalyst, whereas H/D exchange catalysis with the Ru PNN pincer likely proceeds via (reversible) oxa&#8208;Michael addition of D2O.

Abstract
A tetraarylpyrrole&#8208;based phosphine ligand L1 in combination with Pd(dba)2 provided a catalyst for the Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination reaction. A variety of amines were rapidly coupled with aryl chlorides at a Pd loading of 0.5&#8197;mol%. The selective monoarylation of aliphatic primary amines was achieved in the presence of 0.8&#8197;equiv. water. Comparison experiments were also conducted, which revealed that the catalytic activity of L1 is superior to representative phosphine ligands in the Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N coupling of various amines.

Abstract
C&#8208;methylation is a vitally important reaction applicable in chemical synthesis and structure&#8208;based drug design. Notably, the &#8220;magic methyl&#8221; effect has become decisive in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery for the modulation of bio&#8208;active properties in life science molecules. In this regard, C&#8208;methylation reaction is widely applied chemical modification in various biomolecules, pharmaceuticals, and natural products. In general, this reaction often relies on activated, hazardous and uneconomical methyl sources such as diazomethane, dimethyl sulfate, and methyl halides. To achieve methylation reactions in a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective manner, the use of &#8216;ideal&#8217; C1 source is crucial. In this regard, methanol constitutes an expedient &#8208;CH3 source because this simple alcohol is less&#8208;hazardous, inexpensive, and abundantly available platform chemical as well as it produces only water as the by&#8208;product in methylation processes. Regarding potential catalysts to perform C&#8208;methylation using methanol by hydrogen borrowing methodology, non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based catalysts are highly preferable due to their unique advantages such as more abundance, inexpensive and low&#8208;toxicity. In recent years, chemists made significant contributions towards catalytic valorization of methanol as C1 source to insert methyl groups via C&#8722;H activation in a variety of compounds and life science molecules. Consequently, in this minireview we summarize the C&#8208;methylation process using methanol by applying Fe&#8208;, Mn&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Ni&#8208;based catalysts as well as metal free catalysts.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Enzymatic Cascade Reactions for the Synthesis of cis,cis&#8208;Muconic Acid</title>

Abstract
Lignin valorization allows the generation of a number of value&#8208;added products such as cis,cis&#8208;muconic acid (ccMA), which is widely used for the synthesis of chemicals for the production of biodegradable plastic materials. In the present work, we reported the first multi&#8208;enzymatic, one&#8208;pot bioconversion process of vanillin into ccMA. In details, we used four sequential reactions catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, O&#8208;demethylase LigM (and the tetrahydrofolate&#8208;regeneration enzyme methyl transferase MetE), decarboxylase AroY (based on the use of E. coli transformed cells) and catechol 1,2&#8208;dioxygenase CatA. The optimized lab&#8208;scale procedure allowed to reach, for the first time, the conversion of 5&#8197;mM vanillin into ccMA in &#8764; 30&#8197;h with a 90% yield: this achievement represents an improvement in terms of yields and time when compared to the use of a whole&#8208;cell system. This multi&#8208;enzymatic system represents a sustainable alternative for the production of a high value added product from a renewable resource.

         <title>Investigating the Structure&#8208;Reactivity Relationships Between Nicotinamide Coenzyme Biomimetics and Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate Reductase</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Ene reductases (ERs) are attractive biocatalysts in terms of their high enantioselectivity and expanded substrate scope. Recent works have proved that synthetic nicotinamide coenzyme biomimetics (NCBs) can be used as easily accessible alternatives to natural cofactors in ER&#8208;catalyzed reactions. However, the structure&#8208;reactivity relationships between NCBs and ERs and influence factors are still poorly understood. In this study, a series of C&#8208;5 methyl modified NCBs were synthesized and tested in the PETNR&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reductions. The physicochemical properties of these NCBs including electrochemical properties, stability, and kinetic behavior were studied in detail. The results showed that hydrophobic interaction caused by the introduced methyl group contributed to the stabilization of binding conformation in enzyme active site, resulting in comparable catalytic activity with that of NADPH. Molecular dynamics and steered molecular dynamics simulations were further performed to explain the binding mechanism between PETNR and NCBs, which revealed that stable catalytic conformation, appropriate donor&#8208;acceptor distance and angle, as well as free dissociation energy are important factors affecting the activity of NCBs.

         <title>Z&#8208;Selective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Sulfanyl Carbonyl Compounds from Internal Alkynes and Thiols via Photoredox Catalysis</title>

Abstract
A synthetically useful Z&#8208;selective cascade formal thiyl radical addition, 1,3&#8208;double bond isomerization, oxygen trapping reaction, can be promoted by Eosin B under visible light, leading to the construction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208; and alkylthio enone derivatives in good yields. An accurate study on the reactivity of different thiols and the screening of the reaction conditions, allowed us to extend this reaction to a large number of substrates, showing a good functional groups tolerance while highlighting the limitations of this procedure. Background experiments and mechanistic studies were also. performed to rationalize this cascade process. The usefulness of this methodology was finally demonstrated via the transformation of a series of &#945;&#8208;sulfanyl&#8208;enone adducts through selected oxidation reactions, stereoselective synthesis of cyclopropyl ketones, indanones, and pyrazole compounds.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A synthetically useful &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selective cascade formal thiyl radical addition, 1,3-double bond isomerization, oxygen trapping reaction, can be promoted by Eosin B under visible light, leading to the construction of 2-aryl- and alkylthio enone derivatives in good yields. An accurate study on the reactivity of different thiols and the screening of the reaction conditions, allowed us to extend this reaction to a large number of substrates, showing a good functional groups tolerance while highlighting the limitations of this procedure. Background experiments and mechanistic studies were also. performed to rationalize this cascade process. The usefulness of this methodology was finally demonstrated via the transformation of a series of &#945;-sulfanyl-enone adducts through selected oxidation reactions, stereoselective synthesis of cyclopropyl ketones, indanones, and pyrazole compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lewis Acid Regulated Divergent Catalytic Reaction between Quinone Imine Ketals (QIKs) and 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds: Switchable Access to Multiple Products Including 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds, Indoles, and Benzofurans</title>

Abstract
A catalytic Lewis acid regulated reaction between quinone imine ketals (QIKs) and 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds provides a divergent and tunable approach to a variety of skeletons, including a series of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds, indoles, and benzofurans. The use of lithium chloride and ferrous bromide gives C3&#8208; or C2&#8208;alkylation products of the QIKs. The combination of ferrous bromide and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid delivers indole derivatives. Sequential hydrolysis and C3&#8208;alkylation occur in the presence of ytterbium (III) trifluoromethanesulfonate and stoichiometric amounts of water. When the reaction is performed with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and stoichiometric amounts of water, benzofuran is obtained. This protocol utilizes mild conditions, exhibits regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity, and has broad functional group tolerance.

         <title>Z&#8208;Selective Fluoroalkenylation of (Hetero)Aromatic Systems by Iodonium reagents in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Directed C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct and catalytic incorporation of fluorine containing molecular motifs into organic compounds resulting high&#8208;value added chemicals represents a rapidly evolving part of synthetic methodologies, thus this area is in the focus of pharmaceutical and agrochemical research. Herein we report a stereoselective procedure for direct fluorovinylation of aromatic and heteroaromatic scaffolds. This methodology development has been realized by palladium&#8208;catalyzed ortho C&#8208;H activation reaction of aniline derivatives featuring the regioselectivity via directing groups such as secondary of tertiary amides, ureas or ketones. The application of non&#8208;symmetrical aryl(fluoroalkenyl)&#8208;iodonium salts as fluoroalkenylating agents allowed mild reaction conditions in general for this transformation. The scope and limitations have been thoroughly investigated and the feasibility has been demonstrated by more than 50 examples.</dc:description>

Abstract
A three&#8208;component thioamination reaction has been developed in the presence of phenyliodonium(III) diacetate (PIDA) leading to the formation of a thioaminated products. This catalytic approach represents a method for the metal&#8208;free thioamination of 1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone. It was observed that maleimides also work smoothly under this metal&#8208;free reaction condition. This present method implies the oxidative coupling reaction through a one&#8208;step process with the generation of C&#8722;N and C&#8722;S bonds. Various aromatic and aliphatic thiols and amines provided the corresponding thioaminated compounds in 62&#8211;88% yields. A plausible reaction pathway has been predicted according to few control experiments.

Abstract
Due to the versatile reactivity and molecular complexity, as well as diversity, electron&#8208;rich alkenes bearing nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atoms have been regarded as versatile reagents in organic synthesis. This review mainly focuses on the recent advances in the reaction development of electron&#8208;rich alkenes since 2000, including mono&#8208;/difunctionalization reactions, cyclization reactions, and cross&#8208;metathesis reactions. Numerous protocols enabling facile and efficient transformations of electron&#8208;rich alkenes to valuable compounds have been developed, which are discussed with special emphasis placed on the mechanistic aspects and the synthetic utilities. We hope that this review will help inspire future studies and promote developments in this area.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Enzyme Cascade Catalyzed Asymmetrization of Primary Alcohols: Synthesis of Enantiocomplementary Chiral &#946;&#8208;Nitroalcohols</title>

Abstract
Biocatalytic asymmetrization of inexpensive and stable primary alcohols to prepare enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols is an important development in green chemistry for the production of chiral pharmaceutical intermediates. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step cascade reaction sequence in which first benzylic alcohols were oxidized to produce corresponding benzaldehydes using horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH). The in&#8197;situ generated aldehydes were then reacted in a biphasic medium with nitromethane by Arabidopsis thaliana hydroxynitrile lyase (AtHNL) or Baliospermum montanum HNL (BmHNL) catalyzed Henry reaction to produce stereoselective &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols with (R) or (S) configuration, respectively. Using HLADH&#8208;AtHNL, (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols were obtained in up to 64% conversion, and HLADH&#8208;BmHNL, (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols in up to 70% conversion, while in both cases excellent stereoselectivity (up to &gt;99% ee) was achieved. The concept was proven by functionalization of sp3 C&#8722;H bond of ten simple achiral benzylic alcohols to enantiocomplementary chiral &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biocatalytic asymmetrization of inexpensive and stable primary alcohols to prepare enantioenriched &#946;-nitroalcohols is an important development in green chemistry for the production of chiral pharmaceutical intermediates. Herein, we report a one-pot, two-step cascade reaction sequence in which first benzylic alcohols were oxidized to produce corresponding benzaldehydes using horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH). The in&#8197;situ generated aldehydes were then reacted in a biphasic medium with nitromethane by &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; hydroxynitrile lyase (&lt;i&gt;At&lt;/i&gt;HNL) or &lt;i&gt;Baliospermum montanum&lt;/i&gt; HNL (&lt;i&gt;Bm&lt;/i&gt;HNL) catalyzed Henry reaction to produce stereoselective &#946;-nitroalcohols with (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;) or (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;) configuration, respectively. Using HLADH-&lt;i&gt;At&lt;/i&gt;HNL, (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-&#946;-nitroalcohols were obtained in up to 64% conversion, and HLADH-&lt;i&gt;Bm&lt;/i&gt;HNL, (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-&#946;-nitroalcohols in up to 70% conversion, while in both cases excellent stereoselectivity (up to &amp;gt;99% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;) was achieved. The concept was proven by functionalization of &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Overview of Regioselective and Stereoselective Catalytic Hydroboration of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Hydroboration of alkynes is of special interest to researchers since it is the most straightforward process for the synthesis of highly important vinylborane synthetic intermediate compounds. It is significant in terms of both regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, since several positional isomers are formed during the process of hydroboration. Given the importance of this class of compounds, an extensive study has been carried out regarding catalytic condition development and detailed mechanistic studies for selectively obtaining a single isomer. This review comprehensively summarizes both the regioselective and stereoselective catalytic hydroboration of alkynes. It is aimed at giving readers accurate knowledge of the catalytic systems available for the hydroboration of certain alkynes. We anticipate that this inclusive review will encourage researchers to explore more new types of catalytic systems to achieve the remarkable process of hydroboration of alkynes.

         <title>Application of Mutualism in Organic Synthetic Chemistry: Mutually Promoted C&#8722;H Functionalization of Indole and Reduction of Quinoline</title>

Abstract
Here we reported a one&#8208;pot, metal&#8208;free B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed strategy for simultaneous synthesis of C3&#8208;regioselective functionalization of indoles and complete reduction of quinolines. It turned out that by sharing a quinolinium hydridoborate intermediate, the original determining steps with high energy barrier in both the convergent disproportionation of indole and reduction of quinoline could be realized at room temperature, thus furnishing both the C3&#8208;borylated (or silylated) indoles and N&#8208;borylated tetrahydroquinolines in up to 98% yields at room temperature. Mechanistic studies suggested that both reactions would consume a product generated from the other reaction such that they can mutually promote each other, thus producing desirable products in a high atom&#8208;economy and low energy&#8208;cost manner. This strategy opened the gate to introducing mutualism to the field of chemistry.

         <title>Isocyanide&#8208;Induced Esterification of Sulfinic Acids to Access Sulfinates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The isocyanide&#8208;induced esterification of sulfinic acids with alcohols or thiophenols access to sulfinates has been developed. Various primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols could be compatible with the established protocols. Notably, such an isocyanide&#8208;induced synthetic strategy presented the advantages of simple operation, good functional group tolerance, and more than 40 examples up to 99% yields.
