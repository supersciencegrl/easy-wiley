      <title>Iridium(I) Complexes with Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligands as Catalysts for H/D Exchange in Nonpolar Media</title>
      <dc:description>A series of neutral iridium(I) complexes of the general type [(WCA&#8208;NHC)]IrL(COD)] (COD = 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene; L = phosphine, pyridine), bearing anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (WCA&#8208;NHC) with a weakly coordinating anionic (WCA) borate moiety, were prepared by addition of phosphines and pyridine to [(WCA&#8208;NHC)]Ir(COD)], in which the available coordination site is stabilized by intramolecular metal&#8208;arene interaction (&#960;&#8208;face donation). The solvent and substrate scope of the neutral complexes as catalysts for H/D exchange was investigated, revealing their suitability for promoting efficient deuteration in nonpolar solvents such as cyclohexane.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrophosphination of Activated Alkenes by a Cobalt(I) Pincer Complex</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we report the synthesis of three heteroleptic first&#8208;row transition metal(II) complexes containing carbazolido NNN pincer ligands, and the conversion to their corresponding metal(I)&#8208;carbonyl complexes via a reductive carbonylation route. These complexes are precatalysts for the hydrophosphination of activated alkenes, affording a cobalt&#8208;catalysed hydrophosphination process that solely and selectively yields the &#946; addition (anti&#8208;Markovnikov) product. The scope of this transformation has been investigated using a variety of activated alkenes. Isolation and characterisation of substrate&#8208;coordinated intermediates reveals available coordination sites, which provide insight into the proposed catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

      <title>An Efficient Approach to Functionalized Indoles from &#955;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;Iodanes via Acyloxylation and Acyl Transfer</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. Versatile role of &#955;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;iodanes has been identified between the reaction of hydroquinone and &#946;&#8208;enaminones for the synthesis of 5&#8208;acyloxy&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy indoles. The reaction is proposed to proceed through an intermolecular C&#8208;C bond formation, intramolecular cyclization, acyloxylation and 1,4&#8208;acyl migration. The important features of this work include various acyloxylation from &#955;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;iodanes and broad functional group tolerance to deliver 34 examples in moderate to good yields.

Versatile role of &#955;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&#8208;iodanes has been identified between the reaction of hydroquinone and &#946;&#8208;enaminones for the synthesis of 5&#8208;acyloxy&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy indoles. The reaction is proposed to proceed through an intermolecular C&#8208;C bond formation, intramolecular cyclization, acyloxylation and 1,4&#8208;acyl migration. The important features of this work include various acyloxylation from &#955;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&#8208;iodanes and broad functional group tolerance to deliver 34 examples in moderate to good yields.

      <title>Double Carbonylation Reactions: Overview and Recent Advances</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. The compounds like amides, carbamates, oxamates, oxamides, &#945;&#8208;keto amides, diketones, esters, ureas, etc. find extensive applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and organic synthesis. The classical syntheses of these compounds often involve cumbersome routes involving toxic chemicals. The carbonylation reactions such as aminocarbonylation, alkoxycarbonylation, oxidative carbonylation and double carbonylation deliver as an efficient and attractive alternative to the conventional synthetic routes even at industrial scale. The catalytic single carbonylation reactions are extensively studied, however, catalytic double carbonylation reactions are not explored for several potential applications. This review covers literature on the use of different types of catalysts involving various	metals like Pd, Cu, Fe, Co, Rh and Ni for double carbonylation reactions along with the chemistry of associated ligands. It also covers double carbonylation used for synthesis of different types of novel substrates with the discussion related to mechanism of formations of mono and di carbonylation products. The notable introduction of several CO&#8208;surrogates and exploration of their efficiency have solved the problems related to the toxicity of CO.  CO&#8208;surrogates used for double carbonylation reactions are also discussed.</dc:description>

This protocol, merging visible light photoredox and palladium catalysis, provides a direct approach to conjugated tertiary allylic alcohol derivatives with broad functional group tolerance in moderate to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies suggest that, although two possible pathways exist in the transformation, radical oxyalkenylation promoted by visible light photoredox takes over the major pathway.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuneable copper catalysed transfer hydrogenation of nitrobenzenes to aniline or azo derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>A highly versatile and flexible copper nanoparticle (Cu(0) NPs) catalytic system has been developed for the controlled and selective transfer hydrogenation of nitroarene. 
Interestingly, the final catalytic product is strongly dependent on the nature of the hydrogen donor source. The yield of nitrobenzene reduction to aniline increased from 20% to an almost quantitative yield over a range of alcohols, diols and aminoalcohols. In glycerol at 130 &#176;C aniline was isolated in 93% yield. In ethanolamine, the reaction was conveniently performed at a lower temperature (55 &#176;C) and gave selectively substituted azobenzene (92% yield). Experimental studies provide support for a reaction pathway in which the Cu(0) NPs catalysed transfer hydrogenation  of nitrobenzene to aniline proceeds via the condensation route. The high chemoselectivity of both protocols has been proven in experiments on a panel of variously substituted nitroarenes. Enabling technologies, microwave and ultrasound, used both separately and in combination, have successfully increased the reaction rate and reaction yield.</dc:description>

      <title>Preparative&#8208;Scale Production of Testosterone Metabolites by Human Liver Cytochrome P450 3A4</title>
      <dc:description>Just like the drugs themselves, their metabolites have to be evaluated to succeed in a drug development and approval process. It is therefore essential to be able to predict drug metabolism and to synthesise sufficient metabolite quantities for further pharmacological testing. This study evaluates the possibility of using in vitro biotransformations to solve both these challenges in the case of testosterone as a representative component for steroids. The application of cells of Pichia pastoris with expressed membrane&#8208;associated human liver cytochrome P450 enzyme (P450) 3A4 in two cycles of a preparative&#8208;scale bioreactor experiment enabled the isolation of the common metabolites 6&#946;&#8208;hydroxytestosterone and 6&#946;&#8208;hydroxyandrostenedione on a 100 mg scale. Side&#8208;product formation caused by enzymes intrinsic to P. pastoris was reduced. In addition more polar testosterone metabolites formed by a P450 3A4&#8208;catalysed bioconversion, than the known mono&#8208;hydroxylated ones, are reported and 6&#8208;dehydro&#8208;15&#946;&#8208;hydroxytestosterone as well as the di&#8208;hydroxylated steroids 6&#946;,16&#946;&#8208;dihydroxytestosterone, 6&#946;,17&#946;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;androstene&#8208;3,16&#8208;dione and 6&#946;,12&#946;&#8208;dihydroxyandrostenedione were isolated and verified by NMR analysis. Their respective biological significance remains to be investigated. Whole&#8208;cell P450 catalysts expressed in P. pastoris qualify as a tool for the preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of human metabolites. Biotransformation processes in combination with standard chemical procedures allow the isolation and characterisation even of minor drug metabolite products.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Substituted 4&#8208;Arylamino&#8208;1,2&#8208;naphthoquinones in One&#8208;Pot Reactions Using CotA&#8208;Laccase as Biocatalyst</title>
      <dc:description>An efficient and environmentally benign biocatalytic strategy for the synthesis of substituted 4&#8208;arylamino&#8208;1,2&#8208;naphthoquinones was developed, through a cross&#8208;coupling reaction in which the 1,2&#8208;naphthoquinone nucleus, formed in the biocatalytic process mediated by CotA&#8208;laccase from Bacillus subtilis, is the key synthetic intermediate. Electrochemical data and kinetic parameters were determined revealing a significant higher specificity of CotA&#8208;laccase for 4&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxynaphthalene&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonic acid (AHNSA). 
This ability of CotA&#8208;laccase to discriminate between oxidisable aromatic amines allows the set&#8208;up of one&#8208;pot reactions in the presence of the enzyme, between AHNSA and a set of appropriate aromatic amines under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

The front cover picture, provided by M. Mar D&#237;az&#8208;Requejo, Pedro J. P&#233;rez and co&#8208;workers, shows the capabilities of copper as catalyst for the selective functionalization of the Csp2&#8722;H bond of 1H&#8208;pyrroles by carbene insertion from diazo compounds. The N&#8722;H and C&#8722;H bonds are represented by chains, from which only the latter can be cleaved in this catalytic transformation, despite the lower bond dissociation energy and higher polarity of the N&#8211;H bond. The authors thank Dr. Ivan Rivilla for artwork design. Details of the work reported can be found in the full paper on pages XXXX&#8211;YYYY (A. M. Rodr&#237;guez, F. Molina, M. M.

      <title>Recent Progress in the Construction of C&#8722;N Bonds via Metal&#8208;Free Radical C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds widely exist in pharmaceuticals and multifunctional materials. Thus, the development of C&#8722;N bond formation reactions is of great importance in synthetic chemistry. Since 2014, obvious progress has been made in the construction of C&#8722;N bonds via metal&#8208;free radical C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization, which is one of the major protocols due to its high reaction activity and mild conditions. To the best of our knowledge, there are still no exclusive reviews about the formation of C&#8722;N bonds through metal&#8208;free radical C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. This review aims to highlight the recent advances in this area since 2014, according to the type of the nitrogen source (amines, amides, sulfonamides, azoles, azides and other nitrogen sources). The paper is focused on discussions about the reaction mechanisms and selected examples of substrates have also been listed.

      <title>Phosphoramidates as Transient Precursors of Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Radical Under Visible Light Irradiation</title>
      <dc:description>
Phosphoramidates and especially phosphonohydrazones were, for the first time, used as efficient N&#8208;Centered Radical (NCR) precursors under visible light irradiation. Mechanistic investigations confirmed the formation of an N&#8208;radical from these brand new derivatives, which was able to be engaged in an intramolecular 6&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization to provide phthalazines. Compared to previous pre&#8208;activated moieties, the phosphoramidate group is self&#8208;immolative, thus enhancing its attractiveness for the C&#8722;N bond formation. Details of this work can be found in the full paper on pages XXXX&#8211;XXXX (M. De Abreu, M. Selkti, P. Belmont, E. Brachet, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2020, 362, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202000018).

The inside cover picture, provided by Yuanjiang Pan and co&#8208;workers, illustrates the selectivity associated with reported method: the hemin&#8208;catalyzed, carbene&#8208;mediated, dealkylative intercepted [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement reactions of allylic sulfides with in situ generated 2,2,2&#8208;trifluorodiazoethane. The product of the classic [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement from the sulfonium ylide intermediate was not formed; instead the allyl group was lost and the 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl sulfide was formed. This transformation distinguishes itself by the concise process, mild conditions and efficiency achieved with the help from the natural catalyst, hemin.

      <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Conjugate Addition of Organoboronic Acids to Carbonyl&#8208;Activated Alkenyl Azaarenes</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
The enantioselective synthesis of chiral azaarenes by rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of organoboronic acids to carbonyl&#8208;activated alkenyl azaarenes was reported. Diverse chiral azaarenes were produced in up to 99% yield and with up to 99% ee (&gt;60 examples). Catalytic asymmetric syntheses of dexchlorpheniramine and dexbrompheniramine were realized by using the developed method.

      <title>Diastereodivergent Formal 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of 5&#8208;alkenyl thiazolones to Access Stereochemically Diverse Pyrrolidinyl Spirooxindoles</title>
      <dc:description>









Abstract
We report here a stereoselective [3+2] cyclization of 5&#8208;alkenyl thiazolones and ketimines that allows the assembly of three diastereoisomers through the combination of stereodivergent organocatalysis and the following diastereoselective transformation of products. A broad spectrum of pyrrolidinyl spirooxindoles featuring stereochemical diversity has been synthesized through organocatalytic formal 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions with up to 98% yield, &gt;20:1&#8197;dr and 99:1&#8197;er.

      <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Carbonyl Acridanes as Highly Potent Inhibitors of Tubulin Polymerization via One&#8208;Pot Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dual Arylation of Nitriles with Cyclic Diphenyl Iodoniums</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
A novel Copper&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction between six&#8208;membered cyclic diaryliodonium salts and nitriles is reported for the facile access to a variety of N&#8208;carbonyl acridanes in good to excellent yields (up to 82%). The reaction is efficient and atom&#8208;economical with a broad substrate scope (e.&#8201;g. both aryl / alkyl nitriles and substituted / unsubstituted cyclic diaryliodonium salts compatible in the system). This method is particularly useful for the synthesis of substituted N&#8208;carbonyl acridanes which are present in many pharmaceutically important compounds, but are not easy to obtain in conventional approaches. Furthermore, one of the newly synthesized acridanes displayed high antiproliferative activity against MB&#8208;468 cancer cells (IC50=26&#8197;nM, comparable to paclitaxel and colchicine) by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Together, these findings might grant a rapid access to a novel molecular scaffold with potential anticancer utilities.

      <title>Intermolecular Electrophilic Bromoesterification and Bromoetherification of Unactivated Cyclopropanes</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
1,3&#8208;difunctionalization of cyclopropane is an useful organic transformation. The corresponding 1,3&#8208;difunctionalized products are synthetic synthons and building blocks in many organic syntheses. Many existing ring&#8208;opening difunctionalization methodologies rely primarily on the use of donor&#8722;acceptor cyclopropanes, while the difunctionalization of unactivated cyclopropanes is less exploited. In this research, 1,3&#8208;bromoesterification and 1,3&#8208;bromoetherification of unactivated cyclopropanes were successfully achieved using N&#8208;bromosuccinimide as the brominating agent with high yields and regioselectivity.

Over the last few decades, the electronic and structural properties of their &#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;coordinated ligands have been modified by introducing electron&#8208;donating, electron&#8208;withdrawing, and sterically hindered substituents to obtain desirable catalytic properties for the metallocenes.

      <dc:description>Bis(phosphinite) pincer platinum hydride complexes, [2,6&#8208;(R2PO)2C6H3]PtH (R = tBu, 1; iPr, 2), were synthesized, characterized and applied to the hydrosilylation of aldehydes and ketones. NMR study and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicated that the hydrides in these two platinum complexes are comparatively less hydridic: down&#8208;field 1H NMR resonances (0.71 and 0.98 ppm) and weak Pt&#8208;H interactions were observed. Both the platinum complexes were found to be good catalysts for the hydrosilylation of aldehydes and ketones with phenylsilane. The corresponding alcohols were isolated in good to excellent yields following basic hydrolysis of the resultant hydrosilylation products and turnover frequencies (TOFs) up to 3200 h&#8208;1 were achieved at 60&#730;C in toluene, which are much higher than those of the hydrosilylation catalysed by the corresponding nickel pincer hydride complexes.

      <title>Enantiopure Chiral Phosphines Bearing a Sulfinyl Group and Their Application in Catalytic Enantiodivergent Synthesis of Polysubstituted Pyrrolines</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, a type of enantiopure chiral phosphines bearing a polar S=O sulfinyl group as the chiral unit in the molecule has been developed, which can be prepared in either enantiomeric form from commercially available materials by a three&#8208;step route. The enantiopure chiral phosphines can catalyse enantiodivergent asymmetric [4+1] annulation reactions of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines and allylic carbonates, delivering polysubstituted pyrrolines in either enantiomeric form in up to 99% yield and up to 99% ee, and thus empower a method for dual stereo&#8208;controlled synthesis of chiral pyrrolines. This work accordingly unveils a practical and predictable strategy to realize enantiodivergent synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Developments in Enantioselective Multicatalyzed Tandem Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>This review updates the emerging field of enantioselective multicatalyzed tandem reactions published since the beginning of 2015. It illustrates how much the combination of different types of catalysts allows unprecedented enantioselective one&#8208;pot reactions of many types to be achieved, allowing a direct access to a variety of very complex chiral molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Still&#8208;Gennari olefination and its applications in organic synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>The Still&#8208;Gennari olefination is a widely applied modification of the Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons reaction, allowing access to Z &#8208;olefins by carbonyl group transformation. Its synthetic utility is undoubtedly of great significance for organic chemistry, as can be illustrated by the number of citations of the original report by W. C. Still and C. Gennari which up to date has been cited over 1000 times. In 2008 Nobel prize winner Ei&#8208;ichi Negishi indicated the Still&#8208;Gennari olefination as one of the crucial methods for the olefin synthesis, complementary to palladium catalyzed alkenylations. Surprisingly, so far there is no review concerning this popular and valuable transformation. Therefore, we aim to comprehensively systematize achievements in this field and to present the scope of applications of the Still&#8208;Gennari olefination along with recent examples in total synthesis of biologically active compounds. Our review intends to be of interest for general chemical community as well as to be a helpful source of information for synthetic organic chemists.</dc:description>
