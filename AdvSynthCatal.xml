A powerful platform for the efficient synthesis of 2,4&#8208;disubstituted thiophenes and 2,5&#8208;disubstituted thiophenes via acid&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component cyclization of 2&#8208;methylquinoline, elemental sulfur, and chromone&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehyde or cinnamaldehyde under metal&#8208;free conditions is disclosed. This approach stands out due to its readily available starting materials, broad substrate scopes, simple operation, and the efficient formation of multibonds in one&#8208;pot.

Bisheteroaryls and its derivatives, as a privileged motifs, are commonly found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, ligands, and other bioactive molecules. Herein, a novel and efficient method for the divergent synthesis of functional 2&#8208;quinolinyl&#8208;bearing thiophenes via acid&#8208;mediated three&#8208;component cyclization of 2&#8208;methylquinolines, S powder, and chromone&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehydes or enals is reported. This approach stands out due to its metal&#8208;free conditions, readily available starting materials, broad substrate scopes, simple operation, and the efficient formation of multibonds in one&#8208;pot. The Gram scale reaction and useful derivatizations are performed to showcase the potential synthetic utility of this strategy. This acid&#8208;promoted cyclic strategy provides a straightforward pathway toward diversely valuable thiophenes, which possibly exhibit good applications in medicinal chemistry and materials science.

         <title>Organophotoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Functionalization of Spiro&#8208;Dihydroquinazolinones with Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hilman Adducts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free approach for the synthesis of quinazolinone&#8208;containing alkenes is reported under organophotoredox conditions. In this approach, spiro&#8208;dihydroquinazolinones undergo aromaticity&#8208;driven deconstructive functionalization with Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hilman adducts in a chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective manner.

An organophotoredox&#8208;catalyzed, chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective C&#8211;C bond formation between spiro&#8208;dihydroquinazolinones and Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hilman adducts has been reported. This transformation proceeds via an aromatization driven deconstructive formation of an alkyl radical and its subsequent selective addition at SN2&#8242; position of MBH acetates, resulting in alkene&#8208; containing quinazolinones. Mild reaction conditions, good substrate&#8208;scope and further modification of resultant products are the noteworthy accomplishments of this methodology.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Enantiopure (R)&#8208;Citronellal from Geraniol via a Short&#8208;Chain Dehydrogenase and Ene Reductase</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 14, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic cascade with two consecutive biocatalytic steps consisting of a short&#8208;chain alcohol dehydrogenase and an ene reductase in a biphasic system provides (R)&#8208;citronellal with &gt;90% conversion and &gt;99% enantiomeric excess from inexpensive geraniol.

The development of synthetic routes to produce enantiopure (R)&#8208;citronellal as a key intermediate for the synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;menthol and other valuable terpenoids is highly relevant in the pharmaceutical, flavor, and fragrance industries. Herein, we showcase a cascade with two consecutive biocatalytic steps performed separately using the inherent selectivity of a short&#8208;chain alcohol dehydrogenase (SDR) and an ene reductase (ERED) from the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) family. The first reaction involves the AaSDR1&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of relatively inexpensive geraniol in a biphasic system, providing geranial as an intermediate. The organic phase containing geranial is then extracted and transferred to the second step, where the ERED variant OYE2_Y83V catalyzes the asymmetric reduction of geranial to produce (R)&#8208;citronellal, achieving &gt;90% conversion and &gt;99% enantiomeric excess. The use of n&#8208;heptane in a two&#8208;liquid phase system not only facilitates substrate and product solubilization but also minimizes geranial isomerization. This biocatalytic cascade therefore enables the synthesis of enantiopure (R)&#8208;citronellal.

         <title>Borane&#8208;Catalyzed Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Ring Opening of 2&#8208;Substituted Aziridines with Phenols for Direct Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 14, July 29, 2025. </description>

Boron&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208; and ortho&#8208;selective C&#63743;H bond substitution of phenols with 2&#8208;alkyl/aryl aziridines to access the branched selective ortho&#8208;phenolic&#8208;&#946;&#8208;arylethylamines is achieved. N&#8208;heterocyclic arenes can also act as carbon nucleophiles to open the aziridine ring selectively to afford the branched products. This protocol is demonstrated for the synthesis of serotonin and tryptamine.

A metal&#8208;free chemo&#8208; and regioselective nucleophilic ring opening of 2&#8208;substituted aziridines with ortho&#8208;C(sp2) atom of phenols enables facile access to medicinally relevant &#946;&#8208;arylethylamine derivatives. In this approach, phenols act as aryl nucleophiles that favor C&#63743;C bond formation selectively at the ortho&#8208;C(sp2) position with the more substituted carbon of aziridines to generate branched, selective arylated products. Despite the significant advancement of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling and nucleophilic ring opening of 2&#8208;substituted azirines, only linear arylated products are widely demonstrated. The first metal&#8208;free branched selective nucleophilic ring opening of 2&#8208;alkyl and 2&#8208;aryl aziridines with phenols is reported to address this challenge. Furthermore, the diversity of the substrate scope by using N&#8208;heterocycles as nucleophiles empowers the generation of &#946;&#8208;heteroarylethylamine derivatives. A combination of computational and experimental investigation reveals that the reaction proceeds via a borane&#8208;promoted proton transfer, followed by aziridine ring opening and Fridel&#8211;Crafts alkylation involving a &#960;&#8208;complex of carbocation&#8208;anion ion pair. This protocol is further applicable for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant compounds like serotonin and tryptamine.

N-heterocyclic arenes can also act as carbon nucleophiles to open the aziridine ring selectively to afford the branched products. This protocol is demonstrated for the synthesis of serotonin and tryptamine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A metal-free chemo- and regioselective nucleophilic ring opening of 2-substituted aziridines with &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) atom of phenols enables facile access to medicinally relevant &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-arylethylamine derivatives. In this approach, phenols act as aryl nucleophiles that favor C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C bond formation selectively at the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) position with the more substituted carbon of aziridines to generate branched, selective arylated products. Despite the significant advancement of transition-metal-catalyzed cross-coupling and nucleophilic ring opening of 2-substituted azirines, only linear arylated products are widely demonstrated. The first metal-free branched selective nucleophilic ring opening of 2-alkyl and 2-aryl aziridines with phenols is reported to address this challenge. Furthermore, the diversity of the substrate scope by using N-heterocycles as nucleophiles empowers the generation of &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-heteroarylethylamine derivatives. A combination of computational and experimental investigation reveals that the reaction proceeds via a borane-promoted proton transfer, followed by aziridine ring opening and Fridel&#8211;Crafts alkylation involving a &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-complex of carbocation-anion ion pair. This protocol is further applicable for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant compounds like serotonin and tryptamine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxidative Rearrangement of 3&#8208;Aryl Azo Indoles in Water: Synthesis of C3&#8208;Oxo&#8208;C2&#8208;Amino Indoles and their Application as Fluorophores for Lipid Droplet Detection</title>

         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free, sustainable oxidative rearrangement of 3&#8208;azo indoles in water is described to C3&#8208;oxo&#8208;C2&#8208;amino indoles, which are used as fluorescent probes to detect lipid droplets.

A novel oxidative rearrangement of the diazene moiety in 3&#8208;aryl azo indoles is reported, leading to the formation of C3&#8208;oxo&#8208;C2&#8208;amino indoles with excellent regioselectivity. This transformation, achieved using oxone in water at ambient temperature, proceeds in good yields with broad functional group tolerance, including toward azaindoles. Mechanistic insights are gained through control experiments, crystal structures, and density functional theory calculations. Experimental and theoretical photophysical studies, along with cellular uptake and colocalization experiments, demonstrate that the resulting compounds selectively bind to lipid droplets (LDs), highlighting their potential as fluoroprobes for LD detection.

An efficient, metal&#8208;free method for synthesizing C3&#8208;alkylated indoles via B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed reductive C&#63743;C bond cleavage of bisindolylmethanes (BIMs) under mild conditions is reported, offering broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance.

In this study, B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed reductive C&#63743;C bond cleavage of bisindolylmethanes (BIMs) is reported as an efficient strategy for preparing C3&#8208;alkylated indoles. In the presence of silane, B(C6F5)3 selectively activates Csp2&#8208;Csp3 bonds of BIMs under mild conditions. Moreover, this sustainable process exhibits a broad substrate scope, highly functional group tolerance, and excellent regioselectivity. Preliminary mechanistic studies disclose that the formation of stabilized ion&#8208;pair intermediates is crucial to achieving the desired transformation. Notably, the strategy provides a metal&#8208;free alternative to transition metal catalysis, enabling the sustainable synthesis of valuable indole derivatives.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Photoredox Synthesis of Sulfonylated Benzimidazoisoquinolines via 10 H&#8208;Phenothiazine&#8208;Catalyzed Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free photocatalytic strategy using unmodified 10 H&#8208;phenothiazine is presented for the synthesis of sulfonylated benzimidazoisoquinolines. Visible light activates catalytic electron donor&#8211;acceptor complexes between phenothiazine and sulfonyl chlorides, driving a sulfonation/cyclization cascade with broad substrate scope, high efficiency, and mild conditions.

An unmodified 10 H&#8208;phenothiazine is directly utilized as an efficient photocatalyst to enable ready access to sulfonylated benzo[4,5]imidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives from N&#8208;allyl benzimidazoles and sulfonyl chlorides. The reaction involves the formation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor complexes between phenothiazine and sulfonyl chloride, which, upon visible light irradiation, undergo single&#8208;electron transfer to generate sulfonyl radicals. The reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and high efficiency.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;Oxokolavenol: A Natural Neoclerodane Diterpene with Farnesoid X Receptor Transcriptional Activity</title>

The natural neoclerodane diterpene (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol shows significant Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) transcriptional activity. Herein, the first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol is reported. The synthetic route takes a 15&#8208;step sequence from the known Wieland&#8211;Miescher ketone with 0.85% overall yield. In addition, the synthesis allows (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol with 12 synthetic intermediates for biological evaluations of FXR transcriptional activity.

The natural neoclerodane diterpene (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol is isolated from the twigs of Amoora stellato&#8208;squamosa, and exhibited significant Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) transcriptional activity with an EC50 value of 1.877 &#956;M. However, the scarcity of its natural sources poses a considerable challenge for further biological studies. To address this limitation, herein, the first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol is reported. This synthesis features stereoselective alkylation, regioselective redox transformations (including late&#8208;stage allylic oxidation), and strategic installation of methyl groups. The overall synthesis delivers (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol in 15 steps from the cheap and readily available Wieland&#8211;Miescher ketone. In addition, this approach allows (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol with 12 synthetic intermediates for biological evaluations by using dual&#8208;luciferase reporter assay. Preliminary investigations confirm the nuclear receptor selectivity of (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol as a FXR agonist, underscoring its potential for further bioactivity studies.

         <title>eAmidation: An Electrochemical Amidation of Aldehydes via the Oxidation of N&#8208;Aryl Hydrazones</title>

The indirect electrochemical oxidation of N&#8208;aryl hydrazones offers an efficient approach to access amides from aldehydes and amines. The AZADO&#8208;mediated reaction enables the selective synthesis of a broad range of valuable amides using readily available aldehydes.

In recent years, the use of electrochemistry has emerged as a powerful yet sustainable means of enabling key transformations. Amidation is one of the most frequently executed transformations in synthetic chemistry, and using an electrochemical approach, the current study has demonstrated the synthesis of amides from aldehydes and amines. Mechanistic work indicates that the reaction proceeds via the oxidation of an intermediate hydrazone to generate an acyl diazene as the acylating species. The protocol developed has enabled the synthesis of a broad range of amides, including access to pharmaceutically relevant products, directly from aldehydes without recourse for hazardous chemical oxidants and activating agents.

         <title>C&#8211;H Homocoupling of Arenes via Pd/S,O&#8208;Ligand Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 14, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient C&#8208;H homocoupling of arenes via Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand catalytic system is reported. This method can be applied to a series of arenes using O2 as oxidant under room temperature and is also applicable for late&#8208;stage homocoupling of pharmaceutical derivatives. Homocoupling of o&#8208;xyleneexhibits near&#8208;perfect chemoselectivity, offering an industrially favorable route to a Upilex&#174; monomer precursor .

Non&#8208;directed Pd&#8208;catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenative homocoupling of arenes is achieved in the presence of an S,O&#8208;ligand. The reaction proceeds under aerobic and mild reaction conditions with a wide range of anisole derivatives, providing direct access to symmetric biaryls with excellent ortho&#8208;ortho or para&#8208;para regioselectivity. Notably, the use of the arene as the limiting reagent enables late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex pharmaceutical molecules. The industrial applicability of this methodology is demonstrated through the synthesis of the Upilexmonomer via the homocoupling of unactivatedo&#8208;xylene.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Ring&#8208;Opening Hydrosulfonylation of Methylenecyclopropanes for Branched Allylic Sulfones</title>

A Pd&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and stereoselective ring&#8208;opening hydrosulfonylation reaction of sulfonyl hydrazides with methylenecyclopropane derivatives was developed, which produced a series of branched (E)&#8208;allylic sulfones in good yields. Meanwhile, the corresponding asymmetric reactions provided the optically active products in moderate yields with good enantioselectivity.

A Pd&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydrosulfonylation reaction of methylenecyclopropanes with sulfonyl hydrazides was developed, which produced a series of branched (E)&#8208;allylic sulfones in 52&#8722;91% yields. In addition, the asymmetric variant was also investigated, and the optically active products were obtained in moderate yields with good enantioselectivities (up to 94:6 er). Mechanistic studies suggested that the reaction proceeds through the formation of an allyl hydrazine intermediate and subsequent rearrangement to the branched (E)&#8208;allylic sulfone products. Generally, the reaction was completed in one pot under mild reaction conditions, which also featured in good functional group tolerance, broad substrate scope, high regiospecificity, branched selectivity, as well as atom and step economy.

A simple photoredox system comprising Hantzsch ester, Cs2CO3, and 4DPAIPN that enables direct and site&#8208;selective deoxygenation of benzyl alcohol derivatives is described. Mechanistic studies reveal that in&#8201;situ reversible acylative activation of hydroxy groups plays a pivotal role in achieving the unique selectivity, highlighting the importance of reversible activation strategies in selective molecular transformations.

A simple yet efficient method is presented for direct and site&#8208;selective deoxygenation of benzyl alcohol derivatives, including polyols, without requiring preactivation. This reaction system, consisting of Hantzsch ester, Cs2CO3, and a photocatalyst under photoirradiation, enables direct and site&#8208;selective deoxygenation. Mechanistic studies reveal that in&#8201;situ reversible acylative activation of hydroxy groups plays a pivotal role in achieving unique selectivity. This approach offers a general and practical strategy for the selective transformation of polyols.

         <title>Electrochemical Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Heterofunctionalization of Tropones via C(sp2)&#63743;H Derivatization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 14, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and selective. The electrochemical heterofunctionalization of activated tropones is achieved using readily available inorganic salts. A theoretical model, based on cyclic voltammetry and quantum chemistry calculations, predicts both reactivity trends and site selectivity. This model is supported by the rapid synthesis of densely functionalized tropones and tropolones (35 examples, with yields up to 95%).

A general electrochemical synthetic procedure for the site&#8208;selective heterofunctionalization of activated tropones is documented. Detailed voltametric analysis and quantum chemistry calculations enabled&#160;the development of a predictive model for the process efficiency, accounting for both reactivity and regioselectivity. Mono&#8208; and poly&#8208;halogenation, nitration, sulfonation, and thiocyanation protocols are successfully executed starting from inexpensive sodium salts under oxidative electrolytic conditions (35 examples, isolated yields up to 95%, faradaic efficiencies up to 95%). The implementation of an iterative electrochemical/metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling synthetic strategy, along with the adaptation of the protocol for the preparation of biologically relevant tropolone derivatives, underscores the generality and robustness of the methodology.

         <title>Electrochemically Driven Diastereoselective Dearomative 2,3&#8208;Diesterification of Indoles with Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 14, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein an electrochemical radical cation&#8208;mediated dearomative 2,3&#8208;difunctionalization of indoles with carboxylic acids for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;diesterified indolines with excellent trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity is reported.

An electrochemically driven radical cation&#8208;mediated dearomative 2,3&#8208;difunctionalization of indoles with carboxylic acids is described, which provides an efficient and straightforward route for the construction of a range of 2,3&#8208;diesterified indolines with excellent trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields. This metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free electrochemical protocol proceeds in an undivided cell, exhibiting broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance.

&lt;p&gt;Herein an electrochemical radical cation-mediated dearomative 2,3-difunctionalization of indoles with carboxylic acids for the synthesis of 2,3-diesterified indolines with excellent &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-diastereoselectivity is reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An electrochemically driven radical cation-mediated dearomative 2,3-difunctionalization of indoles with carboxylic acids is described, which provides an efficient and straightforward route for the construction of a range of 2,3-diesterified indolines with excellent &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-diastereoselectivity in moderate-to-good yields. This metal- and oxidant-free electrochemical protocol proceeds in an undivided cell, exhibiting broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies reveal that the anodic single-electron oxidation of indoles is the initial step and oxocarbenium ion formation is the key to controlling &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-diastereoselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Solvent&#8208; and transition metal&#8208;free synthetic pathways for obtaining 2&#8208;thiazolines and S&#8208;thiocarbamates, based on the mechanochemical process of addition of chloroalkyl iso(thio)cyanates to thiols catalyzed by cheap and commercially available K2CO3, are designed and optimized. This approach has been successfully applied to obtain 39 materials with significant medicinal potential in yields above 95%.

For the first time, the mechanochemical synthesis of five&#8208;membered N,S&#8208;heterocyclic 1,3&#8208;thiazolines and S&#8208;thiocarbamates has been performed starting from chloroalkyl iso(thio)cyanates, thiols, as well as dithiols, in the presence of cheap and commercially available potassium carbonate (K2CO3) as a catalyst. The experimental conditions are optimized to allow the effective formation of attractive materials with significant medicinal potential in yields above 95% in transition metal&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free conditions. The reactions are efficient and easily scalable to gram quantities, offering substantial benefits for practical applications.

         <dc:description>
Achieving controllable generation and effective interception of relevant intermediates during intermolecular and intramolecular oxidation of aromatic amines by noncovalent interactions is an attractive objective. It has been reported herein the means to enable a family of intermolecular and intramolecular controllable selective oxidation of aromatic amines that create opportunities for the synthesis of symmetric or unsymmetric nitrosobenzenes, nitrobenzenes, azoxybenzenes, and azobenzenes.


Selective oxidation of aromatic amines is a valuable transformation in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry as well as materials science. However, the efficient means to reach its full potential remain a formidable challenge because meticulous perturbations on the oxidation states can potentially lead to dramatically different product selectivity and efficacy profiles. Herein, by identifying bench&#8208;stable and easily prepared 2,2&#8242;&#8208;diperoxyphenic acid as oxidant and/or I2 as additive, a general and divergent oxidation is developed to reliably form a wide assortment of nitrosobenzenes, nitrobenzenes, azobenzenes, and azoxybenzenes in an intermolecular and intramolecular controllable manner, avoiding the use of stoichiometric metal oxidants and transition metal&#8208;based catalysts. Mechanistic studies reveal that the imposing of noncovalent interactions enables the achievement of reagent&#8208; and additive&#8208;dependent reordering of N&#63743;H bond reactivity and the rate of corresponding elementary steps.

         <title>Cu/Ru Sequential Catalysis via In Situ Directing Group Formation for Site&#8208;Selective C&#63743;H Arylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 14, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu/Ru sequential catalysis enables in situ formation of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles as directing groups for site&#8208;selective C&#63743;H arylation.Combining click chemistry with Ru&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H activation bypasses prefunctionalization, ensures high regioselectivity, and accommodates diverse substrates.Applications include late&#8208;stage drug modification and functional material synthesis.

A Cu/Ru bimetallic sequential catalytic strategy combining copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) with Ru&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H activation is developed, enabling the in&#8201;situ formation of nitrogen&#8208;containing triazoles and their ortho C&#63743;H arylation in a one&#8208;pot dual&#8208;functional transformation. This system innovatively employs the 1,2,3&#8208;triazole formed via CuAAC as an endogenous directing group, facilitating sequential [3+2] cycloaddition and Ru&#8208;mediated C&#63743;H functionalization through a stepwise catalytic approach. The strategy overcomes the limitations of traditional preactivation and exhibits excellent regioselectivity and broad substrate compatibility. This approach has been successfully applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceutical molecules, offering a new paradigm for the modular synthesis of complex compounds.

         <title>Electrochemically Driven Hydroxy&#8208;Thiocarbamation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 14, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces an electrochemical method for multi&#8208;component hydroxy&#8208;thiocarbamation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, using (hetero)aryl alkenes, KSCN, and H2O to produce &#946;&#8208;hydroxy primary S&#8208;thiocarbamates. The process is highly atom&#8208;economical, and demonstrates excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, enabling diverse product synthesis and late&#8208;stage natural product modification.

This article reports the first example of multi&#8208;component hydroxy&#8208;thiocarbamation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes in an electrochemical undivided cell. Simple and readily available electron&#8208;deficient (hetero)aryl alkenes, KSCN and H2O are used as starting materials to produce &#946;&#8208;hydroxy primary S&#8208;thiocarbamate derivatives in moderate to good yields. H2O is involved in the formation of carbamoyl and hydroxyl groups, making the method highly atom&#8208;economical. The reaction introduces multiple functional groups under mild and environmentally friendly conditions, without the need for metals or external oxidants. The reaction exhibits good functional&#8208;group tolerance and excellent product diversity. The procedure is operationally simple, and late&#8208;stage modification of natural products further demonstrates the practical application of the method.

         <title>High&#8208;Order Cascade Transformations on Tertiary &#946;&#8208;Enaminones for Step&#8208;Economical Construction of Molecular Diversity and Complexity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 14, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the recent development of enaminone&#8208;based high&#8208;order cascade single cyclization reaction and bicyclic annulation reaction via the formation of four or more new chemical bonds are summarized.

The generation of molecular diversity and complexity constitutes the major task of synthetic organic chemistry. In contrast, to achieve the maximum complexity and/or diversity of organic compound with minimum operational steps is of high significance by saving consumption of both the chemicals and the time for synthesis, enhancing the synthetic efficiency and sustainability. Based on our longstanding interest in the enaminone&#8208;based organic synthesis, herein, the research advances in high&#8208;order cascade reactions are reviewed, which involve in the formation of at least four new chemical bonds, including sigma&#8208;, pi&#8208;bonds and C&#63743;H bond, in one reaction of enaminones, showing how the high&#8208;step economy is achieved in the enaminone&#8208;based synthetic reactions. Since the known results all involves in the cyclization, the contents of the current manuscript are divided into two main sections: the single cyclization reaction and bicyclic annulation reaction.

         <title>Bifunctional Reagents for Photochemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 14, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively explores bifunctional reagents in photocatalysis, which integrate radical activation sites and coupling modules within a single molecule. It systematically categorizes them (radical precursor&#8208;radical precursor/nucleophile/electrophile/acceptor) based on reaction modes and active sites, detailing mechanisms like energy/electron transfer. Emphasis is placed on their advantages for precise, efficient, and selective molecular construction under mild conditions.

Bifunctional reagents in photochemistry integrate radical activation sites with coupling modules within a single molecular framework, enabling precise construction of sophisticated moleculars. This review systematically summarizes recent advancements and reaction mechanisms of these reagents in photocatalysis regulated by energy transfer or photoinduced electron transfer. It emphasizes how kinetic matching and electronic modulation achieve selective activation of radical precursors. Cutting&#8208;edge developments, including diverse metal&#8208;based and metal&#8208;free systems, and innovative mechanisms like strain&#8208;release and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, have expanded complex molecular synthesis. The review categorizes progress based on active sites and reaction modes into four classes: radical precursor&#8208;radical precursor, radical precursor&#8208;nucleophile, radical precursor&#8208;electrophile, and radical precursor&#8208;radical acceptor. Subclassifications are defined by the central atom type of radicals and transformation patterns, revealing intrinsic correlations between reagent parameters (e.g., bond dissociation energy, electronic distribution, steric effects) and reaction pathways. This review aims to establish precise yet universal methodologies for guiding drug synthesis and functional material development.

Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;thiocarboxylic acids featuring C&#8211;S chirality are valuable targets in organic synthesis. This review outlines recent progress in their asymmetric synthesis, including chiral pool approaches, metal&#8208; /organo&#8208;catalysis, and emerging biocatalytic strategies.

Enantiomerically pure &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;thiocarboxylic acids bearing a stereocentre at the C&#8211;S bond represent a class of compounds of notable significance in organic and medicinal chemistry. The chirality at the C&#8211;S bond presents both challenges and opportunities in synthetic chemistry. Traditionally, the enantioselective synthesis of these &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;thiocarboxylic acids has relied on chiral pool strategies using naturally derived precursors such as amino acids and hydroxycarboxylic acids. In recent years, the expansion of organo&#8208; and metal&#8208;catalysed methodologies, employing catalysts such as cinchona alkaloids, copper, and rhodium complexes, has led to strategies with improved efficiency and stereocontrol. Additionally, advances in biocatalysis have enabled more sustainable routes toward s these valuable compounds, using enzymes such as hydrolases and nitrilases. Given the growing academic and industrial interest in these compounds, this review provides an overview of the methods developed and the progresses made over the past two decades in the asymmetric synthesis of thiocarboxylic acids bearing a stereocentre at C&#8211;S bond.

         <dc:description>
Unleashing the power of Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides with LiCl/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

Herein, an efficient and mild Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed interrupted cycloaddition is described between organic azides and Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides, using diorganoyl dichalcogenides as trapping reagents of the Cu(I) triazolide intermediate to prepare fully substituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles containing an organochalcogen (S, Se, Te) group at C5 position. It is found that chalcogenoacetylenes and 1,4&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles are competitive side products in this reaction, but the use of Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides and LiCl as an additive in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) significantly increased the yields and selectivity for 1,4&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;5&#8208;organochalcogen&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides are well&#8208;known for their low solubility in organic solvents.

         <title>Harnessing Vinylogy with Radicals: Photoinduced &#947;&#8208;Benzylation Reactions of 2&#8208;Silyloxyfurans</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two radical&#8208;mediated benzylations of 2&#8208;silyloxyfurans, promoted by visible light and suitable photoredox catalysts have been disclosed. A broad scope of &#947;&#8208;benzyl butenolides was obtained in one step, some of which were used as strategic precursors to bio&#8208;valuable chiral butanolides. Notably, harnessing vinylogy with radicals brings new &#8220;chemical&#8221; life to silyloxyfurans, one of the most exploited vinylogous nucleophile in synthesis.

2&#8208;Silyloxyfurans are among the most exploited Mukaiyama&#8208;type vinylogous nucleophiles from which a myriad of bioactive &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones have been accessed. Although a plethora of &#8220;polar&#8221; reactions featuring this scaffold as a key player have been developed so far, its behavior in radical chemistry is still in its infancy. Herein, the development of two complementary vinylogous, radical&#8208;mediated benzylations of 2&#8208;silyloxyfurans, promoted by visible light and suitable photoredox catalysts, is described. Common to both photocatalytic cycles is the reduction of a suitable redox active ester forging a key benzyl radical intermediate, which undergoes two different fates. First, the photoinduced oxidation of the silyloxyfuran generates an unprecedented silyl&#8208;radical cation species able to trap the nucleophilic benzyl radical. Alternatively, with specific electron&#8208;rich substrates, the benzyl radical can be converted to the corresponding benzyl carbocation intermediate via a net&#8208;neutral radical&#8208;polar crossover pathway, enabling a vinylogous, polar benzylation reaction. A broad scope of chiral, &#947;&#8208;benzyl butenolides is obtained in one step, some of which are used as strategic precursors to access bioactive phenyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;valerolactone metabolites.

         <title>Heterogeneous Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 1,4&#8208;Conjugate Additions of Grignard Reagents to Cyclic and Linear Enones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition of Grignard reagents to various cyclic and linear enones using a heterogeneous catalyst is reported. Recyclable copper nanoparticles immobilized on polysaccharide support (e.g., cellulose, chitosan) enable high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. Integrated with asymmetric tandem reactions involving enals and &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, the method produces chiral &#946;,&#948;&#8208;disubstituted ketones with excellent stereoselectivity.

Highly selective conjugate additions of Grignard reagents to cyclic and linear enones catalyzed by recyclable heterogeneous polysaccharide/nanocopper catalysts are disclosed. The method also allows the synthesis of ketones with an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center. When integrated with catalytic asymmetric tandem reactions using enals and &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, it yields chiral &#946;,&#948;&#8208;disubstituted ketones with high stereoselectivity.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes (NHCs): An Emerging Efficient Catalyst in Amide Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents recent breakthroughs in N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed amide bond formation, covering metal&#8211;NHC and metal&#8208;free NHC systems. It emphasizes sustainable, mild, and atom&#8208;economical strategies, offering new mechanistic insights and broad substrate scope for green and efficient amide synthesis.

Since the discovery of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), their role as ligands and organocatalysts has grown significantly due to their unique umpolung reactivity and strong &#963;&#8208;donor capabilities. In recent years, the field of amide bond formation has seen notable advancements through NHC catalysis. Given the wide application of amides in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science, several NHC&#8208;based strategies have emerged for synthesizing amides from substrates such as aldehydes, alcohols, esters, and nitriles. This review highlights the sustainable and efficient nature of NHC&#8208;catalyzed amide bond formation. Both metal&#8211;NHC complexes and metal&#8208;free NHCs offer diverse catalytic pathways, with Ru&#8211;NHC systems proving especially effective in redox&#8208;neutral amidations. NHCs promote reactions through mechanisms involving acyl azolium, hemiaminal, and Breslow intermediates, enabling high selectivity under mild conditions. Many of these methods align with green chemistry principles, featuring high atom economy and minimal waste generation. The versatility and tunability of NHC catalysts allow broad substrate compatibility, and recent innovations include metal&#8208;free organocatalysis, continuous flow processes, and electrochemical amidation strategies. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of NHC&#8208;catalyzed amide formation, summarizing key mechanisms, substrate scope, and catalyst design, emphasizing their dual role in metal&#8208;based and organocatalytic sustainable amidation methods.

A photoresponsive aerobic cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction of N&#8208;substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines with nitroalkanes is developed using an iodide salt catalyst under blue LED irradiation, affording the C&#63743;C bond coupling products in high yields.

         <title>Perdeuteration of (Hetero)arenes in Flow Enabled by Defective Porous Carbon</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose, which is widely present in nature, is utilized as a precursor to prepare defective porous carbon materials and developed a general system for the perdeuteration of (hetero)arenes in flow.

Deuterium incorporation in organic compounds has been widely applied in medicinal chemistry and materials science. Specifically, fully deuterated aromatic compounds are frequently applied in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. For this application, there is a growing interest in the development of methods for perdeuteration. Herein, a general and scalable method for constructing perdeuterated (hetero)arenes using carbon materials via hydrogen isotope exchange reaction is described. Defective porous carbon material is generated by pyrolyzing cellulose, which permits perdeuteration of arenes and heteroarenes using inexpensive and easy&#8208;handling D2O as the deuterium source. Materials characterization and mechanistic studies reveal that vacancy&#8208;defect O&#8208;doped porous&#8208;carbon is generated after pyrolyze cellulose and D species in pores could be formed under continuous flow. This methodology represents a cost&#8208;effective methodology for scalable deuteration and enables efficient labeling in a straightforward manner.

         <title>Asymmetric C&#63743;H Functionalization Enabled by a Traceless Oxidizing Chiral Auxiliary</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#63743;H bond transformation by using a novel traceless oxidizing chiral directing group (CDGOX), which offers a general access chiral N&#8208;heterocycles with diverse chiral elements.

Chiral directing group strategy has long been utilized in the asymmetric C&#63743;H bond functionalization to access the complex molecules with different chiral elements. However, this strategy often encounters synthetic challenges such as the removal of preinstalled chiral auxiliaries. Reported herein is the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#63743;H bond transformation by using a novel oxidizing chiral directing group strategy (CDGOX). N&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;menthoxyl amide is designed and used as an oxidizing chiral auxiliary, which not only enables the stereoselective C&#63743;H bond transformation with diverse hydrocarbons but also be self&#8208;removed in situ through the intramolecular oxidation, constituting a traceless directing group for the asymmetric C&#63743;H bond transformation. Notably, the current strategy is capable of forming diverse chiral elements, e.g., axial chirality, planar chirality, and point chirality, providing a novel and complementary strategy for the construction of chiral N&#8208;heterocycles with good enantioselectivity.

         <title>Photocatalytic Polyene Cyclization to Cyclopentyl Thioethers with Consecutive Quaternary Centers in Fluorinated Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic strategy enables efficient cyclization of polyenes to cyclopentyl thioethers with consecutive all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers. Using 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate in 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol, the method proceeds via a thiyl radical mechanism, offering high yields and good diastereoselectivities.

The synthesis of carbocycles bearing consecutive all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers remains a formidable challenge in organic chemistry due to their steric congestion and synthetic inaccessibility. Herein, an efficient and sustainable photocatalytic strategy for the cyclization of polyenes to cyclopentane thioethers using 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate (TPT+) as a photocatalyst in 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) is reported. The transformation proceeds via a thiyl radical&#8208;initiated mechanism, forming multiple Csp3&#63743;Csp3$\left(\text{C}\right)_{\left(\text{sp}\right)^{3}} &amp;#x00026;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;bond; \left(\text{C}\right)_{\left(\text{sp}\right)^{3}}$ bonds and quaternary centers in a single step under mild conditions. The method tolerates a broad range of aliphatic and functionalized thiols and exhibits high yields and good diastereoselectivities, the latter strongly depending on the addressed mechanism of the transformation. Mechanistic investigations support a radical pathway initiated by thiol oxidation. This work highlights the potential of combining photocatalysis with microstructured solvent systems to facilitate polyene cyclizations. Overall, it provides a versatile platform for synthesizing sterically congested, biologically relevant carbocyclic frameworks.

A mild and highly efficient metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free electrochemical approach for the synthesis of 3&#8208;selenylated benzothiophene derivatives is described. In this innovative electrochemical cascade cyclization reaction, the selenylated benzothiophene skeletons can be constructed along with the formation of C&#63743;Se and C&#63743;S bonds in a single step. Moreover, this electrochemical protocol exhibits good functional group compatibility, paving the way for the construction of diverse selenylated benzothiophene compounds with various functional groups from readily available starting materials under an aerobic reaction condition. Meanwhile, a series of control experiments are carried out, and a reasonable reaction mechanism is proposed. Finally, the scaled&#8208;up reactions are performed, and then the photochemical and bioactive properties of the synthesized compounds are elaborately discussed.

A solvent&#8208;controlled divergent access to 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;pyrones and enamine derivatives starting from ketenimines with acylacetonitriles is reported.

A DABCO&#8208;mediated Mannich&#8208;type reaction of ketenimines with acylacetonitriles toward the stable &#946;&#8208;aminoacrylates is reported. The multifunctional properties of &#946;&#8208;aminoacrylates led to the discovery of a solvent&#8208;controlled divergent access to 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;pyrones and enamine derivatives. In addition, the selective reduction and dihalogenation of &#946;&#8208;aminoacrylates are also achieved, which greatly increased the structural diversity of the products.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A groundbreaking advancement in asymmetric catalysis is achieved with the development of a novel P&#8208;chiral PNN ligand for manganese(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation. This innovative ligand enables highly efficient asymmetric hydrogenation and asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones, delivering chiral alcohols in great reactivity (1560 TON) and high enantioselectivities (up to 92% ee) across 42 diverse substrates.

A novel chiral P*NN ligand featuring a P&#8208;chirality has been synthesized, and its catalytic properties in Manganese(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation and asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones are investigated. A broad range of substrates (42 examples) are hydrogenated, delivering a series of chiral alcohols with outstanding yields (&gt;90%) and good enantioselectivities (up to 92% ee). In addition, a plausible catalytic cycle is performed through deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry analysis.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalyzed hydroxydifluoromethylation of styrenes is described using readily available, easily&#8208;to&#8208;handle, and low&#8208;cost difluoroacetic anhydride as CF2H source in the presence of simple acetoxime as the activator, providing a practical and efficient approach to &#946;&#8208;difluoromethylated alcohols. This reaction occurs under white light, even sunlight irradiation, and can be easily scaled up to gram scale.

Herein, a practical photocatalytic method is described for the hydroxydifluoromethylation of styrenes using readily available, easily&#8208;to&#8208;handle, and low&#8208;cost difluoroacetic anhydride as CF2H source in the presence of simple acetoxime as the activator. The optimized conditions enable the reaction to proceed under mild white light, or even natural sunlight irradiation, yielding a range of &#946;&#8208;difluoromethylated alcohols in good yields. The gram&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage modification of bioactive molecules further highlight its potential applications.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative C&#63743;H o&#8208;Arylation of s&#8208;Aryltetrazines with Aryl Boronic Acids: One&#8208;Step Selective Access to T&#8208;Shaped and Z&#8208;Shaped Polyaromatics</title>

         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step regioselective access to T&#8208;Shaped and Z&#8208;Shaped polyaromatics s&#8208;tetrazines by a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#63743;H o&#8208;functionalization is reported. Electron&#8208;rich aryl coupling partners display a higher reactivity than electron&#8208;poor aryl, and allow the formation of poly(hetero)aromatic derivatives while avoiding 1,4&#8208;azaphilic addition of the organometallic reagents that may occur with organometallic nucleophiles such as aryl cuprates.

The N&#8208;directed rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H bond arylation of s&#8208;aryltetrazine is reported using arylboronic acids as coupling partners. Convenient synthetic conditions are identified that avoid the 1,4&#8208;azaphilic addition of the organometallic reagents on the tetrazine core, that may occur with organometallic nucleophiles, such as aryl cuprates. Thus, using [RhCl2Cp*]2 and Cu(OAc)2 in trifluoromethylbenzene favors the C&#63743;H activation and direct arylation of the s&#8208;tetrazine. This setup tolerates both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the (hetero)aryl boronic acids. Electron&#8208;rich aryl coupling partners display a higher reactivity, and allow the formation of polyaromatic derivatives. This methodology provides a facile and straightforward route to diversely structured polyaromatics incorporating the valuable s&#8208;tetrazine core, with so&#8208;called T&#8208;shaped and Z&#8208;shaped architectures.

This setup tolerates both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on the (hetero)aryl boronic acids. Electron-rich aryl coupling partners display a higher reactivity, and allow the formation of polyaromatic derivatives. This methodology provides a facile and straightforward route to diversely structured polyaromatics incorporating the valuable s-tetrazine core, with so-called &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;-shaped and &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-shaped architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances in Catalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of Seven&#8208; and Eight&#8208;Membered Rings with Inherent Chirality</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review mainly highlights recent advancements in asymmetric catalytic synthesis of seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings with inherent chirality. It will provide a stepping stone for further investigations by summarizing and discussing the recent developments in the area of synthesis of inherently chiral cycles.

Inherently chiral seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered cyclic frameworks constitute privileged structural motifs in natural products and bioactive compounds. While remarkable achievements have been made in enantioselective synthesis of centrally and axially chiral seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings, the catalytic atroposelective construction of inherent chiral systems remains a significant challenge in modern organic synthesis. Current methodologies predominantly focus on calix[n]arene assemblies, particularly enantioenriched calix[4]arenes, whose success in materials science applications has been well&#8208;documented in recent reviews. This review systematically summarizes emerging strategies for catalytic asymmetric access to seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings, encompassing both direct asymmetric functionalization of preformed rings and de&#8201;novo ring&#8208;forming approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on catalytic asymmetric annulation methodologies and stereoselective functional group transformations that induce inherent chirality. By critically analyzing the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art and existing limitations, this review aims to inspire innovative catalytic systems and unconventional disconnection strategies for constructing these biologically relevant yet synthetically challenging architectures.

         <title>TBHP/Ammonium/Iodide&#8208;Promoted Ring&#8208;Opening of Cyclobutanones toward &#947;&#8208;Iodo Nitriles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TBHP/ammonium/iodide&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;opening reaction of a variety of cyclobutanones is developed to access &#947;&#8208;iodo nitriles. The key intermediate of this transformation is a C&#8208;centered radical formed by undergoing &#946;&#8208;scission from iminyl radical. As such, this mild transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free procedure provides a direct, facile, and efficient pathway toward diverse &#947;&#8208;iodo functionalized nitriles.

A TBHP/ammonium/iodide&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;opening of a variety of cyclobutanones is developed to access &#947;&#8208;iodo nitriles in DCM under N2 at 40&#8201;&#176;C. This transformation initiated with in&#8201;situ imination, forming an iminyl radical that underwent &#946;&#8208;scission to yield a ring&#8208;opening C&#8208;centered radical. The latter successively underwent a single electron transfer followed by nucleophilic substitution, or alternatively proceeded via a halogen&#8208;atom transfer process to generate &#947;&#8208;iodo nitrile. As such, this mild transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free procedure provides a direct, facile, and efficient pathway toward diverse &#947;&#8208;iodo functionalized nitriles.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Radical Cyclization of Unactivated Olefins with Perfluoroalkyl Iodides to Access Perfluoroalkylated Ortho&#8208;Diazaheterocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical cascade cyclization method for unactivated olefins with perfluoroalkyl iodides (IRf), constructing diverse perfluoroalkylated ortho&#8208;diazaheterocyclic compounds was developed. This catalytic strategy demonstrates broad substrate scope and has been successfully applied to 34 examples. Moreover, the reaction is initiated through the formation of an electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex between IRf and TMEDA.

An efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven strategy for the radical perfluoroalkylation/tandem cyclization of unactivated alkenes with perfluoroalkyl iodides (IRf) has been developed, enabling efficient synthesis of perfluoroalkylated heterocyclic derivatives, including pyrazoles, pyridazines, and benzodiazepines. This methodology features broad substrate compatibility with 34 examples, affording the desired products in yields up to 81%. Results of mechanistic studies indicate that the formation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex between perfluoroalkyl iodides and TMEDA greatly initiates the reaction, avoiding the use of extra catalysts and oxidants.

The B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation of 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes and glyoxals with PMHS affords 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines in high yields. The asymmetric variant can be achieved by using the chiral borane catalyst formed in&#8201;situ from HB(C6F5)2 and a binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral diene and PhSiH3, affording chiral products with excellent enantioselectivities.

Borane&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation of 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes and glyoxals for step&#8208;economic synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines has been developed. The use of B(C6F5)3 catalyst and polymethylhydrosiloxane provides convenient access to various 2&#8208;aryl&#8208; and 2&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxaline products in good to excellent yields with wide substrate scope and broad tolerance of functional groups. The asymmetric variant of this reaction can be achieved by using the enantioenriched borane catalyst generated in&#8201;situ from HB(C6F5)2 and a binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral diene and PhSiH3, affording a variety of chiral 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines with enantioselectivities ranging from 90% to &gt;99% ee. The judicious selection of borane catalyst and hydrosilane has been demonstrated to be crucial for catalysis. This cascade reaction proceeds with simple operation, and can be easily scaled up. Preliminary mechanistic studies have been performed to elucidate the catalytic pathway.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from 2&#8208;diazobenzophenones, a straightforward synthesis of valuable fluorenones via a gold&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot oxidation, C&#8211;H activation, and cyclization is described. The addition of ascorbic acid, the correct selection of the counteranion of the 2&#8208;diazobenzophenones, and the use of terpyridine as an auxiliary ligand are crucial for the reaction to proceed in good yields.

This study shows that aryldiazonium salts can participate as electrophiles in gold&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H arylation of arenes. Using 2&#8208;diazo benzophenones, a gold&#8208;catalyzed oxidation/C&#8211;H activation/cyclization sequence has been developed, leading to valuable fluorenones. Key parameters for the reaction to proceed in good yields are the introduction of electron&#8208;donating groups, the use of PF6&#8722; as counteranion, and terpyridine as an auxiliary ligand.

         <title>Water&#8208;Mediated 1,7&#8208;Palladium Aryl&#8208;to&#8208;Aryl Migration in an Unusual Aryne Trimerization Enables the Synthesis of Multihelicenes with Profoundly Hindered Stereogenic Axes</title>

         <dc:description>
In the presence of a Pd0 catalyst, large &#960;&#8208;extended arynes trimerize in an unusual manner to forge extremely compact and strained chiral benzenoids. This new trimerization reaction involves a 1,7&#8208;Pd isomerization, a rare and poorly understood process that is elucidated.

The nickel(0)&#8208;catalyzed [2&#8201;+&#8201;2&#8201;+&#8201;2] cyclotrimerization of 13,14&#8208;picyne, a &#960;&#8208;extended aryne intermediate having bay regions at both sides of the aryne triple bond, has recently enabled the synthesis of an overcrowded triple [7]helicene. In contrast, it has now been found that under palladium(0) catalysis, the same &#960;&#8208;extended aryne intermediate trimerizes in a very different manner, notably featuring a formal 1,7&#8208;hydrogen shift coupled with a rare 1,7&#8208;palladium aryl&#8208;to&#8208;aryl migration. Remarkably, this new aryne trimerization reaction seems general and reveals possible using a further &#960;&#8208;extended analog of 13,14&#8208;picyne. The two chiral multi[5]helicenes thus obtained have, in addition to helical stereogenic elements, a profoundly hindered stereogenic biaryl axis located in the fjord region of a carbo[5]helicene fragment. Both compounds are characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, which reveals their remarkably compact and severely distorted structures. A thorough mechanistic study, combining experiments and DFT simulations, shows that the observed 1,7&#8208;Pd aryl&#8208;to&#8208;aryl migration is a two&#8208;step 1,4&#8208;to&#8208;1,4&#8217;&#8208;Pd isomerization process enabled by the presence of trace amounts of water, a proton shuttle, in the reaction mixture.

         <title>Synthesis of Spirolactones from Carbonyls via Carboborylation of N&#8208;Sulfonylhydrazones with Alkoxycarbonylalkylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spirolactones are readily prepared from carbonyls via their N&#8208;tosylhydrazones. The reaction involves carboborylation with ethoxycarbonyl&#8208;substituted boronic acids, followed by oxidation and lactonization. Thermal or photochemical protocols enable versatility. The approach is applicable to natural products and bioactive molecules, demonstrating broad substrate scope and synthetic utility.

A straightforward synthesis of spirolactones from carbonyls via N&#8208;tosylhydrazones is described. The process consists of a reaction between N&#8208;tosylhydrazones and ethoxycarbonylethylboronic acid or ethoxycarbonylpropylboronic acid, leading to spiro &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones or &#948;&#8208;valerolactones, respectively. The transformation takes place by carboborylation of the N&#8208;tosylhydrazone followed by oxidation of the homologated boronic acid that delivers a hydroxyester, which undergoes further lactonization to yield a spirocyclic lactone. Depending on the structure of the starting N&#8208;tosylhydrazone, thermal or photochemical protocols are applied for the key carboborylation reaction. The usefulness of the process is illustrated by the application in a variety of natural products and biologically relevant carbonyl&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Iterative Use of Regiocomplementary Flavin&#8208;Dependent Halogenases Gives Access to Unique Halogenation Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The halide motif is ubiquitous in organic synthesis, facilitating fine&#8208;tuning of molecular properties and functionalization using substitution and cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Combination of different flavin&#8208;dependent tryptophan halogenases enables the installation of novel halogenation patterns on l&#8208;tryptophan, which can be orthogonally addressed in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions, yielding a plethora of halogenated biaryl and triaryl building blocks for the synthesis offine chemicals.

Flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases provide an environmentally friendly, highly regioselective toolkit for the halogenation of various aryl compounds. While previous works characterize the substrate scope of many halogenases individually, exploration of their combinatorial use has thus far been at best superficial. In this study, combinations of the Trp&#8208;halogenases PyrH, Thal, RebH, and AetF are used to synthesize a range of novel di&#8208; and trihalogenated tryptophan derivatives. All tested enzymes accept some halotryptophan derivatives well, while others are mostly rejected. This behavior is rationalized using crystallographic data in conjunction with molecular docking. Upscaling using halogenase combiCLEAs provides facile access to nine novel di&#8208; and even trihalogenated tryptophan derivatives. The more reactive bromine and iodine substituents prove orthogonal to chlorine substituted positions during Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling, readily giving access to chlorinated biaryl scaffolds. Finally, the strategic selection of two different boronic acids enables the selective synthesis of indole&#8208;containing triaryl compounds.

An efficient and scalable metal&#8208;free method is developed for C3&#8208;alkylation of indoles to access &#946;&#8208;(3&#8208;indolyl)carbonyl frameworks employing alkylidene and arylidene malonates as alkyl surrogates, catalyzed by nontoxic and inexpensive iodine.

An efficient and scalable metal&#8208;free protocol is developed for C3&#8208;alkylation of indoles employing alkylidene and arylidene malonates as alkyl surrogates, catalyzed by nontoxic and inexpensive iodine. The developed methodology is operationally simple and provides access to a diverse range of products in high yields, up to 95%. The method is further extended and developed into an one&#8208;pot stepwise synthesis strategy for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;(3&#8208;indolyl)carboxylic acid derivatives. Via product modifications, pharmaceutically relevant 5,10&#8208;dihydroindeno[1,2&#8208;b]indole (DHII) and carboline&#8208;based core for MK2 inhibitor analogues are synthesized.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Amino Esters with &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Carbon Centers via NHC/Photoredox Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#947;&#8208;Amino acid derivatives with an &#945;&#8208;quaternary center are prevalent in medicinally important compounds. A dual N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene/photocatalytic pathway is developed for the three&#8208;component synthesis of &#945;, &#945; &#8208;disubstituted &#947;&#8208;amino esters. This methodology allows for the rapid synthesis of diverse libraries of &#947;&#8208;amino esters in good yields.

         <title>Deazaflavin&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation of White Phosphorus with Aryl Bromides and Chlorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 5&#8208;aryldeazaflavin photocatalyst o&#8208;Me&#8208;dFl catalyzes the arylation of white phosphorus with aryl chlorides and bromides under near UV&#8208;LED irradiation, affording triarylphosphines and tetraarylphosphonium salts. Nuclear magnetic resonance&#160;studies and density functional theory&#160;calculations offer insights into the reaction pathway.

A substantial improvement in the challenging photocatalytic arylation of white phosphorus (P4) with aryl chlorides and bromides is reported. Using the readily accessible deazaflavin&#8208;based photocatalyst o&#8208;Me&#8208;dFl, valuable triarylphosphines (PAr3) and tetraarylphosphonium salts ([PAr4]X, X&#8201;=&#8201;Br, Cl) are synthesized from P4 under near UV&#8208;LED (365&#8201;nm) irradiation in up to 87% combined yield with drastically reduced reaction times compared to previous protocols. 31P nuclear magnetic resonance&#160;spectroscopic monitoring studies and density functional theory calculations provide insights into the reaction pathway. The results represent an important step toward more atom&#8208;efficient and economical photocatalytic P4 functionalization reactions.

         <title>CO2 Conversion in Water Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water microdroplets significantly accelerate CO2 conversion reactions and enable otherwise unfavorable processes due to their unique physicochemical environment&#8212;characterized by strong interfacial effects, intrinsic electric fields, localized super acidic or basic conditions, radical formation, and enhanced reducing power.

Microdroplet chemistry is gaining recognition as a powerful tool and promising platform due to its unique physicochemical environment, suitable for a wide range of applications. When scaled down to the nano&#8208; or micrometer range, microdroplets possess a high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio and exhibit several distinctive properties, such as strong interfacial effects, electric fields, super acidic or basic environments, radical generation, and enhanced reducing power. These characteristics contribute to accelerated reaction rates and enable reactions that are otherwise unfavorable. This minireview explores and discusses the applications of microdroplet chemistry in CO2 conversion processes.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Directed Selectivity in Vinylcarbene Reactions: A Comparative Study of Ag, Rh, and Cu Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals that ligand stereoelectronic effects, rather than vinylogous electrophilicity, govern selectivity in Ag&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Cu&#8208;catalyzed vinylcarbene C(sp3)&#63743;H insertions. These insights guide the design of more selective catalysts for C&#63743;H functionalization.

A comprehensive mechanistic investigation is conducted to uncover the factors governing the selectivity of Ag, Rh, and Cu catalysts in vinylcarbene&#8208;mediated reactions. The study examines the preference for carbenic versus vinylogous C(sp3)&#63743;H bond insertion, highlighting the critical roles of the electronic and steric properties of transition metal catalysts. Contrary to previous assumptions that the enhanced electrophilic character of the vinylogous position in metal vinyl carbenes is the primary determinant, the findings demonstrate that the stereoelectronic effects of the ligand play a more dominant role. These insights inform the design of catalytic systems with tailored selectivity, advancing predictive catalysis and C&#63743;H bond functionalization.

         <title>Green&#8208;Light Photocatalytic Synthesis of Non&#8208;Proteinogenic Isothiocyanate&#8208;Decorated Amino Acids from Lysine Residues and Carbon Disulfide</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable and mild approach for the synthesis of unnatural isothiocyanate&#8208;decorated amino acids from lysine residues and carbon disulfide via green&#8208;light photocatalysis is presented. A series of pharmacologically interesting isothiocyanate&#8208;containing amino acids and oligopeptides is obtained through the desulfurization strategy with the wide tolerance of protected groups and amino acid residues, which can be further converted into thiocitrulline derivatives.

A sustainable and mild approach for the synthesis of nonproteinogenic isothiocyanate&#8208;decorated amino acids from lysine residues and carbon disulfide via green&#8208;light photocatalysis is described. A series of pharmacologically interesting isothiocyanate&#8208;containing amino acids and oligopeptides are synthesized for the first time through the desulfurization method with the wide tolerance of protected groups and amino acid residues. The produced unnatural amino acids can be successfully converted into thioamide&#8208;containing amino acids such as thiocitrulline and its analogs. Mechanism studies support the dithiocarbamate radical coupling, deprotonation, and desulfurization processes. This approach expands the scope of nonproteinogenic amino acids and provides a new type of amino acid residues with a robust active site, which are significant organic building blocks and potential biological diagnostic markers.

A doubly chemoselective and switchable diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of the indanedione&#8208;tethered benzofurans and &#946;&#8208;acylated arylidene indandiones is reported. The key features of this approach include chemoselective acylation by changing the addition sequence of acylating agents with distinct reactivities, and efficient control over the competition between catalytic and stoichiometric processes.

An efficient, chemoselective, and switchable diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of &#946;&#8208;acylated arylidene indandiones and the indanedione&#8208;based formal cross&#8208;coupling benzofuran adducts is reported, which is challenging to realize by conventional strategies. It is achieved via a chemoselective acylation by altering the addition sequence of acylating agents with distinct reactivities, followed by &#946;&#8208;acylation or chemoselective intramolecular Wittig reactions, with the in&#8201;situ&#8208;generated bis&#8208;acylated phosphorus ylides as the key intermediates.

         <title>Electrochemical [3+2] Cycloaddition to Access 5&#8208;Aryl(alkyl)thiotetrazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
5&#8208;Aryl(alkyl)thiotetrazoles were synthesized via an electrochemical three&#8208;component cascade reaction of thiophenols/thiols, isocyanides and azides.

An electrochemical three&#8208;component reaction of thiophenols/thiols, isocyanides and azides is developed. By using carbon felt (GF) as anode and platinum plate as cathode, a series of 5&#8208;aryl(alkyl)thiotetrazoles are obtained in moderate to good yields. The reaction is proposed to occur through cascade radical addition, oxidation, and [3+2] cycloaddition. The method could be further extended to the synthesis of 5&#8208;alkyl(aryl)selenyltetrazoles. The simple and mild reaction conditions, good substrate scope and scalability make this reaction have a good application prospect in organic synthesis.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Amide Synthesis from Alcohols: An Ammonia&#8208;Free Approach with Dihydrogen Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and selective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed method for synthesizing primary amides directly from alcohols, with the concurrent release of molecular hydrogen, is reported.

A highly efficient and selective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed method for synthesizing primary amides directly from alcohols, with the concurrent release of molecular hydrogen, is reported. The reaction proceeds through tandem dehydrogenative coupling, oxime ether and nitrile as intermediate using methoxyamine as the amine source. The present strategy simplifies traditional processes, offering a more direct route to primary amides. Mechanistic investigations are conducted to elucidate and support the proposed reaction pathway.

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Chloro and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Dichloro Acetamidines via the Carbenoids Addition to Inherently Low Electrophilic Carbodiimides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbodiimides act as competent electrophilic synthons for the chemoselective addition of lithium mono&#8208; and di&#8208;halocarbenoids. The transformation is provided through a single synthetic operation&#8212;hitherto elusive&#8212;halogenated acetamidines. Interestingly, the constitutively tamed electrophilicity of the starting materials is effectively counterbalanced by the usage of the highly reactive halogenated organolithiums.

The hitherto few explored &#945;&#8208;halomethyl amidine motif has been assembled through the addition of a lithiated (di)&#8208;halomethane (i.e., carbenoid) to easily accessible N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl&#8208;substituted carbodiimides. Despite the inherent low electrophilicity of these heterocumulenes&#8212;as quantitatively determined in Mayr's previous studies&#8212;their sp&#8208;hybridized carbon atom acts as a competent site of attack for these tamed nucleophiles. The overall high&#8208;yielding transformation featuring a genuine chemoselective profile&#8212;as documented by using variously functionalized materials&#8212;is adaptable to the addition of dihalogenated carbenoids. Reaction products could be advantageously used in nucleophilic substitution sequences as well as in further functionalization of the nitrogen atoms due to the constitutive heteroallyl&#8208;type skeleton.

         <title>Electrolyte&#8208;Free Electrochemical C3&#8208;Arylmethylation of Indoles with Tertiary/Secondary N&#8208;Methyl Anilines using N&#8208;Methyl as the Methylene Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an electrochemical C3&#8208;arylmethylation of indoles with tertiary/secondary N&#8208;methyl anilines using the N&#8208;methyl as the methylene donor to link indoles and anilines under electrolyte&#8208;, oxidant&#8208;, and catalyst&#8208;free conditions, producing various C3&#8208;arylmethylated indoles in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields after the cleavage of the C&#63743;N bond in presumed C3&#8208;aminomethylated indoles.

An electrochemical approach devoid of electrolytes, oxidants, metals, and light is established for the C3&#8208;arylmethylation of indoles using tertiary/secondary N&#8208;methyl anilines, demonstrating a wide substrate scope, with N&#8208;methyl serving as the methylene donor. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the presumed C3&#8208;aminomethylated indole acts as a reactive intermediate, facilitating the formation of the arylmethylated product via radical/electrophilic addition, anodic oxidation/deprotonation, fragmentation, and cathodic reduction/protonation processes.

         <dc:description>
This work presents an efficient rongalite&#8208;induced cascade C&#8722;C/C=O bond formation reaction involving indoles, difluoromethyl bromides, and H2O for the synthesis of indole&#8208;3&#8208;glyoxylates and indole&#8208;3&#8208;yl&#8208;glyoxylamides. Mechanistic insights reveal rongalite's dual role as a super electron donor for C&#8722;C coupling and a proton source for C&#8722;F bond cleavage, enabling C=O formation. The method boasts high efficiency, scalability, and wide substrate scope.

Mechanistic studies suggest that rongalite may act as a precursor of a super electron donor to activate difluoromethyl bromides for C&#63743;C bond formation, as well as a source of protons to facilitate the cleavage of the C&#63743;F bond for C&#63742;O bond formation. The cascade reaction exhibits remarkable efficiency, broad substrate compatibility, and scalability. Moreover, the products can be further transformed into valuable heterocyclic structures and pharmacologically active compounds.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;H Activation and Cyclization with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations of isocyanates via C(sp2)&#8208;H activation (2006&#8211;2025). It categorizes advances by substrate type, and provides a concise analysis of substrate scopes, limitations, molecular modifiability, mechanistic studies, and their applications in the synthesis of diversely functionalized molecules. Future challenges are outlined.

Nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds represent the core structures of natural products and drugs, and their efficient synthesis is of great significance for the development of medicinal chemistry and functional materials. Isocyanates, owing to their high electrophilicity and multifunctionality, have become a universal building block for constructing complex nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of isocyanates through C(sp2)&#63743;H bond activation to construct heterocyclic frameworks has emerged as an atom&#8208;economical alternative. This review systematically summarizes the research progress of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of isocyanates through C(sp2)&#8208;H activation from 2006 to 2025. It categorizes these advancements according to the substrates involved in the cyclization reaction, providing a concise analysis of substrate scopes, limitations, molecular modifiability, mechanistic studies, and their applications in the precise synthesis of diversely functionalized molecules. Moreover, the main challenges and future opportunities are also succinctly elucidated with the goal of expanding the application range of these reactions.

We report the diazo&#8208;transfer from Hypervalent Iodine Diazo Reagents to azocarboxylates under photocatalytic conditions. The subsequent intramolecular decarboxylative cyclization leads to the divergent access to 1&#8201;H&#8208;diazirines and 1H&#8208;tetrazoles depending upon the substituents in the azo&#8208;substrate. The control experiments suggested that the diazo&#8208;group transfer may take place through photocatalytically generated diazomethyl radical intermediate or through electrophilic diazomethylation of azocarboxylate radical anion

The integration between visible&#8208;light photocatalysis and biocatalysis has the potential to greatly improve modern organic synthesis by combining the production of valuable synthetic intermediates under mild photochemical conditions with the high degree of stereoselectivity reached by enzymes. The review collects the recent efforts in the photoenzymatic asymmetric synthesis of alcohols and amines.

The stereocontrolled formation of C&#63743;O and C&#63743;N bonds is important for the preparation of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, fragrances, and flavors. In this field, enzymes have become a valid alternative to transition metal complexes and organocatalysts due to their high degree of stereoselectivity and desirable sustainability features. In this scenario, the increasing interest toward sustainable and efficient chemical processes has also led to the combination of complementary catalytic systems. The merge of biocatalysis and photocatalysis is among the most recent approaches. While photocatalysis allows the production of valuable synthetic intermediates and reactive species under mild conditions, biocatalysis exploits highly specific enzymes to catalyze reactions with high (stereo)&#8208;selectivity and minimal byproduct formation. This review summarizes the progress in photoenzymatic catalysis (also photobiocatalysis), emphasizing their complementary mechanisms in producing chiral alcohols and amines, and highlights how such integration not only enhances the sustainability of catalytic systems but also expands the scope of reactions accessible under milder and ultimately more sustainable conditions.

         <title>Insights into Alkene Hydroselenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the hydroselenation reactions of alkenes with selenols or their surrogates for the synthesis of valuable organoselenium compounds, with a special emphasis on the mechanisms of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed and radical hydroselenation.

Selective hydrofunctionalization of alkenes enables the efficient construction of structurally diverse and value&#8208;added molecules with new functionalities. The past few decades have witnessed rapid applications of organoselenium compounds in pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and materials. Alkene hydroselenation represents one of the most promising strategies for the highly regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208;, and stereoselective synthesis of selenium&#8208;containing substances. This review outlines the hydroselenation reactions of alkenes with selenols or their surrogates developed over the past five decades and discusses the origin of selectivity based on representative examples. These developments are categorized according to the reactivity patterns exhibited by the selenium nucleophiles. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, light&#8208;induced, and electrocatalytic hydroselenation are highlighted to enhance the understanding of the mechanism.

This article discusses the reports on DG&#8208;assisted site&#8208;selective di&#8208;ortho&#8208;arylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkenylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkynylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;cyanation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;amination, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;thiolation/selenation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;carbonylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;halogenation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;oxygenation, and unsymmetrical di&#8208;ortho C&#63743;H functionalization of inert aryl and heteroaryl C&#63743;H bonds. This unique approach has gotten tremendous attention over the last two decades for the synthesis of complex functionalized aryls.

The directing group (DG)&#8208;assisted transition metal (TM)&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective C&#63743;H activation and functionalization has become a popular approach in the synthesis of natural products, pharmaceuticals, and late&#8208;stage functionalization. In particular, the ortho&#8208;selective C&#63743;H functionalization is frequently addressed. One DG generally directs the mono&#8208;C&#63743;H functionalization. However, over the years, there are some exceptional reactions that have been reported where one DG directs di&#8208;ortho&#8208;C&#63743;H functionalization, offering extra functionalization in one pot. There is no generalization in this type of reaction. In this comprehensive report, the di&#8208;ortho&#8208;C&#63743;H functionalization reactions reported in the recent two decades (2004&#8211;2024) are summarized, and the current status and future perspective for further modifications are provided. This discussion covers DG&#8208;assisted site&#8208;selective di&#8208;ortho&#8208;arylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkenylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkynylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;cyanation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;amination, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;thiolation/selenation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;carbonylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;halogenation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;oxygenation, and unsymmetrical di&#8208;ortho C&#63743;H functionalization of inert aryl and heteroaryl C&#63743;H bonds.

         <title>CuF2&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;N Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Silanes: Expanding the Scope of Chan&#8208;Lam Type Reaction</title>

Abstract
An efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8211;Lam type N&#8208;arylation of various amides, sulfonamides, urea, azoles, and amines has been demonstrated using a CuF2/DMSO catalytic system with structurally diverse aryl(trimethoxy)silanes under base and ligand&#8208;free conditions. This approach facilitates effective C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling with user&#8208;friendly organosilicon reagents without requiring an external fluoride source. CuF2 serves a dual function as both a catalyst and a desilylating agent, facilitating the cleavage of the aryl&#8208;silane bond. The process is compatible with a broad range of substrates, ensuring high efficiency and excellent functional group compatibility. Moreover, this protocol is proven to be valuable for late&#8208;stage modification of amide and sulfonamide&#8208;containing drug molecules, as well as for synthesizing agrochemicals.

         <title>eAmidation: An Electrochemical Amidation of Aldehydes via the Oxidation of N&#8208;Aryl Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the use of electrochemistry has emerged as a powerful yet sustainable means of enabling key transformations. Amidation is one of the most frequently executed transformations in synthetic chemistry, and using an electrochemical approach, the current study has demonstrated the synthesis of amides from aldehydes and amines. Mechanistic work indicates that the reaction proceeds via the oxidation of an intermediate hydrazone to generate an acyl diazene as the acylating species. The protocol developed has enabled the synthesis of a broad range of amides, including access to pharmaceutically relevant products, directly from aldehydes without recourse for hazardous chemical oxidants and activating agents.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the use of electrochemistry has emerged as a powerful yet sustainable means of enabling key transformations. Amidation is one of the most frequently executed transformations in synthetic chemistry, and using an electrochemical approach, the current study has demonstrated the synthesis of amides from aldehydes and amines. Mechanistic work indicates that the reaction proceeds via the oxidation of an intermediate hydrazone to generate an acyl diazene as the acylating species. The protocol developed has enabled the synthesis of a broad range of amides, including access to pharmaceutically relevant products, directly from aldehydes without recourse for hazardous chemical oxidants and activating agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand controlled regio&#8208;divergent [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of alkynes by merging electrochemistry and nickel catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions between three alkynes, a diyne and an alkyne, or a triyne offer a straightforward and typical protocol toward all kinds of polysubstituted benzens. Herein, the synthesis of polysubstituted aromatics through electrochemical nickel catalyzed cyclotrimerization of alkynes is developed. The regio&#8208;divergent cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes was achieved by judicious choice of ligands. And tributylphosphine, sterically hindered bipyridine or &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands delivered 1,2,4&#8208; and 1,3,5&#8208;substituted aromatics with high regioselectivities respectively. Besides, the semi&#8208;intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between	diynes and alkynes are also amenable under this catalytic system. This approach operates without metal reductant, exhibits wide functional groups tolerance, ease of scalability and furnishes 75 examples with moderate to good yields, including some biorelevant compounds. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculation revealed the catalytic pathways of 1,3,5&#8208; and 1,2,4&#8208;cyclotrimerizations, and the origin of the ligand controlled regioselectivity.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydration reactions of diynes to access tetrasubstituted cyclohexenones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;carboalkoxy&#8208;3&#8208;substituted&#8208;cyclohexenones are powerful building blocks for the synthesis of a variety of bioactive target molecules. Their preparations requires multi&#8208;steps sequence involving the use of stoichiometric quantities of various reagents, while the catalytic approaches are limitited to trisubstituted cyclohexenones. We describe here an efficient catalytic approach based on gold(I)&#8208;catalysis starting from unsymmetrical diynyl mono&#8208;ester or symmetrical diynyl di&#8208;ester substrates. The carbon chain linking the two alkyne functions can bear two or one substituent, or even be unsubstituted. Regardless of the nature of the substrates and independently of its substitution, the cyclohexenone derivatives are cleanly produced.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(II) complex dispersed in imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid: Recyclable catalyst system for regioselective and chemoselective hydrobromination and hydrochlorination of alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a recyclable catalyst system combining Cu(II)O and 4,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline in a 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid for the hydrohalogenation of alkynes. The reaction efficiently yields alkenyl bromides and chlorides with good functional group tolerance and regioselectivity across a range of functionalized alkynes. Remarkably, the reaction exhibits unprecedented chemoselectivity for alkyne over alkenes in polyenynes and enables late&#8208;stage modifications to rapidly synthesize brominated polyenes. The catalyst system could be recycled for up to six runs without significant reduction of the reaction yield.</dc:description>

         <title>SuFEx reactions when shaken not stirred
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Click reactions display many of the goals desired for more sustainable chemical
conversions.  Yet, the solvent used is an often overlooked aspect in determining the
environmental impact of reactions. In the current paper we develop the first
mechanochemical method for the efficient and solvent&#8208;free SuFEx reaction of sulfonyl
fluorides with a wide range of phenols.  After outlining the optimization process, which
yields an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use and robust method, we provide indications of the very wide
scope of this approach, and demonstrate this potential via the application to a range of
natural phenols that also display other functionalities, and several gram&#8208;scale
syntheses.</dc:description>
