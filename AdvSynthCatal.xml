      <title>Synthesis of Metallocene Analogues of the Phenethylamine and Tetrahydroisoquinoline Scaffolds via Regioselective Ring Opening of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;N&#8208;Sulfonyl Aziridines</title>
      <dc:description>The Lewis (or Br&#248;nsted) acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridines with ferrocene and ruthenocene provided new aminofunctionalized metallocene derivatives arising from a regioselective ring opening of the aziridine. The functionalized metallocene derivatives available by this methodology are suitable precursors for the stereoselective synthesis of metallocene analogues of the relevant tetrahydroisoquinoline motif by a Pictet&#8208;Spengler type reaction. These isoquinoline analogues are also accessible by a TfOH&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridines, ferrocene (or ruthenocene) and formaldehyde.</dc:description>

The inside cover picture illustrates the impact of visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photocatalysis to generate imidoyl radical intermediates and their applications in the construction of diverse heterocyclic scaffolds.

      <dc:description>A direct synthesis of spiro[5.5] and [5.4]&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines has been developed through C(sp3)&#8212;H bond functionalization triggered by sequential [1,5]&#8208; hydride shift /cyclization sequence using ortho amino benzaldehydes and active methylene compounds such as 2&#8208;coumaranone, 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin, 3&#8208;coumaranone, and 3&#8208;isochromanone. This protocol provides a Lewis acid catalyst&#8208;free straight forward one&#8208;pot reaction in cases of 2&#8208;coumaranone and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin, Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed stepwise reaction for 3&#8208;coumaranone and 3&#8208;isochromanone to access a wide range of spiro&#8208;heterocycles in excellent to good yields and diastereoselectivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Heterocyclics via Cascade Cyclization of Propargylic Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>Heterocyclic compounds are important organic compounds and have emerged as key scaffolds in numerous drugs, natural products, vitamins, biologically and pharmaceutically active compounds. Over the past few decades, the development of versatile methodologies employing propargylic alcohols as synthons for the construction of heterocyclic skeletons has attracted great attention from synthetic chemists. In this review, recent developments in the cascade cyclization of propargylic alcohols with diverse nucleophiles to construct heterocyclic compounds are summarized. According to the types of nucleophiles, these reactions can be divided into four categories: 1) Reactions involving C&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation; 2) Reactions involving O, S&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation; 3) Reactions involving N, P&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation; 4) Reactions involving halo&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation.</dc:description>

These features endow COFs with great potential in the development of function&#8208;tailored materials, particularly in catalytic organic synthesis.

As heterogeneous organic catalysts, COFs bring benefits and solve problems, but also create new obstacles.

The inside cover picture shows the palladium&#8208;catalyzed selective carbofunctionalization of inert &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;O bonds of aliphatic amides by using the strategy of sp3 C&#8208;H activation/&#946;&#8208;O elimination/hydrocarbofunctionalization with the assistance of 8&#8208;aminoquinolyl directing group. Notable features of the strategy include (i) the use of hydroxypyridones and analogous hydroxypyrones as nucleophilic reagents for the first time to achieve carbofunctionalization of C(sp3)&#8208;O bonds, (ii) the realization of inert &#947;&#8208;methyl and methylene C(sp3)&#8208;O bonds cleavage, and (iii) high functional group tolerance. More information can be found in the Update by Lin et al. The cover artwork was composed by Cong Lin and Liang Shen. (Q. Guan, C. Lin, S. Chen, F. Gao, L. Shen, Adv. Synth.

      <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed site selective arene C&#8208;H bond activation concomitant functionalization with various coupling partners gain magnificent attraction in synthetic organic chemistry as complementary to traditional transformations. Mechanistically, these C&#8208;H functionalization approaches involve directing group assisted concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation (CMD), migratory insertion, and reductive elimination sequences. In this realm, diverse categories of coupling partners were employed as C&#8208;H functionalization buddies. Particularly alkynes gain enormous  attention as annulating agents. These units coordinates with metalcycle through &#7467;&#8208;interaction produce annulation outcomes in a straightforward manner.
Very recently, propargylic alcohols were appointed as valuable archetypes in arene C&#8208;H activation armoury, as they have shown regio&#8208; and chemoselective migratory insertion into primary metalcycle species via hydroxy chelation. The influential regioselectivity was drawn by dual coordination of metal complexes with the pendent directing group and a propargylic hydroxyl group. In this review, we focused on annulations and functionalization of arenes and propargylic alcohols, which afford intricate cycles as well as complex acyclic motifs in a trouble&#8208;free manner. We categorized these transformations based on number of atoms  of propargylic alcohols involved in annulation along with some addition reactions. We anticipate to pave a way towards enhanced endeavours for discovering novel reaction avenues.</dc:description>
