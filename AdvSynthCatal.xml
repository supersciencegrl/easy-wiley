         <title>Organocatalytic Synthesis of Substituted Vinylene Carbonates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The organocatalytic synthesis of substituted vinylene carbonates from benzoins and acyloins was studied using diphenyl carbonate as a carbonyl source. A range of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) precursors were screened and it was found that imidazolium salts were the most active for this transformation. The reaction occurs at 90&#8201;&#176;C under solvent&#8208;free conditions. A wide range of substituted vinylene carbonates (symmetrical and unsymmetrical, aromatic or aliphatic), including some derived from natural products, were prepared with 20&#8211;99% isolated yields (24 examples). The reaction was also developed using thermomorphic polyethylene&#8208;supported organocatalysts as recoverable and recyclable species. The use of such species facilitates the workup and allows the synthesis of vinylene carbonates on the preparative scale (&gt;30&#8197;g after 5 runs).

         <title>Oxoammonium Salt&#8208;Mediated Vicinal Oxyazidation of Alkenes with NaN3: Access to &#946;&#8208;Aminooxy Azides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An approach to the vicinal oxyazidation of alkenes has been achieved under mild and transition metal&#8208;free conditions. This method utilizes NaN3 as the azidation agent and 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxoammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEMPO+BF4&#8722;) as the single&#8208;electron oxidant as well as the oxygen source. By using this protocol, various &#946;&#8208;aminooxy azides were synthesized and several complex bioactive molecules were functionalized.

         <title>Application of Mutualism in Organic Synthetic Chemistry: Mutually Promoted C&#8208;H Functionalization of Indole and Reduction of Quinoline</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we reported a one&#8208;pot, metal&#8208;free B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;catalyzed strategy for simultaneous synthesis of C3&#8208;regioselective functionalization of indoles and complete reduction of quinolines. It turned out that by sharing a quinolinium hydridoborate intermediate, the original determining steps with high energy barrier in both the convergent disproportionation of indole and reduction of quinoline could be realized at room temperature, thus furnishing both the C3&#8208;borylated (or silylated) indoles and N&#8208;borylated tetrahydroquinolines in up to 98% yields at room temperature. Mechanistic studies suggested that both reactions would consume a product generated from the other reaction such that they can mutually promote each other, thus producing desirable products in a high atom&#8208;economy and low energy&#8208;cost manner. This strategy opened the gate to introducing mutualism to the field of chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Cascade Reactions of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;Unsaturated Hydrazones/Oximes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Radical cascade cyclization of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazones/oximes has recently emerged as an efficient and powerful protocol for the construction of diverse and valuable functionalized pyrazolines and isoxazolines. In this review, three catalytic ways of radical cascade cyclization of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazones/oximes are summarized and classified; these are transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed systems, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free systems, and photo&#8208;/electrocatalytic systems, respectively. Through these methods, various functional groups are installed on the pyrazoline and isoxazoline skeletons to enrich the small organic molecule library.

         <title>Umpolung Strategy for Arene C&#8722;H Etherification Leading to Functionalized Chromanes Enabled by I(III) N&#8208;Ligated Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>

Abstract
The direct formation of aryl C&#8722;O bonds via the intramolecular dehydrogenative coupling of a C&#8722;H bond and a pendant alcohol represents a powerful synthetic transformation. Herein, we report a method for intramolecular arene C&#8722;H etherification via an umpoled alcohol cyclization mediated by an I(III) N&#8208;HVI reagent. This approach provides access to functionalized chromane scaffolds from primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols via a cascade cyclization&#8208;iodonium salt formation, the latter providing a versatile functional handle for downstream derivatization. Computational studies support initial formation of an umpoled O&#8208;intermediate via I(III) ligand exchange, followed by competitive direct and spirocyclization/1,2&#8208;shift pathways.

         <title>Divergent Access to Benzocycles through Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylative Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed chemodivergent approach to five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered benzocycles from dienyl arenes tethered with a ketone has been developed. Through proper choice of coordinating ligands and catalytic conditions, copper&#8208;catalyzed borylative cyclization of a single dienyl arene can be diverted to two different pathways, leading to indanols and dihydronaphthalenols with high stereoselectivity. The chiral bidentate bisphosphine ligand (S,S)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE was optimal for asymmetric copper&#8208;allyl addition to a tethered ketone via a boat&#8208;like transition state, whereas NHC ligands led to boro&#8208;allyl addition producing indanols with high diastereoselectivity.

Through proper choice of coordinating ligands and catalytic conditions, copper-catalyzed borylative cyclization of a single dienyl arene can be diverted to two different pathways, leading to indanols and dihydronaphthalenols with high stereoselectivity. The chiral bidentate bisphosphine ligand (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-Ph-BPE was optimal for asymmetric copper-allyl addition to a tethered ketone &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; a boat-like transition state, whereas NHC ligands led to boro-allyl addition producing indanols with high diastereoselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Tunable C&#8722;H activation cascade reactions between quinazolinones and cyclopropenones have been developed. Notably, cyclopropenones, acting as multi&#8208;functional building blocks, could be assembled to construct up to 10&#8197;distinct heterocyclic scaffolds in a one&#8208;pot manner.

         <title>Domino Ring&#8208;Opening of N&#8208;Tosyl Vinylaziridines Triggered by Aryne Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>

Abstract
The reactivity of N&#8208;tosyl vinylaziridines toward arynes has been demonstrated under mild and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions to yield 2&#8208;(phenanthren&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;sulfamides in moderate to good yields. The selective synthesis of N&#8208;H and N&#8208;aryl products was accomplished using CsF in MeCN and KF/18&#8208;C&#8208;6 in 1,4&#8208;dioxane, respectively. This cascade process involves a sequential Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, ring&#8208;opening aromatization, ene&#8208;reaction, and selective N&#8208;arylation reaction.

         <title>Indium Catalyzed Sequential Regioselective Remote C&#8722;H Indolylation and Rearrangement Reaction of Peroxyoxindole</title>

Abstract
Indium&#8208;catalyzed sequential remote C&#8722;H functionalization (C&#8208;6 position) and C3&#8208;indolylation of peroxyoxindole using indole is described for the synthesis of terindolinone derivatives. Whereas, N&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;phenyl peroxyoxindole derivatives undergoes consecutive skeletal rearrangement to generate transient carbocation, which has been trapped with indole nucleophile to generate 2&#8208;(1H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazin&#8208;3(4H)&#8208;one derivatives. In contrast with Indium (III) Chloride, FeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O facilitates oxidative cleavage of the peroxyoxindole (Hock cleavage) and further reaction with indole to afford biologically important trisindoline derivatives. A plausible mechanism has been proposed for these reactions with experimental evidences.

Abstract
A synthesis of spiroindolinone&#8208;isoindolinone skeletons is presented. The protocol is through a Ugi four&#8208;component reaction followed by highly efficient and mild copper&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular tandem C&#8722;N/C&#8722;C coupling process. Control experiments demonstrated that the formation of C&#8722;C bond is a copper catalyzed coupling process rather than base promoted nucleophilic aromatic substitution pathway which proposed in Prof. Van der Eycken's palladium catalyst system previously.

Abstract
2&#8208;Imino&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;selenadiazole derivatives can be synthesized from hydrazides and isoselenocyanates by sequential oxidation and a tributylphosphine (PBu3)&#8208;promoted annulation reaction at room temperature. In this synthetic process, crude less stable N&#8208;aroyldiazene intermediates generated by I2&#8208;mediated oxidation of hydrazides were used directly in a subsequent annulation reaction to afford the selenadiazole products. The merits of the present synthetic strategy also include absence of transition metals and gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Enzyme Cascade Catalyzed Asymmetrization of Primary Alcohols: Synthesis of Enantiocomplementary Chiral &#946;&#8208;Nitroalcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalytic asymmetrization of inexpensive and stable primary alcohols to prepare enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols is an important development in green chemistry for the production of chiral pharmaceutical intermediates. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step cascade reaction sequence in which first benzylic alcohols were oxidized to produce corresponding benzaldehydes using horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH). The in situ generated aldehydes were then reacted in a biphasic medium with nitromethane by Arabidopsis thaliana hydroxynitrile lyase (AtHNL) or Baliospermum montanum HNL (BmHNL)  catalyzed Henry reaction to  produce   stereoselective &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols with (R) or (S) configuration, respectively.  Using HLADH&#8208;AtHNL, (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols were obtained in up to 64% conversion, and HLADH&#8208;BmHNL, (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols in up to 70% conversion, while in both cases excellent stereoselectivity (up to &gt;99% ee) was achieved. The concept was proven by functionalization of sp3 C&#8208;H bond of ten simple achiral benzylic alcohols to enantiocomplementary chiral &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Aryl enol acetates and DMF could promote radical difluoroalkylation of aryl enol acetates to generate &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;ketoacetates without a catalyst, an oxidant, or a base. When using different bases, &#946;&#8208;fluoroenones and &#946;&#8208;enaminones were synthesized by controllable C&#8208;F bond activation. These transformations provide an alternative method for the cascade difluoroalkylation and C&#8208;F bonds activation of aryl enol acetates.

         <title>One&#8208;pot synthesis of fused indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones via a [3+3] cycloaddition reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A formal [3+3] cycloaddition reaction of azaoxyallyl cations and isatogens generated in situ from &#945;&#8208;halohydroxamates and o&#8208;nitroalkynes, respectively, was developed. The cycloisomerization of the o&#8208;nitroalkynes, followed by the base&#8208;mediated elimination of hydrogen halide and the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of the azaoxyallyl cations with the isatogen intermediates, were hallmarks of this &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; tandem reaction. A series of tricyclic fused indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones were obtained under very mild reaction conditions with high atom economy, and the reaction exhibited excellent functional group tolerance.  In addition, the reaction was highly scalable to multigram quantities. The obtained indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones exhibited robust DNA staining patterns in agarose gel electrophoresis. Coupled with suitable fluorescence properties of the products, these results highlighted the potential utility of the tricyclic fused indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones in various fluorescence and cell&#8208;staining applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed pseudo&#8208;Anomeric C&#8208;H Alkynylation of Glycals as an Approach towards C&#8208;Glycoconjugate Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of complex C&#8208;glycoconjugates is presented here using a key directed nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H alkynylation step. Thanks to a bidentate amidoquinoline&#8208;type directing group, the insertion of diverse alkynyl moieties onto the pseudo&#8208;anomeric position of glycal substrates was performed on 10 examples in moderate to good yields. These platforms were used as starting substrates in a click reaction with complex azides to form original C&#8208;glycoconjugates. By this route, a C&#8208;glycosylated amino acid, a C&#8208;linked disaccharide and a C&#8208;glycosylated biotin derivative were synthesized. Preliminary conditions to remove the directing group are also proposed.</dc:description>

Abstract
The construction of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides has gradually become a hotspot of carbohydrate chemistry in recent years. In this work, we present an efficient, regioselective, stereoselective and widely applicable strategy for the synthesis of 2&#8208;indolyl&#8208;C&#8208;deoxyglycosides via Ir(I)&#8208;catalyzed, pyridine&#8208;group&#8208;directed C&#8722;H functionalization. This method exhibits high tolerance for the functional groups of indoles and the protecting groups of carbohydrates. Moreover, this protocol has good stereoselectivity and mainly produces &#946;&#8208;configuration products. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and several practical transformations were conducted for further applications. Meantime, we also explored the mechanism of this method and proposed a catalytic cycle

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidative azo&#8208;ene cyclization has been developed. The developed CuI/DMAP/O2 system efficiently facilitates the aerobic oxidation of ene&#8208;containing hydrazides to azo compounds, which undergo azo&#8208;ene cyclizations for the synthesis of oxazolidinones. In addition, the present approach enables the synthesis of lactams, as well as a nitroso&#8208;ene cyclization. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that two carbonyl groups were essential for the successful azo&#8208;ene cyclization and that a concerted mechanism might be plausible for this azo&#8208;ene cyclization.

Abstract
Indole&#8208;based heterocycles containing sulfur or nitrogen atoms are important frameworks that occur widely in biological active natural products and drugs. Consequently, several novel chemical transformations and new catalytic strategies have been developed for the preparation of these skeletons in a highly efficient and selective manner. This review focuses on recent advancements in the construction of indole&#8208;fused heterocyclic compounds by using iminoindolines, 3&#8208;diazoindol&#8208;2&#8208;imines, 2&#8208;thioxoindolines, and their derivatives as starting materials.

Abstract
As an important branch of the Michael addition reaction, the aza&#8208;Michael addition cascade reaction has been developed rapidly in recent years. This is because the reaction serves as an important method for effectively constructing functionalized C&#8722;N bonds, which can be widely used in the synthesis of chiral drugs and their intermediates and natural products. Given the importance of this topic, this review highlights the recent developments of aza&#8208;Michael addition triggered cascade reactions in asymmetric synthesis, including aza&#8208;Michael/Michael, aza&#8208;Michael/Aldol, aza&#8208;Michael/Henry, aza&#8208;Michael/hemiacetal, aza&#8208;Michael/Mannich, aza&#8208;Michael/alkylation, aza&#8208;Michael/cyclization, aza&#8208;Michael/ring&#8208;opening, aza&#8208;Michael&#8208;IED/HAD, aza&#8208;Michael/INCR, and aza&#8208;Michael/1,6&#8208;conjugate addition reactions. In this paper, the reaction mechanism and derivatization experiments of different reactions are timely introduced to provide a more comprehensive theoretical basis for subsequent studies.

Abstract
We describe herein that the cross&#8208;coupling of bromodifluoroacetamides with (iodoethynyl)arenes proceeds without recourse to any photocatalyst when exposed to visible light at room temperature to afford alkynyldifluoroacetamides in 62&#8211;83% yields (27 examples). Several control experiments suggest that the reaction involves the homolysis of bromodifluoroacetamides and the coupling of the resultant difluoromethyl radical species with the 1&#8208;iodoalkynes via a radical chain process. Divergent transformations of the coupling products led to various organofluorine compounds, demonstrating the synthetic utility of the developed photo&#8208;coupling method.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of Alkynyl Norbornene Derivatives for the Synthesis of Benzofused Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Modular approaches, which allow a systematic variation of heteroaromatic cores and substituents, are crucial for the development of heteroaromatic drug candidates and organic functional materials. A new strategy involving the cyclization of heteroarenes tethered with alkynes through a norbornene bridge was developed. The precursors were readily prepared by a three&#8208;component coupling process of heteroaryl halides, norbornadiene, and terminal alkynes. The Pd catalytic system derived from Pd(OAc)2 and 2&#8208;(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine transformed a variety of five&#8208;membered heteroarenes to the corresponding benzofused products, including (di)benzothiophene, indazole, carbazole, indole, and benzofuran, with aryl and alkyl substituents at the C4(C7) position. During the cyclization process, the norbornene ring underwent a retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, serving as an acetylene synthon. This approach was used to synthesize naphthalene derivatives from electron&#8208;rich arenes, demonstrating its versatility in the annulation of (hetero)aromatic rings.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A radical alkylarylation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;methacryloyl indoles via autoxidation of alkylboronic acids was developed under metal&#8208;free conditions for the construction of indolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolinone derivatives. Primary and secondary alkyl boronic acids were utilized as suitable alkyl sources with O2 as the clean and green oxidant in a simple operate mode. Moreover, this protocol can also be applied to the construction of benzimidazo&#8208;[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolinone derivatives.

         <title>Carbene Catalyzed Access to 3,6&#8208;Disubstituted &#945;&#8208;Pyrones via Michael Addition/Lactonization/Elimination Cascade</title>

Abstract
The first direct transition metal&#8208;free access to 3,6&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;pyrones from &#945;&#8208;chloro aldehydes and &#946;&#8208;tosyl enones is reported. The reactions proceed via the Michael addition/lactonization/elimination cascade. The regioselective addition of NHC&#8208;bound enolates/homoenolates to the enones bearing a bulkier functionality such as tosyl group at the &#946;&#8208;position has remained challenging. The 3,6&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;pyrones could be converted to valuable products such as 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenes, 1,4&#8208;disubstituted naphthalenes as well as anthracenes and 6,13&#8208;disubstituted dihydro&#8208;ethenopentacenes in a simple operation.

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot strategy for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;bromo enaminones is reported. The reactions proceed via the p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (TsOH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O) catalyzed reactions of 3&#8208;bromopropenals with anilines in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and does not require an external brominating agent. The chemoselective 1,2&#8208;addition was accomplished by employing aniline with a sterically hindered electron&#8208;withdrawing group attached at the ortho&#8208;position. In addition, the reactions involving other aniline derivatives as nucleophiles have resulted in minor yields of 1,4&#8208;addition product. The 3&#8208;bromopropenals showed a diverse range of reactivities with aniline derivatives.

         <title>Time&#8208;Dependent Diastereodivergent Michael Addition Enabled by Phosphazenes Acting as Catalysts and Reactants</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A switching of the step order within cascade process enabled design of a diastereodivergent approach to phosphazenopyrrolines with a 1,3&#8208;relationship of stereocenters. The approach is based on a cascade transformation of readily accessible &#947;&#8208;azidobutyronitriles that includes Staudinger, aza&#8208;Wittig and Michael steps. Stereodivergence is achieved at the Michael step that is self&#8208;catalyzed by phosphazene intermediates and provides construction of quaternary stereocenter. Depending on the type of phosphazene intermediates, generating either via Staudinger reaction or via subsequent intramolecular aza&#8208;Wittig reaction with nitrile and then reacting with a Michael acceptor, either trans&#8208; or cis&#8208;isomers of the target product can be produced. Thus, diastereoselectivity can be achieved by varying the time of addition for the Michael acceptor. Therefore, three distinct roles were revealed for phosphazenes in this process: catalysts, reactants and stereoselectivity controllers. This stereodivergent strategy was applied for the synthesis of all stereoisomers of the biorelevant tetrahydro&#8208;7&#8208;aza&#8208;indoles.

         <title>Mechanochemistry Enabled Construction of Isoxazole Skeleton via CuO Nanoparticles Catalyzed Intermolecular Dehydrohalogenative Annulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A dehydrohalogenative approach for isoxazole annulation by partnering &#946;&#8208;vinyl halides and &#945;&#8208;nitrocarbonyls under mechanochemical setting was accomplished. This chemistry is operative under the cooperative catalysis of cupric oxide nanoparticles (&lt;50&#8197;nm) and DABCO. The key beneficial aspects of this protocol include: (i) broad substrate scope, (ii) no vigorous work&#8208;up, (iii) short reaction time, (iv) solvent&#8208;free condition, (v) commercial viability of substrates/reagents (vi) good chemical yields and selectivity. The other merit of this chemistry is the ease with which CuO can be recuperated and reused after the reaction with not much drop in catalytic activity for six runs. With no confinement to &#946;&#8208;vinyl halides, the validated condition is also open to alkynes for isoxazole preparation, thereby establishing the broader utility of the current methodology.

Abstract
The development of a stereoselective aza&#8208;Piancatelli reaction to access 4&#8208;aminocyclopentenones is reported. This transformation relies on the use of chiral o&#8208;sulfinyl anilines as chiral inductors to afford the targeted products in good to excellent yields. Remarkably, the high value&#8208;added cyclopentenones could be obtained in drs up to &gt;95:5, depending upon the furan substitution pattern.

Abstract
Series of chiral palladium(II) allyl and cinnamyl complexes bearing a C1&#8208;symmetric N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes were synthesized from achiral precursors. The chirality of theses complexes results from the formation of the carbene&#8208;palladium bond which restricts the rotation of dissymmetric N&#8208;aryl substituents of the NHC and thus creates an axis of chirality. Chiral HPLC at preparative scale enabled the resolution of racemic complexes and provided a straightforward access to complexes with excellent enantiopurities (&gt;99.5% ee). Enantiopure complexes were studied by crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and electronic circular dichroism (ECD). Their configuration stabilities were investigated both experimentally and theoretically through the determination of the rotational barrier values. These complexes were tested for the intramolecular &#945;&#8208;arylation of amides, with a moderate chiral induction (up to 54% ee).

We disclose an concise synthesis of alkynylcyclopropane derivatives containing adjacent quaternary carbon centers via a transition&#8208;metal free cascade enyne rearrangement and cyclopropanation process. This methodology, started from a variety of allenylphosphine oxides and N&#8208;tosylhydrazones, features the advantage of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, operational simplicity, wide substrate scope and good functional group tolerance.

         <title>Asymmetric Epoxidation of Enones Promoted by Dinuclear Magnesium Catalyst</title>

Abstract
Asymmetric synthesis with cheaper and non&#8208;toxic alkaline earth metal catalysts is becoming an important and sustainable alternative to conventional catalytic methodologies mostly relying on precious metals. In spite of some sustainable methods for enantioselective epoxidation of enones, the development of a well&#8208;defined and efficient catalyst based on magnesium complexes for these reactions is still a challenging task. In this perspective, we present the application of chiral dinuclear magnesium complexes for asymmetric epoxidation of a broad range of electron&#8208;deficient enones. We demonstrate that the in&#8197;situ generated magnesium&#8208;ProPhenol complex affords enantioenriched oxiranes in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). Our extensive study verifies the literature data in this area and provides a step forward to better understand the factors controlling the oxygenation process. Elaborated catalyst offers mild reaction conditions and a truly wide substrate scope.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced radical cascade cyclization of ortho&#8208;diisocyanoarenes for the synthesis of diethyl benzo[a]phenazine&#8208;6,6(5H)&#8208;dicarboxylates has been developed. This process provides an efficient and convenient protocol for the construction of benzo[a]phenazine skeleton that widely present in biologically active molecules and pharmaceuticals. The reaction takes place under mild conditions and the products are obtained in moderate to excellent yields.

Abstract
A broadly applicable methodology for the regio&#8208; and enantioselective construction of branched allylic carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds from racemic, secondary allylic trichloroacetimidates has been developed. The branched allylic substrates undergo dynamic kinetic asymmetric substitution reactions with a number of unactivated anilines and carboxylic acids as well as unactivated aromatic thiols in the presence of a chiral bicyclo[3.3.0]octadiene&#8208;ligated iridium catalyst. The allylic C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;S bond containing products are obtained in synthetically useful yield and selectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest that the iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective substitution reactions of heteroatom nucleophiles with allylic trichloroacetimidate substrates through an outer&#8208;sphere nucleophilic addition mechanism. In addition, the chiral diene&#8208;ligated iridium catalyst is effective at promoting asymmetric aminations of acyclic secondary anilines. Importantly, this catalytic iridium methodology enables the use of alkyl substituted allylic electrophiles.

Abstract
Selenols react with isocyanates under mild catalyst&#8208;free conditions to generate selenocarbamates in good yield and with high selectivity over potentially competing nucleophilic additions. The methodology enables the incorporation of a wide variety of functional groups providing access to a broad array of densely functionalised selenocarbamates. In the presence of competing heteroatom&#8208;centered nucleophiles, isocyanates selectively couple with selenols. Selenocarbamates exhibited thiol&#8208;peroxidase&#8208;like properties, enabling the reduction of hydrogen peroxide at the expense of thiols, which are converted into the corresponding disulfides. A series of control experiments suggested that the catalytic mechanism proceeds through a pathway, involving a H2O2&#8208;promoted transcarbamoylation reaction leading to a thiocarbamate with concomitant releasing of catalytically active selenolate anions. By undergoing peroxide&#8208;driven thiol&#8208;selenol exchange, selenocarbamates behave as equivalents of selenolate anions with thiol&#8208;peroxidase&#8208;like activity.

The front cover picture, designed by L. Duarte de Almeida et al. illustrates the successful application of a well&#8208;defined manganese PNP pincer complex in the formal hydroamination of allylic alcohols with primary and secondary amines as well as with N&#8208;heterocycles. The corresponding &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols were obtained in up to 94% yield in a tandem reaction combining dehydrogenation/Michael addition/hydrogenation sequence. The properties of these non&#8208;innocent pincer ligands allowed application of this non&#8208;noble metal catalyst in organic synthesis with a broad substrate scope. Details can be found in the communication by M. Beller, K. Junge and co&#8208;workers (L. Duarte de Almeida, F. Bourriquen, K. Junge, M. Beller, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2021, 363, 4177&#8211;4181; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202100081).

Abstract
Crystallization&#8208;induced diastereomer transformations (CIDT) enable isolation of the target compounds in high enantio&#8208; and diastereomeric purities and with up to quantitative yields simply by filtration. Numerous inspiring examples of this appealing synthetic strategy reported over the last fifteen years are reviewed. Important observations along with aspects to consider when designing CIDT experiments are discussed.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Direct Functionalization of Isoindolinones for the Synthesis of 3,3&#8208;Disubstituted Isoindolinones</title>

Abstract
The construction of tetrasubstituted carbon centers (especially chiral ones) represents one of the most challenging and demanding topics in the synthesis of natural products and related drugs. The development of isoindolinones with this feature appears to be of great importance, because 3,3&#8208;disubstituted isoindolinones, which feature all kinds of tetrasubstituted carbon centers, also including spirocyclic and all&#8208;carbon or heteroatom&#8208;containing centers, show a wide spectrum of biological and pharmaceutical activities. Therefore, the synthetic methodologies for preparing these skeletons have received significant attention during the past decade. In general, these strategies can be classified into two major categories, namely the direct functionalization of parent isoindolinones and lactam&#8208;ring&#8208;formation&#8208;involved reactions, depending on whether there is a lactam&#8208;ring&#8208;formation process or not during the production of the final 3,3&#8208;disubstituted isoindolinone. Since the second strategy has been well reviewed, this review mainly summarizes the recent progress in the direct functionalization of parent isoindolinones to construct 3,3&#8208;disubstituted isoindolinones via three subdivided strategies.

         <title>Water Can Accelerate Homogeneous Gold Catalysis</title>

Abstract
A selection of gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions was examined in a kinetic study on the influence of water on the rate constant. Two intramolecular reactions and one intermolecular reaction, which proceed via proton transfer and/or protodeauration steps, were investigated. The kinetic data was collected by GC or 1H NMR spectroscopy. The obtained rate constants provided information about the influence of water in these test reactions. On the basis of the data collected, beyond the commonly assumed tolerance against water, a reaction&#8208;promoting influence of water on gold catalysis was identified and kinetically quantified. The results underline that the often&#8208;mentioned water&#8208;tolerance of gold catalysis not only simplifies these reactions operationally, but in addition even provides better results than a troublesome exclusion of water.

Abstract
A Mn(OAc)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O&#8208;catalyzed aerobic dehydrogenation of five and six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles for the synthesis of N&#8208;heteroarenes is reported. Of note, this protocol can be applied to the dehydrogenation of tertiary indolines with various electron&#8208;deficient N&#8208;substituents. Preliminary mechanistic investigations support that a single&#8208;electron transfer pathway might be involved.

Abstract
In this report, two distinctive intramolecular cyclizations of o&#8208;propargyloxy diketopiperazines (achieved from a one&#8208;pot Ugi post&#8208;transformation) is achieved via a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular reaction of azomethine ylide and alkyne moiety. The presence of internal alkyne in the starting materials directed the reaction towards through [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition, while terminal alkyne led to a spirocyclization reaction between azomethine ylide and terminal unsaturated C&#8722;C bond. This method offering an opportunity for the synthesis of challenging Diazabicyclics and Spiro&#8208;Diketopiperazinochromanes in high yields with exclusive diastereoselectivity.

Abstract
The first organocatalytic asymmetric [4+3]&#8208;cycloaddition of 2&#8208;aminophenyl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls with in&#8197;situ generated azaoxyallyl cations was developed, and enantioenriched functionalized seven&#8208;membered 1,4&#8208;benzodiazepine&#8208;3&#8208;ones were obtained in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. This approach was also extended to the first asymmetric [4+3]&#8208;cycloaddition of &#948;&#8208;hydroxy &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls, affording 1,4&#8208;oxazepanes in one step under mild conditions. Several of the novel adducts demonstrated promising bioactivity in the prevention of peripheral nerve degeneration.

Abstract
A ligand library containing 31 chiral diamines was synthesized using a flow&#8208;based semiautomatic reductive amination system. These ligands were evaluated in a continuous&#8208;flow asymmetric 1,4&#8208;addition reaction with a heterogeneous Ni catalyst. Based on the experimental results of ab initio DFT calculations, a prediction model for enantioselectivities was successfully constructed. Furthermore, virtual screening of possible ligands was conducted to identify promising structures, which showed good enantioselectivities in experiments.

         <title>Enantioselective Construction of 5&#8208;6&#8208;5 Tricyclic Lactone Framework Bearing a Quaternary Bridgehead Carbon via Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric [2+2+2] Cycloaddition of Enediynes</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [2+2+2] cycloaddition of ene&#8208;yne&#8208;yne enediynes to generate enantio&#8208;enriched tricyclic cyclohexadienes bearing a quaternary bridgehead carbon. We found that the Rh&#8208;Phanephos complex is an appropriate catalyst for the cycloaddition of enediynes bearing an unsubstituted propiolate terminus, whereas Rh&#8208;biaryl bisphosphine catalysts, which have been widely used for asymmetric cycloadditions of alkynes and alkenes, are not applicable for the reaction of such enediynes. Several control experiments suggest that the reaction using the Rh&#8208;Phanephos complex exclusively proceeds via a rhodacyclopentadiene intermediate, unlike when using a Rh&#8208;biaryl bisphosphine complex that can form a rhodacyclopentadiene intermediate as well as a rhodacyclopentene intermediate in a substrate&#8208;dependent manner.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component thioamination reaction has been developed in the presence of phenyliodonium(III) diacetate (PIDA) leading to the formation of a thioaminated products. This catalytic approach represents a method for the metal&#8208;free thioamination of 1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone. It was observed that maleimides also work smoothly under this metal&#8208;free reaction condition. This present method implies the oxidative coupling reaction 	through a one&#8208;step process with the generation of C&#8208;N and C&#8208;S bonds. Various aromatic and aliphatic thiols and amines provided the corresponding thioaminated compounds in 62&#8208;88% yields. A plausible reaction pathway has been predicted according to few control experiments.</dc:description>

Abstract
A series of pyridinium and bipyridinium salts were prepared and their catalytic properties were evaluated in the aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between imines and Danishefsky diene. Depending on the substituents of the pyridinium/bipyridinium rings and on the nature of the counterion, two mechanisms of activation were demonstrated. In case of non&#8208;substituted rings, the substrate is activated through charge transfer involving the aryl ring on the C&#8208;side of the imine. When halogen atoms were introduced on the catalysts, the activation mode switched to halogen bond involving the imine nitrogen lone pair. Moreover, alternative activation modes based on hydrogen bonding and radical cation were ruled out. This work allowed us to develop two families of catalysts whose potential was demonstrated in the cycloaddition of various imines with Danishefsky diene. The first family is composed of the simple methyl pyridinium triflate and dioctyl bipyridinium triflate. The former is active only with imines bearing a p&#8208;methoxyphenyl group on the C&#8208;side and the latter was found to be efficient with imines bearing different substituents on both the N&#8208; and C&#8208;sides of the imines. The second family is based on halogenated pyridinium salts which proved active with almost all considered imines.

         <title>Non&#8208;Chelate&#8208;Assisted Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidative Heck Reaction of Fluorobenzenes and Other Arenes: When Does the C&#8722;H Activation Need Help?</title>

Abstract
The pyridone fragment in the ligand [2, 2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridin]&#8208;6(1H)&#8208;one (bipy&#8208;6&#8208;OH) enables the oxidative Heck reaction of simple arenes with oxygen as the sole oxidant and no redox mediator. Arenes with either electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing groups can be functionalized in this way. Experimental data on the reaction with toluene as the model arene shows that the C&#8722;H activation step is turnover limiting and that the ligand structure is crucial to facilitate the reaction, which supports the involvement of the pyridone fragment in the C&#8722;H activation step. In the case of fluoroarenes, the alkenylation of mono and 1,2&#8208;difluoro benzenes requires the presence of bipy&#8208;6&#8208;OH. In contrast, this ligand is detrimental for the alkenylation of 1,3&#8208;difluoro, tri, tetra and pentafluoro benzenes which can be carried out using just [Pd(OAc)2]. This correlates with the acidity of the fluoroarenes, the most acidic undergoing easier C&#8722;H activation so other steps of the reaction such as the coordination&#8208;insertion of the olefin become kinetically important for polyfluorinated arenes. The use of just a catalytic amount of sodium molybdate as a base proved to be optimal in all these reactions.

&lt;p&gt;The pyridone fragment in the ligand [2, 2&#8217;-bipyridin]-6(1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-one (bipy-6-OH) enables the oxidative Heck reaction of simple arenes with oxygen as the sole oxidant and no redox mediator.

         <title>Enantioselective 1,6&#8208;Conjugate Addition of Dialkyl &#945;&#8208;Diazo Methylphosphonate to para&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>

Abstract
An asymmetric 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition reaction of dialkyl diazomethylphosphonates to para&#8208;quinone methides promoted by phase&#8208;transfer catalysis has been developed. A series of chiral diarylmethylated diazomethylphosphonates were accessed with up to 85% yields and 99% ee enantioselectivities. The resulting products were further transformed into bioactive compounds, namely, a chiral dihydrocinnoline phosphonate and a chiral &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonate, bearing diarylmethine stereogenic centers.

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Cyclobutenes and Spirocycles via Asymmetric P(III)/P(V) Redox Catalysis</title>

Abstract
An enantioselective phosphine&#8208;catalyzed transformation has been developed for the synthesis of chiral cyclobutene triesters and fluorinated spirocyclic compounds. The strategy involved a P(III)/P(V) redox cycling process, via in&#8197;situ reduction of phosphine oxide with phenylsilane. This catalytic methodology has enabled the enantioselective synthesis of functionalized cyclobutenes (24 examples, up to 94% ee). On the occasion of the extension of this study to &#945;&#8208;ketoester indenone substrates, a surprising reactivity has been discovered for the synthesis of spiro&#8208;indenone products.

Abstract
A diastereoselective and enantioselective construction of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds is reported. Nishiyama's RuPhebox complex (2.0&#8197;mol% catalyst loading) serves as a chiral Lewis acid catalyst in conjunction with BrCCl3 and a base for the oxidative homocoupling of 2&#8208;acyl imidazoles via the stereocontrolled reaction of intermediate Ru enolates with in&#8197;situ brominated 2&#8208;acyl imidazoles. Cleavage of the achiral imidazole auxiliary provides optically active 2,3&#8208;disubstituted succinic acids which are useful intermediates in the synthesis of chiral compounds like the natural product class of lignans.

Abstract
A protocol for the synthesis of terminal N&#8208;vinylazoles from aromatic aldehydes, DMSO, and azoles has been reported. In this strategy, DMSO was involved in the construction of the C=C bond as a terminal carbon synthon. Both aromatic aldehydes and azoles could be well tolerated and give the corresponding terminal N&#8208;vinylazoles in 52&#8211;91% yields. Based on preliminary experiments, a plausible mechanism is proposed.

         <title>A Unified Approach for Divergent Synthesis of Heterocycles via TMSOTf&#8208;Catalyzed Formal [3+2] Cycloaddition of Electron&#8208;Rich Alkynes</title>

Abstract
We present a synthetic protocol for the construction of polysubstituted five&#8208;membered heterocycles via TMSOTf&#8208;catalyzed formal [3+2] cycloaddition of electron&#8208;rich alkynes, which features free from any metal, atom economy and water as the main by&#8208;product. Furthermore, alkenyl ether adduct has been verified as the key intermediate. Notably, by utilizing this approach, we can synthesize a broad range of polysubstituted furans, thiophenes and pyrroles, and extend this transformation to deliver fused&#8208;polyheterocycles. This reaction can be achieved on a gram scale and the corresponding products are intermediates for producing diverse potentially useful scaffolds.

         <title>Optimizing the Iodide/Iodonium/O2 Oxidation Cycle Enhances the Scope, Selectivity, and Yields of Hydroiodic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Multicomponent Cyclocondensation Reactions</title>

Abstract
Catalytic iodine in the presence of water acts indirectly as a source of Br&#248;nsted acid and, concurrently, generates iodonium ion and hydrogen peroxide, which mediate the final oxidative aromatization step in the multicomponent cyclocondensation of an aromatic amine and two aliphatic aldehyde compounds. The oxidative cycle in this and related iodine&#8208;catalyzed reactions is seldom discussed, generally unoptimized, and rarely investigated in detail. This work establishes that two independent catalytic cycles (H+ and I&#8722;/I+) drive such multicomponent cyclocondensation/ oxidation reactions, provided that the oxidant is generated in sufficient concentration to inhibit oxidation of the dihydroquinoline by the intermediate iminium cation. The complementary dual catalytic cycles, when optimized, act in concert to suppress side product formation, which simplifies isolation and purification of the self&#8208;aggregating products, and increases the efficiency and scope of the Wang&#8208;Kozlov multicomponent reaction.

         <title>Recent Advances in Organophosphorus&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation and Silylation Reactions</title>

Abstract
Over the past few decades, organophosphorus catalysis has emerged as a robust platform for the preparation of highly functionalized molecules with excellent control of reactivity and selectivity. Organophosphorus catalysis has the advantages of mild and metal&#8208;free reaction conditions. The easy&#8208;to&#8208;tune electronic and steric properties of phosphorus provide an easy handle for developing efficient synthetic methodologies with high stereochemical fidelity. This review describes the efforts to introduce boron and silicon functionalities into organic substrates catalyzed by organophosphorus compounds. These catalysts are categorized into nucleophilic, electrophilic, and biphilic phosphorus catalysts. Phosphorus compounds efficiently catalyze hydroboration of various unsaturated systems, carbonyl compounds, imines, etc.; hydro&#8208;/cyano&#8208;silylation of carbonyls; and silylation of alcohols. The present review emphasizes the scope of nucleophilic, electrophilic, and biphilic phosphorus&#8208;based catalysis to introduce boron and silicon functionalities into organic compounds, mainly from the recent decade.

Abstract
An iridium/f&#8208;diaphos catalytic system for the enantioselective hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;ketoesters via dynamic kinetic resolution is reported. The desired anti &#946;&#8217;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino esters were obtained in moderate to good yields (60&#8211;95%) with 72&#8211;99% ees and 91:9 to 99:1 drs. This protocol tolerates various functional groups and could be easily conducted on gram scale with lower catalyst loading (TON up to 9100).

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Continuous&#8208;Flow Synthesis of Fungicide Metalaxyl through Catalytic C&#8722;N Bond&#8208;Formation Processes</title>

Abstract
Metalaxyl, an acylalanine fungicide, was synthesized through catalytic continuous sequential&#8208;flow reactions. Commonly used syntheses of this compound use batch systems and suffer from problems such as coproduction of halogen&#8208;containing by&#8208;products derived from acyl and alkyl halides in the substitution reactions of 2,6&#8208;dimethylaniline. To minimize waste and enhance efficiency, a halide&#8208;free approach including two continuous&#8208;flow catalytic processes, heterogeneous Pt&#8208;catalyzed reductive alkylation and homogeneous acid&#8208;catalyzed amidation with an acid anhydride, was developed. Systematic examination of the two reactions in flow mode enabled a high&#8208;yielding, two&#8208;step sequential continuous&#8208;flow process to be achieved.

         <dc:description>This study has developed a method to prepare diastereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective indoline&#8208;fused 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine scaffolds. The synthetic process involved an Ugi four&#8208;component reaction in which readily available starting materials were used and a metal&#8208;free intramolecular post&#8208;Ugi tandem consecutive 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig/6&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization under basic conditions. The plausible mechanism and substrate structures were elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and supported by density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein Engineering of d&#8208;Succinylase from Cupriavidus sp. for d&#8208;Amino Acid Synthesis and the Structural Implications</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
d&#8208;Amino acids are important chiral building blocks for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Previously, we have used d&#8208;Succinylase (DSA) from Cupriavidus sp. P4&#8208;10&#8208;C and N&#8208;succinyl amino acid racemase (NSAR, EC.4.2.1.113) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus NCA1503 to produce d&#8208;amino acids via the dynamic kinetic resolution of N&#8208;succinyl&#8208;dl&#8208;amino acids. However, the use of this bioconversion system remains challenging for industrial application due to the insufficient enantioselectivity of DSA toward N&#8208;succinyl&#8208;d&#8208;amino acids. Therefore, we screened DSA mutants for improved enantioselectivity by directed evolution. Several mutants showed improved enantioseletivity compared to wild&#8208;type DSA. L182E mutant had superior enantioselectivity, and the thermal stability was also remarkably improved by this single mutation. We solved the crystal structure of the L182E mutant in complex with succinic acids at a resolution 2.0&#8197;&#197;. The mutated residues in all generated mutants that showed improved enantioselectivity (including the substituted Glu182 in the L182E mutant) are found very close to the active site. The solved crystal structure also provides some rationale to explain the higher thermostability of the L182E mutant compared to wild&#8208;type DSA. d&#8208;phenylalanine and d&#8208;tryptophan were produced in high conversion (approximately 90%) with 98.8% ee and 99.6% ee, respectively, using coupled L182E DSA and NSAR with the one&#8208;pot enzymatic method. These data suggested that L182E DSA may be a useful biocatalyst for industrial d&#8208;amino acids production.

Abstract
A catalytic carbonylative approach to the multicomponent synthesis of benzothiophene derivatives from simple building blocks [1&#8208;(2&#8208;(methylthio)phenyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ols, carbon monoxide, and an alcohol)] is presented. It is based on an S&#8208;cyclization&#8208;demethylation&#8208;alkoxycarbonylation&#8208;reduction sequence promoted by the PdI2/KI catalytic system, occurring under relatively mild conditions (40&#8197;atm, 80&#8201;&#176;C, 15&#8197;h). Benzothiophene&#8208;2&#8208;acetic esters are obtained in moderate to good yields (35&#8211;70%) starting from variously substituted substrates in combination with different alcohols as external nucleophiles (17&#8197;examples).

Abstract
The iodine&#8208;promoted oxidative domino annulation and carbonylation process has been developed for the synthesis of biologically important azaarene&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;b:4&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;e]pyridines (BPPs), diuracilpyridines and o&#8208;amino diheteroaryl ketones. The domino procedure proceeded with easily available methyl azaarenes, 5&#8208;aminouracils and substituted 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles. This protocol is a simple and metal&#8208;free approach which exhibits high functional group compatibility and broad substrates scope. Moreover, this transformation can be applied for the preparation of dipyrazolo/diuracil&#8208;fused pyridines on a gram scale.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed/TsOH&#8208;promoted one&#8208;pot tandem annulation of 1,6&#8208;allenynes with organic azides was reported, providing N&#8208;allyl 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;fused structures in moderate to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. Moreover, the late&#8208;stage diversification of the N&#8208;allyl products can be realized by chemoselectively reducing to the N&#8208;alkyl counterparts.

         <title>Cp*Co(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrative C2&#8208;Prenylation of Pyrrole and Indole with Allyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Non&#8208;activated allyl alcohols are utilized as allylating agent for thiocarbamate&#8208;directed allylation of pyrrole and indole. The synthetic methodology is accompanied by advantages like silver&#8208;free conditions and generates water as the by&#8208;product. A wide range of substituted pyrroles and indoles along with several structurally different allyl alcohols took part in the reaction. Among notable examples, biologically relevant prenylation, geranylation, and synthesis of 1,3&#8208;dienes are achieved. Selective mono allylation of pyrrole, gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and ready deprotection of directing group are the other key highlights of this method.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed (Pd(PPh3)4/Ag2O/PivOH) C2&#8208;regioselective direct dehydrogenative alkynylation of unsubstituted selenophene was achieved. The selenophenes substituted with R1 groups at 2&#8208;position can be C5&#8208;alkynylated with a variety of 4&#8208;substituted phenylacetylenes (R2 groups). The R1 and R2 can be either electron&#8208;withdrawing or electron&#8208;donating groups, demonstrating a wide range of substrate scope with various functional group tolerance. The mono/C2&#8208;alkynylated selenophenes can subsequently undergo the second direct alkynylation at C5&#8208;position to afford symmetrical or unsymmetrical donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor 2,5&#8208;dialkynylated selenophenes.

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Access to &#946;&#8208;Substituted o&#8208;Hydroxyphenyl Ethyl Ketones from 4&#8208;Chromanone and its Application in Preparation of a Silica&#8208;Supported Cobalt(II) Salen Complex</title>

Abstract
The o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketone skeleton is prevalent in many biologically active natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Herein, a two&#8208;step protocol has been developed for synthesis of various &#946;&#8208;substituted o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketones. A base&#8208;mediated ring opening of 4&#8208;chromanone was used to introduce the &#946;&#8208;ethoxyl o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketone intermediary, followed by nucleophile substitution under BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O assisted conditions to give the desired &#946;&#8208;carbon, nitrogen, or thiol substituted o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketones. With the aid of this protocol, a silica&#8208;supported cobalt(II) salen complex was successfully prepared and its structure was confirmed by FTIR, 13C MAS NMR, UV&#8208;Vis absorption, and XPS spectra. The immobilized cobalt(II) salen catalyst not only displayed comparable catalytic activity in the synthesis of several heterocycles including 1,3&#8208;oxazolidine, benzimidazole, and benzoxazole as compared with their homogeneous counterparts, but also could be recycled for several times without obvious loss of its catalytic activity.

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketone skeleton is prevalent in many biologically active natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Herein, a two-step protocol has been developed for synthesis of various &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-substituted &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketones. A base-mediated ring opening of 4-chromanone was used to introduce the &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-ethoxyl &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketone intermediary, followed by nucleophile substitution under BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O assisted conditions to give the desired &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-carbon, nitrogen, or thiol substituted &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketones. With the aid of this protocol, a silica-supported cobalt(II) salen complex was successfully prepared and its structure was confirmed by FTIR, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C MAS NMR, UV-Vis absorption, and XPS spectra. The immobilized cobalt(II) salen catalyst not only displayed comparable catalytic activity in the synthesis of several heterocycles including 1,3-oxazolidine, benzimidazole, and benzoxazole as compared with their homogeneous counterparts, but also could be recycled for several times without obvious loss of its catalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Radical Promoted Synthesis of Furoquinolines via Anomalous Dakin&#8208;Type Reaction</title>

Abstract
A radical promoted approach for the selective synthesis of furo[3,2&#8208;b]quinolines and benzylidene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydrofuro[3,4&#8208;b]quinolines have been achieved from 2&#8208;alkynyl quinoline&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehydes by fine&#8208;tuning of base and oxidant in good yields. In the presence of an oxidant, the reaction afforded the 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclized furoquinolines by decarbonylative intramolecular cyclization via a Dakin&#8208;type reaction; however, in the absence of oxidant, 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclized products were obtained selectively through reductive intramolecular cyclization. The formation of furoquinolines was further supported by X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies. The proposed mechanism was well supported by the control experiments.

         <title>Stereo&#8208; and Regioselective [3+3] Annulation Reaction Catalyzed by Ytterbium: Synthesis of Bicyclic 1,4&#8208;Dihydropyridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An ytterbium catalyzed formal [3+3] cycloaddition of cyclic enamines and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones catalyzed is reported. The reaction proceeds with a &#8216;head to tail&#8217; regioselectivity through a conjugate addition of the enamine moiety followed by an amine&#8208;carbonyl condensation. In addition the use of chiral enamines provided a high degree of stereoselectivity, driven by a possible balance between steric and &#960;&#8208;stacking effects. The resulting bicyclic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines were evaluated as antiproliferative agents against A549 (carcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cell) and SKOV3 (human ovarian carcinoma) human tumor cell lines. Good toxicities were found for some of the compounds against A549 and SKOV3 cell lines, with best IC50 values of 0.89&#8197;&#956;M for A549 and 6.69&#8197;&#956;M for SKOV3, and a very good selectivity was observed towards MRC5 (non&#8208;malignant) cell lines.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalysed electrophilic N&#8208;imination of aryl(alkenyl) boronic acids with a stable hypervalent iodine(III) reagent containing a transferable (diarylmethylene)amino group is developed. The electrophilic C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling reaction proceeds smoothly at room temperature under oxidant&#8208;free and base&#8208;free conditions, which is further characterized by the broad functional group compatibility, thereof, extending the N&#8208;electrophile scope of electrophilic C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling outside the limitation of N&#8722;O and N&#8722;Cl reagents.

Abstract
A variety of chromeno[4,3&#8208;c]isoxazolidines were prepared in good yields through visible light promoted Chan&#8208;Lam reaction and [3+2] cycloaddition cascade reaction in one pot. Mechanistic studies showed that visible light promoted both Chan&#8208;Lam reaction and cycloaddition. The obtained products were converted to various useful chromenone derivatives. Moreover, the reaction was easily performed at gram scales with the purification of products without column chromatography and used to efficiently synthesize estrone&#8208;derived chromeno[4,3&#8208;c]isoxazolidine.

         <title>Activated Hoveyda&#8208;Grubbs Olefin Metathesis Catalysts Derived from a Large Scale Produced Pharmaceutical Intermediate &#8211; Sildenafil Aldehyde</title>

Abstract
Two EWG&#8208;activated Hoveyda&#8208;Grubbs&#8208;type ruthenium complexes (Sil&#8208;II and Sil&#8208;II&#8217;) were obtained, characterized, and screened in a set of olefin metathesis reactions. These catalysts were conveniently synthesized from a commercially available pharmaceutical building block &#8211; Sildenafil aldehyde &#8211; in two steps only. Stability and catalytic activity tests disclosed that the bulkier NHC&#8208;ligand bearing catalyst Sil&#8208;II&#8217; is visibly more stable and productive than its smaller NHC&#8208;analogue Sil&#8208;II. Good application profile of catalyst Sil&#8208;II&#8217; was confirmed in a set of diverse metathesis reactions including ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) and cross&#8208;metathesis (CM) of complex polyfunctional substrates of medicinal chemistry interest, including a challenging macrocyclization of the Pacritinib precursor. Compatibility of the new catalyst with various green solvents was checked and metathesis of Sildenafil and Tadalafil&#8208;based substrates was successfully conducted in acetone. The mechanism of Sil&#8208;II&#8217; initiation has been investigated through kinetic experiments unveiling that the decrease of the steric hindrance of the chelating alkoxy moiety (from iPrO to EtO) favors the interchange initiation pathway over the typical dissociation pathway for other popular 2nd generation Hoveyda&#8208;Grubbs catalysts.

Abstract
A catalytic enantioselective vinylogous domino reaction has been achieved from ketone&#8208;derived benzylidene Meldrum's acid and &#945;&#8208;ketolactones to provide spirolactone dihydropyranones with more than 99%&#8201;ee. An Auto Tandem Catalysis (ATC) process resulting from dual and complementary role of (DHQ)2PHAL organocatalyst resulted in a sequence involving an asymmetric vinylogous formal (4+2) cycloaddition of benzylidene and the subsequent kinetic resolution operating through a 1,3&#8208;prototropic shift leading to good yields (&gt;50%) and the high selectivity.

         <title>Enantioselective Vinylogous Mannich Reaction of Acyclic Vinylketene Silyl Acetals with Acyclic Ketimines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The first enantioselective vinylogous Mannich reaction of acyclic vinylketene silyl acetals with acyclic ketimines derived from alkynyl ketoesters was developed. Excellent yields and enantioselectivities were obtained from the reaction using bis(imidazoline)&#8208;Zn(II) catalyst. Based on experiments and MO calculation, a plausible transition state was proposed to explain the stereoselectivity of the reaction. The obtained products were converted into various amines and a lactam. This process provides an efficient route for the synthesis of acyclic &#948;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and their derivatives.

         <title>1,3&#8208;Difunctionalization of Imino&#8208;Carbenes via Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions of Triazoles with Acyl Selenides</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report on the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of triazoles with acyl selenides. Under thermal reaction conditions and in the presence of a rhodium catalyst, a rapid 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization reaction occurs to provide valuable &#945;&#8208;seleno enamides with high stereoselectivity and broad functional group tolerance, which was demonstrated in 35 examples with up to 95% yield. Computational calculations suggest a reaction pathway that gives a direct access to the 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization without intermittent formation of ylide intermediates.

Abstract
This paper reports the transition metal&#8208;free C(sp3)&#8722;H sulfenylation of arylacetamides by using thiophenols as the sulfenyl reagents. The reactions take place in the presence of only K3PO4. Control experiments indicate that the reactions proceed via a featured sulfur&#8208;centred free radical intermediate. In addition, the synthesis of 2&#8208;thiomethyl benzoxazoles has been realized via the p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (p&#8208;TSA) promoted annulation of the sulfenylated products.

Abstract
We report herein a strategy to afford a multicomponent catalytic enantioselective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;substituted isoxazolidin&#8208;5&#8208;ones via a KMC process promoted by a suited cupreine used as bifunctional organocatalyst. The hydroxamic acid component, with a sterically hindered amide moiety, proved to be key for the successful formation and transformation of the obtained original N&#8208;amide isoxazolidin&#8208;5&#8208;ones.

         <title>Modification of the Enantioselectivity of Biocatalytic meso&#8208;Desymmetrization for Synthesis of Both Enantiomers of cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;Disubstituted Cyclohexane by Amidase Engineering</title>

Abstract
Both enantiomers of cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclohexane have been obtained enantioselectively through engineered amidase&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of meso carbocyclic 1,2&#8208;dicarboxamides under mild condition. Based on the enzyme&#8208;substrate binding model suggested by molecular docking, the amplification and reversal of enantioselectivity of amidase was quickly achieved through generating and testing only 8 variants. The origin of enantiopreference for amidase was revealed by MD simulations and the reason for the reversal of enantioselectivity towards amidase variant was disclosed. The synthetic application of biocatalytic meso&#8208;desymmetrization was demonstrated by straightforward transformation of the products to enantiomerically pure heterocyclic compounds.

Abstract
A series of enantioenriched 4,5,6,7&#8208;tetrahydrofuro[2,3&#8208;b]pyridines were accessed by a cycloisomerization/cycloaddition strategy. Starting from ynamide derivatives and aldehydes, yields ranging from 27 to 90% and high levels of stereoselectivity (de&gt;95%, 93&#8211;99% ee) were obtained through sequential relay catalysis. The concurrent use of a gold complex with a diphenylprolinol silyl ether was applied to a combination of diversely functionalized substrates.

Abstract
A nitrogen&#8208;centered radical strategy for the preparation of 3&#8208;acylated spiro[4,5]trienones via visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated acylation/ipso&#8208;cyclization of alkynes with acyl oxime esters is reported. The alkyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted acyl radicals, which generate from the cleavage of carbon&#8208;carbon &#963;&#8208;bonds in acyl oxime esters via nitrogen&#8208;centered radical pathway, attack the carbon&#8208;carbon triple bonds in propiolamides and then undergo ipso&#8208;cyclization. This method provides a way for the construction of 3&#8208;acyl&#8208;substituted spiro[4,5]trienones, which can introduce aryl&#8208; or alkyl&#8208;substituted acyl into spiro[4,5]trienone skeletons.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed tandem intermolecular ylide formation/intramolecular cycloaddition of diazo compounds and aldehyde&#8208;tethered&#8208;cyclohexadienones was reported, chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectively providing oxapolycyclic frameworks in moderate to excellent yields under mild conditions. This reaction creates two C&#8722;C bonds and one C&#8722;O bond with five stereocentres including two all&#8208;carbon quaternary centres. Moreover, the late&#8208;stage diversification of products can be realized via chemoselective substitutions.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Spirothiazolones via Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Cooperative amino&#8208; and palladium catalysis utilizing heterocyclic systems containing strongly coordinating and adsorptive sulfur atom remains an underdeveloped area. Herein, we describe an enantioselective cyclization of enals with thiazole derivatives catalyzed with the combination of achiral Pd(0) complexes and chiral secondary amines. Chiral spirocyclic thiazolones were produced in yields ranging from 41% to 98% with stereoselectivities (from 5:1 to 12:1 dr, and 95&#8211;99%&#8197;ee). Moreover, the developed strategy allows access to highly substituted chiral cyclopentane derivatives by additional transformations of spirocyclic thiazolones.

         <title>Biochemical and Structural Characterization of an (R)&#8208;Selective Transaminase in the Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Hydroxy Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
An (R)&#8208;selective transaminase RbTA with excellent stereoselectivity (&gt;99% ee) in the asymmetric amination of hydroxy ketones was identified. Biochemical characterization showed that RbTA exhibited the highest activity toward 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone among reported enzymes, and that it has broad substrate specificity, including for aliphatic, aromatic, and alicyclic ketones. Crystallization of RbTA were performed, as were molecular docking and mutagenesis studies. Residue Tyr125 plays a key role in substrate recognition by forming a hydrogen bond with hydroxy ketone. The applicability of the enzyme was determined in preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of (R)&#8208;3&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;butanol, demonstrating the potential of RbTA as a green biocatalyst for production of value&#8208;added chiral hydroxy amines. This study provides an efficient tool for enzymatic synthesis of chiral hydroxy amines, as well as structural insight into substrate recognition by transaminases in the asymmetric amination of hydroxy ketones.

         <title>Cascade Reaction of &#945;, &#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones and 2&#8208;Aminoaryl Alcohols for the Synthesis of 3&#8208;Acylquinolines by a Copper Nanocatalyst</title>

Abstract
3&#8208;Acylquinolines possess widespread applications in functional chemicals. However, the convenient and selective synthesis of such important substructures has to date remained a challenge. Herein, we report a method to access 3&#8208;acylquinolines from &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones and 2&#8208;aminoaryl alcohols in one pot with a copper nanocatalyst supported on nitrogen&#8208;silica&#8208;doped carbon (Cu/N&#8722;SiO2&#8722;C). Mechanistically, the construction of the product involves a cascade procedure including radical&#8208;type oxidation of 2&#8208;aminoaryl alcohols, aza&#8208;Michael addition and annulation. This developed protocol proceeds with merits of mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance, earth&#8208;abundant and reusable copper catalyst, easily available stocks and O2 as the sole oxidant, which provides an alternative way for the sustainable synthesis of quinoline derivatives.

Abstract
C&#8722;N bond formation reactions have garnered a lot of interest in recent years due to the predominance of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds in most pharmacological medications. Since traditional approaches have several limitations, the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H amidation/amination process has arisen as a more atom&#8208;friendly option. Because there are so many distinct kinds of C&#8722;H bonds in organic molecules, selective amidation of C&#8722;H bonds has always been a challenge. In this scenario, the directing&#8208;group&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H amidation has received considerable attention, especially with inexpensive metal cobalt, due to its unique properties and efficiency. We summarize recent developments in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed directing&#8208;group&#8208;aided C&#8722;H bond amidation reactions in this review. We briefly discuss the evolution of directing group preferences and their function in the site selection.
