      <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Pentacyclic Proaporphine Alkaloid (&#8211;)&#8208;Misramine</title>
      <dc:description>An enantioselective total synthesis of pentacyclic proaporphine alkaloid (&#8211;)&#8208;misramine has been achieved. The synthetic route features a Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization to construct the fused B and C rings and a sequence of Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation, Pinnick oxidation, and pinacol&#8208;type cyclization to install the &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl ketal moiety. The absolute configuration of the pentacyclic framework was elucidated by X&#8208;ray single crystal analyses of (&#8211;)&#8208;11&#8208;demethoxymisramine.</dc:description>

      <title>Direct C&#8208;H arylation of indole&#8208;3&#8208;acetic acid derivatives enabled by an autonomous self&#8208;optimizing flow reactor</title>
      <dc:description>Described herein is a continuous&#8208;flow strategy for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8208;H arylation of indole&#8208;3&#8208;acetic acid derivatives with arenediazonium salts. A fully autonomous self&#8208;optimizing flow platform was used to efficiently optimize the coupling reaction in a 3&#8208;dimensional space. The flow methodology developed is experimentally simple, mild, broad in scope and safer than traditional batch approaches. Our continuous&#8208;flow approach is particularly convenient to prepare precursors of pharmaceutically relevant compounds.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Heterocyclics via Cascade Cyclization of Propargylic Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>Heterocyclic compounds are important organic compounds and have emerged as key scaffolds in numerous drugs, natural products, vitamins, biologically and pharmaceutically active compounds. Over the past few decades, the development of versatile methodologies employing propargylic alcohols as synthons for the construction of heterocyclic skeletons has attracted great attention from synthetic chemists. In this review, recent developments in the cascade cyclization of propargylic alcohols with diverse nucleophiles to construct heterocyclic compounds are summarized. According to the types of nucleophiles, these reactions can be divided into four categories: 1) Reactions involving C&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation; 2) Reactions involving O, S&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation; 3) Reactions involving N, P&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation; 4) Reactions involving halo&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation.</dc:description>

      <title>Halohydrin Dehalogenases and Their Potential in Industrial Application &#8211; A Viewpoint of Enzyme Reaction Engineering</title>
      <dc:description>At the moment, there are approx. 100 published papers investigating halohydrin dehalogenases from different aspects; enzymology, molecular biology and reactions they can catalyse. Unquestionably, these enzymes are of great importance and hold an immense potential due to the wide spectrum of different compounds that can be synthesized by their action. These compounds, such as chiral epoxides, &#946;&#8208;substituted alcohols, oxazolidinones etc., significantly enrich the chemist&#8217;s toolbox and, moreover, open the possibility for the synthesis of even more complex compounds. Still, there are many unknowns, and it is the purpose of this work to demonstrate the possibilities and bottlenecks, in scientific sense, that could further help in broadening the applicative potential of these fascinating enzymes.</dc:description>

      <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks in Catalytic Organic Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which are built upon dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) with various organic building blocks, possess predesignable, highly ordered and crystalline porous structures. These features endow COFs with great potential in the development of function&#8208;tailored materials, particularly in catalytic organic synthesis. Start from selective oxidation reactions early introduced by Ferdi, Thomas and their co&#8208;workers, and then Wang and co&#8208;workers performed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction through integrating palladium into COFs, increasing numbers of works were established to explore their potentials in the	catalysis of organic reactions. As heterogeneous organic catalysts, COFs bring benefits and solve problems, but also create new obstacles. Hence, we would like to establish a comprehensive system to review some pioneering works in this area. This will help us get a better view so that we can discuss the key and challenging issues we are currently confronted with.</dc:description>

However, the synthetic methods for (R)&#8208;2 mainly include chemical reductions, rarely involving biocatalysis or bioreduction for the moment. Here, we report a method for obtaining (R)&#8208;2 by biocatalytic reduction of corresponding prochiral acetophenone (1) with bulky o&#8208;substitution using recombinant Lactobacillus fermentum short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase 1 (LfSDR1) as a biocatalyst. Further engineering of LfSDR1 variants could access asymmetric reduction of 1 and yield (R)&#8208;2 with a &gt;99% ee value and a &gt;99% conversion. In addition, through the test of different co&#8208;solvents and a series of initial substrate concentrations, substrate 1 with the concentration of 60 g/L can be completely converted into (R)&#8208;2 on a preparative scale (1.13 g, 3.93 mmol, 75.6% isolated yield) in 24 hours.

      <dc:description>Recent years have witnessed a renaissance of radical cross&#8208;coupling of cycloketone oximes which served as active cyanoalkyl radical via ring fragmentation in various transformations. It provided an efficient and practical strategy to introduce cyanoalkyl groups into organic compounds without using toxic cyanide sources. In this review, a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the field of redox&#8208;active cycloketone oximes&#8208;based cross&#8208;couplings were covered. This review was categorized into two broad parts: non&#8208;photocatalyzed and photocatalyzed cross&#8208;couplings according to the reaction conditions. Moreover, the two broad parts were further divided into several sub&#8208;sections depending on the nature of the bond formation.

      <title>Recent Achievements in the Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Concise Construction of Medium N&#8208;Heterocycles, Azepines and Azocines</title>
      <dc:description>Medium N&#8208;heterocycles, azepines and azocines, serve as important skeletons that occurred widely in natural products, however, due to the lack of efficient synthetic methodologies, their application potential in biologically active molecules, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals remained to be explored. In this context, rhodium catalysis in this field featured good reactivity and functional group tolerance, with readily available starting materials, and enabled rapid access to the azepines and azocines. Delightfully, great achievements in the concise construction of these 7 and 8&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles under Rh&#8208;catalysis have been made, which mainly included cycloisomerization of unsaturated C&#8210;X bonds (which might also combine the ring&#8208;opening strategy on strained rings), metal carbenoid or nitrene insertion involved transformations, and direct C&#8210;H activation reactions. Considering the great performance of rhodium catalyst in the synthesis of azepines and azocines, herein, we summarized the recent results in this field, and wish to give further insight and inspired more encouraging methodologies and new drug discovery based on these 7 and 8&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>

      <title>Ni/Co Catalyzed Reductive Hydrocyanation of Alkynes with Formamide as the Cyano Source, Dehydrant, Reductant and Solvent</title>
      <dc:description>A Ni/Co co&#8208;catalyzed reductive hydrocyanation of various alkynes is developed for the production of saturated nitriles. Hydrocyanic acid is generated in situ from safe and readily available formamide. Formamide played multiple roles as a cyano source, dehydrant, and reductant for the NiII pre&#8208;catalyst and vinyl nitriles, along with acting as the co&#8208;solvent in this reaction. Detailed mechanistic investigation supported a pathway via hydrocyanation of C&#8801;C bond and the subsequent reduction of C=C bond. Wide substrate scope, the employment of a cheap and stable nickel salt as pre&#8208;catalyst, a safe cyano source, and convenient experimental operation render this hydrocyanation practical for the laboratory synthesis of saturated nitriles.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A Ni/Co co&#8208;catalyzed reductive hydrocyanation of various alkynes is developed for the production of saturated nitriles. Hydrocyanic acid is generated in situ from safe and readily available formamide. Formamide played multiple roles as a cyano source, dehydrant, and reductant for the NiII pre&#8208;catalyst and vinyl nitriles, along with acting as the co&#8208;solvent in this reaction.

      <dc:description>Asymmetric multi&#8208;catalysis, designed to mimic catalytic processes in nature, is a powerful instrument to fulfil fascinating transformations. As a result, this area of research has attracted considerable interests within chemistry communities. Although there are numerous reviews involving multi&#8208;catalysis, reviews describing asymmetric organomulticatalysis remain rare.

Organomulticatalysis refers to the synthetic strategies of modular combination of organo&#8208;catalyzed reactions into one synthetic operation with minimum workup or change in conditions. It is apparent that a variety reports utilizing the concept of enantioselective organomulticatalysis have substantially surfaced in the past few years. Hence, it is indispensable to succinctly present all such reports by means of disclosing the mechanistic analysis, as well as the challenges and issues associated in the development of the asymmetric catalytic system.

      <title>Propargylic Alcohols as Coupling Partners in Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Arene C&#8208;H Activation</title>
      <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed site selective arene C&#8208;H bond activation concomitant functionalization with various coupling partners gain magnificent attraction in synthetic organic chemistry as complementary to traditional transformations. Mechanistically, these C&#8208;H functionalization approaches involve directing group assisted concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation (CMD), migratory insertion, and reductive elimination sequences. In this realm, diverse categories of coupling partners were employed as C&#8208;H functionalization buddies. Particularly alkynes gain enormous  attention as annulating agents. These units coordinates with metalcycle through &#7467;&#8208;interaction produce annulation outcomes in a straightforward manner.
Very recently, propargylic alcohols were appointed as valuable archetypes in arene C&#8208;H activation armoury, as they have shown regio&#8208; and chemoselective migratory insertion into primary metalcycle species via hydroxy chelation. The influential regioselectivity was drawn by dual coordination of metal complexes with the pendent directing group and a propargylic hydroxyl group. In this review, we focused on annulations and functionalization of arenes and propargylic alcohols, which afford intricate cycles as well as complex acyclic motifs in a trouble&#8208;free manner. We categorized these transformations based on number of atoms  of propargylic alcohols involved in annulation along with some addition reactions. We anticipate to pave a way towards enhanced endeavours for discovering novel reaction avenues.</dc:description>
