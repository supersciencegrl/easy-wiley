         <dc:description>Abstract. The synthesis of 5&#8208;7 membered oxygenated heterocycles by intramolecular aminooxygenation of unsaturated alkenes using commercially available N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide an amination reagent and the TpiPr2Cu(NCCH3) as precatalyst is reported. With unsaturated aliphatic carboxylic acids, the corresponding lactones are obtained from moderate to almost quantitative yields employing a catalyst loading of 2.5 mol% under mild conditions, whereas 2&#8208;vinylbenzoic acids originate low&#8208;er yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonenes from Aldehydes and &#945;&#8208;Pinene: Fe(III) Aggregate Catalysis</title>

Abstract
A challenge for the acid&#8208;mediated formation of oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonenes is side product formation. Presented herein is a Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed method towards these structures from aldehydes and &#945;&#8208;pinene, forming the endo diastereomer exclusively. We include a proposal for the stereochemical reassignment of previously reported exo diastereomers supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, 1H NMR, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The reactive system includes a range of aldehyde substrates. Experimental observations along with quantum chemical simulations suggest that an Fe(III)&#8208;aldehyde aggregate functions as the active catalyst.

         <title>Selectivity Rules for the Dearomative (3+2) Annulation Reaction Between Substituted Indoles and Oxyallyl Cations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
We report a collection of &#8220;selectivity rules&#8221; for the dearomative (3+2) annulation reaction between substituted indoles and oxyallyl cations. The application of these rules enables us to synthesize four different regioisomeric permutations of the annulation products in a stereoselective fashion. We demonstrated that these products could be further transformed into hexahydro&#8208; and tetrahydrocarbazoles by nucleophile&#8208;intercepted Beckmann fragmentation (NuBFr) and Beckmann fragmentation (BFr).

Abstract
Photochemical C&#8722;C coupling reactions can be tailored to industrial chemical processes and preparations of pharmaceuticals. Recent approaches in this area are limited to using precious transition metal coordination complexes that facilitate light absorption and redox processes with benchtop chemicals. Herein, we propose a paradigm that involves all&#8208;in&#8208;one organo&#8208;photo&#8208;auxiliaries, thio&#8208;heteroarenes, which exhibit unique photophysical properties. These thio&#8208;heteroarenes were employed to prepare several all&#8208;in&#8208;one ionic photo&#8208;salts from commercially available alkyl/benzyl and heterocyclic halides via aromaticity&#8208;mediated nucleophilic substitution reactions. From the library of &gt;30 salts, we performed on&#8208;demand photochemical C&#8722;C coupling reactions to isolate numerous symmetrical and unsymmetrical diary/alkyl&#8208;ethanes with yields up to 84% and mass balance as high as 96%. We also investigated the influence of structural features/properties on the outcomes of the photochemical C&#8722;C coupling reactions. The current photochemical C&#8722;C method was successful in the isolation of &gt;30 photoproducts, including the natural product Brittonin A, a precursor of Imipramine, and derivatives of the bioactive Honokiol Analogues. Furthermore, transient absorption spectroscopy and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations were used to decipher the nature of light&#8208;promoted electronic transitions.

         <title>Carboxylate&#8208;Directed Oxidative Annulation via C(Alkenyl)&#8722;H Activation/Double Alkyne Insertion/1,4&#8208;Pd Migration: Synthesis of Functionalized Naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 5, March 4, 2025. </description>

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed double consecutive C(alkenyl)&#8722;H activation/alkyne insertion method utilizing a free carboxylic acid as a directing group in the preparation of functionalized naphthalenes is reported. The reaction mechanism involves a sequence of the C (alkenyl)&#8722;H activation/alkyne insertion/1,4&#8208;palladium migration/reductive elimination steps. The second alkyne insertion occurred at the phenyl ring of the intermediate generated from the first alkyne insertion via 1,4&#8208;palladium migration, which is an uncommon case in typical C&#8722;H activation/alkyne insertion chemistry, providing functionalized naphthalene products. Additionally, the kinetic studies and control experiments as well as density functional theory (DFT) studies are also investigated to elucidate the reaction mechanism.

Abstract
Benzylidene imidazolones with an ortho&#8208;sec&#8208;amino group undergo chemodivergent photochemical transformations, based on the wavelength of irradiation. Irradiation at 525&#8197;nm causes dimerization and the formation of cyclobutanes with two spiroatoms, related to dictazoles in 87&#8211;98% yield. In turn, irradiation at 365&#8197;nm provides access to spirocyclic indolines in 67&#8211;92% yield. Each of the processes proceeds with exclusive atom economy and chemoselectivity.

Abstract
Herein, we report the development of photoredox&#8208;catalyzed N&#8722;H insertion of sulfoxonium ylides with amines via oxidative single&#8208;electron transfer (SET). These reactions exhibit broad substrate scope (32 examples) and offer operationally simple, scalable procedures for accessing &#945;&#8208;ketoamides in a single step. Mechanistic studies and control experiments confirm the participation of a photogenerated carbon radical in facilitating the oxidative single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) from the sulfoxonium ylides to initiate the reaction.

         <title>Unsupported Nanoporous Copper Catalyzed Insertion of Carbenes from &#945;&#8208;Diazo Compounds into Hydrosilanes</title>

Abstract
The insertion of diazo carbene into Si&#8722;H bonds with unsupported nanoporous copper (CuNPore) catalyst has been developed. &#945;&#8208;Aryl diazoesters, diazophosphonates, and unstable aryl diazoalkyls can be used as carbene precursors to exquisitely insert into the Si&#8722;H bond of silanes. A variety of &#945;&#8208;silylesters, silylphosphonate, and functionalized arylsilane were obtained in 35&#8211;82% yields. The reusability feature of the CuNPore catalyst for this insertion reaction demonstrated its high heterogeneous catalytic activity and practicality. Further, mechanistic studies revealed that the insertion of carbene from diazo compounds into the Si&#8722;H bond may include a three&#8208;center concerted transition state on CuNPore.

         <title>Discovery of EDA&#8208;Complex Photochemical Reactions Using Computational Vision</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a multidimensional screening strategy to discover Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor (EDA) complex photochemical reactions using only simple photographic devices, such as webcams or cellphones, combined with TLC analysis. An algorithm was designed to automatically identify EDA&#8208;complex reactive mixtures in solution by processing digital images from a 96&#8208;well microplate, alongside TLC results. The code detects the absorption region of the mixture in the visible spectrum and quantifies color changes through grayscale values. Integrated automatic TLC analysis further classifies mixtures as colorimetric reactions, non&#8208;reactive, or potentially reactive EDA complexes. Leveraging this screening platform, we have developed a new EDA&#8208;mediated approach to synthesize iminophosphoranes in yields up to 90%.

Abstract
While arylazo sulfones have been widely applied as arylating agents, their exploitation for diazenylation reactions has been previously limited to electron&#8208;rich alkenes such as styrenes and silyl enol ethers. Herein we optimized a synthetic one&#8208;pot protocol to access oxazolyl azo compounds via a selective domino ring&#8208;closing/aryldiazenylation sequence by starting from arylazo sulfones and isocyanoacetamides in the presence of Sm(OTf)3 as the Lewis acid. The substrate scope, along with scale&#8208;up reaction both in batch and under continuous flow conditions provide a valuable approach to such a class of heteroaryl azo compounds.

Abstract
Quinoxaline is a chemical moiety known for its diverse physicochemical and biological properties, making it the focus of extensive research. Over the past few decades, quinoxaline scaffolds have been utilized in the design and development of various bioactive molecules, dyes, fluorescent materials, electroluminescent materials, organic sensitizers for solar cells, and polymeric optoelectronic materials. Herein, we present a metal&#8208;free and rapid protocol for the phosphorylation of quinoxalines and quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one. This method employs oxygen as an oxidant under ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, with experimental evidence indicating the absence of radical involvement. Our methodology provides range of phosphorylated quinoxalines and quinoxaline&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one in yields ranging from 47% to 99%.

Abstract
An environmentally benign route for the synthesis of sulfonamides via Sulfur (VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) chemistry utilizing N&#8208;methylimidazole, that simultaneously act as a base, precatalyst, HF by&#8208;product scavenger, as well as solvent, is described. This one&#8208;step sulfonamide synthesis exhibits excellent reactivity toward highly electron&#8208;deficient and less nucleophilic anilines as well as aminopyridines while tolerating a wide range of functional groups. In addition to the desired sulfonamide target, we also isolated an ionic salt as the sole side product from the reaction mixture that has been identified as bis[1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;3&#8208;ium] hexafluorosilicate (IV). The glass surface of reaction vessel is acting as the source of silicon present in the isolated side product. Formation of hexafluorosilicate salt is also facilitating the consumption of sulfonyl fluoride for sulfonamide synthesis. Optimization of the reaction under various conditions, as well as the isolation of the bis[1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;3&#8208;ium] hexafluorosilicate (IV) salt, highlight the crucial role of N&#8208;methylimidazole and support the glass&#8208;assisted approach. Besides the first example of glass&#8211;assisted SuFEx catalyzed by benign organic bases, this reaction also offers an alternative route for accessing protic hexafluorosilicate&#8208;based molten salts without employing external HF. The synthetic utility of this SuFEx route for late&#8208;stage functionalization is also demonstrated.

Abstract
The asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of various dibenzo&#8208;fused azepines including 5H&#8208;dibenzo[b,e][1,4]diazepines, dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepines and 11H&#8208;dibenzo[b,e]azepines using chiral iridium diamine catalysts and HCO2H/NEt3 as the hydrogen source has been accomplished. A range of chiral 10,11&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5H&#8208;dibenzo[b,e][1,4]diazepines, 10,11&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine and 6,11&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5H&#8208;dibenzo[b,e]azepines have been prepared in 82&#8211;94% yields with 82&#8211;99% ee. Diversely substituted substrates are suitable for this transformation, and a number of functional groups are tolerated. Enantiocontrol is achieved via judicious choice of catalyst, additive and hydrogen source. The synthetic potential of this reaction is explored through gram&#8208;scale reactions without loss of reactivity and optical purity and further transformations on products.

         <title>Improving the Photochemical Skeletal Enlargement of Pyridines to 1,2&#8208;Diazepines with Isocyanates</title>

Abstract
In this work, we extend the one&#8208;pot protocol to synthesize 1,2&#8208;diazepines from commercially available and cheap starting materials. Capitalizing on isocyanate derivatives as activating agents, the photochemical skeletal enlargement occurs, while preserving key functional groups embedded in more than 30 substrates. We also demonstrated that isocyanates can be generated in&#8197;situ exploiting the wealth of methods starting from bench stable resources. Compare to previous strategies, the use of these precursors prevents the presence of deleterious HCl traces in the system, thus enabling the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;diazepines in high yields over up to 5 sequential steps.

Abstract
The asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of 3&#8208;substituted 2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazines with an azeotropic mixture of HCO2H/NEt3 (5/2) using tethered Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;diamine catalysis has been realized. This process allows access to a broad range of chiral 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazines in high yields with up to 99% ee, and tolerates a variety of functional groups. The enantiocontrol is achieved by the judicious choice of catalyst and hydrogen source. This reaction proceeds with unexpected reversal of enantioselectivity, which is attributed to the acidic reaction conditions and the hydrogen bond between the N&#8722;H of the rhodium species and the O atom in the substrate.

Abstract
Deuterated hydroxyl acids and amino acids have been widely utilized in life science, biochemistry and drug development. Site&#8208;selective and stereoselective synthesis of deuterated hydroxyl acids and amino acids remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the development of a robust whole&#8208;cell&#8208;based chemoenzymatic platform for the synthesis of deuterated hydroxyl acids and amino acids from off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf aldehydes in high yields with excellent selectivities and levels of deuteration. The platform delivers products with diverse scaffolds and deuteration patterns, as well as broad scopes with both aromatic and aliphatic side chains. The application of the platform was demonstrated by the concise synthesis of a deuterium&#8208;containing antiparkinson's disease candidate. This platform provides a concrete foundation for accessing amino acid isotopologs for potential applications in research and drug discovery and development.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced intramolecular crossed [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of allene&#8208;tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes was reported in this paper. The reactions were conducted under mild conditions using Iridium(III) catalyst FirPic as a photosensitizer for energy transfer, affording bridged bicyclic alkenes in moderate to good yields with excellent regioselectivity and stereoselectivity through the regulation of substituents at the olefin's terminal position. Meanwhile, the computational study explained the special region control assisted by sulfonyl radicals in detail.

         <title>The Latest Insights into Multiply Selective Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions Using a Chiral&#8208;Cavity&#8208;Structured Lewis&#8208;Acidic Boron Catalyst</title>

Abstract
The latest insights into multiply selective Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) reactions is presented, where a chiral&#8208;cavity&#8208;structured Lewis&#8208;acidic boron catalyst is employed. The catalyst ((R)&#8208;1) is capable of recognizing both dienes and dienophiles, primarily due to the influence of the suitable steric factors of its cavity. By taking advantage of the structural and exo&#8208;product&#8208;inducing properties of (R)&#8208;1, even in the presence of a mixture of inseparable dienes, the target products were successfully obtained in high yield with high enantioselectivity. As (R)&#8208;1 exhibited the capacity to differentiate between three&#8208;dimensional isomeric transition&#8208;state structures in DA reactions, this work contributes to the advancement of artificial enzyme&#8208;like catalysis, which has so far remained elusive.

         <title>Batch vs Continuous&#8208;Flow Method to Synthesize N&#8208;(3&#8208;Acylamidopropyl)Lactams Through N&#8722;C Bond Cleavage in Amides with Amidines</title>

Abstract
The selective N&#8722;C bond cleavage of amides to create value&#8208;added products through a transition metal&#8208;free approach has become a significant challenge. Here, we present a method to convert amides into N&#8208;(3&#8208;acylamidopropyl)lactams through sequential amide chemoselective N&#8722;C bond cleavage and amidine ring opening under mild conditions, applicable in batch and continuous flow processes. These methods utilize bench&#8208;stable reagents and are operationally straightforward and mild, enabling synthesis on a gram scale with excellent functional group tolerance. Additionally, the synthetic feasibility of these reactions under flow conditions has proven to be highly efficient, providing N&#8208;(3&#8208;acylamidopropyl)lactam derivatives with improved yields and shorter reaction time.

Abstract
Additive carbonylations typically necessitate strong nucleophiles, such as alcohols or amines. In this study, we carbonylated a poorly nucleophilic urea, under oxidant&#8208;free conditions. Our straightforward carbonylative strategy enables access to versatile &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams featuring an aminocarbonyl fragment, utilizing readily available propargylic ureas as starting materials. The employment of the PdI2/KI catalytic system allowed complete regioselectivity (5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig), high functional group tolerance, broad substrate scope as well as operational simplicity (oxidant&#8208;free, organic ligand&#8208;free and base&#8208;free protocol). The synthetic utility of these &#947;&#8208;lactams is showcased through late&#8208;stage functionalizations, such as Giese reactions and peptide couplings.

Abstract
An efficient Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation/cyclization of 2&#8208;arylbenzimidazoles with CF3&#8208;imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides has been achieved, yielding diverse CF3&#8722; and amino&#8208;disubstituted 5,6&#8208;dihydrobenzoimidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines, which could undergo a deaminative hydroxylation to access CF3&#8722; and hydroxy&#8208;disubstituted 5,6&#8208;dihydrobenzoimidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines catalyzed by Sc(OTf)3. This developed strategy features easily available starting materials, broad substrate scope, good scalability and high efficiency. Moreover, the antitumor activities of selected products against some human cancer cell lines were also investigated, and the results indicated that several products show antiproliferative activities.

         <title>Photoinduced Hydrogen Atom Transfer Activation of Benzylic C&#8722;H Bonds Functionalization</title>

Abstract
Visible light, as an efficient and renewable resource, has gained significant attention in organic synthesis due to its mild, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly nature. Among the various photocatalytic processes, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) has become a crucial mechanism for the activation of C&#8722;H bonds, with a particular focus on the functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. This review shows recent developments in the area of photoinduced HAT and its use in benzylic C&#8722;H bonds functionalization. We discuss halogen atom radicals, N&#8208;centered radical, O&#8208;centered radical, S&#8208;centered radical and C&#8208;centered radical in HAT processes, and influence on reaction selectivity and substrate versatility. The potential of photoinduced HAT to bypass the need for transition metal catalysts and directing groups positions it as a promising approach for constructing intricate organic molecules with high atom economy and sustainability. This review aims to offer a detailed summary of the current state of photoinduced HAT, providing insights into its potential uses in synthetic chemistry.

Abstract
The burgeoning field of asymmetric catalysis has significantly advanced the construction of axially chiral compounds, recognized for their distinct three&#8208;dimensional structures that are relevant in drug discovery, catalyst design and material science. Particularly, the atropisomeric aldehydes, characterized by a chiral axis and the presence of an aldehyde functionality, are of increasing value and interest in chemistry&#8208;related domains, such as serving as privileged chiral catalysts for activation of amines. In recent years, elegant environmentally&#8208;friendly metal&#8208;free catalytic asymmetric methodologies based on de novo formation of (hetero)aromatic rings, dynamic kinetic resolution and desymmetrization have been established to build this fascinating class of atropisomers. In this review, we would like to highlight recent research progress on enantioselective synthesis of atropisomeric aldehydes by means of organocatalysis and biocatalysis, including their scopes, limitations, mechanisms, synthetic applications and provide some insights into future development.

Abstract
Described herein is the discovery of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed chlorocylization strategy for the synthesis of 3&#8208;chloroindoles tolerated with a wide range of functional groups in moderate to excellent yields. In this transformation, the solvent effect is so important that only THF presents the positive effect. Furthermore, the present method provides an essay access to the N&#8208;unprotected 3&#8208;chloroindoles. A mechanism study showed that 2&#8208;alkynlanilines were catalyzed by palladium to from corresponding indoles, followed by copper&#8208;mediated oxidation chlorination to deliver the 3&#8208;chloroindoles products.

Abstract
A method has been developed for the synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical aryl 1, 2&#8208;diketones at room temperature, without the need for transition metals or photocatalysts. This protocol employs aromatic terminal alkynes or alkenes to react with aryl iodides under conditions involving formate, air, and DMSO. Mechanistic studies indicate that formate, air, and DMSO are all necessary conditions, and that the highly reactive carbon dioxide radical anion (CO2&#8901;&#8722;) generated under these conditions plays a key role in the reaction.

         <title>Co(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective C&#8722;H Dienylation of Indolines and Indoles with Allenyl Carbinol Acetates</title>

Abstract
Herein, we present a Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective C7&#8208;H dienylation of indolines at room temperature employing allenyl carbinol acetate as an efficient dienylating reagent. The reaction proceeds via C&#8722;H activation, regioselective 2,1&#8208;migratory insertion of the allene followed by &#946;&#8208;acetate elimination, resulting in a diverse array of C7&#8208;dienylated indolines. The methodology was further extended to C2&#8208;H dienylation of indoles, affording either branched or linear dienes, contingent on the nature of the substituent present at the allenylic carbon. In addition, hydroarylation of allenes was also successfully achieved with tri&#8208;substituted allenes, which was elusive so far under cobalt catalysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we present a Co(III)-catalyzed regioselective C7-H dienylation of indolines at room temperature employing allenyl carbinol acetate as an efficient dienylating reagent. The reaction proceeds &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; C&#8722;H activation, regioselective 2,1-migratory insertion of the allene followed by &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-acetate elimination, resulting in a diverse array of C7-dienylated indolines. The methodology was further extended to C2-H dienylation of indoles, affording either branched or linear dienes, contingent on the nature of the substituent present at the allenylic carbon. In addition, hydroarylation of allenes was also successfully achieved with tri-substituted allenes, which was elusive so far under cobalt catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A novel and efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization amination of propargylamines and 1,3&#8208;dienes is reported for the first time, yielding a series of chloromethylene pyrrolidines with high efficiency and excellent selectivity. This method was successfully applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and drug molecules, providing molecular backbones with potential applications. The reaction was shown to achieve regioselective modulation of the product molecules through the resonance between the solvent and allylpalladium. Additionally, the E&#8208;form products were found to be thermodynamically stable.

Abstract
A 1,3&#8208;iodoesterification of 2&#8208;substituted indoles with trihaloacetic acid, iodination reagent, and hypervalent iodine(III) compound was developed as an acid&#8208;promoted Csp2&#8722;H/Csp3&#8722;H dual functionalization reaction to furnish 3&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8208;trihaloacetoxymethyl indoles. The one&#8208;pot 1,3&#8208;iodoesterification/hydrolysis of the trihaloester group provided 3&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8208;pivaloylmethyl indoles via the rearrangement of the pivaloyl group. The reaction proceeded through a trihaloacetic acid&#8208;assisted electrophilic activation of the iodination reagent after the formation of an indolyl(mesityl)iodonium trihaloacetate.

Abstract
Herein, we present the example of iron&#8208;catalyzed reductive amination of nitroarenes under the iron/borane system, providing diverse N&#8208;heterocycles in moderate to good yields. This transformation has high efficiency, broad substrate scope, and good functional group compatibility. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that hydroxylamines derived from nitrosoarenes may serve as crucial intermediates rather than anilines, and free organic radicals may not participate in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Mg(SPh)2 as a Catalyst for Efficient Photocatalytic Alkylation Reactions of Active Methylene Compounds with Nonactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 5, March 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Mg(SPh)2 has been found to be a highly active catalyst in photocatalytic alkylation reactions of active methylene compounds with nonactivated alkenes. The desired reactions proceeded smoothly to afford the corresponding alkylated products in high yields with low catalyst loadings (0.2&#8211;0.3&#8197;mol%). This protocol is applicable to a continuous&#8208;flow system. Notably, magnesium is an earth&#8208;abundant metal, and Mg(SPh)2 exhibits higher catalytic activity than the previously reported LiSPh.

Abstract
A general protocol for the efficient synthesis of a variety of highly functionalized pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ones has been developed through a sequential Wolff rearrangement and [3+3] annulation reaction of enaminones and diazo compounds. This straightforward approach features wide substrate applicability, good substrate tolerance, moderate to excellent yields, and without any catalyst, and enables access to structurally diverse pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;one skeletons. Additionally, scale&#8208;up experiments and synthetic derivatizations demonstrated the potential synthetic utility of the transformations.

&lt;p&gt;A general protocol for the efficient synthesis of a variety of highly functionalized pyridin-4-ones has been developed through a sequential Wolff rearrangement and [3+3] annulation reaction of enaminones and diazo compounds. This straightforward approach features wide substrate applicability, good substrate tolerance, moderate to excellent yields, and without any catalyst, and enables access to structurally diverse pyridin-4-one skeletons. Additionally, scale-up experiments and synthetic derivatizations demonstrated the potential synthetic utility of the transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constant enzymatic &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; production of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for an Unspecific Peroxygenase by an L&#8208;amino acid oxidase</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unspecific Peroxygenases have been the subject of a lot of research in the recent past as they offer opportunities for green hydroxylation reactions using hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as donor. A striking problem of UPOs is their low stability against their own co&#8208;substrate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In order to prevent the deactivation, we developed an enzyme cascade with an L&#8208;amino acid oxidase (LAAO) to produce hydrogen peroxide &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; at a constant low concentration, aiming for much higher lifespan and therefore longer working time of the enzyme. This way, we are able to convert a variety of substrates with conversion rates up to 95 %.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel metal&#8208; and base&#8208;free approach for the synthesis of benzoxazino and benzoxazepino fused isoquinoline derivatives from ortho&#8208;alkynyl aldehydes and amines under mild reaction conditions has been described. The formation of new C&#8208;O and C&#8208;N bonds via metal&#8208;free cyclization with internal alkyne aided by water molecules without using external ligands and bases has been described. In addition, a series of control experiments are performed, and mechanistic studies are discussed elaborately by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale synthesis and photophysical studies of the synthesized compounds and their quantum yield calculation have been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new method for the synthesis of indolyl&#8208;7&#8208;azanobornanes.  The process involves the generation of a meta&#8208;stable tetrahydro&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazepine intermediate that decomposes by extrusion of molecular nitrogen and ultimately leads to the formation of the observed products.  The intermediacy of the triazepine intermediate was substantiated by trapping with allyl bromide to give an allylated triazepine compound that was sufficiently stable to be fully characterized in the usual ways.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Click reactions display many of the goals desired for more sustainable chemical
conversions.  Yet, the solvent used is an often overlooked aspect in determining the
environmental impact of reactions. In the current paper we develop the first
mechanochemical method for the efficient and solvent&#8208;free SuFEx reaction of sulfonyl
fluorides with a wide range of phenols.  After outlining the optimization process, which
yields an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use and robust method, we provide indications of the very wide
scope of this approach, and demonstrate this potential via the application to a range of
natural phenols that also display other functionalities, and several gram&#8208;scale
syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Carboxylic acids as enabling directing groups in C&#8208;H activation and functionalization: A decade review</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the last decade, carboxylic acids have drawn profound interest in synthetic chemistry, due to its exceptional adaptability as traceless directing groups (TDGs) in the construction of complex organic molecules in the realm of C&#8208;H activation. The chameleonic nature of such privileged functionality startles each time in portraying its diversity by either trace elimination of acid group or by inherent annulation which makes an aura of distinction from other conventional DGs. In this review, the recent developments of carboxylic acid as a directing group (DG) are emphasized from the year 2017 with apparent late&#8208;stage applications. In view of synthetic chemistry context and substrate scope, innovative avenues are addressed along with multiple approaches in utilising carboxylic acids as efficient DGs.</dc:description>

Abstract
A simple and efficient Ag&#8208;catalyzed tandem selanylation/cyclization of o&#8208;alkynyl benzylazides/o&#8208;alkynyloxy benzylazides with diselenides has been developed. The reaction afforded a series of 3&#8208;seleno&#8208;8H&#8208;[1,2,3]triazolo[5,1&#8208;a]isoindoles and 3&#8208;seleno&#8208;4H,10H&#8208;benzo[f][1,2,3]triazolo[5,1&#8208;c][1,4]oxazepanes in moderate to good yields. The mechanistic study revealed that the intramolecular AAC reaction of an alkynyl selenium intermediate occurred. The synthesized compound 3&#8201;k showed potent cancer cell&#8208;growth inhibition activities.

         <title>Heterogeneously Catalyzed Cascade Oxidative Coupling/Dearomative Spirocyclization of Diarylamines: Facile Access to Spiroacridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Spirocyclic compounds, particularly spirocyclohexadienones, are important in pharmaceuticals due to their biological activity. In this study, we develop a catalytic cascade oxidative spirocyclization of diarylamines for the rapid access to highly functionalized spirocyclohexadienones. Using commercially available recyclable heterogeneous metal catalysts, cascade process via oxidative coupling and dearomative spiroannulation proceeds efficiently under mild aerobic conditions, providing spirocyclohexadienones fused with an acridine skeleton in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. This method provides efficient and rapid access to nitrogen&#8208;containing fused spiro compounds in a highly atom&#8208;economical and environmentally friendly manner.

         <title>Lithium Chloride&#8208;Promoted Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts Alkylation Reaction of Indoles with Aldehydes and Ketones &#8220;on Water&#8221;</title>

Abstract
The Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction between indoles and ketones poses a significant challenge. In this study, we developed an efficient and environmentally friendly approach for the synthesis of bis(indolyl)methanes bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary and tertiary centers at room temperature under &#8220;on water&#8221; conditions. Notably, the utilization of saturated lithium chloride as a solvent greatly enhances the Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed double additions of indoles to ketones and aldehydes by promoting hydrophobic interactions. Additionally, LiCl acts as a Lewis acid catalyst for carbonyl activation and facilitates dehydration. This methodology demonstrates compatibility with various ketone substrates such as alkyl alkyl ketones and aryl alkyl ketones, along with aldehyde substrates. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale productions were successful, and the LiCl solutions demonstrate reusability.

         <title>FeCl3&#8208;Catalyzed Photochemical Reductive Transamidation of Nitroarenes: A Sustainable Approach Using Sacrificial C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A sustainable photochemical reductive transamidation of nitroarenes catalyzed by FeCl3 under blue LED irradiation is reported. This method eliminates the need for pre&#8208;reduction steps or stoichiometric reducing agents by utilizing sacrificial C&#8722;H bonds from organic solvents. The reaction proceeds via FeCl3&#8208;catalyzed single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) cascades. A previously unreported intermediate formed between nitroarenes and N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone (NMP) is discovered, playing a crucial role in facilitating substitution with amides. The method exhibits broad functional group tolerance and achieves yields up to 82%, demonstrating compatibility with a wide range of nitroarenes and amides.

Abstract
We report the direct and selective synthesis of oxadendralenes starting from readily available bis(&#945;&#8208;hydroxyallenes). The designed sequence involves a hitherto unknown oxy&#8208;Cope rearrangement of allenols by supplying a site for the migration of the 1,2&#8208;diene moiety. Moreover, the so&#8208;prepared oxadendralenes were converted into valuable polyfunctionalized scaffolds through effective late&#8208;stage diversification.

Abstract
In this paper, we reported a novel sequential reaction sequence consisting of two processes including domino [3+2]/[2+1] annulation and in&#8197;situ Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement reaction, which enabled synthesis of a series of structurally complex polycyclic pyrrolizine derivatives in 51&#8211;96% yields and excellent diastereoselectivities. The viability of the existing protocol was additionally illustrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis and further modifications. In addition, some of these valuable ring&#8208;fused pyrrolizines displayed some extent of anticancer activity, demonstrating their potential application in the medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Aldehyde Dehydrogenase from Klebsiella pneumoniae: A Robust Biocatalyst for Preparing Heteroatom&#8208;Containing Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Heterocyclic scaffolds have broad applications in organic synthesis, resulting in the production of essential compounds utilized in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and dietary products. In this study, we present the characterization of a discovered succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase from Klebsiella pneumoniae (KpSSADH) and elucidate its crystallographic structure. Further investigation into the catalytic performance of KpSSADH reveals its remarkable efficiency in converting various heteroatom&#8208;containing (including N, S, O, and their combinations) cyclic aldehydes into the corresponding acids with conversions reaching up to 99%. To expand the range of available substrates, we designed cascade reactions by integrating thiol oxidase from Methylovorus sp. MP688 or unspecific peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita with KpSSADH. Through this approach, the desired acids via alcohol oxidation and C&#8722;H bond oxyfunctionalization were obtained, respectively. The discovery of KpSSADH and the envisioned cascade reactions have significantly broadened the biocatalytic toolbox for synthesizing heteroatom&#8208;containing carboxylic acids, thereby holding potential for applications in the modern pharmaceutical industry.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterocyclic scaffolds have broad applications in organic synthesis, resulting in the production of essential compounds utilized in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and dietary products. In this study, we present the characterization of a discovered succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase from &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Kp&lt;/i&gt;SSADH) and elucidate its crystallographic structure. Further investigation into the catalytic performance of &lt;i&gt;Kp&lt;/i&gt;SSADH reveals its remarkable efficiency in converting various heteroatom-containing (including N, S, O, and their combinations) cyclic aldehydes into the corresponding acids with conversions reaching up to 99%. To expand the range of available substrates, we designed cascade reactions by integrating thiol oxidase from &lt;i&gt;Methylovorus sp&lt;/i&gt;. MP688 or unspecific peroxygenase from &lt;i&gt;Agrocybe aegerita&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;Kp&lt;/i&gt;SSADH. Through this approach, the desired acids via alcohol oxidation and C&#8722;H bond oxyfunctionalization were obtained, respectively. The discovery of &lt;i&gt;Kp&lt;/i&gt;SSADH and the envisioned cascade reactions have significantly broadened the biocatalytic toolbox for synthesizing heteroatom-containing carboxylic acids, thereby holding potential for applications in the modern pharmaceutical industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advances of Chiral Metal Complexes as Standalone Photocatalyst for Asymmetric Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Many enantiopure chiral organic molecules are very important unit for drug discovery. Ready access to a wide range of enantiopure organic compounds, attached with one or more chiral centres significantly enhance the quality and diversity of chemical libraries for screening of drug discovery. The ability to control the stereochemistry of many organic reactions remains an area of interest in organic synthesis to allow the development of novel, structurally diverse 3D molecules. Asymmetric catalysis has been extensively studied for controlling the stereochemistry in modern synthetic organic chemistry. Recently, the use of light as the energy source with a chiral photocatalysts for photocatalytic asymmetric organic reactions has drawn much attentions but limited in numbers. The short lifetime of excited chiral photocatalysts and very fast reactions make the stereocontrol difficult in many reactions. However, by making a chiral photoactive metal complex with a suitable metal and ligands, this problem could be solved. As these chiral metal complexes are stable under light irradiation, versatile, having easy tuneable properties, these can provide more chiral inductions in many asymmetric organic reactions. So, in this review, we have focused on the recent development on chiral metal complexes as the standalone chiral photocatalysts for asymmetric organic reactions. We hope this review will help to understand the scopes and limitations to the research community in the field of asymmetric synthesis.

         <title>Electromagnetic mill promoted mechanochemical Sonogashira coupling reaction and mechanism insight into the catalytic complex</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A solid&#8208;state Pd/Cu co&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling facilitated by electromagnetic milling (EMM) was realized without solvent or additional heating. This strategy exhibited excellent substitutions tolerance and widely substrate scope. The physical parameters were investigated, which proved both of magnetic field strength and frequency to be positive correlation to yields. Meanwhile, the suitable size of the grinding medium is key to the transformation. The coordination between copper, palladium and ligands were investigated by mass measurement and 31P NMR, proving that CuI, PPh&#8323;, and DABCO coordinated in a 1:1:1 ratio under EMM, and DABCO could efficiently inhibit the homocoupling by&#8208;product from alkyne. The active catalyst complex for the Sonogashira coupling reaction in EMM is generated in situ. The EMM system offers a straightforward method for Sonogashira coupling and demonstrates significant potential for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric All&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Based Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction of Conjugated Vinyl Azides: Synthesis of Chiral Fused and Spiro Cyclohexenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of conjugated vinyl azides with &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;keto esters and amides was achieved. With C1&#8208;symmetric imidazolidine&#8208;pyrroloimidazolone pyridine as the tridentate ligand and Cu(OTf)2 as the Lewis acid, diverse chiral fused and spiro cyclohexenes with an azido group containing three continuous stereogenic centers were obtained in good yields (up to 92% yield), excellent diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). The developed method was applied to the derivatization of complex molecules including buspirone&#8208;derived ketoamide. The functional group vinyl azide was capable of participating in a subsequent click reaction.

         <dc:description>Simultaneous thiolation/pyridinylation of alkenes was achieved in a three&#8208;component reaction under visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced conditions. By employing 4CzIPN as a photocatalyst and DIPEA as a base, a variety of alkenes and cyanopyridines reacted well with thioacetates or thiosulfonates to obtain the difunctionalized products in excellent yields with high regio&#8208;selectivity. The thiolation/pyridinylation products could easily transfer to 4&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)pyridine or dithioperoxoate compounds.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we describe a Fe&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type reaction of polysubstituted stereodefined fluoroalkyl cyclopropyl carbinols. This transformation provides access to a series of fluoroalkyl group&#8208;substituted dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;indenols bearing three continuous stereogenic centers including two congested tetra&#8208;substituted stereocenters. The key to the realization of this reaction relies on the electronic destabilizing effect of fluoroalkyl group to tune the stability and reactivity of non&#8208;classical cyclopropyl&#8208;carbinyl cation intermediate. Functional group interconversions of the obtained diastereomerically pure dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;indenols further demonstrated the synthetic utility of this rationally designed reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photo&#8208;Dual Catalytic Strategy for Azo Compound Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azo compounds as a class of privileged molecules continue to attract significant attention in many fields including drug discovery, organic synthesis, and materials science. Despite notable progress in their synthesis, the use of visible light to directly construct azo compounds under photocatalytic conditions from amine precursors remains a challenging endeavour. Herein, we report the first instance of photo&#8208;dual catalytic Cu/photosensitizer (PS) synthesis of symmetric and non&#8208;symmetric azo compounds from readily available amines using renewable light energy input, ambient conditions, and ubiquitous air as a stoichiometric oxidant. This reliable and efficient photo&#8208;driven procedure is scalable and tolerates a variety of functional groups with broad substrate scope and allows for the preparation of azo&#8208;based photoswitches, arylazopyrazoles, and diazocines. The origin of this remarkable reactivity is delineated by in&#8208;depth experimental and computational studies.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) is an efficient and mild way to obtain chiral compounds. However, the toxic metal ions and the low turnover number (TON) in aqueous ATH limited the further application. We reported a polystyrene&#8208;covered mesoporous SiO2 supported Noyori&#8217;s Ru&#8208;TsDPEN named Ru&#8208;PCMS, consisting of an inner mesoporous silica core and an outer organic polystyrene layer, which could promote the aqueous ATH of &#946;&#8208;keto esters to afford various chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ester with excellent yields (up to 99%) and ee values (up to 97%). It showed excellent water stability that successfully recycled 8 times without the enantioselectivity reduction and the metal loss.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Unnatural Amino Acids via &#946;&#8208;Aminoaldehyde C&#8211;H Arylation using HAT&#8208;Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unnatural amino acids play a crucial role in advancing protein engineering and drug development. In this study, we present the synthesis of a series of &#947; aryl&#8208;keto&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids through the direct C&#8211;H arylation of readily accessible &#946;&#8208;aminoaldehydes and aryl bromides, promoted by hydrogen atom transfer combined with metallaphotoredox catalysis. This direct and mild methodology provides access to enantiopure L&#8208; and D&#8208; amino acids, either N&#8208;protected or unprotected, with broad functional group compatibility, including pyridine heterocycles. These features highlight the potential relevance of this strategy for pharmaceutical synthesis and biotechnological research.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an electrochemical radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) strategy for the radical cyclization of olefinic amides with C&#8208;H nucleophiles with H2 as the byproduct. Enabled by this strategy, structurally diverse multi&#8208;ester functionalized benzoxazines and iminoisobenzofurans were obtained with good yields. Notably, the resulting triple&#8208;ester functionalized O&#8208;heterocycles are inaccessible by other means. This protocol features catalyst&#8208; and external oxidant&#8208;free conditions, high atom economy, and broad substrate scope. The scalable synthesis as well as product derivatization highlight the synthetic utility of this electrochemical protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of immobilized chiral iridium catalysts by strengthening coordination bonds for Z&#8208;retentive asymmetric allylic substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allyl substitution is pivotal for constructing chiral compounds. However, addressing Ir scarcity and developing sustainable catalysts for industrial applications remains a significant challenge. This study presents a polymer&#8208;supported heterogeneous chiral single&#8208;Ir&#8208;site catalyst, wherein the coordination is optimized through modulation of anions, resulting in a significant reduction in metal leaching. The catalysts exhibit exceptional performance in terms of enhanced enantioselectivity and broad applicability in Z&#8208;retentive asymmetric allylic substitution reactions, even accommodating a wide range of diverse functional groups. Specifically, the catalyst demonstrates minimal metal leaching over 14 cycles, marking a notable improvement compared to previously reported catalysts. The practical optimization of this reaction highlights the potential application value of such catalysts, offering insights for the development of chiral heterogeneous catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Catalytic Sulfide&#8208;based Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complex Platform for Decarboxylative Transformations of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide Esters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study develops a general platform using a catalytic electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) system, which combines inexpensive and readily available sulfides and N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters. This general platform facilitates various redox&#8208;neutral and net&#8208;reductive reactions, including intramolecular cyclization, hydrodecarboxylation, hydroalkylation, heterocyclic synthesis, and C&#8211;H imidation of arenes, through simple operations. For example, the intramolecular cyclization of the N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) ester derivatives achieves yields of up to 84%, while hydrodecarboxylation and hydroalkylation reactions proceed with yields of 78% and 81%, respectively. Heterocyclic synthesis and C&#8211;H imidation are also accomplished with yields of up to 76% and 74%, respectively. Mechanistic investigations reveal that, in the presence of Li ions, the distance between the sulfur atom and the closest atom of the NHPI ester (1a) in the EDA complex decreases from 3.43 to 3.29 &#197;, whereas the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap decreases from 5.42 to 5.32 eV. These results confirm that lithium ions serve as Lewis acids, enhancing the interaction within the EDA complex. The robustness of this catalytic EDA platform is demonstrated by its compatibility with water and air, conditions that challenge conventional photoredox platforms. This study highlights sulfides as effective catalytic electron donors.</dc:description>

The robustness of this catalytic EDA platform is demonstrated by its compatibility with water and air, conditions that challenge conventional photoredox platforms. This study highlights sulfides as effective catalytic electron donors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
The palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis, first identified by Catellani in 1997, provides an efficient approach for synthesizing highly functionalized aromatic compounds that are challenging to obtain through conventional methods. The developed synthetic approach integrates selective C&#8722;H bond activation with sequential reactions, allowing for the targeted functionalization of both the ortho and ipso positions of aryl halides via aryl&#8208;norbornadiene&#8208;palladacycle (ANP), which in turn ensures high chemoselectivity and regioselectivity of the products. It is estimated that approximately 20% of all natural products are glycosylated, with the carbohydrates linked to these compounds frequently playing a critical role in their biological activity. Currently, research in carbohydrate chemistry predominantly concentrates on polysubstitutional derivatization or vicinal functionalization strategies. However, the limited availability of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted compounds has been scarcely investigated, and previous studies often relied on directional group assistance to achieve disubstitution. Recently, significant advancements have been achieved with Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis, an area that has gained considerable importance in carbohydrate chemistry, presenting an opportunity to inspire further research interest in Catellani reactions. In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the Pd/NBE strategy within the realm of sugar chemistry, encompass early research and advancement in catalytic reactions, outline synthetic potential, highlight the significant progress made, and emphasize the most recent developments and their applications in&#8197;situ vicinal functionalization of carbohydrate derivatives.

Abstract
Despite the formidable challenge of concurrently managing both the regiochemistry and stereochemistry of the process, organocatalytic remote stereocontrol has emerged as an appealing approach to establish stereocenters at specified locations distant from reactive functional groups. Herein, we achieved the first organocatalyzed remote stereocontrolled (4+2) annulation of 2&#8208;(4H&#8208;benzo[d][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)acrylates with 4&#8208;methyleneisoxazol&#8208;5(4H)&#8208;ones. The nucleophilic attack of a suitable chiral amine to 2&#8208;(4H&#8208;benzo[d][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)acrylates generated the key amine&#8208;dipole intermediate, followed by the enantioselective aza&#8208;1,4&#8208;addition of 4&#8208;methyleneisoxazol&#8208;5(4H)&#8208;ones and intramolecular annulation cascade reaction to construct spiro[isoxazole&#8208;4,3&#8217;&#8208;quinolin]&#8208;5&#8208;one frameworks bearing continuous three stereocenters. More importantly, different from the well&#8208;established reactions of MBH carbonates, this work successfully established a novel platform for the direct enantioselective synthesis of continuous three stereocenters, inclusive of an &#1013;&#8208;stereocenter.

Abstract
Regio&#8208; and stereoselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalizations of saturated nitrogen heterocycles, amines/amides are challenging and have emerged as an important topic of research in the area of C(sp3)&#8722;H activation. Herein, we have summarized various &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H activation/functionalization methods; this review provides an overview of various trending approaches for &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation/functionalization of saturated nitrogen heterocycles, amines/amides. The regio&#8208; and stereoselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation methods are classified based on the reaction pathways. The literature methods including directing group or ligand&#8208;assisted transformations, reactions proceeding through enamine intermediate, redox&#8208;neutral methods and other trending methods including photoredox and transitional metal&#8208;free methods are discussed with recent updates.

         <title>Amide Synthesis via Transaminative Amidation of Aromatic Aldehydes/Ketones: An Entry to 15N Isotopologs</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we develop the first one&#8208;pot amide synthesis from aldehyde/ketone and amino acids via transaminative amidation reaction and the method requires no catalyst or promoters, by allowing a concise access to structurally diverse amides and lactams with good efficiency. This transformation could also proceed smoothly by direct use of ether solvent as the formylated reagent in stead of formylic acid, thus furnishing an unique synthesis of formamides. The underlying principles of this unique amide synthesis was rationalized by a series of mechanistic studies, which involved a concerted decarboxylatively structural isomerization/acylation process as the key for amidation and a transamination/imine formation/aerobic oxidation cascade for formamidation. The potential utility of this strategy has been demonstrated by the readily accessible late&#8208;stage transformation of biologically active molecules by 15N incorporating. This protocol was also applied to the total synthesis of a kind of drug Butenafine with 15N&#8208;enrichment.

Abstract
Catalytic formal aldol condensation reactions between &#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates and arylaldehydes, in which the C&#8722;C double bond formation occurs at the &#947;&#8208;position of the &#946;&#8208;ketophosphonate, are reported. The reactions were performed in the presence of a catalyst system composed of p&#8208;anisidine and trifluoroacetic acid under mild conditions. Mechanistic investigations suggest that a Mannich reaction followed by elimination results in the formation of the &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated &#946;&#8208;ketophosphonate. Although the &#946;&#8208;ketophosphonate has an active methylene group, the bond formation occurred selectively at the &#947;&#8208;position of the &#946;&#8208;ketophosphonate.

         <dc:description>We report a straightforward and efficient method for the synthesis of spiropyrazoline oxindoles using CuCl2&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; as the Lewis acid catalyst. This approach involves a one&#8208;pot domino process, consisting of a condensation step between indolin&#8208;2&#8208;one and phenylhydrazine derivatives, followed by a copper&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction. 
The methodology enabled the synthesis of 32 diversely functionalized spiro compounds with yields ranging from moderate to excellent, achieving up to 98%.

         <title>Photo&#8208; or Electrochemical N&#8208;P Cross&#8208;Hetero&#8208;Dehydrogenative Couplings between Amines and Phosphonothioates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a dual synthetic approach utilizing both photochemical and electrochemical strategies for the synthesis of diversely functionalized thiophosphoramidates via N&#8208;P cross&#8208;hetero&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling. Both methods provide a practical and efficient route to access this significant class of biologically relevant thiophosphoramidates. Key advantages of the protocol include mild reaction conditions, the use of visible light and electrochemical cells as sustainable tools, and energy efficiency enabled by a low&#8208;energy visible light source and low&#8208;current operation. Furthermore, the process utilizes low&#8208;cost substrates and a nontoxic photosensitizer, delivers high yields, exhibits broad substrate scope with excellent functional group tolerance, and offers operational simplicity with a strong emphasis on eco&#8208;friendliness.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual HATs&#8208;Mediated Catalyst&#8208;Free sp3 C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization for Regioselective Radical Hydroalkylation of Ynazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Direct hydroalkylation of ynazoles, facilitating the efficient synthesis of linear N&#8208;&#946;&#8208;vinylazoles, is accomplished through the functionalization of sp3 C&#8722;H bonds using trace amounts of dioxygen as an initiator. This catalyst&#8208;free method eliminates the need for exogenous reagents and proceeds through a radical chain mechanism involving dual hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes. Its application potential is exemplified through the implementation of scale&#8208;up operations.

Abstract
An operationally simple protocol to access 2,2&#8208;chlorofluoro&#8208;, and 2,2&#8208;bromofluorobicyclopentanes (BCPs) via commercially available, inexpensive, non&#8208;ozone depleting, and bench stable reagents is reported. The resulting BCP products are tolerated in diverse, synthetically relevant post&#8208;functionalization reactions. Gram&#8208;scale reactions to prepare the BCPs are also included.

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of Acyl Fluoride via 1,3&#8208;Chelation&#8208;Assisted Transhalogenation and Its Application in the Valorization of Biomass&#8208;Derived Alcohol in Aqueous System</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed an environmentally friendly method for synthesizing acyl fluorides and achieving the selective mono&#8208;acylation of water&#8208;soluble alcohols using acyl fluorides in green media. Our method offers substantial advantages over the existing technologies for acyl fluoride production, particularly in terms of cost and environmental impact. Notably, our approach is augmented by an unusual 1,3&#8208;chelation via transhalogenation, and the use of an eco&#8208;friendly solvent and a simple base aligns with the principles of sustainable chemistry. We also explored the direct and highly efficient mono&#8208;acylation of biomass&#8208;derived water&#8208;soluble alcohols, such as ethylene glycol and glycerol, in the presence of water. The key arrangements, such as the role of the K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; base and unusual 1,3&#8208;chelation between acyl fluoride and potassium ion, were characterized by HRMS and NMR spectroscopic analysis, and controlled experiments. These findings underscore the effectiveness of this method and provide deeper insights into the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Lanthanide One&#8208;Dimensional Coordination Polymer Catalyzed [3+2] Annulation Reaction: Synthesis of N,N&#8217;&#8208;Bicyclic Pyrazolidine Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of the multidendate ligand (H2L) with lanthanide metal salts leads to the formation of one&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers (CP). The structural analysis of the molecule suggests the formation of CP with ladder&#8208;type arrangements of ligands with metal centers. The polymers CP&#8208;1 and CP&#8208;2 with europium and terbium were found to be anionic and coordinatively unsaturated with the existence of solvent molecules in the vacant sites. The CPs were found to be suitable catalysts for the regioselective annulation of aza&#8208;MBH adducts with N,N, cyclic azomethine imines that lead to the formation of N,N&#8217;&#8208;bicyclic pyrazolidine scaffolds via [3+2] cycloaddition. The protocol tolerates a wide substrate scope with different functionalities by producing the bicyclic scaffold with better yield and excellent diastereoselectivity. The X&#8208;ray and NMR analysis suggests the formation of cis diastereomer which is stabilized by N&#8208;H&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;O interaction. The synthetic utility of the pyrazolidine scaffolds is attempted for various functional group interconversions.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Alkylation/Cyclization of Isocyanides with Organoboron Reagents for Diversified Synthesis of N&#8208;Heteroaromatics</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utility of alkyl boronic acids as alkyl radical precursors in photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reactions has been limited due to their low reactivity. A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical alkylation/cyclization of functional arylisocyanides with alkyl boronic acids is reported herein. This strategy allows the formation of alkyl radicals from boronic acids containing primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl groups, which are subsequently transformed into structurally diverse alkylated products, including quinoxalines, phenanthridines, benzothiazoles, benzoselenazoles and quinolines. This transformation features readily available radical precursors and a broad substrate scope. The reaction mechanism is investigated by fluorescence quenching, light on/off, and cyclic voltammograms (CV) experiments. The combination of alkyl boronic acids with DBU may lead to the formation of the alkyl radical via a single electron transfer (SET) process, while the arylisocyanides may undergo an energy transfer (EnT) process with photocatalyst under visible light to generate the carbon radical or act as a radical acceptor to react with the alkyl radical.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The first example for photo&#8208;induced oxidative C&#8208;H esterification of quinoxalinones with arylaldehydes under benign conditions has been reported. This method is distinguished by its capacity to accommodate a diverse array of quinoxalinones and arylaldehydes, culminating in the synthesis of the corresponding esters with moderate to good yields. The protocol is lauded for its environmental benignity, eschewing the need for hazardous transition metals and costly photocatalysts, and relies solely on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as the oxidant. Moreover, the scalability of the synthesis and the derivative transformations of the products have been demonstrated, underscoring its practical utility in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of a Cobalt&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework in Carbodiimide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The synthesis of carbodiimides via nitrene transfer to isocyanides has garnered significant attention in recent years. However, this reaction predominantly relies on homogeneous catalytic systems with high catalyst loadings. In this study, we employed ZIF&#8208;67 MOF as a heterogeneous catalyst for carbodiimide synthesis and conducted an in&#8208;depth analysis of its stability. Our findings reveal the non&#8208;innocent role of catalyst leaching, demonstrating that even as little as 0.04&#8197;mol% of leached cobalt species is sufficient to catalyze this reaction. This result is in contrast with previous reports, where 5&#8211;10&#8197;mol% of homogeneous cobalt&#8208;loading is required. Furthermore, this study highlights that lower catalyst loadings are more efficient, particularly in cases where isocyanides exhibit limited stability.

&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of carbodiimides via nitrene transfer to isocyanides has garnered significant attention in recent years. However, this reaction predominantly relies on homogeneous catalytic systems with high catalyst loadings. In this study, we employed ZIF-67 MOF as a heterogeneous catalyst for carbodiimide synthesis and conducted an in-depth analysis of its stability. Our findings reveal the non-innocent role of catalyst leaching, demonstrating that even as little as 0.04&#8197;mol% of leached cobalt species is sufficient to catalyze this reaction. This result is in contrast with previous reports, where 5&#8211;10&#8197;mol% of homogeneous cobalt-loading is required. Furthermore, this study highlights that lower catalyst loadings are more efficient, particularly in cases where isocyanides exhibit limited stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Double&#8208;sided control of product type preference in the visible&#8208;light initiated reaction of 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds with alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. The demonstrated light&#8208;initiated addition of radicals formed on an active methylene group to styrene derivatives exhibits a product selectivity influenced by the presence of a protic solvent. Under protic conditions, the predominant products are branched compounds with the alkene moiety attached to the methylene group. In the absence of a proton source, an alkene is incorporated between the carbonyl group and the methylene group, forming products known from the De Mayo reaction. The utility of the presented method was confirmed by a broad substrate range of alkenes and compounds bearing active methylene groups. A comprehensive mechanistic study revealed that both types of products can be formed via the radical pathway. This suggests a previously unreported mechanistic path as an alternative to the De Mayo reaction, which gives the same type of products.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a photoredox assisted &#945;&#8208;acylation of enol acetates with acyl chlorides using catalytic amount of Ir(ppy)3. The reaction proceeds via net&#8208;redox neutral radical&#8208;polar crossover pathway and furnishes 1,3&#8208;diketones in moderate to high yields under mild conditions without an external oxidant. The application of this method is demonstrated in the synthesis of Avobenzone (main ingredient in sunscreens), one&#8208;pot synthesis of anti&#8208;bacterial 4H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzothiazines and organic&#8208;laser dye boron difluoride hemicurcuminoid complex.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
Over the past two decades, iodine&#8208;mediated free radical reactions have been extensively explored and employed in chemical transformations that complement traditional ionic reactions. In this review, we have updated the progress of the iodine&#8208;mediated radical reactions in organic synthesis reported between 2015 and mid&#8208;2024, and organized the reactions according to their mechanistic pathways. In general, the proposed mechanisms can be divided into four categories based on the radical initiation or its preceding steps, namely, (1) formation of a covalent X&#8722;I (X=C, N, S, Se) bond, which subsequently participates in a radical reaction; (2) formation of a noncovalent N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I bond, which assists the homolysis of the I&#8722;I bond; (3) formation of the key iodine radicals by visible&#8208;light or heat induced homolysis of I2 or by electrochemical oxidation of iodide; (4) iodine induced peroxide decomposition via single electron transfer (SET) mechanism to generate alkoxy or alkyl peroxy radicals. We hope this review will provide readers with a comprehensive update on the iodine&#8208;mediated radical reactions, thereby further inspiring more exciting advances in this emerging field.

Abstract
We describe a novel cobalt/salicyloxazoline (Salox) catalytic system for enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization, enabling the synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic and axially chiral cyclic phosphinic amides. Chiral Salox ligands, conveniently prepared in a single step from salicylonitriles and chiral amino alcohols, facilitated this transformation with excellent enantioselectivities (92&#8208;99% ee) and moderate to good yields (31 examples, 45&#8211;89%). Mechanistic studies implicate a cobalt (III/IV/II) catalytic cycle in the C&#8722;H annulation process, providing valuable insights into the stereoselective reaction pathway.

         <dc:description>A facile one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component cascade cyclization has been developed for synthesis of 2&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;2&#8208;ol dihydropyrroles and 4&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;4&#8208;ol dihydropyrroles from various substituted amines, 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoropropan&#8208;2&#8208;one, and substituted &#946;&#8208;oxoamides using K&#8322;CO&#8323; as an additive. This K&#8322;CO&#8323;&#8208;promoted method offers a simple and efficient approach for achieving highly regioselective products through cascade bond formation and cyclization. Post functionalization of resulting products into various valuable trifluoromethylated heterocycles including triazoles, isoxazoles, Mannich bases and the products from Sonogashira coupling reactions has also been reported. Additionally, a straightforward and scalable protocol for synthesis of 4&#8208;trifluoromethylpyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxamide derivatives without K&#8322;CO&#8323;, utilizing diverse 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds has been established. This method demonstrates broad substrate compatibility, efficient tolerance towards a wide range of functional groups, making it a versatile strategy for accessing highly substituted trifluoromethylated pyrroles.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indole derivatives are widely present in bioactive alkaloids and pharmaceuticals, with pyrroloindolones, containing a &#947;&#8208;lactam fused to an indole scaffold, forming a significant class of heteroaromatic compounds due to their presence in numerous natural products and biologically active molecules. In this study, we explored the potential of indole&#8208;derived hydrazones as 1,2&#8208;dinucleophiles in the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed formal [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition with &#945;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. A broad substrate scope was investigated, revealing the versatility of the method with various aldehydes and hydrazones.

         <title>CuF2&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;N Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Silanes: Expanding the Scope of Chan&#8208;Lam Type Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8211;Lam type N&#8208;arylation of various amides, sulfonamides, urea, azoles, and amines has been demonstrated using a CuF2/DMSO catalytic system with structurally diverse aryl(trimethoxy)silanes under base and ligand&#8208;free conditions. This approach facilitates effective C&#8208;N cross&#8208;coupling with user&#8208;friendly organosilicon reagents without requiring an external fluoride source. CuF2 serves a dual function as both a catalyst and a desilylating agent, facilitating the cleavage of the aryl&#8208;silane 	bond. The process is compatible with a broad range of substrates, ensuring high efficiency and excellent functional group compatibility. Moreover, this protocol is proven to be valuable for late&#8208;stage modification of amide and sulfonamide&#8208;containing drug molecules, as well as for synthesizing agrochemicals.

         <title>Effective and Practical Stereoselective Synthesis of Nutlins Precursors by Immobilization of Privileged Chiral Mono&#8208;Amidine Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A strategy for the immobilization of Johnston's Mono(AMidine) catalyst (MAM) onto polystyrene, silica and hybrid silica&#8208;polystyrene nanoparticles is presented. The catalyst activity was evaluated in the stereoselective aza&#8208;Henry reaction leading to the pivotal &#946;&#8208;amino nitroalkane precursors of the anti&#8208;cancer agents Nutlins (with Nutlin&#8208;3a as the most active drug). The effect of the support and the linker on the catalytic performance was investigated, observing an interesting match/mismatch effect when using a chiral linker. The polystyrene&#8208;supported 3&#8208;pyrrolidinol&#8208;linked PS&#8208;(S)&#8208;Pyr&#8208;MAM organocatalyst showed the best activity among the tested catalysts, behaving very similarly to the homogeneous counterpart in the synthesis of a library of Nutlins precursors: yield up to 95%, ee up to 99%, and dr up to &gt;99:1. The catalyst recyclability was also assessed through simple filtration, yielding a satisfactory 93% ee after 5 cycles, showing only a moderate decrease in conversion efficiency (ca. 5% after each cycle), which resulted in an accumulated turnover number (TON) of 69.7.

         <title>Second&#8208;Generation One&#8208;Pot Enantioselective Heck&#8208;Matsuda Arylations of Unactivated Olefins Directly from Anilines and Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A highly improved second generation of the one&#8208;pot enantioselective Heck&#8208;Matsuda reaction directly from anilines and nitroarenes is reported. This practical arylation method, featuring 56 examples, relies on the in&#8197;situ diazotization of anilines and 3&#8208;aminothiophenes, or from the in&#8197;situ reduction&#8208;diazotization of nitrobenzene derivatives. The in&#8197;situ diazotization of the aniline, directly or from the in&#8208;situ reduction of the nitroarene, synchronizes smoothly with the enantioselective Heck&#8208;Matsuda reaction under mildly acidic conditions, bypassing the synthesis and handling of some unstable and/or difficult&#8208;to&#8208;prepare arenediazonium salts. The protocol was applied to the desymmetrization of unactivated olefins leading to the synthesis of functionalized spirocyclopentenyl hydantoins, aryl cyclopentenes, and &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones, in high yields (up to 99%) and er (up to 99:1). The efficiency of the method is showcased by the formal total synthesis of the bioactive compound VPC01091, a potential drug candidate for multiple sclerosis treatment at the gram scale in excellent yield (94%), in 97:3 er and 20&gt;1 dr.

Abstract
A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bond activation reaction of aryl oximes and CF3&#8208;substituted imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides (TFISYs) has been described, producing a wide variety of N&#8208;(2&#8208;cyanoaryl)&#8208;3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)isoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;imines in moderate to excellent yields. The transformation might involve a consecutive C(sp2)&#8211;H bond activation, intramolecular spiro&#8208;cyclization, C&#8722;C bond activation and N&#8722;O bond cleavage sequence. This developed protocol provides a direct entry to diverse trifluoromethyl and nitrile&#8208;containing heterocycles with the generation of water and dimethyl sulfoxide as by&#8208;products.

Abstract
The electrochemical catalyst&#8208;free generation of carbon radicals bearing three electron&#8208;withdrawing groups from the corresponding C&#8722;H nucleophiles remains unexplored. To this end, we report a direct electro&#8208;oxidation strategy to access these electrophilic carbon radicals under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. Enabled by this strategy, the radical 1,2&#8208;alkylarylations of allylic alcohols was realized, affording &#946;&#8208;quaternary ketones with high functional group compatibility. This protocol is operationally simple and also easy to scale up.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Analysis of Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Semihydrogenations of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes has historically been an essential technique in organic chemistry. In this context, researchers often employ transition metal complexes to achieve this conversion. Given the pronounced polarization of results, often yielding either very high or very low values, it remains challenging to discern the factors influencing reactivity and selectivity in many cases. In this work, we combine different sub&#8208;disciplines of digital chemistry with experimental outcomes to rationalize the results of a model Ni&#8208;catalyzed semihydrogenation that leads to E&#8208;alkenes. First, we analyze the main factors behind successful reactions using a machine learning classification model. The descriptors are computed directly from the SMILES strings of the reacting alkynes using an automated protocol that relies on structural features, molecular mechanics, and semi&#8208;empirical techniques. This workflow requires minimal human intervention and provides a fast and effective approach. Next, we couple the same descriptors with activation barriers calculated with density functional theory, generating a regression model that explains reactivity based on the properties of the alkyne substrates. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of using a combination of digital chemistry techniques to uncover reaction trends in Ni&#8208;catalyzed semihydrogenations of alkynes, an area where human intuition proves limited in application.

Abstract
Replacing hydrogen with deuterium raises the activation energy for C&#8722;D bond cleavage. This approach has gained attention in drug design, especially to protect the ortho&#8208;position of pyridines, which are susceptible to enzymatic oxidation. Until now, direct hydrogen isotope exchange has been largely restricted to the use of reactive organolithium reagents or metal&#8208;catalysed deuteration methods. In this work, we present a metal&#8208;free, selective ortho&#8208;deuteration of N&#8208;heterocycles starting from their N&#8208;oxides, proceeding at room temperature in just 5 minutes. This method achieves high deuterium incorporation across a broad range of N&#8208;heterocycles, including bioactive compounds. Experimental and computational studies have elucidated the mechanism of the reaction, showing that regioselectivity is driven by a successful increase in acidity at the ortho&#8208;position, enabling deprotonation by the in&#8208;situ generated dimsyl anion.

         <title>Biomimetic Orthogonal Removal of Arylacyl Protecting Groups from the C&#8208;Terminus of Substituted Amino Acids and Oligopeptides via Flavin N(5)&#8208;iminium Covalent Adducts</title>

Abstract
Flavin co&#8208;factors and other flavin derivatives are traditionally associated with one&#8208; or two&#8208;electron redox reactions. Flavins also form covalent intermediates with a variety of substrates. While extensive attention has focused on reactions at the C(4a) position of the flavin ring, recent interest has shifted toward the dynamic potential of the N(5) atom. In our study, we demonstrate the formation of artificial flavin N(5)&#8208;iminium covalent adducts via nucleophilic attack by enolates derived from arylacyl esters at the flavin N(5) position. This interaction mimics the biosynthesis of ether phospholipids catalysed by alkyl&#8208;dihydroxyacetone phosphate synthase via an N(5)&#8208;FAD iminium adduct formation and fatty acid release. Accordingly, we developed a method for the selective removal of phenacyl and 2&#8208;naphthylacetyl protecting groups from the C&#8208;terminus of &#945;&#8208;amino acids and di&#8208; and tripeptides using biomimetic flavin organocatalysis. Although many approaches are currently available for protection of C&#8208;terminus of peptides, their removal often requires harsh conditions, which cause racemization and the loss of optical purity, together with other side reactions. Our method is versatile, mild, orthogonal to most functional and protecting groups and maintains optical purity of &#945;&#8208;amino acids. From general point of view, the method signifies the groundbreaking application of the non&#8208;canonical reactivity of flavins in organic synthesis.

Abstract
Gem&#8208;difluoroethylene moiety holds pivotal roles in drug research owing to its unique ability as a bioisostere of the carbonyl group. Here, magnesium&#8208;mediated reductive defluorinative cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrene with carbon&#8208;centered electrophiles was developed. This method featured readily accessible reagents, mild conditions, and wide substrate scope, enabling the efficient production of gem&#8208;difluoroallyl carboxylic acid and ketones. The establishment of this protocol will offer a general alternative for the acquisition of gem&#8208;difluoroethylene compounds.

Abstract
A functionalized heterogeneous Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Cu&#8208;2D&#8208;MOF) was synthesized through the reaction of Cu(NO3)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O with 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoroterephthalic acid and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine. The synthesized material underwent comprehensive characterization using various techniques, including FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy, N2 physical adsorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Subsequently, the catalytic performance of Cu&#8208;2D&#8208;MOFs was assessed in the hydrophosphorylation and aerobic oxidative dehydrogenative coupling reactions involving alkynes and P&#8722;H bonds. The catalyst demonstrated remarkable catalytic activity in both transformations, effectively yielding a wide variety of (E)&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;phosphoryl and alkynyl&#8208;phosphoryl compounds, respectively. Notably, the incorporation of this MOF material facilitated the phosphorylation reaction to proceed seamlessly, eliminating the necessity for supplementary small molecular organic ligands. Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrated ease of recovery and recyclability through a simple recovery process. Employing a systematic approach of sequential control experiments, we have delineated the potential transformation pathway of the reaction and consequently hypothesized a probable reaction mechanism for the observed transformation.

Abstract
This article presents a method for asymmetric formal cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of benzylic alcohols with ketones through combined electrooxidation and organocatalysis. Employing inexpensive and environmentally friendly proline as a chiral organocatalyst, various benzylic alcohols and simple ketones serve as substrates to directly obtain diverse chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxycarbonyl compounds with moderate to good yields (up to 85%) and excellent stereoselectivity (up to 99% ee and 99:1&#8197;dr). The reaction proceeds under mild conditions at room temperature in air, without oxidants or additives, demonstrating robust functional group tolerance and atom efficiency. Hydrogen gas released at the cathode is the sole byproduct. Using L&#8208; or D&#8208;proline allows straightforward access to both chiral configurations of &#946;&#8208;hydroxycarbonyl compounds.

Abstract
Functionalized pyridines and 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines are crucial organic entities in natural products, organic materials, drugs and catalysts. Despite progress, a facile and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis remains desirable so far. In this context, we disclose a novel visible light&#8208;promoted radical cascade sulfonylation&#8208;cyclization&#8208;aromatization of N&#8208;propargyl enamides with selenosulfonates. This approach avoids the use of metal&#8208; or photocatalyst, bases and external oxidants, marking a significant advance in sustainable and green chemistry accords. Utilizing this protocol, we successfully synthesized a diverse range of sulfonated 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines and pyridines, featuring good functional group compatibility, simple operation and mild condition.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced 3&#8208;Alkylation of Coumarins with Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A method for the direct 3&#8208;alkylation of coumarins utilizing alkyl halides as the alkylating agents has been achieved. This versatile reaction is compatible with a range of alkyl halides, including activated alkyl bromides, perfluoroalkyl iodides, and unactivated alkyl iodides. We propose a mechanism involving photoinduced electron transfer between alkyl halides and coumarins in the first singlet excited (S1) state, which generates alkyl radicals essential for the 3&#8208;alkylation process.

         <title>Scalable Electrochemical Dehalogenative Carboxylation without a Sacrificial Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A scalable electrochemical procedure for the synthesis of carboxylic acids from organic halides has been developed using a spinning cylinder electrode electrochemical reactor. The electrochemical process is based on the reductive dehalogenation of the starting material followed by trapping of the resulting carbanion with CO2. The protocol is compatible both with organic chlorides and bromides and uses inexpensive graphite and stainless steel as electrode materials. As sacrificial metal anodes are avoided, the method can be readily scaled up in flow mode. The procedure is compatible with a wide range of substrates (24 examples), including aryl and alkyl halides as well as heterocyclic compounds. Multigram scale preparations in flow mode have been demonstrated by processing 600&#8197;mL of reaction mixture in an electrolyte recirculation setup.

         <title>&#947;&#8208;Terpinene: Biorenewable Reductant for the Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Reduction of Sulfoxides, N&#8208;Oxides and Nitroarenes</title>

Abstract
A molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenation of sulfoxides, pyridine and quinoline N&#8208;oxides, N&#8208;hydroxybenzotriazoles, as well as the reduction of nitroarenes to anilines, has been developed using monocyclic terpenes such as &#947;&#8208;terpinene as an environmentally benign hydrogen surrogate. The only byproducts generated are water and p&#8208;cymene, under neat reaction conditions in which the terpene acts as both solvent and reducing agent. These features make this approach a highly attractive and sustainable alternative for the reduction of S&#8208;O and N&#8208;O containing compounds. Additionally, the reaction exhibited excellent chemoselectivity, tolerating a wide variety of functional groups.

         <title>NFSI&#8208;TEMPO Catalysed Stereoselective Synthesis of 2&#8208;Deoxyglycosides from Glycals</title>

Abstract
2&#8208;deoxyglycosides are prominent constituents of diverse naturally occurring glycans and are known to participate in crucial biological pathways. We herein demonstrate NFSI&#8208;TEMPO as an efficient organocatalyst for the formation of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glycosides from glycals. For the first time a catalytic behaviour of NFSI&#8208;TEMPO combination has been observed. The reaction conditions have been found suitable for the generation of glycosides from commercial alcohols, amino acid, sterol, phenols and monosaccharide derived alcohols. Broad range of protecting groups on both glycal and glycosyl acceptors as well as alcohols of varied reactivity were found to be compatible for the generation of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glycosides in moderate to good yields. The synthetic potential of the newly established transformation was illustrated by application in trisaccharide synthesis and gram&#8208;scale reaction.

Abstract
A base&#8208;mediated one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step, four&#8208;component reaction has been developed to synthesize imidazole&#8208;4(2H)&#8208;ones, utilizing commercially available amino acid esters, aldehydes, alkynes, and amino alcohols. Control experiments and isolation of the intermediate revealed the mechanistic details. This four&#8208;component reaction proceeds via imine formation, followed by the nucleophilic addition of alkyne to form a propargylamine precursor. Subsequently, the propargylamine precursor under undergoes base&#8208;mediated conversion into 1&#8208;azadiene, followed by in situ ketene formation to generate (allylideneamino)prop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;one. The nucleophilic addition of amino alcohol and subsequent intramolecular cyclization provides imidazole&#8208;4 (2H)&#8208;ones exclusively.

         <title>Imidazolium&#8208;Dithiocarboxylate Zwitterions Catalysed Ring&#8208;Opening Additions of Cyclopropenones</title>

Abstract
Imidazolium&#8208;dithiocarboxylate zwitterions (NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2), a novel organocatalyst that derived from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC), was used to activate cyclopropenones. Under the catalysis of 10&#8197;mol% NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2, a range of phenols, alcohols, primary and secondary amines react with cyclopropenones to produce trisubstituted &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters and amides in 46&#8211;95% yield. More than 68 products, including 7 natural product derivatives have been synthesized through this method. Mechanism study showed NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2 act as a Lewis base to activate the C=C double bond of cyclopropenones and trigger the ring&#8208;opening reaction. HRMS analysis indicated the formation of the key adduct of NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2 and cyclopropenone. More importantly, this study demonstrated completely different catalytic activity of NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2 and NHC catalysts, the latter one cannot catalyse these reactions.

         <title>Au(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Hydroarylation of Allenes for the Synthesis of Tetrahydrodiazepines or Tetrahydrodiazonines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Allenes tethered to pyrroles undergo Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation leading to tetrahydrodiazepines or tetrahydrodiazonines. The regioselectivity of the reaction is governed by both the substitution pattern of the allene and the nature of the Au(I) ligand. Hence, alkyl&#8208;gem&#8208;disubstituted allenes preferentially lead to tetrahydrodiazepines via 7&#8208;exo&#8208;cyclizations, while aryl&#8208;substituted allenes preferentially lead to tetrahydrodiazonines via 9&#8208;endo&#8208;cyclization when a phosphite ligand is used. Enantioselective reactions have been developed with the SEGPHOS chiral ligand, leading to chiral heterocycles with high enantioselectivity (up to 96% ee). In addition, DFT calculations have streamlined the regioselectivity (7&#8208;exo vs 9&#8208;endo) of these gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations.

Abstract
A chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of axially chiral alkenes was developed via an enantioselective and para&#8208;selective Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction between phenols and 1&#8208;alkynylnaphth&#8208;2&#8208;ols. This methodology features an efficient hydroarylation with high functional group tolerance, complete para&#8208;selectivity, excellent yields (up to 99%), and enantioselectivities (up to 94% ee) in the presence of a N&#8208;triflylphosphoramide catalyst. DFT calculations were performed to investigate para&#8208;selectivity and results indicate that both kinetics and thermodynamics parameters are more favorable compared to ortho&#8208;selectivity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chiral Br&#248;nsted acid-catalyzed synthesis of axially chiral alkenes was developed via an enantioselective and &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-selective Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction between phenols and 1-alkynylnaphth-2-ols. This methodology features an efficient hydroarylation with high functional group tolerance, complete &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity, excellent yields (up to 99%), and enantioselectivities (up to 94% ee) in the presence of a &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-triflylphosphoramide catalyst. DFT calculations were performed to investigate &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity and results indicate that both kinetics and thermodynamics parameters are more favorable compared to &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling Catalyst Speciation to Achieve Room Temperature Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Aminations with Aryl and Heteroaryl Chlorides</title>

Abstract
The amination of aryl halides with palladium catalysts (Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination) is a widely used transformation in synthetic and drug discovery chemistry. In this report, we demonstrate that a monometallic 2&#8208;phosphinoimidazole Pd catalyst exhibits comparable or enhanced reactivity when compared to all ligands screened for room temperature amination of aryl chlorides with secondary amines. The di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine derivative showed extremely high reactivity while the di&#8208;isopropyl variant led to almost complete loss of catalytic activity. Computational and experimental mechanistic and kinetic studies indicate that a monometallic Pd structure rather than a bimetallic Pd structure is key to fast catalysis. The di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine ligand has fast catalysis because it thermodynamically disfavors the formation of a much less active bimetallic Pd complex. A wide substrate scope is demonstrated for the arylation of secondary amines with aryl chlorides using our new catalyst system.

         <title>Alkylation of Imines with Alkyl Halides under Electrochemical Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An electrochemical protocol for the alkylation of imines was developed by using easily available alkyl halides as the alkyl sources, graphite felt (GF) as anode and zinc plate as cathode. Various substituted imines, alkyl bromides and alkyl iodides were suitable for this reaction and a series of &#945;&#8208;branched amines were obtained in moderate to good yields. This method provides a green way for the addition of imines to avoid the need for metal reagents, chemical oxidants and reductants, which makes it has a good application prospect in drug synthesis.

         <title>Organic Photoredox Catalytic Sulfonylation of Enaminones to Access 3&#8208;Sulfonyl Chromones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we disclose a readily available phenothiazine derivative as an oxidizing organic photocatalyst, that serves to induce radical cascade sulfonylation/cyclization reaction of enaminones. A variety of 3&#8208;sulfonyl chromones have been obtained with moderate to excellent yields. This catalytic platform proceeds under metal&#8208;free conditions with a wide substrate scope and broad functional group compatibility, which unlocks the new reactivity of phenothiazine derivatives and adds significant synthetic values to O&#8208;heterocycles.

         <title>Photoinduced Catalytic Alkylation of Active Methine Compounds with Nonactivated Alkenes Using Yttrium Triflate as a Lewis Acid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Photoinduced catalytic alkylation reactions of active methine compounds with nonactivated alkenes have been developed using an organophotocatalyst, a metal Lewis acid, an arylthiol, and an amine base catalyst system. The alkylation reactions proceeded smoothly under ambient conditions with blue light irradiation, affording the desired products bearing quaternary carbon centers in high yields. Furthermore, enantioselective alkylation with an nonactivated alkene was achieved using a chiral Lewis acid.

Abstract
The synthesis of architecturally complex polyheterocyclic structures embedding the indole ring represents a growing field of interest. Carbolines and their partially dehydro derivatives, pyrazinoindoles, indoloindoles, azepinoindoles and other medium&#8208;sized derivatives are only some examples of indole&#8208;containing polycyclic compounds featured by enhanced pharmacological and photophysical properties. Among various synthetic protocols to prepare these important target compounds those based on the utilization of 2&#8208;aminoindoles and 2&#8208;iminoindolines are gaining increasing interest because of the ease of their preparation. The presence of a couple of reactive sites in these derivatives is instrumental for the assembling of polyheterocyclic structures exploiting single step operations featured by efficient cascade or tandem processes. Several of these methods employ catalyzed reactions which can be developed for the asymmetric synthesis of enantiopure compounds. This review provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date report on the currently available methods for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aminoindoles and 2&#8208;iminoindolines and their application to the preparation of polyheterocyclic derivatives.

         <title>Preparation of Mesoporous Cu2O Nanospheres for Green Synthesis in the Enantioselective Boron Conjugate Addition of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Chiral Compounds in Aqueous Phase</title>

Abstract
Chiral organoboron compounds are essential intermediates in various significant reactions. However, there are still few efficient catalysts for their synthesis. This paper reports a novel catalytic material for chiral asymmetric boron conjugate addition reactions: mesoporous Cu2O nanospheres (M&#8722;Cu2O). M&#8722;Cu2O is approximately 0.55&#8197;&#956;m, exhibiting dense and uniformly distributed worm&#8208;like pores. It features a specific surface area of 15.7&#8197;m2/g and an average pore size of 14.3&#8197;nm. Under the conditions of Toluene:H2O=9:1, with a chiral ligand amount of 3.6&#8197;mol% and no additional base, it achieves a high yield (98% yield) and impressive enantioselectivity (99% ee) for the template substrate chalcone using only 3.0&#8197;mol% of the catalyst. Notably, the catalyst can be easily recovered and maintains robust catalytic performance after seven cycles, yielding 92% and an ee value of 90%. This work presents a mild and effective method for synthesizing chiral boron compounds in an aqueous phase, significantly enhancing the application potential of mesoporous copper oxide nanospheres.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Carbonylation/Coupling Reaction Using Anode to Oxidize the Trasition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyst and Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reported an electrochemical oxidative carbonylation of N&#8208;phenylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amine derivatives under mild condtions without an external oxidant. Our approach demonstrated a novel electrochemical oxidative carbonylation reaction mode in which the simultaneous reaction of catalyst and substrate with the anode has been developed. Furthermore, an electrochemical C&#8208;H activation for the synthesis of cyclized pyridinium ion has also been realized. Mechanistic investigations suggested that the process involved a &#8220;PdII/PdIII/PdI/PdII&#8221; catalytic cycle, and H2 was generated at the cathode.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative and Deconstructive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Acrylic Acids with Ketone&#8208;Derived Dihydroquinazolinones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Herein, an iron&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the aromatization&#8208;driven deconstruction and decarboxylation of ketone&#8208;derived dihydroquinazolinones in reaction with unsaturated carboxylic acids is reported. A diverse range of fluoroacrylic acids and cinnamic acids reacted effectively with dihydroquinazolinones, yielding essential monofluoroalkenes and alkenes with excellent stereoselectivity. Additionally, spiro&#8208;dihydroquinazolinones served as suitable substrates, facilitating the synthesis of valuable quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones featuring alkene motifs. This protocol is notable for its operational simplicity and versatility, enabling the chemical diversification of active molecules.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Cascade Synthesis of 5&#8208;Alkylidene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;Lactams via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Hydro&#8208;Oxycarbonylation</title>

Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrofunctionalization of alkynes and, more precisely, the intramolecular hydro&#8208;oxycarbonylation (cycloisomerization) of acetylenic acids, has been widely employed as a key step in cascade processes for the construction of valuable and complex molecules. However, in contrast with other aminonucleophiles, no method has been reported for the reaction between primary monoamines and non&#8208;activated alkynoic acids. Hence, a procedure has been devised for the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective preparation of 5&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams via a copper&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction between alkynoic acids and amines. The developed protocol proves to be scalable and demonstrates significant tolerance to a wide range of structurally diverse alkynoic acids and amines bearing various functional groups, as evidenced by 60 high&#8208;yielding examples. An exhaustive experimental and computational analysis of the reaction is also provided to unravel the nature and role of the copper catalyst, the observed regioselectivity and the mechanism of the reaction.

         <title>Divergent Hydroelementation of Unsaturated C&#8722;C Bonds Using 3d Transition Metal Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Divergent hydroelementation reactions offer a cost&#8208;effective synthetic protocol to prepare two or more products starting from same set of reactant molecules by altering one or more reaction parameters. This strategy is quite helpful in functionalizing unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds into several value&#8208;added chemical compounds by using various organic and metal&#8208;based catalysts. In this regard, catalysts derived from 3d metals have come to the fore, providing an alternative to heavier transition metals and rare&#8208;earth elements. In this review, we summarize and elucidate the recent developments of divergent hydroelementation of alkenes and alkynes using the first&#8208;row transition metal complexes by categorizing them into three classes: (1) Catalyst and ligand&#8208;controlled; (2) Reaction component&#8208;controlled and (3) Substrate&#8208;controlled. Given the importance of hydroelementation reactions, we hope this review will be helpful to the organic chemistry community.

         <title>Multifunctionalization of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Boranes by a Single Metal&#8208;free Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Selective access to densely functionalized boranes, with identical or distinct functional groups at the boron center, has great potentials in materials science, organic synthesis and drug discovery. However, assembling multifunctional boranes was heavily dependent on hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (HAT) at high temperatures, hazardous radical initiators, metal photocatalysts and HAT reagents, respectively. Simultaneously, competitive side reactions such as polymerizations and regioisomers formation remain highly challenging. Herein, a programmable multifunctionalization of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) boranes is developed for the first time powered by a single, metal&#8208;free photocatalyst, in which boryl radicals from sequential substituted boranes are generated instead of polymerizations. This robust and versatile catalytic system leads to an extremely broad variety of boranes incorporated with diverse alkyl or alkenyl groups in high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities.

         <title>Enzymatic Asymmetric Synthesis of All Stereoisomers of Aliphatic, Vicinal Diols in Conventional and Non&#8208;Conventional Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Chiral, vicinal diols are of high interest for academic research and industrial applications. For synthesizing chiral diols, enzymes are important catalysts due to their high selectivity and ability to work under tolerable temperature and no pressure. In this study, two consecutive enzyme&#8208;catalyzed steps were used for the asymmetric synthesis of aliphatic, vicinal diols with high product concentrations and chiral purity. The reaction comprised a ligation step employing lyases and a subsequent reduction step using oxidoreductases. Either in an aqueous buffer or an organic solvent, the potentially biobased aldehydes acetaldehyde, propanal, butanal, and pentanal were used as substrates. Here, all possible stereoisomers of 2,3&#8208;butanediol, 3,4&#8208;hexanediol, 4,5&#8208;octanediol, and 5,6&#8208;decanediol were produced with isomeric content values between 72% and &gt;99%, and concentrations between 4.1 and 115&#8197;mM. This work shows how four symmetric, chiral, vicinal diols can be synthesized by combining enzymes in a modular way, including exemplarily scaling.

Abstract
An I2/cumene hydroperoxide (CHP)&#8208;mediated tandem cyclization of 2&#8208;aminoaryl ketone oximes with isocyanides has been developed. Various 2&#8208;aminoquinazolines were obtained in 49&#8211;96% yields under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, and the resulting 4&#8208;phenylquinazolin&#8208;2&#8208;amines show typical fluorescent emission properties. The key to the success of this strategy involves the formation of iminyl radical via the N&#8722;O bond cleavage of hydroxy oxime.

Abstract
Phosphorus Fluoride Exchange (PFEx) is a new click chemistry technology that hinges on the creation of innovative hubs to unlock its potential and broaden its applications. In this study, we outline some guiding principles for PFEx hub development and validate these principles by developing a new hub, 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyclotriphosphazenes (SACPs). These SACPs serve as versatile PFEx hubs with stable functionality and orthogonal reactivity, exemplifying their utility within the Diversity Oriented Clicking (DOC) framework. We demonstrate that SACPs interact with various 1,3&#8208;dipoles, enabling the synthesis of phosphorus&#8208;rich compounds through sequential cycloaddition and PFEx reactions, thus pioneering new synthetic routes for wide application of click chemistry.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Engineering of Oleate Hydratase for the Synthesis of Small Chiral Alcohols without Decoy Molecule</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Small and chiral secondary alcohols are sought&#8208;after compounds that are frequently used in the synthesis of biologically active compounds. However, their stereochemically correct synthesis remains a challenge for the chemical industry. Synthetic routes are restrained by multiple steps and thus low atom efficiency. Here we employ engineered variants from the oleate hydratase from E. meningoseptica to produce chiral C5&#8208;C8 secondary alcohols within a single step. First, we established a two&#8208;phase system (2&#8208;PS) to trap the volatile substrates/products which facilitated semi&#8208;rational mutagenesis in the active site and tunnel of the enzyme. These efforts led to variants with an up to 20&#8208;fold increase in catalytic activity and &gt;99% ee, notably, without the use of a decoy molecule. Computational analysis indicated structural changes in the tunnel radius, ligand transport and energy profiles, which gave us hints to explain the enhanced performance of the variants. Interestingly, scaling up the reaction volume demonstrated significant increases in product concentrations, leading up to a 100&#8208;fold increase in comparison to the current benchmark. This new 2&#8208;PS and the engineered enzyme variants offer a promising approach for a scalable, asymmetric hydration of small unactivated alkenes, which would drastically ease the access to chiral alcohol&#8208;based pheromones or drugs.

         <title>Organophotocatalytic Site&#8208;Selective Radical Deuteration at Sterically Hindered Benzylic Positions by Consecutive Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond activation or exchange labeling with hydrogen isotope are of vital importance, in particular for high&#8208;specific&#8208;selectivity deuteration of pharmaceuticals. While catalytic approaches relying on closed&#8208;shell manifolds have been well documented for efficient delivery of deuterium at sterically less hindered benzylic positions, complementary strategies target sterically bulky benzylic positions remain a long&#8208;standing challenge. We herein disclose a mild, versatile approach to achieve efficient and selective radical deuteration by merging organophotoredox catalysis and bromine radical catalysis. This open&#8208;shell strategy provides the unparalleled ability of the convergent unification of readily available quinoxalinones and para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) and D2O through a simultaneous highly cross&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and chem&#8208;selective radical coupling&#8208;H/D exchange approach. Furthermore, the long&#8208;standing challenge of the incorporation of deuterium to sterically bulky benzylic positions has been addressed through this approach.

         <title>Photoredox Hydroacylative Dearomatization of Indoles with Aromatic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein we reported for the first time a photocatalytic dearomative hydroacylation reaction of electron&#8208;deficient indoles with readily available aromatic acids through a phosphoranyl radical&#8208;assisted deoxygenative process. A range of racemic and optically active 2&#8208;acylindoline derivatives were obtained in good yields (up to 94%) with good diastereoselectivity. The synthetic robustness is highlighted by the enantioselective dearomatization of indoles and the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and pharmaceutical molecules. This protocol features broad substrate scope and mild reaction conditions, providing a reliable entry to developing deoxygenative strategies in dearomatization reactions. Preliminary mechanistic studies and DFT calculations suggest that a Giese&#8208;type radical addition pathway should be involved.

         <title>Disclosing the Intra&#8208;Catalyst Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in Tetrahydropyran&#8208;Based Dipeptidic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Herein, we describe how minor structural modifications to our bifunctional organocatalysts based on sugar amino acids (SAAs) can alter the network of non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) within the catalyst, leading to significant changes in their catalytic activity. This is attributed to the intra&#8208;catalyst NCIs, which induce conformational changes that are reflected in the transition state of the rate&#8208;determining step of the Michael addition of aldehydes to trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes. Through kinetic experiments, conformational analysis, and DFT calculations, we found that the presence of a methoxy group at the C4 position of the tetrahydropyran ring reduces the catalytic activity by a factor of five compared to the catalyst without the methoxy group. Additionally, we have identified the different intra&#8208;catalyst NCIs, both attractive and repulsive, that drive the conformational changes, ultimately modifying the energy levels of the transition states of the rate&#8208; and enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step of the reaction.

Abstract
The reaction of alkenyl boronates and bromodifluoroacetates in the presence of copper powder and TMEDA as the catalytic system was developed. The corresponding C&#8722;C coupling products were obtained in 35&#8211;93% yield. The method tolerated a variety of functional groups, namely, phenol, (thio)ether, protected amino&#8208;, hydroxy&#8208;, ketone, and carboxylic acid moieties, as well as various saturated carbo&#8208; and heterocycles, and was compatible with multigram scale&#8208;up (to 76&#8197;g). The diastereoselectivity of the process was typically low so that ca. 1:1 E/Z isomeric mixtures were formed from pure E or Z alkenyl boronates. Further functional group transformations demonstrated the utility of the prepared compounds as valuable building blocks for synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Based on the obtained results and the literature data, a plausible reaction mechanism was proposed involving the formation of radical and organocopper intermediates.

         <title>Selective Synthesis of 2&#8208;(Indol&#8208;3&#8208;Yl)Phenols via Iodine&#8208;Catalyzed C3&#8208;Arylation of Indoles with Cyclohexanones</title>

Abstract
An iodine&#8208;catalyzed C3&#8208;arylation of indoles with cyclohexanones to selectively synthesize 2&#8208;(indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenols has been described. Mechanism studies indicate that the oxygen atom in 2&#8208;(indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenols is originally from DMSO. This cascade involving dehydration condensation, selective oxygenation, dehydrogenation, and aromatization was achieved in one pot under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Raney Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Deuterium Labeling of Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Heterocycles and Pharmaceuticals under Continuous Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deuterium&#8208;labeled compounds play a pivotal role in physical organic chemistry, life sciences, and materials science. This has resulted in a surge of interest in deuterium&#8208;labeled active pharmaceutical ingredients in recent years. In this study, we present a continuous flow Raney nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange process that boasts compatibility with a wide spectrum of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles and pharmaceutical compounds. The broad applicability of the developed method was demonstrated through successful labeling of various purine bases, imidazoles, pyridines, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including complex structures like abacavir and remdesivir. Control experiments revealed Raney nickel's crucial role in the exchange process, showcasing the superiority of the continuous flow approach over batch reactions. Furthermore, a scaled&#8208;up experiment demonstrated the robustness of the catalyst.</dc:description>
