         <title>Intermolecular Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Nitrene Transfer Employing Aryl Azides: An Access to 7&#8208;Functionalized 2&#8209;Aminoindoles
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on intermolecular gold&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer, utilizing o&#8208;functionalized aryl azides as nitrene transfer reagents. This catalytic reaction provides a modular route to 7&#8208;functionalized 2&#8208;aminoindoles. Due to the optimized reaction conditions (toluene, 80&#8211;100 &#176;&#1057;), a variety of functional substituents proved compatible (36 examples; yields up to 98%). The reaction can be performed using both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic variants with a low catalyst loading (1 mol %). The synthetic potential of the obtained products was illustrated by post&#8208;modifications of the indole backbone and peripheral substituents. A plausible reaction mechanism includes the generation of intermediate &#945;&#8208;imino carbenes directly from the o&#8208;functionalized aryl azides or other nitrene sources, such as anthranils or benzofuroxans, which form during the reaction in the cases of the specific aryls.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper and Photocatalytic Synergistic Strategies for Radical Cyclization Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The rapid development of photo&#8208;synergistic transition metal catalytic systems has provided a green paradigm to complement thermal transition metal catalytic methods. However, the most commonly used iridium or ruthenium complexes involve expensive in nature, in contrast to the abundant copper elements in the earth's crust, which are highly valued for their unique electronic structure and light&#8208;absorbing properties. Recently, the application of copper and photocatalytic synergistic strategies in radical cyclization reactions has progressed considerably, leading to a renaissance in the synthesis of functional natural products, drugs and their analogues, but summary work addressing this aspect has not been reported. In this review, we briefly analyze the effect of ligand choice on copper complexes and some inorganic copper salts and even on light sources. We then summarize the copper and photocatalytic synergistic strategies in radical cyclization reactions and classify them into three categories, C, N and O radicals, according to the class of the central atom of the radical in each work, and in each category will be elaborated in turn from coordination cyclization via Cu catalysts, direct radical cyclization and other cyclization mode. For individual more complex reactions, the mechanisms are explored and briefly discussed.

         <title>Recent Developments in Selenylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Alkynes are simple yet important organic feedstocks. The selenylation of alkynes is able to produce complex selenium&#8208;containing compounds in a facile way. Although there are some reviews about the selenylation of alkynes, most of them focus on one specific reaction or what types of products that can be obtained. There is a lack of attention given to the various uses of different selenium reagents and their mechanisms. This review mainly focuses on recent advances (2013&#8211;2023) based on diverse selenium reagents. Mechanisms and how the added reagents work will be discussed. Different reaction types, including difunctionalization, Se&#8208;annulation, spiro&#8208;cyclization, C&#8722;Se coupling, click reaction will be recorded in this review. The regioselectivity can be achieved through various mechanisms, including radicals, seleniraniums or electrophilic cyclization. We hope it will do help for future research in this area.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Cycloadditions of Cyclic Sulfamidate Imines: Straightforward Access to Chiral N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds are key structures in natural compounds and pharmaceuticals, and they serve as essential building blocks of functional materials. Catalytic asymmetric cycloaddition reactions represent one of the most efficient synthetic strategies for constructing optically active heterocycles. Cyclic sulfamidate imines have recently come to be extensively studied and widely utilized in both organocatalytic and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions, where they have been shown to provide various N&#8208;fused&#8208;heterocycles and spiro&#8208;cycles exhibiting high efficiencies with excellent stereoselectivities. This review highlights recent advancements in catalytic asymmetric cycloadditions of cyclic sulfamidate imines for the stereoselective synthesis of biologically active sulfamidate&#8208;containing heterocycles since 2012 while focusing on the diverse reactivities of cyclic sulfamidate imines and the mechanisms of chiral induction in catalysis.

         <title>A High&#8208;Throughput in Vitro Assay System for the Detection of the Enzymatic Dihydroxylation of Aliphatic Olefins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Rieske dioxygenase enzymes can perform the cis&#8208;dihydroxylation of aliphatic olefins, representing a potential green alternative to established methods of performing this important transformation. However, the activity of the natural enzymes in this context is low relative to their more well&#8208;known activity in the cis&#8208;dihydroxylation of aromatics. To enable the engineering of dioxygenase enzymes for improved activity in the dihydroxylation of aliphatic olefins, we have developed an assay system to detect the relevant diol metabolites produced from whole&#8208;cell fermentation cultures. Optimization studies were carried out to maximize the sensitivity of the assay system, and its utility in the in&#8197;vitro screening of enzyme variant libraries was demonstrated. The assay system was utilized in screening studies that identified Rieske dioxygenase variants with significantly improved activity in the dihydroxylation of aliphatic olefins relative to the wild&#8208;type enzyme.

Abstract
In synthetic carbohydrate chemistry, the modification of glycosyl radicals pathway stands as a central area of focus. The radical&#8208;based reactions often demonstrate remarkable compatibility with various functional groups owing to the mild initiation conditions. In particular, the identification of novel glycosyl radical precursors, combined with advanced reaction techniques, has substantially broadened the scope of glycosyl compound synthesis. Despite the presence of versatile donors, the synthesis of noble donors is still addressed as a synthetic need and challenges associated with sugar chemistry. Currently, a new class of glycosyl radical precursors has been developed which enables the production of C&#8208;, S&#8208;, O&#8208;, and N&#8208;glycosides efficiently. In this light, we highlight strategies towards bench&#8208;stable glycosyl sulfoxides, sulphone, and sulfite donors that can enable the site&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective transformation of protected or naked sugar synthons in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry. Here, this review article covers the recent developments in the selective glycosyl radical diversification such as glycosyl alkylation, arylation, alkenylation, sulfuration, C&#8722;H activation, and DNA conjugation via the bench&#8208;stable donors along with mechanistic aspects, challenges, and future directions.

In this light, we highlight strategies towards bench-stable glycosyl sulfoxides, sulphone, and sulfite donors that can enable the site-, regio- and stereoselective transformation of protected or naked sugar synthons in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry. Here, this review article covers the recent developments in the selective glycosyl radical diversification such as glycosyl alkylation, arylation, alkenylation, sulfuration, C&#8722;H activation, and DNA conjugation via the bench-stable donors along with mechanistic aspects, challenges, and future directions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>4&#8208;Aminobenzotriazole (ABTA) Directed Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Reaction for Synthesis of Benzofulvenes Through C&#8722;H Bond Activation Involving Inner Alkynes</title>

Abstract
A route for the construction of benzofulvenes derivatives through 4&#8208;Aminobenzotriazole (ABTA) directed Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions of amides with inner alkynes was developed. This method afforded a diverse array of benzofulvene derivatives in yields ranging from 34% to 91%. The control experiments indicated that the substrate reacts with alkynes in tandem to synthesize 1,3&#8208;diene intermediates, and ultimately 1,3&#8208;diene underwent intramolecular cyclization to produce benzofulvene derivatives. Furthermore, the directing group can be removed.

         <title>Stereoselective Construction of Trisubstituted 1,3&#8208;Enynes via Aryl to Vinyl 1,4&#8208;Palladium Migration</title>

Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective olefinic C&#8722;H alkynylation of gem&#8208;diarylsubstituted ethylenes with propargylic alcohols was achieved to access diverse unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;enynes. The regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities were established through a 1,4&#8208;palladium migration from aryl to vinyl in the presence of 2&#8208;FC6H4OH as additive. Mechanistic investigations suggest that cleavage of the olefinic C&#8722;H bond might not be involved in the rate&#8208;determining step of the catalytic process.

         <title>Recent Advances and Prospects in Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
C&#8722;H activation represents an interesting alternative to conventional cross&#8208;coupling methods, avoiding the requirement of additional steps to introduce activating groups. Generally, Pd&#8208;catalyzed reactions have been extensively employed for C&#8722;H activation. The high cost and limited availability of resources of Pd have prompted us to explore alternative transition metals. In this context, researchers are turning to Earth Abundant Metals (EAMs) like manganese and iron for their potential in C&#8722;H activation. Significant progress has been made in manganese&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H activation in recent years, showcasing excellent specificity, environmental compatibility, and versatility across different substrates. This review summarises approximately 50 recent publications highlighting significant advancements in this field from 2020 to 2023.

         <title>Rapid (Deuterio)difluoromethylation of Heteroatoms Using R&#8208;22 Gas: A Demonstration of Flow Chemistry in Suppressing Intrinsic Reaction Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
R&#8208;22 gas (ClCF2H) is utilized in continuous flow for the installation of CF2H and CF2D groups on heteroatoms. A judiciously designed flow system suppresses the intrinsic SN2 reaction between heteroatom anions and ClCF2H, allowing for selective carbene&#8208;based fragment coupling to yield X&#8208;CF2D products with deuterium incorporation levels up to 96%. A broad scope of X&#8211;CF2H and X&#8211;CF2D products (X=S, O, N) is obtained with a short residence time of 5 minutes and scalability is demonstrated.

Abstract
Monophosphine ligands based on C&#8722;N axially chiral N&#8208;Arylpyrrole backbones are prepared starting from amino acids and evaluated in Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitutions. 20.7&#8211;99.9% ees are achieved in the reactions of rac&#8208;1,3&#8208;diphenylallyl acetates with O&#8722;, N&#8722; and C&#8208;nucleophiles. Ligand screening revealed that the steric hindrance from 3&#8208; or 4&#8208; position of the pyrrole is crucial for the enantioselectivity of the reaction. The synthetic utilization of the products was demonstrated by the transformation of one product by a gold&#8208;catalyzed oxidative rearrangement reaction.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Organic electrosynthesis has become a green, efficient and sustainable alternative to traditional organic transformation for the redox reactions. In this connection, indirect electrolysis employing redox mediators is attaining increasing significance as it offers a chance to improve reaction selectivity and avoids the over&#8208;oxidation/reduction issues encountered in direct electrolysis. Triarylamines and triarylimidazoles, as representative organic molecular mediators, have attracted widespread attention in recent years due to the advantages of well&#8208;defined easy structural modification and tunable redox ability. Hence, in this minireview, the recent growth of triarylamine and triarylimidazole derivatives mediated electrochemical oxidation reactions were presented, highlighting the structural optimization, electrochemical performance and reaction mechanism of these organic mediators. Moreover, the photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic cases with these molecular mediators were also highlighted. To conclude, the current challenges and future prospects of this field are also discussed.

Abstract
A multicomponent cascade cyclization reaction using aryl methyl ketones, aryl amines, and enaminamide reagents to construct 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;1&#8208;one skeleton with good substrate compatibility (50 examples) has been reported. The one&#8208;pot, metal&#8208;free process formed two C&#8722;C bonds, two C&#8722;N bonds, and a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter containing a hydroxyl group. The reaction enabled modified transformation of drug molecules and derivatization of products.

Abstract
We disclose herein a triflic acid and silane&#8208;promoted reductive deoxygenative transformation of ketoacid/esters for the divergent synthesis of different&#8208;sized lactones, which hold substantial significance in pharmaceutical and natural product chemistry. Owing to the simple reaction conditions and setup, this protocol features broad substrate generality, scalability, and good functional group tolerance, including late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical compounds and natural products. The control experiments and detailed NMR study provide insight into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>C&#8722;C Bond Formation by Dual Pyrrolidine and Nickel Catalysis: Allylation of Ketones by Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Whilst catalytic ketone allylation using palladium(0) is well&#8211;precedented, nickel(0)&#8208;catalysed equivalents of such reactions remain scarce. We report here the first nickel&#8208;catalysed allylation of ketones which uses an easily handled and inexpensive bench&#8208;stable Ni(II) pre&#8208;catalyst. This method avoids generation of stoichiometric by&#8208;products via the use of readily available allyl alcohols, rather than the esters or related derivatives which are often used in such transformations. Under the optimised conditions, 25 monoallylated ketones were obtained in 16% to 98% yield and with high selectivity for the linear (E)&#8208;isomers.

         <title>Aldehyde&#8208;Mediated Open&#8208;Air Stereoselective &#946;&#8208;Glycosylation of Glycals: An Expeditious Route towards Glycosyl&#8208;Ester Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The study introduces a method for achieving a selective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;glycosyl esters through the reaction of glycals with carboxylic acids. This process is characterized by stereoselectivity, operating under mild reaction conditions and in an open&#8208;air environment mediated by an aldehyde. Detailed investigations and control experiments indicate the significance of benzaldehyde in conjunction with atmospheric air in facilitating this transformation. The method's versatility is evident in its broad substrate scope, accommodating various carboxylic acid derivatives with electron&#8208;releasing and electron&#8208;neutral functional groups. The practical applicability of the protocol is demonstrated by successfully esterifying different drugs, including indomethacin, tolmetin, and stearic acid, resulting in the production of novel compounds with excellent yields. Mechanistic studies, supported by controlled experiments, highlight the formation of glycal epoxide as an intermediate in the reactions.

Abstract
A catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free one&#8208;step protocol for synthesizing thiazolines and thiazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, utilizing the annulative coupling between &#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxonium ylides and &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides has been described. The dual functionalization of &#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxonium ylides through S&#8208;alkylation and intramolecular N&#8208;cyclization leads to the generation of both C&#8722;S and C&#8722;N bonds. The developed synthetic methods facilitate the synthesis of diverse functionalized thiazolines and thiazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives, validated through large&#8208;scale reactions.

Abstract
The development of synthetic methods for the synthesis of organic azides is highly important, given their critical role in advancing click chemistry over the last twenty years. We report a reagent&#8208;economical, reliable, and scalable synthesis of alkyl azides from primary and secondary alcohols. This robust click method capitalizes on the synergistic interaction between Sulfur Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) reagents &#8211; specifically, benzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;disulfonyl fluoride (BDSF) or benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trisulfonyl fluoride (BTSF) &#8211; and trimethylsilyl azide (TMSN3). The method offers procedural ease, accommodates a wide array of substrates, and enables late&#8208;stage functionalization. Additionally, we demonstrate the protocol&#8216;s adaptability by validating a straightforward one&#8208;pot deoxyazidation&#8208;CuAAC sequence for drug discovery applications.

We report a reagent-economical, reliable, and scalable synthesis of alkyl azides from primary and secondary alcohols. This robust click method capitalizes on the synergistic interaction between Sulfur Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) reagents &#8211; specifically, benzene-1,3-disulfonyl fluoride (BDSF) or benzene-1,3,5-trisulfonyl fluoride (BTSF) &#8211; and trimethylsilyl azide (TMSN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The method offers procedural ease, accommodates a wide array of substrates, and enables late-stage functionalization. Additionally, we demonstrate the protocol&#8216;s adaptability by validating a straightforward one-pot deoxyazidation-CuAAC sequence for drug discovery applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Tailored Divergence of Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidation of Cyclopropanols. Application to the Practical Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Aminoketones and &#946;&#8208;Enaminones</title>

Abstract
The aerobic ring&#8208;opening oxidation of cyclopropanols catalyzed by copper complexes was systematically investigated, with a focus on the effect of nitrogen ligands on the distribution of oxidation products. This study led to the development of a new synthesis of &#946;&#8208;aminoketones and &#946;&#8208;enaminones from cyclopropanols, where product specificity is tuned through ligand and solvent selection. &#946;&#8208;Aminoketones were prepared in 34&#8211;99% yields by copper(II) acetate&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation of cyclopropanols in the presence of nucleophilic secondary aliphatic amines. In contrast, bipyridine&#8208;ligated copper catalysts resulted in the generation of &#946;&#8208;enaminones in 36&#8211;86% yields, presumably via the Kornblum&#8208;DeLaMare rearrangement of intermediate 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes.

         <title>Oxidative Photochemical Cyclisations to Access Spiroketals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The spiroketal moiety is an important substructure within many biological natural products. One method to access them is via the oxidative cyclisation of a pendant hydroxyl group on to a pre&#8208;formed pyran. However applications of this methodology have been severely limited by requiring the use of toxic oxidants, such as lead (IV) tetraacetate or mercuric oxide. Herein we report a high yielding photochemical route to prepare complex spiroketals using an oxidative photochemical approach employing iodine monochloride and sodium acetate and demonstrate the methodology to the synthesis of a number of insect pheromones.

Abstract
Reported herein is a method for the construction of azepino[1,2&#8208;a]indoles via an intramolecular aldehyde&#8211;alkyne metathesis of 1&#8208;(5&#8208;aryl&#8208;4&#8208;pentynyl)indole&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehydes. This Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed reaction has several remarkable features, such as ready accessibility of the starting materials, broad substrate scope, operational simplicity, and high yields. The practicality of the process and the synthetic potential of the products were demonstrated with an upscaling experiment and downstream synthetic derivatizations of the obtained products. We have also extended this methodology to synthesize a 6,7&#8208;dihydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indole derivative.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclohexenone(aryl)iodonium Salts and Their Application in Construction of Fused aza&#8208;Heterocyclic Skeletons</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A class of cyclohexenone(aryl)iodonium salts was readily prepared from 2&#8208;iodocyclohexenones and arenes under mild conditions. This novel series of hypervalent iodonium building blocks exhibits dual characteristics of hyperiodonium salts and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated cyclic ketones, enabling access to intricate aza&#8208;heterocycles. The reaction of these cyclohexenone(aryl)iodonium salts with arylamines or aryl sulfonamides affords 2&#8208;acylaziridines, while with 2&#8208;aminobenzimidazoles or 2&#8208;aminoimidazoles leads to the formation of the 1H&#8208;imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]imidazole&#8208;fused compounds. The transformation is postulated to proceed through an exclusive hyperiodonium&#8208;mediated N&#8208;Michael addition followed by N&#8208;annulation cascade.

Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive amidation of aryl sulfonium salts with isocyanates for amide synthesis via C&#8722;S bond cleavage was developed. The reactions proceeded smoothly at ambient temperature in the presence of nickel catalyst and manganese metal in DMF to give a variety of amides in moderate to good yields with wide functional group tolerance.

         <title>Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Annulation of Enaminones with Maleimides Using a Traceless Directing Group Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed annulation of enaminones with maleimides was developed to synthesize various pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;e]isoindoles. In this strategy, 2&#8208;aminopyridine served as a traceless directing group, and target products were obtained in 54&#8211;72% yields. Moreover, a plausible mechanism for this reaction was proposed based on several control experiments, deuterium exchange experiments, and previous reports.

Abstract
A domino sequence consisting of a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed Doyle&#8208;Kirmse rearrangement followed by a Claisen&#8208;thioimidate rearrangement has been developed. This type of thio&#8208;Claisen rearrangement represents the first example reported in the homoallenylsulfenyl series. The sequence involves 2&#8208;propargylsulfenyl benzazoles and diazoesters, affording N&#8208;butadienyl substituted benzazole&#8208;2&#8208;thiones as a mixture of Z and E isomers, in yields ranging from 12% to quantitative (32 examples). The method provides a rapid access to a new family of highly substituted polyfunctionalized 2&#8208;aminobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes with potential synthetic applications.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced C&#8722;H Silylation of Azauracils with Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A C&#8211;H silylation of azauracils was developed via the combination of organic photoredox and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysis. Using 1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) as the photocatalyst, quinuclidine as the HAT catalyst, and silanes as the silyl radical sources, a variety of silylated azauracils were synthesized in 43&#8208;87% yields. Moreover, pyrazinone, cinnolinone, and chromone were also compatible with this catalytic system. The reaction is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization of drugs and complex molecules, and the transformation can be easily scaled up to the gram level. Mechanistic studies suggest that the silylation reaction is likely to proceed through a radical mechanism.</dc:description>

Abstract
A three&#8208;component allylic alkylation reaction of &#945;&#8208;diazo ketones, water and allyl carbonate under the cooperative catalysis of Rh2(OAc)4, Pd2(dba)3 and Br&#248;nsted acid was disclosed. This method provides an expeditious access to &#945;&#8208;keto homoallylic alcohols in good to high yields. Controlled experiments support that the transformations proceed through cross&#8208;interception of two active intermediates Pd&#8208;allyl species and enol intermediates derived from oxonium ylides. Moreover, synthetic transformations of the generated products enable the creation of motifs enriched with dense functional groups, underscoring their potential as valuable building blocks.

Abstract
Classical methods for the synthesis of tertiary alcohols mainly rely on the nucleophilic addition of organometallic reagents to carbonyl compounds. Here, we disclose a strategy for synthesizing tertiary alcohols via electroreductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of aromatic carbonyl compounds and alkyl bromides (allyl, propargyl, benzyl and cyclohexyl bromides). This procedure features good substrate tolerance and friendly conditions (undivided cell, cheap and reusable carbon electrodes, reaction in open air, room temperature, without any external transition metal/activating reagent). Using this method, 32 desired products can be obtained with moderate to good yields, and gram&#8208;scale synthesis is feasible, demonstrating the practicality of this approach.

Abstract
Herein, we describe a reaction conditions&#8208;based switchable Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkylation and alkenylation of 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazinones with maleimides, where the triazinone serves as a directing group rather than its traditional role denitrogenative precursor. This strategy enables the selective synthesis of diverse 3&#8208;arylated succinimides and 3&#8208;arylated maleimides in up to 99% yield and a broad substrate scope (48 examples). Furthermore, for the first time, a tandem C&#8722;H alkylation and denitrogenative coupling of 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazinones has been achieved by slightly modifying the reaction conditions. Additionally, gram&#8208;scale reactions and product derivatizations were conducted to demonstrate the synthetic utility.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we describe a reaction conditions-based switchable Rh(III)-catalyzed C&#8722;H alkylation and alkenylation of 1,2,3-benzotriazinones with maleimides, where the triazinone serves as a directing group rather than its traditional role denitrogenative precursor. This strategy enables the selective synthesis of diverse 3-arylated succinimides and 3-arylated maleimides in up to 99% yield and a broad substrate scope (48 examples). Furthermore, for the first time, a tandem C&#8722;H alkylation and denitrogenative coupling of 1,2,3-benzotriazinones has been achieved by slightly modifying the reaction conditions. Additionally, gram-scale reactions and product derivatizations were conducted to demonstrate the synthetic utility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A tandem oxidative radical functionalization/annulation of N&#8208;acryloyl amino saccharin is disclosed. This strategy allows the facile construction of diversely functionalized 3,4&#8208;fused tricyclic benzosultams that previously have not been reported. A wide range of functionalities were installed through the formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;S and C&#8722;P bond enabled by the respective radicals.

Abstract
Formal olefinic C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling between alkenyl sulfonium salts and secondary phosphine oxides and H&#8208;phosphinates has been developed. A base enables construction of alkenyl C&#8722;P bonds as well as aliphatic C&#8722;P bonds at ambient temperature under an air atmosphere. This protocol provides an alternative access to multisubstituted alkenyl phosphine oxides and phosphinates in 40&#8211;99% yield from functionalized alkenes through an interrupted Pummerer activation/base&#8208;promoted olefinic C&#8722;S bond phosphinylation sequence. Gram&#8208;scale preparation and feasible derivatization demonstrated the applicability of the resultant alkenylphosphine oxides.

Abstract
PIII/PV redox cycling has recently emerged as a valuable strategy to minimized the chemical waste generated by phosphine&#8208;mediated reaction, as well as enabling asymmetric transformation. In this article, we detail our contribution to this field by designing a series of diversely functionalized, electron&#8208;rich bridgehead phosphine oxides with structural features that make them well&#8208;suited as PIII/PV redox organocatalysts. Their catalytic performance has been assessed in various model reactions, including Wittig or Staudinger reactions, along with the reduction of activated alkenes and allenes. For each of these scenarios, we performed a comparative analysis with existing catalysts in order to demonstrate the applicability and limitation of methanophosphocines.

Abstract
Herein, we describe a strategy for the synthesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from readily available 2&#8208;iodostyrenes and o&#8208;halobenzoic acids through a ligand&#8208;free palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade vinyl C&#8722;H activation/decarboxylative cyclization. A vinyl&#8208;coordinated five&#8208;membered palladacycle was proposed as the key intermediate for this sequential process. Furthermore, Heptagon&#8208;embedded aromatic compounds can be smoothly synthesized by employing 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;naphthoic acid as decarboxylative insertion unit.

Abstract
With an in&#8197;situ C&#8722;H iodination tactic, a method for the synthesis of chromone&#8208;3&#8208;phosphonates was developed with trialkyl/triaryl phosphites as the reaction partners of o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl enaminones by palladium catalysis. The product formation consists of cascade C&#8722;H iodination, chromone annulation, and Arbuzov&#8208;type C&#8722;P cross coupling as major transformations. In addition to providing an enaminone&#8208;based synthetic method to chromone&#8208;3&#8208;phosphonates, the work shows the advantage of step economy by skipping the separate operation for preparing the iodo&#8208;functionalized chromone intermediate.

Abstract
We report a one&#8208;pot cascade sequence catalyzed by gold starting from 1,5&#8208;diynes and a zwitterion (source of Tf2C=CH2), which allows the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective preparation of cyclobutene&#8208;fused [4&#8208;7&#8208;6] tricycles and displays orthogonal reactivity of the 1,5&#8208;diyne system, zwitterion and metal catalyst. Moreover, the obtained tricyclic bis(triflyl)cyclobutenes [triflyl=(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl] can be easily converted into more complex structures such as bridged ketal and fused 1,3&#8208;oxazine tetracyclic systems, demonstrating the potential of our protocol.

Abstract
Numerous appropriately substituted pyridyl or phenyl groups serve as a particularly advantageous activation motif for the electrochemical oxidation of amines. Such groups enable a general, mild method for the electrochemical &#945;&#8208;functionalization of tertiary amines across numerous activating groups and amine scaffolds. Notably, the method accommodates an unprecedented range of nucleophile classes, allowing for the introduction of diverse functional groups to the readily prepared amine substrates. The utility of this method is then demonstrated through applications to unsymmetrical bisfunctionalization, site&#8208;selective functionalization of N&#8208;pyridyl amines vs. other activated amines, a formal synthesis of ivosidenib and the diversification of FDA&#8208;approved drugs or natural product substrates.

Abstract
2H&#8208;Azirines are an important class of small&#8208;ring heterocycle that have been employed as versatile synthetic building blocks. Herein, a one&#8208;pot CuAAC/ring&#8208;cleavage/[4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/rearrangement reaction sequence involving terminal ynones, sulfonyl azides and 2H&#8208;azirines is reported that leads to 2&#8208;aminopyridine derivatives. In the first step, highly reactive N&#8208;sulfonyl &#945;&#8208;acylketenimines are generated, via a CuAAC/ring&#8208;cleavage process, from sulfonyl azides and terminal ynones and these undergo inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition reactions with 2H&#8208;azirines to form (isolable) 1,3&#8208;oxazines that themselves undergo base&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;cleavage and rearrangement reactions to afford the title compounds.

The cascade waterfall symbolizes the cascade transformation depicted schematically on the image. The starting oxime containing a proximal allene in palladium catalyzed process undergoes several in&#8197;situ transformations to afford the triquinane type product. The cascade stream involves three components and creates four new bonds in a single operation. More details can be found in article by P. Jovanovic, V. Savic and co&#8208;workers (P. Jovanovic, M.

         <title>Radical Difunctionalization of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons Employing the Same Functional Reagent</title>

Abstract
The radical difunctionalization of unsaturated hydrocarbons serves as an efficient means to rapidly construct molecular skeletons and synthesize&#8208;highly valuable compounds. In this transformational process, diverse positions within unsaturated hydrocarbons are sequentially functionalized by a single radical precursor reagent, thereby achieving highly efficient and selective transformations that promote atom economy. Furthermore, this approach minimizes the generation of numerous byproducts stemming from cross&#8208;coupling reactions between reactants, owing to the reduction of the number of participating components. Therefore, this review provides an in&#8208;depth analysis of the radical difunctionalization of unsaturated hydrocarbons utilizing a single functional reagent in recent decades. The discussion is based on eight different radical classes (carbon&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, phosphine&#8208;, oxygen&#8208;, sulfur&#8208;, selenium&#8208;, tellurium&#8208;, and chlorine&#8208;centered radicals), emphasizing the mechanism of specific radical difunctionalization. It also analyzes in detail the regulation of key factors such as regional selectivity, and provides unique insights into reaction transformations.

Abstract
C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization methods have been widely employed in many organic transformations such as cyclization reactions, heterocycle synthesis, cross&#8208;coupling protocols, and photochemical transformations. Among these transformations, cyclization reaction through C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization offers a direct route to convert simple linear substrates to complex products. There are three common modes of utilizing C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in cyclization reactions including single, double, and dual C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. As the most challenging mode, dual C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization refers to converting two separate C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in one molecule into desired C&#8722;Z bonds which can be employed in cyclization reactions. Cyclization reaction via dual functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds can be classified based on the C&#8722;H reactivities. Therefore, these reactions can be categorized into three classes based on the types of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds including activated&#8208;activated, activated&#8208;unactivated, and unactivated&#8208;unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. Most published reports for cyclization reactions through dual C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization involve activated&#8208;activated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. However, the number of reported papers on the other two classes has been growing. This review focuses on the dual C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization protocols used for cyclization reactions and categorizes the published papers based on the types of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds.

Abstract
The substrate&#8208;controlled regioselective conjugate addition (1,8&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;addition) of tropones with difluoroenoxysilanes is reported, which offered an approach for the selective synthesis of multifunctional seven&#8208;membered 3,5&#8208;cycloheptadien&#8208;1&#8208;ones and 1,3&#8208;cycloheptadien&#8208;1&#8208;ones featuring a gem&#8208;difluoroketone moiety. Moreover, these fluorinated cyclo&#8208;heptadienones exhibit effective anti&#8208;proliferative activities (IC50&lt;1&#8197;&#956;M) for human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells in&#8197;vitro, thus providing potential lead compounds for developing new anticancer agents.

Abstract
A three&#8208;component strategy for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl allyl alcohols from 1,3&#8208;dienes is developed. A diverse range of synthetically valuable &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl allyl alcohols are obtained in moderate to high yields. Broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance are observed. This method is also applicable to mono&#8208;olefins and 1,3&#8208;enynes. The control experiment results demonstrate that the hydroxyl group OH in the product comes from TBHP. In addition, the practicality and mild reaction conditions make these synthetic transformations attractive and valuable for organic synthesis.

Abstract
Combining chemical reactivities of allenes and oximes created a methodology for the preparation of heterocyclic triquinane&#8208;type skeletons via a cascade process constructing four bonds in a single step. The initial reaction of allene moiety promoted by Pd&#8208;catalysis, affording &#960;&#8208;allyl Pd&#8208;species, was followed by two additional transformations &#8208; nucleophilic displacement and dipolar cycloaddition &#8208; to furnish the product highly stereoselectively in moderate to good yields. For the process to be efficient, it was necessary to use a dipolarophilic component as a solvent. Intriguingly, while the reaction with cyclopentanone derived oxime progressed through the whole cascade, with cyclohexanone analogue it stopped at the nitrone stage, requiring an additional step to yield similar type of products. Some aspects of the studied cascade were examined by DFT.

Abstract
A photoinduced palladium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydroarylation of furans to form functionalized indenes was achieved via an intramolecular reductive coupling of aryl bromide with furan using silane as the reductant. Deuterium tracking and DFT analysis revealed a reasonable reaction pathway involving: 1) the homolytic cleavage of the furan C&#8722;O bond induced by the &#945;&#8208;allyl radical; 2) a 1,6&#8208;H atom transfer from carbon to oxygen.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Induced Ag&#8208;Palladacycle&#8208;Complex&#8208;Mediated Regioselective C&#8722;H Arylation</title>

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, external photocatalyst&#8208;free, site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H arylation of 4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones and various 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes has been developed to provide ortho arylated products 41&#8211;95% yield at room temperature. A mechanistic study using control experiments, UV&#8208;visible study, DFT study, and observation of colored aggregates suggest that in&#8197;situ generated Ag&#8208;palladacycle complex of 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes is responsible for absorbing the visible light and generating aryl radicals from aryldiazonium salts. Further, this methodology demonstrates its versatility by transforming various 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes, including 2&#8208;phenylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;one, 3&#8208;phenylquinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one, 2&#8208;phenylpyridines, pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines, 2&#8208;phenylquinolines, 2&#8208;phenylisoquinolines, and 2&#8208;phenylbenzo[d]thiazoles, into their respective regio&#8208;selective C&#8722;H arylated products under mild reaction conditions.

Abstract
A mechanism&#8208;navigated enantioselective alkylation of an indole C2&#8197;C&#8722;H bond with an internal alkene was developed. Under the unconventional ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal catalyst ratio, a moderate enantiomeric ratio (er), ranging from 70:30 to 88:12, was achieved with our original ligand. We propose that chain&#8208;walking and bond formation are mechanistically independent and suggest that hydridoiridium generated from the C&#8722;H source does not play a role in the chain&#8208;walking process.

Abstract
An efficient and regioselective cyclization for construction of pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;b]pyridines and methylene&#8208;bridged bis(pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines) has been established. It involves a [3+2+1] annulation of 3(5)&#8208;aminopyrazole, N,N&#8208;dimethylethanolamine (DMEA), with 1,2&#8208;insertion of aryl methyl ketones or 2,1&#8208;insertion of aryl alkynes. DMEA is oxidized through C(sp3)&#8208;H activation to provide a single or triple carbon source.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;induced annulation&#8208;halocyanomethylation of indole&#8208;linked 1,6&#8208;enynes has been established using haloacetonitrile as radical precursors, enabling the synthesis of 21 cyanomethylated pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles with yields ranging from 42% to 81% and a Z/E ratio up to 19:1. Moreover, by adjusting the reaction temperature, a variation of the annulation&#8208;bromobicyanomethylation process was achieved, resulting in the production of 12 bicyanomethylated pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indole isomers in yields of 41&#8211;68%. The stereoisomeric mixture of bicyanomethylated products could be purified to their pure configurations through recrystallization. The proposed reaction mechanism was formulated through a series of control experiments.

         <title>Photoinduced Radical Borylation of Robust Carbon&#8722;Heteroatom Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinduced borylation has emerged as a valuable strategy for synthesizing arylboronic esters. However, photochemical transformations involving inert bonds such as C(sp2)&#8722;F bonds are still challenging. Herein, we report a straightforward and operationally simple method for the activation of various inert carbon&#8722;heteroatom bonds, enabling the synthesis of diverse arylboronic esters without the need for transition metals or catalysts. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the deprotonation of DMSO plays a pivotal role in the reaction, and the excited DMSO anion can undergo electron transfer to the aryl substrates activated by anionic sp2&#8722;sp3 diboron compounds, i.e., [FB2pin2]&#8722;, thereby facilitating the cleavage of carbon&#8722;heteroatom bonds. The reaction allows the conversion of diverse Caryl&#8722;hetero bonds in batch and flow reactors into the corresponding arylboronic esters. The products can be used in a subsequent Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling without isolation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract: A Rh (III)&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral C&#8208;H activation/ [3+3] cyclization of 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2H&#8208;indazole&#8208;6&#8208;carboxylic acids with iodonium ylides under microwave irradiation for the synthesis of indazole&#8208;fused chromenes has been reported. The critical feature of this method is that the C&#8208;H activation of the C7&#8208;H bond of 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2H&#8208;indazole&#8208;6&#8208;carboxylic acid proceeds with regioselectivity in the presence of the proximate C5&#8208;H bond without the need for external oxidant. Microwave irradiation reduced the reaction time as compared to conventional heating. The detailed mechanistic study disclosed the mechanistic pathway of the reaction.

         <title>Synthesis of 3,5&#8208;Dialkoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxolanes by Alkoxyperoxidation of 1,3&#8208;Diketones with Hydrogen Peroxide and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component reaction of 1,3&#8208;diketones with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and alcohols was discovered. 3,5&#8208;Dialkoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxolanes are formed in yield ranging from 13% to 83% using an excess of acids such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, MeHSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;TsOH&#183;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. This reaction proceeds with the formation of 3,5&#8208;dialkoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxolanes despite the diversity of possible reaction pathways leading to different types of peroxides, oligomers, polymers or hydrolysis. 3,5&#8208;Dimethoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxolanes exhibit high activity against phytopathogenic fungi.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(III) Catalysis in Ionic Liquids: The Case Study of Coumarin Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Well&#8208;defined (P,C)&#8208;cyclometalated Au(III) complexes proved to be able to catalyze the synthesis of coumarins by intramolecular hydroarylation of a broad range of aryl propiolates under mild and practical conditions (0.1&#8208;2 mol% catalyst, 25&#8208;40&#176;C, 1&#8208;24 hours). Use of an ionic liquid as reaction solvent allowed to drastically decrease the amount of Br&#246;nsted acid used to unlock the catalyst regeneration step. The effect of the nature of the acid additive and of the ionic liquid anion have been assessed. Preliminary results on the extension of this methodology to the cyclization of aryl propargyl ethers are also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Hypervalent iodine&#8208;mediated regioselective dearomatization of non&#8208;activated arenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dearomatizations of non&#8208;activated arenes, particularly those under mild reaction conditions, are highly desired transformations in organic synthesis due to their power in converting flat aromatic rings into three&#8208;dimensional frameworks. Although hypervalent iodine (HVI)&#8208;mediated dearomatization of phenol derivatives has developed rapidly, HVI&#8208;mediated dearomatization of non&#8208;activated arenes remains an urgent and challenging task. To fulfil this task, in this work, we established an HVI&#8208;mediated oxidative dearomatization of non&#8208;activated arenes by using biphenylureas and N&#8208; or O&#8208;nucleophiles as reactants. This electrophilic dearomatization (DEAr) process is highly regioselective, which enabled different N&#8208; and O&#8208;nucleophiles to react at the distal C4&#8208;position of the phenyl ring, thus generating dearomative spiro&#8208;products in a single step under mild conditions with wide substrate scope (43 examples, 22%&#8722;76% yield). This approach not only provides a successful example for dearomatization of non&#8208;activated arenes under mild reaction conditions, but also has overcome the challenges in HVI&#8208;mediated dearomatization of non&#8208;activated arenes, which will enrich the chemistry of dearomatization.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Ruthenium (II)&#8208;catalysed regioselective C6 alkylation of indole&#8208;7&#8208;carboxamides with maleimide has been described. Electronically diverse maleimides reacted with various indoles to furnish corresponding C6 substituted succinimide derivatives of indoles with 46&#8208;89% yields. The reaction shows broad functional group tolerance. The synthetic utility of the reaction has been demonstrated through the conversion of the obtained product to the corresponding hexahydropyridazinyl derivative. We also studied the kinetics of the reaction through intermolecular competitive experiments with electronically distinct indole&#8208;7&#8208;carboxamides.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnesium and Calcium Bisguanidinates: Catalytic Activity in the Hydroboration of Unsaturated Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role of ligands in catalytically active metal complexes can be crucial. Herein, we present a study on the synthesis and catalytic behavior of alkaline earth bisguanidinato complexes. The reactivity of trisubstituted guanidines, specifically (iPrHN)2CNR (R= Ph, 2&#8208;Ph2PC6H4, 2&#8208;MeSC6H4), towards magnesium and calcium alkyls or amides was explored. All the compounds were found to be very active in the hydroboration of acetophenone with pinacolborane. Notably, a calcium&#8208;based complex was especially effective in the hydroboration of carbonyl compounds, demonstrating significant chemoselectivity against other reactive functional groups.	This complex was also particularly effective in the double hydroboration of nitriles and moderately active in the hydroborative dearomatization of pyridine. Our experimental and DFT studies allow us to propose a mechanism in which the participation of the guanidinato ligands, along with the metal, is key to the activation of both the unsaturated species and borane.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The role of ligands in catalytically active metal complexes can be crucial. Herein, we present a study on the synthesis and catalytic behavior of alkaline earth bisguanidinato complexes. The reactivity of trisubstituted guanidines, specifically (iPrHN)2CNR (R= Ph, 2-Ph2PC6H4, 2-MeSC6H4), towards magnesium and calcium alkyls or amides was explored. All the compounds were found to be very active in the hydroboration of acetophenone with pinacolborane. Notably, a calcium-based complex was especially effective in the hydroboration of carbonyl compounds, demonstrating significant chemoselectivity against other reactive functional groups.	This complex was also particularly effective in the double hydroboration of nitriles and moderately active in the hydroborative dearomatization of pyridine. Our experimental and DFT studies allow us to propose a mechanism in which the participation of the guanidinato ligands, along with the metal, is key to the activation of both the unsaturated species and borane.

Abstract
Recycling cascades combining aldolases and transaminases from biodiversity were designed for the stereoselective synthesis of various isomers of &#947;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids. Aldolases with opposite enantioselectivities were combined with a d&#8208;&#945;&#8208;transaminase to prepare in a single step, d&#8208;syn or d&#8208;anti&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyglutamic acid with high yield and stereoselectivity. Bioactive (2S,3R,4S)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;isoleucine was also efficiently prepared via an aldolase&#8208;transaminase recycling cascade. In that case, the unexpected high stereoselectivity was shown to result from the thermodynamically&#8208;driven formation of a stable derivative of the product. This novel approach was applied to the synthesis of l&#8208;syn and d&#8208;syn&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxynorvaline as well as for 3 new &#946;&#8208;branched&#8208;&#947;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids, analogues of 4&#8208;hydroxyisoleucine.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Daphenylline by Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Dearomatization Reaction of Methoxynaphthalene</title>

Abstract
Daphenylline, a structurally unique triterpenoid Daphniphyllum alkaloid, has attracted considerable attention from the synthetic community since its isolation. Herein, we delineate an enantioselective total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;daphenylline, which is based on a gold&#8208;catalyzed dearomatization reaction of &#946;&#8208;methoxynaphthalene. Other features include installation of the initial chiral stereocenter via an enantioselective rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of an alkylidene&#8208;indane derivative; construction of the other vital stereocenter by organocatalytic asymmetric Mukaiyama&#8211;Michael reaction of a structurally complex benzofused cyclohexanone; and a tandem reductive amination/amidation double cyclization reaction to assemble the distinctive azapolycyclic cage&#8208;like architecture.

Abstract
Here we report a transition metal&#8211; and oxidant&#8211;free annulation cascade method for the synthesis of chromeno&#8211;isoxazoles. The annulation reaction involves easily accessible starting materials, 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2H&#8208;chromene and &#945;&#8208;chloro aldehyde, yielding the structurally intriguing framework, chromeno[3,4&#8208;c]isoxazoles employed by tripotassium phosphate as a base. The isoxazole ring construction over the 2H&#8211;chromene unit is believed to occur via a series of multiple reaction sequences. Here, the enolate generation/Michael addition/C&#8722;Cl bond cleavage/oxy&#8211;anionic addition to reactive tethered&#8208;aldehyde/deformylation via retro&#8211;C&#8722;C and N&#8722;O bond cleavages are the most possible sequences which furnish the desired end&#8211;product in good chemical yields. The multiple reaction sequences occur in one&#8208;pot at mild conditions, supported by experimental results and a few control experiments including DFT studies. This process exhibits a broad substrates scope illustrating good functional group compatibility towards both the nitrochromenes and aldehydes, and thus prove to be a general and efficient protocol for the synthesis of chromeno[3,4&#8211;c]isoxazoles. Overall, the use of nitrochromene as the limiting reagent, noteworthy functional group tolerance, scalability including great applications like chiral pool strategy towards the synthesis of enantioenriched chromeno&#8208;isoxazole are the additional features.

         <title>Synthesis of Acyl Halides from Carboxylic Acid Thioesters for Synthesis of Ketones, Esters, Amides and Peptides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A synthesis of acyl halides from the corresponding carboxylic acid thioesters was achieved using commercially available Selectfluor or NCS, and the acyl fluoride or chloride intermediates were transformed to the corresponding esters, amides, and several carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation products. This approach can be applied to the peptide synthesis from functionalized amino acid thioesters.

         <dc:description>








Abstract
In this work, silyl ethers of phenols and alcohols have been successfully prepared and tested as neutral carbon (silicon) centered radical precursors. The organophotocatalyzed oxidation (by the Fukuzumi catalyst) of these ethers caused the cleavage of a C&#8722;Si (or a Si&#8722;Si) bond for the release of the desired radical to be used for the forging of C(sp3) &#8722;C(sp3) (or C(sp3) &#8722;Si) bonds via a Giese reaction.

         <title>Dearomative 1,2&#8208;(Deutero)Hydrotrifluoromethylation of Chromium&#8208;Bound Arenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Dearomative trifluoromethylation of arenes provides an ideal method for constructing CF3&#8208;containing three&#8208;dimensional architectures which are of increasing interest in drug discovery. However, such transformation is rare and challenging because of the inherently low reactivity of arene &#960;&#8208;systems and selectivity issues. Herein, we disclose a general dearomative 1,2&#8208;hydrotrifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes utilizing activation by temporary &#960;&#8208;complexation to chromium, thus affording convenient access to 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes bearing the privileged CF3 group. The versatility of this strategy further enables a dearomative 1,2&#8208;deuterotrifluoromethylation with high deuterated ratios. The related dearomative 1,2&#8208;(deutero)hydroperfluoroethylation reactions were conducted well for a range of chromium&#8208;bound (hetero)arenes. Finally, a reasonable mechanism was proposed based on the intermediate capture and control experiments.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Photocyclization/Oxidation Cascade Constructing Quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones and Tetrahydrocarbazolones</title>

Abstract
We reported a one&#8208;pot photocyclization/ oxidation cascade of N&#8208;aryl acrylamides to afford quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones. Thioxanthone was used as a bifunctional energy transfer agent to mediate both photocyclization and generation of singlet oxygen, the latter facilitates the dehydrogenation of dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;one intermediate. This cascade strategy also supports the 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization to synthesize tetrahydrocarbazolones from phenylamino cyclohexenones.

Abstract
We developed a second generation of Lewis acid catalyst enabling selective and user&#8208;friendly phosphonylation of diverse alcohols. This one&#8208;pot method utilizes P(III) reagent bis(2,2,2&#8211;trifluoroethyl) phosphite under mild conditions. Exploring the influence of metal selection in Lewis acid catalysts revealed four highly active complexes for alcohol phosphonylation: Zn(II), Al(III), Zr(IV), and Hf(IV). Notably, Hf(IV) displayed superior selectivity compared to the previously developed Zn(II) catalyst.

Abstract
Our study introduces a streamlined oxidative method for synthesizing 1,3&#8208;diarylphenanthro[9,10&#8208;c]thiophenes, and their subsequent oxidative cleavage to yield 9,10&#8208;diaroylphenanthrenes. Harnessing an optimized aerobic photochemical transformation, we showcase broad substrate scope and tolerance to various photosensitive functional groups. Our mechanistic investigations unveil the pivotal role of singlet oxygen, providing intriguing insights into the reaction pathway. The synthesized 9,10&#8208;diaroylphenanthrenes serve as versatile building blocks for nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, dibenzoannulated phthalazines, that are promising compounds with diverse functionalities. Offering mild conditions, and broad applicability, our synthetic strategy is useful for organic synthesis and chemical biology exploration.

         <title>Enzyme Cascade with Four Enzymes in One Pot for the Synthesis of L&#8208;Phosphinothricin</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The biocatalytic oxidative deamination&#8208; reductive amination process for the production of L&#8208;phosphinothricin (L&#8208;PPT) from D,L&#8208;phosphinothricin (D,L&#8208;PPT) is a green and environmentally friendly approach with significant development potential. In this study, the adopted technological route involves the oxidative deamination of the D&#8208;PPT component in D,L&#8208;PPT to 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)butanoic acid (PPO) by utilizing D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAAO), followed by the catalytic reductive amination of PPO to L&#8208;PPT using phosphinothricin dehydrogenase (PpDH). In order to enhance the catalytic rate and reduce the inhibitory effect of the intermediate product PPO on the catalytic process, optimization of both oxidative deamination and reductive amination phases was conducted through separate strategies of constant&#8208;pressure oxygen supply and substrate feeding, respectively. A &#8220;two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot&#8221; method was employed to link the optimized reactions, significantly shortening the production time. Furthermore, the &#8220;two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot&#8221; catalytic strategy was optimized, ultimately achieving a high 97.7% yield of L&#8208;PPT with ee of L&#8208;PPT&gt;99.9% after 5.5&#8197;h of reaction under 800&#8197;mM D,L&#8208;PPT catalytic conditions, D&#8208;PPT and PPO could not bedetected in the reaction system, further enchanced the catalytic efficiency, production efficiency and product quality.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biocatalytic oxidative deamination- reductive amination process for the production of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;-phosphinothricin (&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;-PPT) from D,L-phosphinothricin (&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;D,L&lt;/span&gt;-PPT) is a green and environmentally friendly approach with significant development potential. In this study, the adopted technological route involves the oxidative deamination of the &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;-PPT component in &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;-PPT to 2-oxo-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)butanoic acid (PPO) by utilizing D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO), followed by the catalytic reductive amination of PPO to &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;-PPT using phosphinothricin dehydrogenase (PpDH). In order to enhance the catalytic rate and reduce the inhibitory effect of the intermediate product PPO on the catalytic process, optimization of both oxidative deamination and reductive amination phases was conducted through separate strategies of constant-pressure oxygen supply and substrate feeding, respectively. A &#8220;two-step one-pot&#8221; method was employed to link the optimized reactions, significantly shortening the production time. Furthermore, the &#8220;two-step one-pot&#8221; catalytic strategy was optimized, ultimately achieving a high 97.7% yield of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;-PPT with &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;-PPT&amp;gt;99.9% after 5.5&#8197;h of reaction under 800&#8197;mM &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;-PPT catalytic conditions, D-PPT and PPO could not bedetected in the reaction system, further enchanced the catalytic efficiency, production efficiency and product quality. The aforementioned results demonstrate that this proposed approach has great potential for industrial-scale production of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;-PPT as well as significant competitive advantages in terms of economic feasibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar Chiral Ferrocene Triflones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A multi&#8208;gram scale synthesis of ferrocenetriflone was optimised from ferrocenesulfonyl fluoride and Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Ruppert reagent). Enantioselective deprotolithiations were then carried out using alkyllithiums in the presence of catalytic (+)&#8208;sparteine to afford 2&#8208;substituted ferrocene triflones with ee up to 84%. The use of chiral lithium amides in the presence of in situ traps was also optimised and was found to outperform alkyllithium&#8729;chiral diamine chelates for the first time in the ferrocene series, with ee up to 93%. Crystallisation of derivatives afforded enantiopure compounds that were engaged in deprotolithiation&#8208;electrophilic trapping sequences, a halogen &#8216;dance' reaction and transition metal promoted coupling to afford a wide range of variously polysubstituted ferrocene triflones.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Interaction Enabled Ru(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of (Multi)&#8208;Substituted Pyridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a cost&#8208;effective synthesis of various multi&#8208;substituted pyridine derivatives, especially 2&#8208;aryl pyridines, using secondary alcohols and 1,3&#8208;diol as the primary feedstock with ammonium acetate serving as nitrogen donor, catalyzed by a new well&#8208;defined singlet mono&#8208;radical Ru(III)&#8208;catalyst featuring a cyclopentadienyl group, one PPh3, and a redox&#8208;active scaffold &#8210;N1&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine having a pendant &#8208;NH2 arm. The &#8208;NH2 arm of the catalyst facilitates the generation of the critical reactive intermediates by enhancing the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon center of the diols or diketones by forming hydrogen bonds, making it more catalytically effective over the similar other Ru&#8208;catalysts having no pendant &#8208;NH2 arm. The Ru&#8208;catalyst also functionalizes 2&#8208;aryl pyridine moieties with different coupling partners, such as aryl iodides, terminal alkynes, and styrene derivatives at the o&#8208;position of the phenyl ring.</dc:description>

Abstract
The synthesis of substituted 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;b]indazoles from 3&#8208;aminoindazoles and ketones has been established. It involves one molecule of 3&#8208;aminoindazoles and two molecules of ketones via a [3+2+1] three&#8208;component annulation process. 3&#8208;Oxo&#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;b]indazoles exhibit strong yellow fluorescence in various solvents. A wide range of products have anti&#8208;oxidant activities. Cytotoxicity studies indicate that compounds 3&#8201;a, 3&#8201;aa and 3&#8201;ab have obvious effects on both HCT116 and A549 cancer cell lines.

         <title>Recent Advances on Direct Phosphorothiolation Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Organophosphorothioates are organic molecules containing sulfur and phosphorus, with significant biological activity and physicochemical properties, widely used in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, and the agrochemical industry. In particular, many phosphorothioates display a variety of biological activities, such as antifungal, antibacterial, anti&#8208;parasite, anticancer, and so on. Traditionally, the synthesis of phosphorothioates has mainly relied on indirect methods involving the construction of S&#8722;P bond. In recent years, direct phosphorothiolation has gained attention as a reliable and rapid method for introducing the &#8722;S&#8722;P(O)(OR)2 group into parent molecules. This article reviews the latest advances in direct phosphorothiolation reactions, categorized based on the different sources of the &#8722;S&#8722;P(O)(OR)2 group.

In recent years, direct phosphorothiolation has gained attention as a reliable and rapid method for introducing the &#8722;S&#8722;P(O)(OR)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group into parent molecules. This article reviews the latest advances in direct phosphorothiolation reactions, categorized based on the different sources of the &#8722;S&#8722;P(O)(OR)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>A Ruthenium catalyzed C4&#8208; aminomethyl alkenylation of indoles using substituted propargylamine as an alkenylating agent and pivaloyl as a weak chelating group has been demonstrated. A variety of substituted indoles and propargylamines furnished the desired product in good yields. Control experiments indicate that the C&#8722;H cleavage step is reversible and suggest the possibility of a base&#8208;assisted internal electrophilic substitution (BIES) pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidation State and Halogen Influence on the NHC&#8208;Gold&#8208;Halide&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of Propargylic Amides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The homogeneously catalyzed cycloisomerization reaction of propargylic amides was tested as benchmark reaction for two homologous series of Au(I) and Au(III) complexes with NHC ligands. This reaction is known to afford either aromatic oxazoles or dihydrooxazoles, depending on the oxidation state of the applied gold catalysts. For this purpose, symmetric and unsymmetric NHC ligands with mixed alkyl or benzyl substituents (1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;imidazolyl&#8208;2yl or 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;imidazolyl&#8208;2&#8208;yl) and the corresponding Au(I) and Au(III) derivatives were prepared and characterized by analytical methods, IR and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies, and by X&#8208;ray diffraction methods. 	Ten NHC&#8208;gold(I) and NHC&#8208;gold(III) complexes were tested on the cyclization reactions by adding gold catalysts in the presence and absence of AgPF6.Noteworthy, only the 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;gold(III) trichloride was able to give selectively the aromatic oxazole without the addition of the silver salt. Interestingly, on contrary to what is reported in the literature, the use of gold(I) or gold(III) complexes does not influence the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reaction, while the halide bound to the metal does. In this regard, a mechanism purposing the dihydrooxazole as an intermediate for the formation of aromatic oxazole is proposed.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Synthesis of Substituted Azepines by Gold/Magnesium Orthogonal&#8208;Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component one&#8208;pot synthesis of substituted azepines was realized by gold/magnesium orthogonal relay catalysis. The one&#8208;pot synthesis involves simply mixing and heating propiolates, imines, and activated cyclopropanes to initiate a gold&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;enyne metathesis between propiolates and imines, followed by a magnesium&#8208;catalyzed [4+3] cycloaddition reaction of the resultant 1&#8208;azabutadienes and cyclopropanes, yielding substituted azepines. The corresponding substituted azepines including 22 derivatives could be successfully prepared in good to excellent yield (61&#8211;95%). The reaction could be conducted in one&#8208;gram scale.</dc:description>

         <title>PTC in the polyenolate&#8208;mediated [10+2]&#8208;cycloaddition for the synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acid precursors</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. The manuscript describes a formal [10+2] higher&#8208;order cycloaddition between 2&#8208;benzylideneindan&#8208;1&#8208;ones and &#945;&#8208;alkilidene azlactones as higherene precursors and  higherenofiles respectively. The reaction is realized under Br&#248;nsted&#8208;base catalysis utilizing the phase transfer catalysis approach. The key intermediate is an isobenzofulvene&#8208;derived polyenolate which acts as a 10&#8208;electron component in the higher&#8208;order cycloaddition. By using this strategy, a series of structurally diverse compounds containing a polycyclic hydrocarbon scaffold was prepared in 79&#8208;99% yields. In addition, the potential of the obtained [10+2]&#8208;cycloadducts has been confirmed by transformations, including the synthesis of a highly&#8208;valuable alpha,alpha&#8208;disubstituted N&#8208;protected alpha&#8208;aminoester.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiocomplementary Synthesis of Tetrahydrofurans by Engineered Halohydrin Dehalogenases</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral tetrahydrofurans are prevalent structural motifs in biologically active compounds, approved drugs and natural products, but relevant enantiocomplementary synthesis remains underdeveloped. In this study, wild type halohydrin dehalogenase HheC from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1, was first discovered to enable the intramolecular substitution of &#948;&#8208;halohydrins for the formation of tetrahydrofurans but with unsatisfied activity and stereoselectivity. Through structure&#8208;guided protein engineering, two completely enantiocomplementary variants T134M and P84L/W139A of HheC were obtained for the synthesis of tetrahydrofurans by the kinetic resolution of &#948;&#8208;halohydrins (both giving products with up to 99% e.e., E &gt;200). This research unveiled the halohydrin dehalogenases&#8217; catalytic ability to form chiral cyclic ethers larger ring size than three&#8208;membered epoxides, which has hitherto been unexplored, and provided an enzymatic synthesis access to valuably enantiocomplementary tetrahydrofurans.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Electrochemical Redox/Condensation Reaction between 2&#8208;Amino Nitrobenzenes and Aliphatic Alcohols: An Approach to Benzimidazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tandem reactions via electrocatalytic annulations have emerged as an effective strategy for the construction of heterocycles. Herein, a two&#8208;component electrochemical annulation via sequential reduction, oxidation, and condensation steps to synthesize valuable benzimidazoles motifs is reported.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tandem reactions via electrocatalytic annulations have emerged as an effective strategy for the construction of heterocycles. Herein, a two-component electrochemical annulation via sequential reduction, oxidation, and condensation steps to synthesize valuable benzimidazoles motifs is reported.  This reaction, which utilizes electricity as both the oxidants and reductants, tolerates a broad range of functional groups. Detailed mechanistic studies including control experiments, cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis, and key reaction intermediate characterization, reveals an intermolecular electrochemical redox/cyclization pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Difluoroalkoxylation of Imidazopyridines using N&#8208;Fluorobenzenesulfonimide as Fluorinating Agent</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted site&#8208;selective difluoroalkoxylation of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines has been achieved using N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) as a fluorinating agent. This practical reaction has a wide range of substrate scope for both imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines and alcohols to give 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;arylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines in 65&#8208;93% yields. The reaction proceeded at room temperature, showed high functional group tolerance, and was amenable to scale&#8208;up. Based on mechanistic investigation, a radical pathway is proposed.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of N2,C3&#8208;disubstituted 2H&#8208;indazoles from readily available 2&#8208;acylazobenzenes via deoxygenation of C=O and annulation has been described. The non&#8208;noble metal catalytic system has good tolerance of functional groups, and various N2,C3&#8208;disubstituted 2H&#8208;indazoles have been constructed in 24% to 99% yield. This reaction is easy to scale&#8208;up and has shown its applications in deriving valuable fluorescent and bioactive compounds.

         <title>Exploring the Substrate Scope and Catalytic Promiscuity of Nitroreductase&#8208;like Enzymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavin&#8208;dependent nitroreductases are gaining attention as biocatalysts for the synthesis of pharmaceutically active compounds and their precursors. Here, we examined a panel of nitroreductase&#8208;like flavoenzymes for their reductase activity towards a wide variety of aromatic and aliphatic nitro compounds, nitroolefins, and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Several of these flavoenzymes displayed high reductase activity and achieved excellent conversion of diverse nitroarenes, nitroolefins and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds, accomplishing good product yields in semi&#8208;preparative scale reactions (up to 97%). In addition to the catalytic promiscuity of several of these flavoenzymes, being able to perform the reduction of nitro groups (nitroreductase activity) as well as C=C groups (ene&#8208;reductase activity), this study also revealed that some flavoenzymes exhibit high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and/or enantioselectivity, making them attractive enzymes for use in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Reactions of Ynones with Isothiocyanates for Accessing 2&#8208;Aminothiophenone and Indole&#8208;Fused/Indole&#8208;Substituted Thiophenone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A copper or silver&#8208;catalyzed cascade addition/5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization/isomerization reaction of isothiocyanate with ynone has been developed. This strategy enables the synthesis of a variety of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene&#8208;5&#8208;aminothiophen&#8208;3&#8208;one derivatives with diverse substitutions in a single vessel. The method is featured with pot&#8208;economy and high regio&#8208; and Z&#8208;selectivity. Several biologically active molecules could be modified using this strategy. Moreover, the relevant indole&#8208;fused and indole&#8208;substituted thiophenone derivatives were also assembled in one pot by merging this strategy with other bond formation methods. Based on the experiments and the related reports, a cascade pathway triggered by the addition of ynone&#8208;derived radical towards the C(sp)&#8208;atom of isothiocyanate was proposed to elucidate the probable process of the transformation.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8208;alkyl glycosides play a crucial role in various bioactive compounds. However, the synthesis of C&#8208;alkyl glycosides poses significant challenges, particularly through C(sp3)&#8208;H glycosylation. Here, we report a set of reactions for constructing C&#8208;alkyl glycosides through directing&#8208;group&#8208;mediated functionalization of unactivated &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds under mild conditions. Those reactions not only achieve high regioselectivity and stereoselectivity in glycosylation, but also exhibit a wide substrate scope. They are compatible with both arene and alkane substrates, as well as natural and unnatural amino acid substrates. Mechanistic studies have shown that the directing&#8208;group 8&#8208;aminoquinoline (AQ) and picolinamide (PA) may affect the chirality of the &#946;&#8208;carbon of L&#8208;valine through a sterically favorable trans&#8208;palladacycle intermediate, resulting in (R) or (S) configuration of glycosylated amino acid, respectively. These reactions are promising to provide a convenient and powerful tool for constructing C&#8208;alkyl glycosides and carbohydrate&#8208;based drugs in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>1&#8208;Alkynylphosphorus Compounds in Organic Synthesis&#65292;2010&#8208;2024</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the review of Yorimitsu and Oshima in 2010, the past 15 years have witnessed significant progresses in the application of 1&#8208;alkynylphosphorus compounds in organic synthesis. Owing to the reactive carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond in association with the electron&#8208;withdrawing phosphoryl group, they easily undergo transition metal&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic addition reactions at the &#946;&#8208;position with carbon&#8208; and heteroatom&#8208;based nucleophiles to afford structurally diverse 1&#8208;alkenyl phosphorus compounds.  Especially, when 1&#8208;alkynylphosphonates or phosphinates are used, intramolecular substitution reactions on P&#8208;atom might occur in some cases, which would result in the formation of P&#8208;based heterocycles. In addition, the existing triple bond makes them prone to go through addition reaction initiated cyclization reactions and [2+2], [2+3], [2+4], [2+5] and [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions with other unsaturated bonds, which provides an efficient access to various P&#8208;based heterocycles and phosphorylated carbon&#8208; and heterocycles.</dc:description>

Especially, when 1-alkynylphosphonates or phosphinates are used, intramolecular substitution reactions on P-atom might occur in some cases, which would result in the formation of P-based heterocycles. In addition, the existing triple bond makes them prone to go through addition reaction initiated cyclization reactions and [2+2], [2+3], [2+4], [2+5] and [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions with other unsaturated bonds, which provides an efficient access to various P-based heterocycles and phosphorylated carbon- and heterocycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Direct Decarboxylative Functionalization of Aromatic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl radicals are important intermediates in organic synthesis. The generation of these reactive species via direct decarboxylation of inexpensive and readily available aromatic carboxylic acids is an attractive goal. However, such a process intrinsically exhibits high energy barriers to overcome, which in consequence usually require precious metal catalysis,   stoichiometric oxidants and harsh conditions, suffering from limitations such as poor functional group tolerance and low atom economy. In recent years, visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photochemical reactions have provided new approaches to address this challenge. Three major strategies have been introduced in this emerging field: 1) one&#8208;pot in&#8208;situ activation of benzoic acids to generate intermediates such as benzoyl hypobromites or hypoiodites; 2) the use of specialized photocatalysts like biphenyl/1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene to promote decarboxylation through photo&#8208;induced electron transfer or charge transfer processes; 3) photo&#8208;induced LMCT (Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer) strategy where copper or iron salts coordinate to the carboxylate anion and generate aromatic radicals upon visible light excitation. 
On the basis of these three strategies, this review will systematically summarize the development of visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced direct decarboxylative functionalization of aromatic carboxylic acids, focusing on the reaction mechanism and substrate scope, and discuss their prospects in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

This approach consists on amidation in basic medium of tosyl group by nucleophilic substitution followed by Cu&#8208;mediated Goldberg reaction in same operation. The required &#946;&#8208;bromoenamide bearing a tosyl group was obtained by tosylation of fused brominated N,O&#8208;acetals for the first time in acidic medium using submolar amounts of PTSA.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Initiated Uranyl&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation and Hydrosulfonylation of Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study investigates the visible&#8208;light&#8208;initiated uranyl(VI)&#8208;catalyzed activation of Si&#8208;H bonds through direct hydrogen atom transfer, which facilitates the formation of silyl radicals from silanes. The silyl radical can abstract a chlorine atom from the sulfonyl chloride, leading to the generation of sulfonyl radicals. These silyl radicals and sulfonyl radicals could react with alkenes and alkynes, achieving the first example of uranyl&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation and hydrosulfonylation of unsaturated C&#8208;C bonds. This method features mild reaction conditions and a broad substrate scope, and exhibiting exceptional functional&#8208;group tolerance. Consequently, it is suitable for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Multisubstituted Hydroindole Derivatives via [3 + 2] Annulations of p&#8208;Quinamines with Nitroalkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of two stereoisomers of hydroindole derivatives was achieved through [3 + 2] annulations of p&#8208;quinamines with nitroalkenes. Catalyst&#8208;free or in the presence of DMAP, the annulation reactions were employed to produce the target products containing four contiguous stereogenic centers. This method enables efficient assessment of multisubstituted and functionalized hydroindole derivatives using readily accessible building blocks and reagents. Furthermore, the anti&#8208;inflammatory activity of some resulting hydroindoles was evaluated, with three derivative products showing effective inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Spirocyclic Compounds via Electrochemical Intramolecular Dearomatization of Benzene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The spirocyclic framework is found in many natural products, some of which are biologically active. However, It remains a challenge to develop environmentally friendly and atom&#8208;economic synthetic methods. Herein, we report an intramolecular dearomatization reaction of benzene derivatives enabled by electrochemistry&#8208;mediated two successive single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer (SET) processes, providing an alternative method for the rapid construction of spirocyclic skeletons without using sacrificial reagents. A series of cyclohexadiene products were obtained in 25&#8208;81% yields. Furthermore, a proposed mechanism involving a sequential electron transfer event was supported by cyclic voltammetry experiments. This strategy features transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions and easy handling, which will greatly enhance its practical utility.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Borobenzylation of Vinyl Arenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, catalytic difunctionalization of vinyl arenes is reported using iron salt as a catalyst without ligands. A series of substituted alkylboronic acid esters was obtained as a single regioisomer from vinyl arenes at 50 &#176;C. This multicomponent protocol enabled the formation of C&#8211;C and C&#8211;B bonds to produce boroalkylated products in a single process. A non&#8208;radical pathway is proposed for the reaction in contrast to the radical pathways of iron&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation reactions. The organoboron compounds generated from this reaction were further utilized for diverse functional group conversions.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Wavelength&#8208;Dependant Sequential Ring Transformations of Pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazolones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report new sequential wavelength&#8208;selective photochemical transformations of 1&#8208;alkenylpyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazolones to pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a][1,2]diazepines or cyclobuta[c]pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazolones. Irradiation of 1&#8208;alkenylpyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazolones with visible&#8208;light (blue LED, 457 nm) induced selective &#8216;ring switching&#8217; transformation into pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a][1,2]diazepines, which, upon irradiation with UV A light (black LED, 365 nm) underwent electrocyclisation into cyclobuta[c]pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazolones. Due to the very narrow irradiation wavelength now available from OLED sources, the selective formation of either 5,7&#8208;bicyclic or 5,5,4&#8208;tricyclic ring systems from the 5,5&#8208;bicyclic starting material is possible simply by changing the wavelength of the irradiation source. The transformations took place under mild conditions in the absence of additives or photocatalysts. Mechanistic studies indicate that these transformations proceed through the formation of an excited triplet state of the substrate, followed by selective homolytic C(1)&#8211;N(8) bond cleavage, intersystem crossing, and cyclization of the zwitterionic intermediate on the ground potential energy surface. Subsequent photoinduced disrotatory stereospecific 4&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization of the 5,7&#8208;bicyclic systems leads to 3D&#8208;rich 5,5,4&#8208;tricyclic products.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Allylation of Cyclic Ketones with Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric &#945;&#8208;allylation of ketones is a particularly useful tool for constructing stereocenters via C&#8722;C bond formation. However, this type of reaction often necessitated the use of activated ketones or pre&#8208;prepared enol intermediates as substrates. In this study, we developed a nickel&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;allylation of unactivated cycloketones with allylic alcohols to synthesize chiral cycloketones with an &#945;&#8208;quaternary carbon center. The reaction affords the products with 42&#8211;97% yields, 72&#8211;86% ee, and no additive is needed, and the only by&#8208;product is water.

Abstract
The development of novel strained spiro heterocycles (SSHs) as bioisosteres for aromatic or non&#8208;strained aliphatic rings is highly sought after for improving drug design. Their high molecular rigidity and predictable vectorization can enhance drug&#8208;likeness, target selectivity and clinical success. Towards this goal, 1&#8208;oxa&#8208;2,6&#8208;diazaspiro[3.3]heptane (ODASE) is reported as a novel potential SSH&#8208;bioisostere. We demonstrate through theoretical studies the potential of this strained spiro heterocycle to act as a bioisostere for piperazine. We have developed its synthesis from the highly strained azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl intermediate through a robust and mild flow technology&#8208;assisted two&#8208;step protocol. Its tolerance and stability towards medicinally relevant N&#8208;functionalisation protocols are studied, as well as its mild reduction to the C3&#8208;aminoalkylazetidinol motif found in the anti&#8208;cancer drug cobimetinib.

         <title>Tandem Enantioselective Cycloaromatization/Intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts Desymmetrization of Cyclohexadienones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An enantioselective tandem sequence that comprises a cycloaromatization process followed by an intramolecular desymmetrizing Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of functionalized cyclohexadienones has been accomplished. The process takes place in good yields (65&#8211;95%), with excellent diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1) and enantiomeric ratios up to 90.5:9.5 in the presence of (R)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived N&#8208;triflyl phosphoramides, and it gains access to a family of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives in a simple manner, with the simultaneous generation of two vicinal stereocenters, one of them a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter.

Abstract
A direct visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted radical&#8208;triggered tandem cyclization of 1,7&#8208;diene systems with cyclic sulfonium salts by using copper(I)&#8208;based complexes as photoredox catalyst is developed. With this approach, a variety of sulfur&#8208;containing polycyclic derivatives are prepared through alkylation/6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization/5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization of 1,7&#8208;diene systems under mild conditions. In addition, the photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening of cyclic sulfonium salts provides the alkyl radical intermediates, which prefers addition to the C&#8722;C double bond that connected to the aromatic ring rather than the electron&#8208;deficient vinyl in 1,7&#8208;dienes. Moreover, oxidation of the desired sulfur&#8208;containing polycyclic products provides a strategy for the preparation of remote nitrogen&#8208;fused polycyclic substituted sulfoxide or sulfone&#8208;containing derivatives.

         <title>Manganese Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Hydroxymethylation to 2&#8208;Pyridones and Isoquinolones via C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Pyridine&#8208;directed regioselective C&#8722;H hydroxymethylation to pyridones and isoquinolones using para&#8208;formaldehyde has been developed under manganese catalysis, offering a wide variety of hydroxymethylated products in 40&#8211;85% yields. This operationally simple methodology proceeds in one step using an earth&#8208; abundant first&#8208;row transition metal&#8208;catalyst without the generation of unwanted salt wastes. A mechanistic study revealed that the C&#8722;H metalation step is reversible but not the rate&#8208;determining step.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyridine-directed regioselective C&#8722;H hydroxymethylation to pyridones and isoquinolones using &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-formaldehyde has been developed under manganese catalysis, offering a wide variety of hydroxymethylated products in 40&#8211;85% yields. This operationally simple methodology proceeds in one step using an earth- abundant first-row transition metal-catalyst without the generation of unwanted salt wastes. A mechanistic study revealed that the C&#8722;H metalation step is reversible but not the rate-determining step. The introduction of hydroxymethyl group in the biologically relevant scaffolds could be used as an intermediate for valuable synthetic transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
2&#8208;(chalcogen)benzothiazoles are frequently used as core structures for the development of pharmaceutical agents. A strategy for the synthesis of 2&#8208;(chalcogen)benzothiazoles under electrooxidative conditions using isocyanides, thiols or diselenides as substrates was developed. This protocol allows access to structurally diverse 2&#8208;(chalcogen)benzothiazoles in good yields and with good functional group tolerance, which does not require heavy metal catalysts and exogenous oxidants. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale synthesis was performed to demonstrate the scale&#8208;up applicability of this reaction.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Reductive Alkylative Cyclization of 1,6&#8208;Enynes with Alkyl Bromides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive alkylative cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes with alkyl bromides has been developed. This transformation avoids the use of stoichiometric organometallic reagents and introduces alkyl groups regio&#8208; and stereoselectively into the products. This method provides a platform for the synthesis of carbo&#8208; and heterocycles that are widely found in many natural products and biologically active molecules.

         <title>Electrochemically Induced Desulfurization of Thioureas for the Synthesis of Substituted 5&#8208;Aminotetrazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A one&#8208;pot method has been developed for synthesizing diverse substituted 5&#8208;aminotetrazoles via the electrochemically induced desulfurizative addition&#8211;cyclization of thioureas with azidotrimethylsilane. This methodology enables the construction of C&#8722;N and N&#8722;N bonds under mild reaction conditions without transition metal catalysts or external oxidizing agents. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated by its broad substrate scope, compatibility with various functional groups, scalability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and practicality evidenced by the synthesis of an antibacterial agent.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted chemodivergent phosphorylation&#8208;peroxidation and oxyphosphorylation of alkenes with phosphine oxides and HOOtBu was realized under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. Using the commercially available Eosin Y as a SET&#8208;photocatalyst, the &#946;&#8208;peroxy&#8208;phosphine oxides were selectively obtained with a catalytic amount of base, while the addition of acid led to the exclusive formation of &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;phosphine oxides control experiments showed that Eosin Y could also act as a HAT&#8208;catalyst to induce the O&#8722;O bond cleavage of peroxides under acidic conditions.

         <title>Synthesis and HHDH&#8208;Catalyzed Kinetic Resolution of Propargylic Epoxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The versatile reactivity of propargylic epoxides and alcohols, due to the presence of a triple bond, is used in the synthesis of various organic compounds and building blocks. However, there are not many known methods for the preparation of optically pure propargylic epoxides and alcohols, and the existing ones often require specific reagents. Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) can be used to obtain enantiomerically pure compounds from racemic epoxides. These important biocatalysts facilitate epoxide ring&#8208;opening reactions with unnatural nucleophiles such as azides. Here we report the first biocatalytic transformation of propargylic epoxides using HHDHs. Six propargylic epoxides with different substituents were synthesized. Kinetic resolution reactions catalyzed by HHDHs in the presence of azide were performed. Two enzymes with opposite stereoselectivities, HheC and HheA2&#8208;N178A were used and yielded azido alcohols (98 &#8208; &gt;99% ee, E&#8208;value &gt;200) and epoxides (up to 88% ee). Best performing p&#8208;tolyl propargylic epoxide derivative was used in a sequence of two enzymatic reactions to obtain both enantiomers of the secondary alcohol and (R)&#8208;primary alcohol in &gt; 99% ee, respectively, through complete conversion of the starting epoxide. The obtained azido alcohols were used in further transformations. Click reactions with terminal acetylenes gave triazolyl propargylic alcohols (&gt;99% ee, up to 98% yield). In the case of primary azido alcohol, the click reaction was followed by intramolecular cyclization to form the dihydrofuranyl triazole motif that is found in biologically active compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling between Alkylidenecyclopropanes and Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of a Pd(0) source and a phosphoramidite ligand promotes a formal allylic cross&#8208;coupling between alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) and boronic acids to yield synthetically appealing 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes. Remarkably, the reaction proceeds both under neutral and basic conditions, and works with both aryl&#8208; and alkenylboronic acids. 
DFT calculations suggest that the reaction entails a C&#8208;C activation/protonation mechanism instead of a hydropalladation pathway, such as has been proposed for other metal&#8208;promoted hydrofunctionalizations of ACPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Approach Toward Mesoionic 1,2,3&#8208;Triazole 1&#8208;Imines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic electrochemistry may establish direct routes to a preparation of a plethora of organic substances, which are hardly accessible by conventional experimental techniques. Herein, we present an electrochemically&#8208;driven method for an assembly of a broad range of rare heterocyclic mesoionic entities &#8211; 1,2,3&#8208;triazole 1&#8208;imines. These nitrogen heterocycles were prepared through a transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and exogenous oxidant&#8208;free strategy using a C/Ni electrode pair. Over 30 examples of thus synthesized 1,2,3&#8208;triazole 1&#8208;imines illustrate selectivity and practical utility of this approach. Key solvent&#8208;controlled reactivity patterns for the formation of the triazole imine scaffold were revealed indicating a modulation ability of the developed approach. These experimental findings were additionally justified based on cyclic voltammetry (CV) data and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover, according to differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data, some of the prepared 1,2,3&#8208;triazole 1&#8208;imines correspond to the thermally stable species with an onset decomposition temperature up to 190 oC.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Metal hydride catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) reaction of 1,6&#8208;enyne and electron&#8208;poor alkene progresses through a radical cascade, involving ene&#8208;yne cyclization and exocyclic C&#8208;C bond formation superseding the direct reductive olefin cross&#8208;coupling; which is realized in the current study.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Mediated Carbamoyl Amination of Alkylidenecyclopropane&#8208;Tethered Carbamoyl Chlorides: Synthesis of Functionalized 2&#8208;Quinolones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transition metal catalyzed cyclization of alkene&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chloride has now emerged as a vital tool to construct oxindoles bearing all carbon quaternary centers. However, most of these reactions proceed via carbometalation&#8208;initiated 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization followed by nucleophilic trapping of the resulting &#963; alkyl&#8208;metal species to achieve diverse functionalized oxindoles. The 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig type cyclization of alkene&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chloride has been rarely reported. Herein, a zinc&#8208;mediated carbamoyl amination of alkylidenecyclopropane&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides with anilines for the synthesis of functionalized 2&#8208;quinolones was developed. A range of different substituted 2&#8208;quinolones were prepared in 65&#8208;89% yields from alkylidenecyclopropane&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides and aniline derivatives using Zn/TMSCl system.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A direct electrochemical redox reaction involving radical cross&#8208;coupling cyclization for the synthesis of pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxaline derivatives from 1&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrroles and CH3CN has been developed, which includes the functionalization of C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds as well as the construction of C&#8208;C and C&#8208;N bonds. Notably, the control and deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments suggest that CH3CN in this reaction acts as both a carbon source via C&#8208;C cleavage and solvent.

         <title>New Synthetic Approaches for the Construction of Enantioenriched Molecules Bearing Quaternary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optically active molecule architectures stand as an important class of organic compounds and occupy a key role in academic and industrial communities. Particularly, the molecules bearing quaternary carbon are of vital importance because of its favorable conformation and valuable three&#8208;dimensional molecules, which frequently play a key role in a broad spectrum of functional materials, pharmaceutical relevant natural molecules, and agrochemicals. Over the past few decades, a large amount of synthetic strategies for the enantioselective construction of compounds with chiral quaternary carbon centers have been the focus of a number of research initiatives. In this review, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art toward the synthesis of enantioenriched molecules bearing quaternary stereocenters are summarized, which could be segmented into four categories: 1) Construction of optically active quaternary carbon centers by addition to prochiral sp2 carbon; 2) Construction of optically active all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via substitution at non&#8208;chiral tetra&#8208;substituted carbon; 3) Construction of optically active all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via kinetic resolution; 4) Construction of optically active all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via desymmetrization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Formate Salts: The Rediscovery of Their Radical Reaction under Light Irradiation Opens New Avenues in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formates are abundantly available and inexpensive commodity chemical, widely used in laboratory and industrial organic synthesis. Formates are promising hydrogen carrier and green C1 source, and have also been a subject of research as SET re&#8208;ductants in recent years. Compared to the toxic and flammable gas carbon monoxide, which also serves as a C1 source, for&#8208;mates are easier to handle, store, and transport, and are more environmentally friendly. Therefore, in recent studies of radical reactions, formate is not only as an ideal source of green carbonyl, 	which is of great significance to synthesize carboxyl compounds with various structures, but also as a SET reductant for editing organic molecules either in scientific research or industrial production. The activation and conversion of formate, as a source of C1 or a SET reductant, is a very challenging and hot research field in organic synthesis.

         <dc:description>The replacement of benzene rings with saturated bioisosteric counterparts is a key priority in drug discovery programs, and disubstituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes have been recognized as flexible molecular scaffolds that could act as &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;substituted benzene bioisosteres. In this study, we outline the synthesis of a wide range of 2&#8208;substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexan&#8208;1&#8208;ols, which have the potential to emulate &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenolic derivatives, via SmI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;mediated reductive cyclization reactions. The synthetic utility of this methodology was exemplified by the preparation of several saturated analogs of pharmaceutically relevant compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Shaking Up the Friedl&#228;nder Reaction: Rapid, Scalable Mechanochemical Synthesis of Polyaryl&#8208;substituted Quinolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quinolines are a ubiquitous heterocyclic aromatic scaffold, which can be found in many natural and synthetic products. They are highly valued for their pharmacological and electrochemical properties, encouraging the discovery of new routes for quinoline synthesis and diversification. Polyaryl&#8208;substituted quinolines have recently surged as useful substrates for a wide variety of applications, yet their synthetic routes remain difficult and inefficient. Herein, we report a rapid and novel mechanochemical Friedl&#228;nder synthesis of polyaryl&#8208;substituted quinolines under basic conditions using ball milling. Optimized reaction conditions result in moderate to excellent yields ranging from 69% to &gt;95% and demonstrates broad functional group tolerance at 1 hour reaction times. We further demonstrate a new route for the synthesis of photocatalyst DPQN2,4&#8208;di&#8208;OMe and photo&#8208;ligand PPQN2,4&#8208;di&#8208;OMe as well as OLED donor&#8208;acceptor pCzPPQ, electron transport material oligoquinoline TQB and organic semiconductor DPA. A gram&#8208;scale reaction was also achieved using Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM), providing an isolated yield of 87% after a simple recrystallization in ethanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium Catalysts Based on Phenyl Substituted Cp Ligands for Indole Synthesis via Oxidative Coupling of Acetanilides and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling of acetanilides and alkynes via C&#8208;H activation is the most powerful synthetic tool for producing the indole motif from commercially available precursors. However, this reaction usually requires large catalyst loadings (5 mol% of rhodium). In this study, a 1,2&#8208;diphenylcyclopentadienyl ligand&#8208;based catalyst was developed that works well at 1 mol% loading of rhodium. DFT calculations of the C&#8208;H activation step provided insight into its high catalytic activity. The catalyst efficiency was also demonstrated in the synthesis of naturally occurring isocoumarins, such as polygonolide, tubakialactone B and penicimarine F. The developed catalytic protocols tolerate a wide range of functional groups, for example, halide, nitro, hydroxy, and alkoxy.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Ladderanes by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclodimerization of Allenynes: Scope and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a Ni&#8208;catalyzed cyclodimerization of 1,6&#8208;allenyenes which affords pentacyclic derivatives containing a [3]&#8208;ladderane. Six new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds are formed in a single operation which is fully atom&#8208;economical. The reaction proceeds with an inexpensive catalyst and shows a broad scope in the alkyne, the allene and the tethering group. A computational and experimental study on the reaction mechanism suggests that this process proceeds by oxidative cyclometallation of the allenyne coordinated to Ni(0) followed by reductive elimination leading to cyclobutenes. Then, two of these molecules are coupled following a related cyclometallation&#8208;reductive elimination sequence, the latter being the rate&#8208;limiting step.</dc:description>

         <title>Contrasting Facial Selectivity of a Squaramide&#8208;Tagged Proline in the Asymmetric Michael Addition of Ketones to Maleimides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A squaramide moiety was introduced at the C&#8208;4 position of proline to afford an organocatalyst that served as a stereocontrol element to promote the asymmetric Michael addition of cyclic ketones to maleimides. A variety of chiral succinimides were obtained by the conjugate addition in 84&#8208;98% yield accompanied by 58&#8208;96% enantioselectivity. The results also include an interesting contrast in the facial selectivity observed with cyclohexanones and cycloheptanones, whereas an asymmetric desymmetrization of 4&#8208;alkyl cyclohexanones was also achieved using the transformation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Trimethyl phosphite promotes the synthesis 2,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted 2H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. The protocol developed affords a two&#8208;step method towards triazoles from available reagents. 3,4&#8208;Disubstituted isoxazolones are initially coupled with diazonium tetrafluoroborates. The subsequent reaction is triggered by a single electron transfer from the phosphite to the diazenylisoxazolone under heating or blue LED irradiation at room temperature. The radical anion cascade proceeds via the &#8220;ring opening/decarboxylation/cyclization&#8221; sequence. The synthesized triazoles show promising fluorescence in the region from 340 nm to 450 nm with a quantum yield up to 81.6%. The emission energy depends slightly on the substituent nature at the triazole carbon atoms.  If an electron&#8208;donor group is introduced into the N2 substituent of the triazole ring, it results in a bathochromic shift of the luminescence energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Photocatalytic Pathways for Reductive Dearomatizations of N&#8208;Arylformylindoles by a Visible&#8208;light Triplet Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light triplet photocatalyst 5&#8208;acetyl&#8208;2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;benzoic acid methyl ester (AcBSH) was developed through introducing acetyl into benzenethiolate to improve the efficiency of intersystem crossing (ISC) and using o&#8208;methoxyformyl to increase the molar extinction coefficient. In the photocatalytic system of AcBSH, the reductive dearomatization of N&#8208;arylformylindoles is achieved to afford the desired indolines in moderate to excellent yields, including both indoles without (1) and with 2&#8208;substituent (2). The 2&#8208;substituent is a steric hindrance for the conjugation between benzoyl and indole moiety, and makes indole 2 and indole 1 exhibit different reduction potentials (Ered) and different triplet energy levels (&#916;ET). Thereby, two kinds of substrates undergo primarily two photocatalytic pathways: i) successive SET/protonation pathway, which merging photosensitization via triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (EnT) and photoinduced SET for substrates 1, and ii) single electron transfer (SET) from the triplet photocatalyst and a concerted hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process for substrates 2.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Dearomatic 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;7&#8208;azaspiro[4.5]decane Derivatives through Gold and Palladium Relay Catalytic Tandem Cyclization of Enynamides with Vinyl Benzoxazinanones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a diastereoselective Au/Pd relay catalytic tandem cyclization reaction to produce dearomatic 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;7&#8208;azaspiro[4.5]decane derivatives under mild conditions. This process involves generating furan&#8208;derived azadiene from readily available enynamide, followed by a [2 + 4] cycloaddition with Pd&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl dipole decarboxylated from vinyl benzoxazinanone. Our method efficiently constructs the spiro[4.5]decane skeleton, achieving yields ranging from 31&#8208;97% and diastereoselectivities from 6:1 dr to &gt;20:1 dr across 34 examples. This research introduces new cycloaddition sites for azadienes as 1,2&#8208;dipoles and offers a reliable approach for constructing oxa&#8208;azaspiro[4.5]decane frameworks.</dc:description>

Herein, structure&#8208;guided rational design of short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase LfSDR1 was adopted to improve the catalytic performance for enantioselective synthesis of (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;HPA at high substrate loading. The crystal structures of LfSDR1 in its apo form as well as in complex with NADPH were solved, which were used for mutagenesis studies and illustration mechanism. Three residues (G92, E141 and V186) were identified as hotspots by structural analysis, and variants V186A/G92V and V186A/G92V/E141L with remarkably improved activity were obtained. By molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of WT and variants, G92V plays a key role in enzyme&#8208;substrate interaction in the binding pocket. Whole cells expressing the mutant LfSDR1&#8208;V186A/G92V and glucose dehydrogenase BsGDH from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; were used as the catalyst, and up to 200 g L&#8208;1 substrate without cosolvent was completely converted to (R)&#8208;HPA with 99.9% ee and a high space&#8208;time yield (STY) of 800 g L&#8208;1 day&#8208;1.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Formal Addition of Aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds to Alkenes via Phenyl Radical Involved Intermolecular HAT</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A copper catalyzed aerobic formal addition of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds to alkenes via a phenyl radical mediated intermolecular HAT process is reported herein, in which the phenylhydrazine not only acts as a HAT reagent precursor, but also as a hydrogen atom donor. This reaction affords an alternative method for the direct formal addition of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds to alkenes utilizing air as the radical initiator without additional reductants at ambient temperature. A variety of alkanes and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes are successfully incorporated, furnishing a series of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H formal addition products in 20&#8211;93% yield. Preliminary mechanistic studies show that the 2&#8208;tetrahydrofuranyl and phenyl radical are formed in this reaction.

A palladium&#8208;catalyzed [4+4] cycloaddition of aryl&#8208;substituted &#947;&#8208;methylidene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactones (GMDVs) with divinylketones (DVKs) was developed, providing an approach to access various mono&#8208;cyclic tetrahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;oxocines with diverse substituents in 41% to 95% yield with 81:19 to &gt;20:1 dr. This reaction was facilitated by anchoring olefin (C=C), carbonyl (C=O), and arene (Ar) at the &#945;&#8208;position of carbonyls.

         <title>Iodine Mediated Annulation of Triethylamine, Aldehydes and 2&#8208;Aminopyridines for the Synthesis of 3&#8208;Formyl&#8208;Imidazo [1,2&#8208;a]pyridine Derivatives</title>

Abstract
With triethylamine as a synthon, an alternative method for the synthesis of 3&#8208;formyl imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines has been accomplished from aldehydes, and 2&#8208;aminopyridines. The reaction proceeded via iodine&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N bond cleavage of triethylamine, generation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde in&#8197;situ, and oxidative cyclization with air as the oxygen source. This protocol may facilitate the synthesis of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives and provide a reference for the usage of triethylamine as a synthon.

&lt;p&gt;With triethylamine as a synthon, an alternative method for the synthesis of 3-formyl imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines has been accomplished from aldehydes, and 2-aminopyridines. The reaction proceeded &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; iodine-catalyzed C&#8722;N bond cleavage of triethylamine, generation of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-unsaturated aldehyde in&#8197;situ, and oxidative cyclization with air as the oxygen source. This protocol may facilitate the synthesis of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives and provide a reference for the usage of triethylamine as a synthon.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
It remains a challenge to achieve regioselectivity and stereoselectivity in the synthesis of dihydropyranone derivatives. Herein, an Ir/Pd&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative allylic (amino)ketalization was disclosed to prepare dihydropyranone derivatives in regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities under mild conditions, resulting in O&#8208; and N&#8208;allylative products. It provided a strategy for the post&#8208;modifications of dihydropyranone derivatives.

Abstract
The oxaspiro&#8208;phthalides ([n,5]&#8208;oxaspirobenzalactones) bearing a phthalide spirofused to a cyclic&#8208;ether of various sizes are frameworks found in bioactive natural products. The discovery and development of an alkynyl&#8208;Prins cyclization based, strategy for the construction of structurally interesting, medicinally useful [5,5]&#8208;[6,5]&#8208;, and [7,5]&#8208;oxaspirophthalides is reported in this manuscript. Our strategy represents a report on the construction of oxaspiro&#8208;phthalides using the alkynyl&#8208;Prins cyclization. This approach exhibits broad substrate scope with respect to carbonyl compounds and 2&#8208;(alkynol)benzoates, with yields ranging between 43&#8211;98%. Isolation of intermediate, and further conversion of it to the end&#8208;product supported the proposed mechanistic pathway.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Vicarious&#8208;Type Nucleophilic Amination of Heterocyclic N&#8208;Oxides with Organic Azides.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture, provided by Singh, Park, Kim, and co&#8208;workers, illustrates the synthetic method for the vicarious&#8208;type nucleophilic amination of azine N&#8208;oxides and cyclic iminoamides using iminyl anions, readily generated from organic azides under basic conditions. The formation of iminyl anions and site&#8208;selective nucleophilic aromatic substitution in this process were supported by a series of mechanistic investigations including DFT calculations. The utility of C2&#8208;aminated products was highlighted by the photocatalytic reduction of a N&#8208;oxide group and the formation of a five&#8208;membered iridacycle. More details can be found in Update by Singh, Park, Kim, and co&#8208;workers (J. Min, S. Min, E. Chung, K. Moon, H. S. Kim, T. Jeong, A. Rakshit, P. Singh, J. S. Park, I. S. Kim, Adv. Synth.

         <dc:description>The combination of a gold(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complex and an ene&#8208;reductase (ERED) has made possible the synthesis of enantiopure &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones in a one&#8208;pot concurrent approach. The protocol consists of the Meyer&#8208;Schuster rearrangement of racemic propargylic tertiary alcohols using [1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene]&#8208;[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)&#8208;imide]gold(I) (IPrAuNTf2), followed by asymmetric alkene reduction of the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone intermediate using the Zymomonas mobilis ERED (NCR&#8208;ERED). The chemoenzymatic cascade was optimised with a model substrate, where E/Z&#8208;isomers both generated the (R)&#8208;ketone, which was rationalised using in silico molecular docking experiments. The cascade was then applied towards the production of a series of (R)&#8208;4&#8208;substituted&#8208;alkan&#8208;2&#8208;ones in enantiopure form in a straightforward manner.</dc:description>

Abstract
A convenient cyano source for the nucleophilic 1,4&#8208;addition to enones and 1,2&#8208;addition to imines has been developed, by generating the cyano unit in&#8197;situ. via the TCT&#8208;assisted dehydration of formamide. This protocol distinguishes itself by transition&#8208;metal/ligand free conditions, compatibility with 1,4&#8208;/1,2&#8208;addition, readily available substrates and versatile synthetic utilities of the cyanated products.

Abstract
A de novo synthesis of cyclobutene&#8208;fused indoline derivatives via thermally induced intramolecular cyclization was reported. This approach efficiently yields valuable high&#8208;strained cyclobute[b]indolines in moderate to high yields and enables further transformation into other valuable heterocycles, demonstrating its potential in organic synthesis.

         <title>Intramolecular Buchner Reaction: Experimental and Theoretical Comparison of the Effect of the Carbene Substituent on the Chemoselectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The intramolecular Buchner reaction is a powerful transformation able to dearomatize benzenic rings. However, the competitive C&#8722;H insertion of the carbene moiety into benzylic positions still remains a limitation, and the reasons governing this uncomplete chemoselectivity are poorly understood. The carbene substitution, in particular, has been observed to influence the selectivity strongly, though the currently proposed explanation relying on the electrophilicity of the metallocarbene hardly describes some experimental results reported in the literature. In this article, we present our experimental observations of intramolecular rhodium&#8208;catalyzed Buchner reactions, combined with DFT calculations on selected carbene substituents, to propose a complementary explanation for the observed chemoselectivity modification.

         <dc:description>We have developed a method for the synthesis of thieno[3,2&#8208;b]furans on the basis of a strategy consisting of a formal [3+2] cycloaddition utilizing the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement and a subsequent Br&#248;nsted base&#8208;mediated cyclization. The method streamlines access to a wide range of well&#8208;organized 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted thieno[3,2&#8208;b]furans that are otherwise difficult to synthesize and is also applicable to the syntheses of 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted seleno[3,2&#8208;b]furans.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Substitution using Nucleophilic Amines: Access to Functionalized Mono&#8208; and Bis&#8208;N&#8208;Allyl Synthons</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We here report a catalytic strategy to enable the decarboxylative allylic amination of vinyl cyclic carbonates using various aliphatic and nucleophilic amines. The use of a protic medium and chelating diphosphine ligands is a main driver towards chemo&#8208;selective allylic
amine formation, thereby minimizing undesired ligand&#8208;driven complex speciation and aminolysis of the involved substrate. This improved approach amplifies the repertoire of allylic amine synthons that can be prepared from a variety of substrate combinations.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Regioselective Aldol Reaction of Hydroxyacetone with Aliphatic Aldehydes for the Synthesis of Linear Products</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we present an organocatalyst that addresses the reactivity issue of aliphatic aldehydes with hydroxyacetone, leading to the formation of a linear product. Previous proline&#8208;based catalysts required a significant excess of hydroxyacetone and could only be applied to aromatic aldehydes. The proposed sulphonamide containing a proline moiety effectively controls the reaction, generating a new stereogenic center dependent on the catalyst&#8216;s configuration and does not require a large excess of the ketone. We demonstrated that this methodology can be effectively utilized in the synthesis of natural compounds, as confirmed by obtaining the 2&#8208;keto&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;gluconic acid (KDG) methyl ester from optically pure glyceraldehyde and protected hydroxyacetone.
