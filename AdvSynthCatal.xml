         <title>Recent Advances in the Total Synthesis of &lt;i&gt;Aspidosperma&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Kopsia&lt;/i&gt; Alkaloids Using Tetracyclic Pyridocarbazoles as Versatile Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past decades, &lt;i&gt;aspidosperma&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;kopsia&lt;/i&gt; alkaloids have attracted significant interest by the organic synthetic community owing to their intricate fused&#8208;ring structures and broad biological activities. Consequently, numerous strategically distinct total syntheses have been accomplished, among which tetracyclic pyridocarbazoles have seen widespread adoption as versatile building blocks. In this review, we elaborate and discuss the synthesis of such tetracyclic pyridocarbazoles according to the different approaches for the establishment of the all&#8208;carbon quaternary center at C5. These includes (1) classic synthetic reactions (cycloaddition, Michael addition, nucleophilic substitution, and Claisen rearrangement), (2) palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric decarboxylative allylation reactions, and (3) thiourea&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Michael addition reactions. Furthermore, we also describe the late&#8208;stage key transformations in the realm of the total syntheses of aspidosperma and kopsia alkaloids.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Regioselective Direct C2, C4 Difunctionalization and C2, C4, C6 Trifunctionalization of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports the invention of di&#8208; or trifunctionalization of readily available pyridines (including all the pyridine substrates utilized in this paper, such as 3&#8208;cyanopyridine, 3&#8208;chloropyridine) through dearomative functionalization&#8208;oxidative rearomatization under transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and reductant&#8208;free conditions. Although a two&#8208;step operation is required, the crude product of the first step could be used in the next step directly. Typically, 3&#8208;&#960;&#8208;EWG pyridines undergo difunctionalization, whereas 3&#8208;&#963;&#8208;EWG pyridines participate in trifunctionalization, affording multisubstituted piperidines. Computational studies provide detailed insights for their distinct reactivity in the title reaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed domino cyclization/direct aminosulfonylation of aryl iodides with amines via the insertion of SO2 (from SOgen) was presented. This method could produce a series of oxindole&#8208;based sulfonamides in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields. A scale&#8208;up reaction and two  synthetic applications demonstrated the robustness and practicality of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Conjugate Addition of &#945;&#8208;Substituted Acyl Imidazoles to Nitroalkenes Catalyzed by Nickel Bisoxazoline and B(C6F5)3</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A diastereoselective and enantioselective conjugate addition of &#945;&#8208;substituted acyl&#8208;imidazole to nitroalkene catalyzed by nickel&#8208;bisoxazoline complex and B(C6F5)3 has been developed. This reaction tolerated a wide range of acyl&#8208;imidazoles and nitroalkenes, affording a series of conjugate adducts in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. The use of strong Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 as co&#8208;catalyst proved vital to the success of this process. The potential scalability and utility of the current protocol are demonstrated by a 3 mmol scale reaction and further transformations of the product.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general photocatalytic substrate&#8208;controlled chemodivergent strategy starting from monoalkynes with polyhalomethanes such as BrCCl3 and CBr4 was develop, enabling Kharasch&#8208;type addition/nucleophilic substitution cascade to selectively produce &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;dihalovinyl ketones and chromen&#8208;2&#8208;ones with moderate to good yields. Use of monoalkynes without additional nucleophilic sites furnished &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;dihalovinyl ketones through a Kharasch&#8208;type addition and intermolecular allylic substitution cascade whereas the latter transformation of 2&#8208;ethynylphenols allowed the full breaking of carbon&#8208;halogen bonds of BrCX3 to access functionalized chromen&#8208;2&#8208;ones.

         <title>Synthesis of 1&#8208;Aryl Isoquinolinones or o&#8208;Diaryl Pyrimidines via Bismuth Triflate&#8208;Mediated Intermolecular Annulation of Arylacetic Acids with Nitroarylaldehydes or Trimethoxybenzene in the Presence of Acetonitrile</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this article, bismuth triflate (Bi(OTf)3)&#8208;controlled intermolecular multi&#8208;component condensation of oxygenated arylacetic acids with electron&#8208;withdrawing nitroarylaldehydes or electron&#8208;donating trimethoxybenzene provide 1&#8208;aryl isoquinolinones or o&#8208;diaryl pyrimidines in acetonitrile at 60 oC. The uses of various metal triflates and reaction conditions are investigated under the one&#8208;pot reaction.

         <dc:description>The previous strategies for oxidative cleavage of 2,3&#8208;double bond of substituted indoles generally suffered from usage of heavy metals, stoichiometric chemical oxidants or hash conditions. Herein, we reported an electrochemistry&#8208;driven aerobic cleavage of C(2)=C(3)/C(2)&#8208;N bonds of indoles. Through an undivided cell, various indoles and its derivatives can be converted into the corresponding ortho&#8208;amino aryl ketones. This method features metal&#8208;free, air&#8208;as&#8208;oxidant and easy scalability.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkyne&#8208;based syntheses of carbo&#8208; and heterohelicenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[n]Helicenes are polycyclic aromatic molecules in which n ortho&#8208;condensed benzene or other aromatic rings give rise to helical chiral and highly conjugated structures. Unique screw shape, helically extended &#960;&#8208;system and intriguing electronic and chirooptical properties of these molecules have attracted scientific interest for decades. The applications of helicenes have now expanded into several fields including material science, nanoscience, biochemistry, supramolecular and polymer chemistry. Despite the great theoretical and practical interest in helicenes, their synthesis remains a challenge. Among synthetic approaches to helicenes, alkyne cyclizations have great potential since carbon&#8208;rich high&#8208;energy alkynes can form aromatic rings via cycloisomerizations. These processes are atom&#8208;economic. In addition, alkyne reactions are highly favorable thermodynamically.  This review is focused on the alkyne&#8208;based syntheses of carbo&#8208; and heterohelicenes (2000&#8208;2022). These syntheses are obviously multistage. In the review, they are systematized in terms of the key step leading to the formation of a helical shape. The methods are grouped into two categories: 1) metal&#8208;free syntheses and 2) transition metal&#8208;catalyzed syntheses. This division is very arbitrary as far as catalytic Sonogashira, Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions and others are often used to prepare starting materials in the syntheses of the first group. The largest number of publications on the topic is related to the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed syntheses of helicenes.</dc:description>

Abstract
We herein developed a protocol for the asymmetric synthesis of artificial AAs featuring a 3&#8208;spiropyrrolidine oxindole skeletal with continuous tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenters by a 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction of in&#8197;situ generated azomethine ylides with a chiral dehydroalanine Ni(II) complex. A three&#8208;component reaction of the Ni(II) complex with various isatins and AAs in green solvent (ethanol) provided series of diastereomeric complexes with high dr (&gt;20:1) in 40&#8211;86% yields. The formation of different regioisomers in the case of sarcosine and proline was explained using quantum chemical calculation. The acidic decomposition of the obtained Ni(II) complexes led to the target unnatural complex AAs with a 3&#8208;spiropyrrolidine oxindole core. The chiral auxiliary ligand was recovered after decomposition and reused for the synthesis of the starting dehydroalanine complex&#8208;substrate.

         <title>Cu(I) Mediated Azidation of Halobenzenes, and Cu Catalysed Selective Azide Reduction to Corresponding Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl amines are synthesized from halobenzenes via copper mediated reactions employing sodium azide under mild conditions in ethanol/water. The reaction proceeds stepwise via the aryl azide, which is reduced to the corresponding amine in&#8208;situ. The methodology allows syntheses of amines from corresponding para&#8208;, meta&#8208; and ortho&#8208;bromobenzenes bearing electron withdrawing groups. Bifunctional halobenzenes bearing alkanoyl chains with terminal bromides are selectively transformed, generating an aniline and an aliphatic azide, as this azide position is stable to reduction. A one&#8208;pot multistep sequence for preparation of the target amines was designed. The azide formation is mediated by CuI while elemental Cu is generated simultaneously, which is deposited onto the employed PTFE stirring bar used in the reaction. The Cu films were quantified and analysed by SEM/EDS. The Cu, either deposited or in solution, is responsible for the azide reduction, possibly involving nitrene intermediates. An application of the modified stirring bars as a heterogeneous catalyst for a click reaction is demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into the Stereocontrol of DNA Polymerase&#8208;Catalysed Reaction by Chiral Cobalt Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Enantiomers of chiral substances typically have distinct biological activities, thus, the explorations of biochemical processes at the enantiomeric level has very high significance. This study investigated DNA polymerase&#8211;catalyzed reaction modulated by various types of chiral cobalt complexes. The experimental data showed that polymerase reactions were inhibited or accelerated in the presence of K[Co(edta)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O or [Co(en)3]I3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O. More importantly, the stereocontrol of bioreactivity was found to be different for the enantiomers, which was reflected in their ability to bind to the polymerase reaction system. The docking simulation illustrated that the acceleration or inhibition of polymerase reaction could be correlated with diverse electrostatic energy induced by the attached metal chelates, whereas the different stereocontrol of bioreactivity for the enantiomers was attributed to a discrepancy of Van der Waals interactions between the enantiomer and polymerase catalytic sites.

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Enantioselective Halohydrin Dehalogenases &#8211; Group&#8197;B</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) possess an unnatural activity of introducing functionalities such as N3, CN, NO2 etc., into a molecule through the ring&#8208;opening reaction of epoxides. The enantioselectivity of HHDHs is substrate&#8208;dependent and not always high enough for synthetic applications. B&#8208;group of HHDHs has been neglected in the past, due to observed low enantioselectivity based on performance on a relatively limited number of substrates. Extensive screening of substrates on HheB2 from Mycobacterium sp. GP1 and HheB from Corynebacterium sp. N&#8208;1074 was performed. Several highly enantioselective reactions were discovered (E&gt;200), with HheB showing higher enantioselectivity and activity toward larger panel of substrates compared to HheB2. Enzymes HheB and HheB2 are highly homologous; they differ by only 4 residues. By using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, residues 120 and 125 were found to be responsible for higher enantioselectivity of HheB compared to HheB2. Computational analysis supported experiments and provided evidence that kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of reactions within HheB enzymes are crucial in determining the observed enantioselectivities. Due to remarkable activity and enantioselectivity, B&#8208;group HHDHs emerged as a catalyst of choice for the synthesis of bulky tertiary alcohols, as shown in this work.

Abstract
A synthetic strategy for the construction of 2,2&#8208;disubstituted indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones from 2&#8208;alkynylnitroarenes and ketones has been described. The corresponding indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivatives were afforded in moderate to excellent product yields by using mild conditions. After a Wittig&#8208;like process, the key intermediates 3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones were generated from 2&#8208;alkynylnitroarenes, which could be further transformed to the desired products through a Mannich addition.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Carbazoles by Perester</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An intramolecular C&#8722;H amination for the synthesis of carbazoles with a Pd(II)/TBPB system has been developed. This catalytic amination process forms the carbazole products in good to excellent yields. It is noteworthy that this method implied the advantages of the catalytic mode involving perester with transition metal catalyst in the activation of inert C&#8722;H bonds. In addition, the transformation performs well using water as solvent.

         <title>Diastereoselective and Synergistic Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Bispropargylation of Xanthones and Thioxanthones: An Access to Xanthene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A gold&#8208;catalyzed bispropargylation of xanthone derivatives is described. The use of propargylsilanes permits to achieve a deoxygenative bispropargylation through a double catalytic addition of the corresponding allenylgold intermediate to the synergistically activated carbonyl moiety. This methodology works in a diastereoselective manner either with xanthone or thioxanthone derivatives. Monopropargylated xanthydrol silyl ethers were isolated as reaction intermediates and these species could be transformed into symmetrical and non&#8208;symmetrical bispropargylated xanthenes. The formation of non&#8208;symmetrical bispropargylated xanthenes could also be achieved through an one&#8208;pot procedure. Finally, other interesting structures, such as propargylxanthylidenes, propargylxanthenes and bispropargylated xanthenes replacing the silicon moiety, were accessible following different one&#8208;pot synthetic methodologies. In addition, bispropargylated xanthenes could perform a carbonylative [2+2+1] formal cycloaddition.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bis(&#946;&#8208;oximinoalkyl)malonates and Their Catalytic Reductive Cyclization to Piperidines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hitherto unknown bis(&#946;&#8208;oximinoalkyl)malonates were demonstrated to be convenient platforms for the synthesis of saturated N&#8208;heterocycles. Upon heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation, these dioximes undergo reductive cyclization to give substituted piperidine&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxylates, which are valuable building blocks in medicinal chemistry. By using dioximes bearing an additional ester group in the side chain, tandem piperidine/pyrrolidinone ring closure leading to indolizidinone framework was showcased in this work. A modular synthesis of initial bis(&#946;&#8208;oximinoalkyl)malonates (both symmetrically and unsymmetrically substituted) was accomplished via a sequential Michael addition of two nitrosoalkene molecules to malonic ester. The mechanism of the reductive cyclization of dioximes to piperidines was investigated by isotope scrambling experiments and isolation of intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring closure of nitroalkylmalonates for the synthesis of isoxazolines under the acylation conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acylation of nitroalkylmalonates was found to yield substituted isoxazoline derivatives. This redox&#8208;neutral transformation has a wide substrate scope and produces target products with yields up to 92 %. Various substituents (aryl, alkyl, and ester) at the C3 and C4 positions of the resulting isoxazolines were also tolerated. A quick assembly of the isoxazoline ring starting from nitroalkenes and malonates was successfully developed. Control experiments showed that the intramolecular ring closure is the most likely key mechanistic step. Subsequent transformations into pyrrolidine and furane derivatives demonstrated the synthetic utility of the obtained products.</dc:description>

Abstract
Heterocyclic N&#8208;oxides are prevalent in numerous natural products with broad applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, material sciences, and asymmetric synthesis. Owing to their profound biological and physiological activity and unique chemical reactivity, the importance of these compounds has stimulated substantial interest among organic synthetic chemists. More importantly, C&#8208;2 functionalization of heterocyclic N&#8208;oxides, including pyridine&#8208;, isoquinoline&#8208;, pyrazine&#8208;, quinoxaline&#8208;, and quinoline N&#8208;oxides, is among the most important strategies for heterocyclic functionalization. Besides, deoxygenation of heterocyclic N&#8208;oxides has also emerged as a reaction of significance in organic chemistry. In the past decade, visible light photoredox catalyzed C&#8208;2 functionalization and deoxygenation of these heterocyclic N&#8208;oxides have drawn substantial attention owing to their mild reaction conditions. This review has been categorized based on visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated nondeoxygenative C&#8208;2 functionalization (alkylation, fluoroalkylation, arylation, acylation, and amination), deoxygenative C&#8208;2 functionalization (sulfonylation, alkynylation, alkylation, and acylation), and deoxygenation (without C&#8722;H functionalization) of heterocyclic N&#8208;oxides. For most part of the work, the substrate scope, limitation, and mechanism of the reactions have been discussed.

         <title>Synthesis of Saturated N&#8208;Heterocycles via a Catalytic Hydrogenation Cascade</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Saturated N&#8208;heterocycles are prominent motifs found in various natural products and pharmaceuticals. Despite the increasing interest in this class of compounds, the synthesis of saturated bicyclic azacycles requires tedious multi&#8208;step syntheses. Herein, we present a one&#8208;pot protocol for the synthesis of octahydroindoles, decahydroquinolines, and octahydroindolizines through a cascade reaction.

         <dc:description>A cascade C&#8208;H activation, annulation and etherification protocol of N&#8208;hydroxybenzamides with propargylamines provides a flexible and powerful route to N&#8208;alkoxylated 3&#8208;arylisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones. Three new bonds (C&#8208;C, C&#8208;N, and C&#8208;O) are generated to afford a series of isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones bearing a tetrasubstituted carbon in 49% to 82% yields. The utility of this method is showcased by gram&#8208;scale synthesis, synthetic transformations of the product to access to structurally diverse isoindolinones.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed difluoroalkylation of aryl alkynes with difluoroenol silyl ether in the presence of trimethylsilyl chloride</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of non&#8208;fluorinated silyl enol ether with alkyne is useful for the synthesis of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds. However, most of the existing methods for realizing such organic transformation usually employ stoichiometric amounts of relatively expensive Lewis acids/metallic salts. Herein, an iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed difluoroalkylation of aryl alkynes with difluoroenol silyl ether was developed. The reactions proceeded smoothly in the presence of a catalytic amount of iron(III) chloride, stoichiometric amounts of trimethylsilyl chloride, and 4&#197; molecular sieve in dichloroethane (DCE) to afford the corresponding &#945;&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroketones in modest to good yields. Remarkably, among the various metallic salts screened, cheap and less&#8208;toxic iron(III) salt was found to be the most efficient Lewis acid catalyst for the present reaction. In addition, in the absence of iron(III) chloride or trimethylsilyl chloride, either no reaction occurred or considerably reduced reaction performance was observed. Moreover, the use of Bronsted acid to replace iron(III) chloride as reaction catalyst failed to promote the reaction. The reaction could be scaled up and the obtained difluoroalkylated carbonyl compound serves as a versatile building block which could be subjected to late&#8208;stage diversification to be converted into useful organic molecules containing CF2H and CF2CF2 moieties. Deuterated experiments showed that the proton in the generated alkene product should originate from trace amount of water present in the reaction system.</dc:description>

Abstract
A tertiary amino&#8208;thiourea catalyzed asymmetric aldol reaction between 2&#8208;isocyanatomalonate esters and isatins has been achieved.

&lt;p&gt;A tertiary amino-thiourea catalyzed asymmetric aldol reaction between 2-isocyanatomalonate esters and isatins has been achieved.

         <title>Tartramide Ligands for Copper&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Arylation at Room Temperature</title>

Abstract
Readily accessible tartramide ligands have been demonstrated to promote copper&#8208;catalysed N&#8208;arylation under mild conditions. In addition, the coupling protocol employs cheap and readily available pre&#8208;catalyst, ligand, and base (NaOH), and overcomes many current limitations often associated with Ullmann coupling: it can be run with low catalyst loadings, does not require the use of excess amine, operates at room temperature, is fully homogeneous, and displays improved tolerance to air and moisture. Detailed kinetic studies using reaction progress kinetic analysis (RPKA) methods have provided insight into the factors influencing the reaction rate in terms of impact of ligand structure, reactant/catalyst dependence and catalyst (in)stability. These kinetic insights have been used in a quality&#8208;by&#8208;design approach for further optimization of the reaction protocol. The reaction scope was extended to 22 examples, showing broad applicability for a wide range of substituted aryl iodides with both primary and secondary amines.

Abstract
Substrate&#8208;induced synthesis of 6H&#8208;Chromeno[4,3&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;6&#8208;ones has been developed directly from anilines, 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins and DMSO under air without any catalysts and additives in one pot. This protocol highlights dual roles of 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins which were not only used as reactants but also activated DMSO to provide one&#8208;carbon unit in the desired products.

Abstract
We describe here the Lewis acid&#8208;promoted cyclization reaction of benzomidazole thiols with propargyl alcohols for the selective synthesis of benzoimidazolo thiazines and benzothiazolo imidazoles. The reaction is regioselective and the solvent controls the formation of products. The systematic study to determine the best reaction conditions revealed that the six&#8208;membered benzoimidazolo thiazines were obtained by reacting the benzoimidazole thiols with propargyl alcohols in the presence of boron trifluoride etherate, using dichloromethane as the solvent. Replacement of dichloromethane with dimethylformamide, by using the same starting material and reagents, gave selectively the five&#8208;membered benzothiazolo imidazoles. The mechanism of this cyclization was proposed based on the results obtained and several control experiments.

Abstract
A self&#8208;enabled electrooxidative protocol for the synthesis of nitrones from bench stable amines has been developed under constant current electrolysis at room temperature, rendering metal and external oxidant&#8208;free protocol in an alkaline medium. The electrocatalysis steps of reported strategy involve anodic oxidation of benzyl amines followed by cathodic reduction of nitro&#8208;functional group in an undivided cell affording functional nitrones. The robustness of the electrocatalysis was reflected by tolerant substrate scope, oxidant&#8208;free conditions, and an operationally friendly procedure. Moreover, the cyclic voltammetry and control experiment studies also support the electrochemical process in alkaline medium.

Abstract
Azido radical mediated photocatalytic oxidation method for the selective oxidation of various well&#8208;known feedstocks, such as (hetero)aromatic or aliphatic alcohols, alkylarenes, and terminal alkenes, is successfully accomplished. Herein, the catalytic HAT and reversible addition/elimination strategies of azido radical have been explored to convert the commonly oxidizable functionalities into invaluable carbonyls or tertiary alcohols using an organic photocatalyst 4CzIPN with tetrabutyl ammonium azide (TBAN3) and air/O2 as an oxidant. Indeed, this mild, operationally simple, and productive method offers good to excellent product yields with a wide range of structurally diverse substrates, including pharmaceutical derivatives with good functional group tolerance. Several control experiments have been carried out to investigate the detailed reaction mechanism.

A palladium&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition of hydroxy&#8208;tethered allyl carbonates with five types of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes has been achieved, in which a type of new hydroxy&#8208;tethered allyl carbonates acted as valuable precursors for the formation of 1,4&#8208;C,O&#8208;dipole allylpalladium intermediates. The reaction proceeded efficiently under mild reaction conditions to provide the corresponding tetrahydropyran derivatives in moderate to high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities.

Abstract
Here we present a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free radical cyclization of 2&#8208;arylbenzoimidazoles with unactivated alkanes. By using di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide (DTBP) to promote the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization, this approach enables assembly of various benzimidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolin&#8208;6(5H)&#8208;ones in aqueous media. This strategy can not only well tolerate a wide range of cyclic alkanes, straight&#8208;chain alkanes, toluene derivatives, as well as pharmaceutical molecule eudesmol, but also provides an approach for the functionalization of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in aqueous media under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free systems.

Abstract
The efficacy of synthetic methodologies is based not only on potent chemistries but also on processing strategies that amplify reaction performance and overall safety. The N&#8208;hydroxyphtalimide&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation of aldehydes is an environmentally reliable and inexpensive approach for the synthesis of valuable carboxylic acids. However, the reaction may lead to the accumulation of significant amounts of peracid in crude product mixtures thereby generating a considerable safety hazard. Also, in the case of deactivated substrates, long reaction times, high catalyst loading, and stoichiometric additives are required to promote oxidation. Therefore, we developed a flow chemistry&#8208;based process for N&#8208;hydroxyphtalimide&#8208;catalyzed aldehyde oxidations and exploited its benefits to minimize peracid buildup, thereby enhancing the process safety. By performing the aerobic oxidation of aldehydes under continuous flow conditions, chemically intensified and scalable carboxylic acid formation was obtained even in the reactions of deactivated substrates. Our findings are presented herein.

Abstract
The development of catalytic tools for the late&#8208;stage modification of amino acids within a peptide framework is a challenging task of capital importance. Herein, we report a Ru&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H hydroxylation of a collection of Tyr&#8208;containing di&#8208; and tripeptides featuring the use of a carbamate as a removable directing group and PhI(OCOCF3)2 (PIFA) as oxidant. This air&#8208;compatible tagging technique is reliable, scalable and provides access to L&#8208;DOPA (L&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine) peptidomimetics in a racemization&#8208;free fashion. Density Functional Theory calculations support a Ru(II)/Ru(IV) catalytic cycle.

         <title>Hypertransglycosylating Variants of the GH20 &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;Acetylhexosaminidase for the Synthesis of Chitooligomers</title>

Abstract
Fungal &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylhexosaminidases of the CAZy family 20 of glycoside hydrolases are well&#8208;established tools for the enzymatic synthesis of a wide variety of natural and modified oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates. In order to increase their synthetic efficiency, the &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylhexosaminidase from Aspergillus oryzae (AoHex) was employed as a model enzyme for enzyme engineering aiming at shifting the reaction course from hydrolysis toward transglycosylation. Specifically, nine mutant variants of AoHex were designed by molecular modeling based on its crystal structure and molecular dynamics simulations. The selected mutation hotspots included the tyrosine residue at the active site, which stabilizes the transition state of the reaction, and two residues at the aglycone&#8208;binding site, which were replaced by tryptophan residues to increase the hydrophobicity of this subsite. Besides the individual mutants, combined double&#8208;mutant variants were also prepared and characterized. As a result, eight out of the studied new AoHex variants had transglycosidase activity, with V306W/Y445N AoHex being a superior transglycosidase with a transglycosylation&#8208;to&#8208;hydrolysis ratio greater than 110, which is entirely unique among the hypertransglycosylating glycosidase mutants including the GH20 &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylhexosaminidases.

Abstract
The additive&#8208;free 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction of isatin&#8208;derived azomethine ylides with &#945;&#8208;cyano&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds was developed, which enabled diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of a series of novel and structurally complex 3,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidinyl&#8208;spirooxindoles derivatives containing four contiguous and two quaternary stereogenic centers in high yields (up to 92%) and excellent diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;25:1 dr).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The additive-free 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of isatin-derived azomethine ylides with &#945;-cyano-&#945;,&#946;-unsaturated compounds was developed, which enabled diversity-oriented synthesis of a series of novel and structurally complex 3,3&#8242;-pyrrolidinyl-spirooxindoles derivatives containing four contiguous and two quaternary stereogenic centers in high yields (up to 92%) and excellent diastereoselectivities (up to &amp;gt;25:1 dr). The reaction displays switchable regioselectivity depending on the steric effect of the substrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
Sulfondiimines, which contain a tetrasubstituted sulfur centre bearing two nitrogens and two carbon substituents, are a class of underexplored scaffolds in organic chemistry. Fascinated by some unique yet intriguing properties, sulfondiimines appear as leads in discovery industry, but the lack of efficient synthetic approaches holds back their further uptake by medicinal chemistry. Herein, a general and practical copper&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam coupling of NH&#8208;diaryl sulfondiimines with arylboronic acids is presented. A simple copper catalyst efficiently facilitated the highly chemoselective construction of C&#8722;N bond, allowing the preparation of a variety of N&#8208;arylated diaryl sulfondiimines in good yields under mild and environmentally benign conditions. An array of protecting groups on imine moieties were well tolerated, offering diversified accesses to NH,NAr&#8208;diaryl sulfondiimines, a class of versatile building blocks. Moreover, an aza&#8208;analogue of an EphB4 inhibitor featuring a sulfondiimine&#8208;based pharmacophore was generated employing our Chan&#8208;Lam coupling as the key step.

Abstract
Dehydrogenative cycloisomerization/arylation sequence of heteroatom nucleophile&#8208;tethered unactivated alkynes provides a facile and powerful approach to C&#8722;C bond formation between the generated heterocycles and unfunctionalized arenes. Here, we describe a hypervalent iodine(III)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of oxazoles concomitant with the introduction of aryl groups into side chain from N&#8208;propargyl carboxamides and arenes, representing first C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bond formation by the catalytic dehydrogenative cycloisomerization/arylation reaction in exo&#8208;dig modes.

Abstract
Many naturally occurring small peptides have significant therapeutic properties. Total synthesis of these peptides is not only helpful in the identification of their structures and providing methods to synthesize their analogues, but also contributes to their biosynthetic studies. As solid&#8208;phase synthesis simplifies the tedious and time&#8208;consuming isolation of intermediates, it has been widely applied in peptide synthesis. This review has highlighted the recent progress in solid&#8208;phase total synthesis of both linear and cyclic naturally occurring small peptides from 2014 to July 2021.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced oxidation of diazenyl&#8208;protected tetrahydroisoquinolines and isoindolines for the synthesis of structurally diverse lactams is developed. The reaction was carried out with Eosin Y&#8208;Na2 as an organic photocatalyst and molecular oxygen as an oxidant, and the desired functionalized N&#8208;aryldiazenyl&#8208;lactams were obtained under mild and transition metal&#8208;free conditions. The utility of this method is showcased by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and deprotection of the N&#8208;aryldiazenyl&#8208;lactam product.

Abstract
We report a one&#8208;pot reaction of (&#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroethyl)phosphonates involving aza&#8208;Wittig reagents, in which, difluoromethylphosphonate&#8208;containing diazo and trifluoromethylated ketones assemble to furnish azo&#8208;containing &#945;&#8208;fluorovinylphosphonates. Mechanism studies disclose a pathway, which contains an aza&#8208;Wittig reaction, water addition to hydrazone, and C&#8722;F bond cleavage with an aza&#8208;Wittig reagent as a key intermediate. This reaction is conducted at 60&#8201;&#176;C affording a series of &#945;&#8208;fluorovinylphosphonate compounds in 42&#8211;94% yields and Z&#8208;stereoselectivity. This work opens a vision for the difluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted diazos, and provides a strategy for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;fluorovinylphosphonate derivatives.

Abstract
The mechanochemical fluorination of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds has been achieved using N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide as both a precursor of the hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer reagent and a bench&#8208;stable fluorine source. The control experiments revealed that mechanical energy is essential for realizing this reaction.

         <title>Synthesis of (Hetero)Aroyl Fluorides via a Mild Amides C&#8722;N Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Amides, such as N&#8208;benzoylsaccharin, N,N&#8208;diBocbenzamide, and N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;N&#8208;tosylbenzamides reacted with Et3N&#8901;3HF to provide the corresponding acyl fluorides in good yields. The reaction was conducted under environmentally friendly conditions using i&#8208;PrOAc as the solvent. Moreover, the reaction was performed at room temperature and did not require a transition&#8208;metal catalyst or additives. The methodology showed functional group tolerance toward amines, alkoxy, halides, ketones, esters, and aldehydes.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Aldol Reaction of Isocyanoacetic Acid Derivatives Enabled by Cooperative Participation of Classical and Nonclassical Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The silver&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric aldol reaction of isocyanoacetic acid derivatives with aldehydes has been developed by employing a chiral prolinol&#8208;phosphine as a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating P,N,O ligand. DFT calculations indicated that the reaction proceeds in a stepwise manner, involving C&#8722;C bond forming carbonyl addition and subsequent enantioselectivity&#8208;determining oxazoline ring formation. An O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O/sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O two&#8208;point hydrogen bond donated by the prolinol moiety of the ligand activates the aldehyde in the C&#8722;C bond formation step and facilitates the subsequent cyclization under stereocontrol by the catalyst. The calculations further suggest that additional nonclassical C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonds as well as London dispersion interactions may also participate synergistically in the stereocontrol.

         <title>Low&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Driven Electrochemical Aerobic Oxygenation with Flavin Catalysis: Chemoselective Synthesis of Sulfoxides from Sulfides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The chemoselective electrochemical oxygenation of sulfides to sulfoxides is performed using a biomimetic flavin catalyst that enables the activation of molecular oxygen under a low cathode potential. Diverse functional groups, including alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, cyclopropane, carboxylic acids, pyridine, alkenes, and alkynes, are well tolerated under low&#8208;voltage electrolytic conditions.

         <title>Aryl&#8208;Alcohol&#8208;Oxidase&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Piperonal and Other Valuable Aldehydes</title>

Abstract
The use of fungal aryl&#8208;alcohol oxidases in biocatalysis is still modest, despite their advantageous capability to produce valuable aldehydes via oxidation of the respective alcohols without the need for costly external cofactors. For biocatalytic application, enzyme stability in the presence of organic solvents used for substrate solubilization has to be investigated, and process limitations due to low oxygen supply and the accumulation of the by&#8208;product H2O2 must be addressed. In this study, we showed that the aryl&#8208;alcohol oxidase PeAAO2 from Pleurotus eryngii P34 remained active and stable in the presence of up to 30% (v/v) various organic solvents and up to 500&#8197;mM H2O2. The potential of this biocatalyst was explored based on conversion of piperonyl alcohol to the fragrance compound piperonal. After reaction optimization, product titers of up to 245&#8197;mM were achieved within 3&#8197;h. Addition of catalase was imperative to re&#8208;introduce O2 as co&#8208;substrate into the reaction, thereby diminishing oxygen limitation. On a preparative scale, space&#8208;time&#8208;yield of 9.5&#8197;g/l/h was achieved and 244.6&#8197;mg piperonal (85% yield) with &gt;99% purity were isolated via simple crystallization from n&#8208;hexane extract. Under optimized reaction conditions four other substrates, cumic alcohol, 2&#8208;thiophenemethanol, trans,trans&#8208;2,4&#8208;heptadienol and trans&#8208;2&#8208;cis&#8208;6&#8208;nonadienol, at concentrations of up to 300&#8197;mM were converted to the corresponding aldehydes within 20&#8197;h. Our results demonstrate that PeAAO2 is a versatile and promising biocatalyst for the production of valuable aldehydes.

         <title>Asymmetric Organocatalyzed Friedel&#8211;Crafts Reaction of Trihaloacetaldehydes and Phenols</title>

Abstract
Herein we report the asymmetric organocatalyzed method for the Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction between activated phenols and trihaloacetaldehydes. A three&#8208;phase screening including 41 compounds was employed to identify a catalyst structure based on 3,5&#8208;dinitrobenzamide of 9&#8208;amino&#8208;epi&#8208;cinchonidine as the lead catalytic molecule. Under the optimized reaction conditions, the above catalyst offered trihalohydroxyalkylated adducts in yields ranging from 26 to 92% and enantiomeric ratios within 69:31&#8211;99:1. The reaction scope was determined on 29 entries and several follow&#8208;up transformations of the enantioenriched products were accomplished.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A direct C&#8208;H phosphonylation of pyridine by N&#8208;benzylating activation is reported, which afforded 4&#8208;pyridylphosphine oxides with high regioselectivity, without the employment of metal catalyst or expensive activator. By increasing the electrophilicity of pyridinium with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the N&#8208;benzyl group, the phosphonylation process could be realized at room temperature. Control experiments and NMR investigation confirmed the interaction between DBU and diphenylphosphine oxide which generated the true phosphorus nucleophile. Moreover, DFT calculations offered enough insight into an intermolecular cooperative dehydrogenation&#8208;debenzylation mechanism, which helped to elucidate the origin of C4&#8208;regioselectivity in this metal&#8208;free Chichibabin&#8208;type phosphonylation.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a procedure for the multigram synthesis of 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridinium azide, stable, non&#8208;explosive, low&#8208;hygroscopic source of azide ion soluble in both protic and aprotic organic solvents. In protic ionic liquid media this reagent was shown to serve as a safer equivalent of toxic and unstable hydrazoic acid. The high synthetic utility of this system was demonstrated using donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane ring opening as a model process. General procedures furnishing a variety of dialkyl (2&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;arylethyl)malonates or 4&#8208;azido&#8208;4&#8208;arylbutyrates, depending on the protic ionic liquid applied, were elaborated. The conversion times for studied donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes were established providing the relative reactivity sequence. The application of 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridinium azide for a conventional nucleophilic substitution, oxirane ring opening, (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition to (thio)cyano group as well as their combinations realized as telescopic synthesis was also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalysed Synthesis of Propargyl Alcohol and Derivatives from Acetylene and other Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A copper(I)/phosphine system that homogeneously catalyses the alkynylation of formaldehyde with acetylene or terminal alkynes is reported. Using acetylene at atmospheric pressure, the catalyst consisting of &lt;1&#8197;mol% copper(I) phenylacetylide and a trialkyl bisphosphine ligand shows a high selectivity towards the formation of propargyl alcohol rather than 1,4&#8208;butynediol, which is not reported for common heterogeneous copper acetylide catalysts. The biphasic water/toluene reaction mixture allows the separation of targeted products with the aqueous layer and catalyst recycling via the organic layer.

         <title>Suzuki Coupling of Activated Aryltriazenes for Practical Synthesis of Biaryls from Anilines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Aryltriazenes can hardly take part in productive organic transformations unless stoichiometric Br&#246;nsted or Lewis acid activators are used. We report here for the first time a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki coupling of aryltriazenes activated by a sulfonyl group at N3 atom under the common basic conditions. Benefiting from elimination of stoichiometric acid activators, activated aryltriazenes could efficiently couple with arylboronic acids to afford diaryls in modest to excellent yields by using a simple catalyst at low loading, 0.3&#8197;mol% Pd(PPh3)2Cl2. Scope and limitation of the coupling are demonstrated with 26 examples.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photoredox Catalyzed Decarboxylative Alkylation of Vinylcyclopropanes</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a visible&#8208;light mediated photoredox catalyzed decarboxylative alkylation of vinylcyclopropanes. The reaction was carried out with an Ir&#8208;based photocatalyst and Cs2CO3 as a base. The desired functionalized long&#8208;chained alkylated derivatives were obtained in 48&#8211;93% yields under mild reaction conditions without any external metal co&#8208;catalysts, oxidants, or additives. Various alkyl carboxylic acids and amino acid derivatives are used as alkylating reagents to synthesize the &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated diesters, and unnatural homo&#8208;allylic amino acid derivatives with excellent functional groups tolerance. The utility of this method was showcased by performing a gram&#8208;scale synthesis. A mechanism is proposed based on control experiments and quenching studies.

Abstract
We have developed a method for constructing tricyclic [1,2&#8208;a]indoles via nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular imine&#8208;alkene coupling reactions. This method enables syntheses of 6&#8208;5&#8208;5 and 6&#8208;5&#8208;6 tricyclic [1,2&#8208;a]indoles. The use of NIXantphos or DPPPent as a ligand and 4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid as a co&#8208;catalyst is crucial for the reaction. The synthetic utility of the method was demonstrated by converting the product into useful indole amines.

Abstract
An photosensitizer&#8208; and additive&#8208;free, visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced decarboxylative aminoalkylation/C&#8722;O coupling cyclization of enaminones with N&#8208;arylglycine for the synthesis of 3&#8208;aminoalkyl chromones has been achieved.

Abstract
Tofacitinib is an oral protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. Its efficient production remains a challenge due to the two consecutive stereogenic centers associated to the piperidine ring. In this study, an enzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;asymmetric reductive amination was developed to prepare enantiomerically complementary cis&#8208;1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;N,4&#8208; dimethylpiperidin&#8208;3&#8208;amine and its analogues. Two enantiocomplementary imine reductases (IREDs) were identified for the synthesis of (3R,4R)&#8208; and (3S,4S)&#8208;1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;N,4&#8208;dimethylpiperidin&#8208;3&#8208;amine in high isolated yields (83% and 91%) with excellent stereoselectivity (97% and &gt;99% ee values) and diastereoselectivity (&gt;99:1 dr), providing a green methodology for the production of the key intermediate of tofacitinib.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced regioselective tandem enamido &#946;&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation/acrylamido alkylation/cyclizative alkenylation sequence of 3&#8208;aza&#8208;1,5&#8208;dienes is presented. This protocol is regiospecific, features a broad substrate scope, and provides a direct access to 3,4&#8208;dialkylated 4&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones from readily available N&#8208;alkenylacrylamides. It is readily scalable to a gram scale, and could be induced by natural sunlight.

         <title>Rhodium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Intramolecular Insertion of Aryldiazoacetates into Unactivated Primary C&#8722;H Bond: A Direct Route to 2&#8208;Unsubstituted Indanes</title>

Abstract
Dirhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular insertion of aryldiazoacetates into an unactivated primary C&#8722;H bond was described in this study. The insertion reaction of aryldiazoacetates with ortho&#8208;isopropyl or ortho&#8208;ethyl groups in the presence of a catalytic amount of dirhodium(II) tetrakis(triphenylacetate), Rh2(tpa)4, at room temperature proceeded site&#8208;selectively to afford 2&#8208;unsubstituted indane&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylates in 75%&#8211;96% yields. In the case of o&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;substituted aryldiazoacetates, cis&#8208;isomers were obtained as major products. Furthermore, a chemoselective C&#8722;H insertion reaction of aryldiazoacetate bearing 1&#8208;oxyethyl&#8208;substituent at the ortho position was achieved by using a bulky and electron&#8208;deficient pivaloyl group as the protecting group of a highly active oxygen atom. The present reaction provided a direct route to 2&#8208;unsubstituted indanes.

         <title>Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Asymmetric Allylic Amination with Pyridones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein a catalytic synthetic method for enantioenriched N&#8208;substituted pyridones. By employing chiral iridium catalyst generated from the Carreira [P/olefin] ligand, intermolecular asymmetric allylic amination of allyl alcohols with pyridones proceeded smoothly with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selectivities (&gt;19:1 N/O, &gt;19:1 b/l and &#8805;89% ee). The reaction underwent through a kinetic resolution process under mild conditions and displayed a broad substrate scope for both pyridones and allylic alcohols. The potential of this method was demonstrated by a gram&#8208;scale reaction with only 0.6 mol% catalyst loading and diverse transformations of the amination products to useful skeletons.</dc:description>

         <title>Pentafluorophenyl Group as Activating Group: Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Deuterio Carboxylic Acid Derivatives via Et3N Catalyzed H/D Exchange</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
We discovered that highly regioselective H/D exchange can be achieved on the &#945;&#8208;position of the pentafluorophenyl (Pfp) ester using Et3N as the catalyst and D2O as the deuterium source. Our computational and experimental results showed that the Pfp group can significantly increase the acidity of the &#945;&#8208;hydrogen of the ester. This mild reaction condition tolerated a variety of functional groups. 90%&#8764;98% yields and 91%&#8764;98% deuterium incorporations were obtained with all the tested Pfp esters. Taking advantage of the high reactivity of Pfp esters, a series of valuable &#945;&#8208;deuterio carboxylic acid derivatives, including herbicide, drugs and drug intermediates, have been synthesized using &#945;&#8208;deuterio Pfp esters as precursors.

         <title>Formation of N&#8722;P(O)&#8722;S Bonds from White Phosphorus via a Four&#8208;Component Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Functionalization of white phosphorus with disulfides, amines and KOH to phosphoramidodithioates containing both P&#8722;N, P&#8722;S and P=O bonds via a four&#8208;component reaction is presented. It proceeds with high yields and provides an attractive approach for the construction of valuable N&#8722;P(O)&#8722;S motif using a one&#8208;step strategy. The advantages of this newly developed process include a clean reaction profile, complete conversion of white phosphorus, transition metal&#8208;free and halogen&#8208;free environmentally benign system, and large&#8208;scale synthetic application. Besides, phosphoramidodithioates can also be utilized to construct P&#8722;C, P&#8722;O and P=S bonds with the appropriate reagents.

Abstract
A general method is developed to allow de novo construction of quinolines and C2&#8208;functionalized quinolines from ortho&#8208;alkenyl anilines in the presence of a difluorocarbene precursor. This method exploits a crucial reactivity of in&#8208;situ generation of isocyanides from condensation of primary aniline with difluorocarbene. Subsequent &#945;&#8208;addition of isocyanide by neighbouring alkenyl group constructs the quinoline ring. Furthermore, when a combination of difluorocarbene precursor and Se are present, selenoisocyanate intermediates are tentatively generated that upon nucleophilic addition by ortho&#8208;alkenyl produce 2&#8208;SeH quinolines. In the presence of a second nucleophile such as anilines, competing nucleophilic addition of anilines to the selenoisocyanate is preferred, generating selenourea intermediate. Further nucleophilic addition of the ortho&#8208;alkenyl to selenourea followed by elimination of H2Se produces 2&#8208;aminoquinolines. This allows one&#8208;step multi&#8208;component modular preparation of various C2&#8208;functionalized quinolines from readily available starting compounds. This method shows good yields, scope and chemoselectivity. It is operationally convenient and friendly without manipulating unpleasant isocyanides. The difluorocarbene&#8208;enabled primary amine to isocyanide conversion may be exploited to develop other interesting reactions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general method is developed to allow &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; construction of quinolines and C2-functionalized quinolines from &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-alkenyl anilines in the presence of a difluorocarbene precursor. This method exploits a crucial reactivity of in-situ generation of isocyanides from condensation of primary aniline with difluorocarbene. Subsequent &#945;-addition of isocyanide by neighbouring alkenyl group constructs the quinoline ring. Furthermore, when a combination of difluorocarbene precursor and Se are present, selenoisocyanate intermediates are tentatively generated that upon nucleophilic addition by &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-alkenyl produce 2-SeH quinolines. In the presence of a second nucleophile such as anilines, competing nucleophilic addition of anilines to the selenoisocyanate is preferred, generating selenourea intermediate.

         <title>Ylide&#8208;Functionalized Diisopropyl Phosphine (prYPhos): A Ligand for Selective Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Couplings of Aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The ylide&#8208;functionalized diisopropyl phosphine (prYPhos) promotes Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings of aryl chlorides and bromides with arylboronic acids. Using Pd2(dba)3/prYPhos as the catalyst and K2CO3 as the base, various (hetero)biaryls were synthesized in 45&#8211;98% yields at mild reaction conditions, tolerating sensitive functional groups and steric hindrance. The electron rich, sterically demanding ligand induces a high selectivity for halides versus triflate. Chloroaryl triflates were selectively coupled at the chloride, leaving inherently more reactive triflate groups in place.

Abstract
A ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of allenoates with arylamines has been developed. This strategy provides an approach to synthesize E&#8208;allylic amines in good yields with high atom&#8208;economy and high levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and E&#8208;selectivities with a broad substrate scope.

         <title>Strategic Applications of the &#946;&#8208;Silicon Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Organosilicon reagents are highly versatile and privileged scaffolds in modern synthetic chemistry, largely due to the range of transformations the groups are amenable to. The &#946;&#8208;Silicon effect is one of the fundamental phenomena underpinning the inherent reactivity of organosilicon reagents, allowing unsaturated organosilanes to undergo a range of electrophilic substitutions with a variety of nucleophiles. The application of the &#946;&#8208;Silicon effect in a range of organic transformations is reviewed with the discussion divided up based on the class of silane. The reactivity of these compounds towards carbon, heteroatom and metallic electrophiles is discussed from classical applications such as the Sakurai allylation to contemporary applications such as cross&#8208;coupling chemistry. In addition, examples of these transformations in the context of methodology development and natural product synthesis are provided.

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined Ni&#8722;SNS Complex Catalysed Borrowing Hydrogenative &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Ketones and Dehydrogenative Synthesis of Quinolines</title>

Abstract
The &#8220;borrowing hydrogen&#8221; (BH) method for C&#8208;alkylation reactions using alcohol as alkylating agents is an important synthetic transformation. In this respect, designing cheap and bench stable earth abundant metal catalyst for borrowing hydrogen transformation is a key challenge to be witnessed. Herein we have presented a synthesis of non&#8208;phosphine, easily accessible and bench stable SNS&#8722;Ni complexes. The Ni&#8208;catalyst was successfully applied for the C&#8208;alkylation of ketone enolates to &#945;&#8208;alkylated ketones. Primary alcohol with different functional groups and various heteroaromatic alcohols are well tolerated. The present catalyst system was efficiently applied to gram scale synthesis and also the green chemistry metrics of the reaction were calculated. The present protocol was also extended successfully for the synthesis of biologically important quinoline moieties. Finally, various control experiments and deuterium labelled experiments suggest that the reaction proceeds via borrowing hydrogen pathway.

Abstract
The acidic hydrogen&#8208;tethered allylic carbonates were successfully applied in phosphine catalysis. Their (4+2) annulation reaction with sulfamate&#8208;derived cyclic imines under phosphine catalysis worked well to produce tetrahydropyridine&#8208;fused heterocyclic compounds in high yields. A moderate ee was obtained in the initial screening. The zwitterionic intermediate produced through in&#8208;situ deprotonation functioned as a four&#8208;membered synthon.

Abstract
Reported herein is a photocatalytic platform for the vicinal aminopyridylation of indoles. The accurate difunctionalization reaction undergoes a tandem process involving a radical&#8208;mediated 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddtion which generated from the single&#8208;electron oxidation of N&#8208;aminopyridinium ylides, a cleavage of the N&#8722;N bond as well as an oxidation of indoline ring. The electrophilic pyridyl and nucleophilic amino groups can be installed simultaneously into a wide range of indoles under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions. Moreover, the protocol shows high levels of step and atom economy.

         <title>Intramolecular Aerobic Ring Expansion of Cyclic Ketone: A Mild Method for the Synthesis of Medium&#8208;Sized Lactones and Macrolactones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An operationally simple protocol for the synthesis of medium&#8208;sized lactones and macrolactones via an intramolecular ring expansion of cyclic ketones has been developed. Using this method, a series of 10&#8208; and 12&#8208;membered lactones was synthesized under mild conditions. Preliminary mechanistic studies showed that a radical pathway might be involved in this reaction.

         <title>Direct Thioamination of Cyclohexanones via Difunctionalization with Thiophenol and Aniline</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A synthetic method of o&#8208;sulfanylanilines from cyclohexanones, amines, and thiophenols under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions is disclosed. This is the first report on the direct thioamination of cyclohexanones via N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) promoted oxidative dehydroaromatization. Non&#8208;aromatic cyclohexanones were smoothly dehydrogenated, and acted as an aryl source using oxygen as a green oxidant. The capacity of the resultant o&#8208;sulfanylanilines for synthesis of N&#8208;arylphenothiazines has been further demonstrated.

The front cover picture illustrates the Cinchona&#8208;alkaloid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric and ortho&#8208;selective Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction between activated phenols and trihaloacetaldehydes. The reaction scheme, accompanied by portraits of Charles Friedel (upper right) and James Mason Crafts (lower left), contains pictograms and a background image representing our faculty building with its departments. The catalytic process developed by our group features a reasonably general substrate scope and provides the resulting adducts in good yields and enantioselectivities. Moreover, the possible downstream transformations of products were surveyed. Further details can be found in the Research Article by Otevrel and co&#8208;workers (D. Svestka, J. Otevrel, P.

Abstract
Olefins are important building blocks and are widely utilized in synthetic organic chemistry. Owing to its omnipresence and unique reactivity, the functionalization of alkenes has become a powerful method for constructing complex organic molecules. In this context, direct chelation&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H olefination at the inert C&#8722;H bonds represents the most straightforward synthetic method for introducing the alkenyl group into organic compounds in a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner. Despite the remarkable advances in chelation&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H olefination reaction, most of the successful transformations are restricted to activated or electronically biased olefins such as acrylates, styrenes, acrylamides, vinyl sulfones, and vinyl phosphonates. Literature reports on chelation&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H olefination with unactivated or electronically unbiased alkenes are limited due to poor intrinsic reactivity and regioselectivity issues. Despite significant challenges, the past few years have witnessed tremendous growth. The present review describes the recent advances in the chelation&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H olefination and allylation of aromatics, alkenes, and heteroaromatics with unactivated alkenes via the concerted&#8208;metallation&#8208; deprotonation pathway.Transition metals such as palladium, rhodium, iridium and cobalt are widely used for these kind of transformations. The scope, mechanistic investigation, and limitation of the alkenylation and allylation reactions are discussed elaborately. The present review includes all the reported C&#8722;H olefination and allylation reactions with unactivated olefins via the base&#8208;assisted deprotonation pathway.

Abstract
Difunctionalization of alkenes enables construction of complex compounds in one pot. In this report, we presented an intermolecular, redox&#8208;neutral three&#8208;component dicarbofunctionalization of activated alkenes under mild reaction conditions. The mechanistic studies indicated tertiary alkyl radicals from oxalate salts were first added to alkenes in Giese&#8208;type fashion, followed by nucleophilic addition with aldehydes to produce the desired 1,2&#8208;dialkylation products. The catalyst system does not require any additives, with good functional group compatibility, regioselectivity, and constructs two tertiary carbon centers simultaneously.

         <title>Direct Asymmetric Addition of Heteroatom Nucleophiles to Imines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The direct asymmetric addition of heteroatom nucleophiles to imines represents one of the most efficient tools for the formation of carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds and has received much interest recently. The review is devoted to the asymmetric addition reactions of non&#8208;carbon nucleophiles to imines. The present review is divided into five main sections: reactions with N&#8208;nucleophiles; reactions with P&#8208;nucleophiles; reactions with O&#8208;nucleophiles; reactions with S&#8208;nucleophiles; reactions with Se&#8208;nucleophiles. It has been seen that chiral catalysts such as quinines, BINOLs, chiral phosphoric acids as well as various Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids are the source of asymmetry of the presented reactions of asymmetric addition of non&#8208;carbon nucleophiles to imines.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced [2+2+1] Dearomative Cascade Cyclization of Indole/Furan Alkynes to Synthesize Sulfonyl Polycycles</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced [2+2+1] dearomative cascade cyclization of indole/furan alkynes with NaHSO3, providing an array of diverse highly strained sulfonyl polycycles. Compared to our previous work, this method does not require the use of additional sacrificial oxidants and have wider reaction scope. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the indole moiety initiated the reaction, which proceeded via single&#8208;electron oxidation pathway. An alkenyl radical formed by intramolecular addition capture SO2, and the resulting specie is cyclized to furnish the final product. Also, DFT calculations disclosed that the groups on the indole ring or at the side chain probably affect the single electron distribution at the reaction site of IM&#8208;RC&#8208;I, and the distribution may be a decisive factor of spirocyclization.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Visible Light Mediated Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Tertiary Arylphosphines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Arylation of tertiary aryl and alkyl phosphines bearing 2&#8208;cyanoethyl group with aryl(mesityl)iodonium triflates under blue light irradiation followed by retro&#8208;Michael reaction of the in&#8197;situ generated quaternary phosphonium salts initiated by DBU represent a novel efficient and general method for the preparation of distinctly substituted tertiary arylphosphines. An operationally simple, one&#8208;pot protocol features mild, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, high selectivity, broad functional group compatibility, as well as scalability and would be applied to substrates with different electronic and steric nature.

         <title>Metal&#8208; and Solvent&#8208;Free Synthesis of Maleimide Fused Carbazoles from (Indol&#8208;3&#8208;Yl)cyclohexanones and Maleimides</title>

Abstract
A metal&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free strategy for the preparation of maleimide&#8208;fused carbazoles has been developed. This protocol started from 2&#8208;(indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)cyclohexanones and maleimides, providing various maleimide&#8208;fused carbazoles in 45&#8211;90% yields. The present approach was catalyzed by trimethylsulfoxonium iodide and involved a cascade of oxidation, [4+2] annulation, and dehydrogenative aromatization. Moreover, these maleimide&#8208;fused carbazole products could be further transformed into other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free photoinduced radical&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;oxy C&#8722;H cyclobutylation reaction of bicyclo[1.1.0]butane (BCB) compounds was described. In this protocol, &#945;&#8208;oxy C(sp3)&#8722;H motifs including ethers and alcohols were activated via photocatalytic conditions, releasing the ring strain of BCBs and generating 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutanes in 40&#8211;80% yields. Control experiments and Stern&#8208;Volmer quenching experiments indicated that the reaction proceeded through the generation of &#945;&#8208;oxy carbon&#8208;centered radical intermediates by photoinduced hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process.

         <title>Allylic C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Bond Formation Through Pd&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation of Alkenes and 1,4&#8208;Dienes</title>

Abstract
This review highlights the allylic C&#8722;H alkylation of alkenes (AAH) with nucleophiles under Pd0 or PdII catalysis and achiral or chiral conditions. The &#951;3&#8208;allylpalladium intermediates of these reactions are formed from the cleavage of an allylic hydrogen which becomes a leaving group, like the acetate moiety of allyl acetates during the classical Tsuji&#8208;Trost procedure. Most of these cross&#8208;dehydrogenative&#8208;couplings require quinones as key components; they may play the role of ligand, proton trap and oxidant. Efficient asymmetric allylic C&#8722;H alkylations (AAAH&#8217;s) have been performed. The diversity of the procedures, their limitation and application in synthesis are underlined as well as the proposed mechanisms with, in some cases, personal comments. The data are grouped according to the reaction conditions.

         <title>Defluorinative Alkylation of Trifluoromethyl Alkenes with Soft Carbon Nucleophiles Enabled by a Catalytic Amount of Base</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Direct manipulation of readily accessible trifluoromethyl alkenes (TAs) represents an attractive approach to the preparation of diversified fluorine&#8208;containing compounds. In this study, defluorinative alkylation reactions of TAs with a broad array of soft carbon nucleophiles have been documented. Nucleophilic substitutions occur enabled by a catalytic amount of base, providing access to tertiary alkyl substituted gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrans. By extending the nucleophiles to silyl enol ethers, defluorination can be achieved in the absence of base to give gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. This process, which eliminates the requirement of organometallic reagents, transition metals, or strong bases for the C&#8722;F bond cleavage, is applicable to late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules.

Abstract
A method to synthesize benzofurylselenocyanates, benzothienylselenocyanates and indolylselenocyanates via electrophilic selenocyanogen cyclization was established. This sequential process was conducted under mild conditions in a short time. This protocol was successfully applied to late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules. Notablely, the selenocyanate can be converted into other valuable Se&#8208;containing compounds and showed antitumor activity to human hepatoma cells HepG2.

         <title>Diarylprolinol with Trifluoromethyl Substituents and Diphenylprolinol&#8208;Derived Perfluoroalkanesulfonamide as Organocatalysts in the Cross&#8208;Aldol Reaction of Aldehydes</title>

Abstract
The asymmetric cross&#8208;aldol reaction of two different aldehydes is a synthetically relevant reaction. Diarylprolinol catalyst with trifluoromethyl substituents and sulfonamide catalyst derived from diphenylprolinol are organocatalysts for the cross&#8208;aldol reaction. The reactivity and stereoselectivity of these two catalysts were compared in the asymmetric cross&#8208;aldol reactions of propanal and acetaldehyde as nucleophilic aldehydes and several electrophilic aldehydes. Depending on the electrophilic aldehydes, the preferable catalyst differs. By the proper selection of these two catalysts, potentially synthetically useful chiral building blocks can be synthesized with diastereoselectivities of anti:syn=2.6:1&#8764;&gt;20:1 and enantioselectivities of 60&#8764;&gt;98% ee.

         <title>Diastereospecific Enantiodivergent Allylation of Pyrazolones as an Entry to &#946;&#8208;Aminoamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A diastereospecific enantiodivergent allylation of pyrazolones is reported which is catalyzed by a planar chiral pentaphenylferrocene based palladacycle. With the same catalyst batch both product enantiomers were selectively available. The method is applicable to structurally diverse substrates and gave products with enantiomeric excesses between 85 and 94%. In addition, we could show that pyrazolones are transformable into &#946;&#8208;aminoamides.
