      <title>A Decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8208;N Bond Forming Reaction to Construct 4&#8208;Imidazolidinones via Post&#8208;Ugi Cascade Sequence in One Pot</title>
      <dc:description>A post&#8208;Ugi one&#8208;pot cascade was developed to access 4&#8208;imidazolidinones through an intramolecular decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8208;N bond forming reaction. The reaction has a broad tolerance for a variety of substituted aldehydes, anilines, isocyanides and glyoxylic acids.  The cascade reaction scope was expanded to synthesize spiroimidazolidinone by the replacement of aldehyde with aliphatic ketone in the Ugi reaction. Subsequently, the methodology was applied to synthesize the core structures of pharmaceuticals GSK2137305 and SCH 900822 under the mild and facile conditions with one purification. This cascade reaction generates opportunities for the tailored synthesis of a range of biologically active 4&#8208;imidazolidinones through tuneable Ugi inputs.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydroboration of Enynes and Mechanistic Insights</title>
      <dc:description>Organoboron compounds have found broad applications in the construction of novel C&#8210;C, C&#8210;O, and C&#8210;N bonds via transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. The hydroboration of C&#8210;C multiple bonds is one of the most important methodologies to introduce the boron atom into the organic skeleton. Traditionally, boranes were employed in the hydroboration of enynes under transition metal&#8208;free conditions. When precious metal catalysts, such as palladium and rhodium were employed in the reactions, the scope of the hydroboration, as well as the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, was improved. The asymmetric hydroboration of enynes was also achieved via Pd&#8208;catalyzed reactions. In recent years, the non&#8208;precious 3d&#8208;metal catalysts, such as iron, cobalt, nickel and copper were employed in the hydroboration of enynes, especially in enantioselective reactions. In this review, we have looked into the hydroboration of enynes as well as their mechanisms.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The field in dearomatization of aromatic compounds for the construction of spirocycle compounds has been developed rapidly over the last two decades and it provides alternative synthetic method without using extra stoichiometric amounts of chemical oxidants or reductants. In addition, the radical cascade reactions of alkenes or alkynes that produce multiple chemical bonds in one&#8208;step are significant in the direct and efficient building of complex molecules. By combining these two concepts, dearomatization and radical cascade reactions of alkenes or alkynes opens a new and powerful avenue in accessing spirocycle molecules.

      <title>NHC&#8208;Ni(0) catalyzed diastereodivergent hydroacylative enyne cyclization: synthesis of heterocycles bearing &#947;&#8208;enone</title>
      <dc:description>NHC&#8208;Nickel(0) catalyzed 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;diastereodivergent hydroacylative heteroenyne cyclization with aldehydes was achieved (Syn&#8208;:Anti&#8208;, switchable from up to 1:99 to 98:2). Both sets of heterocyclic diastereomers are accessible via this route, with a high &#947;&#8208;:&#945;&#8208;enone structure ratio. Preliminary DFT investigations indicated that the manipulation of the N&#8208;substituent exerts a direct influence on the diastereoselectivity of NHC&#8208;nickelacyclopentene formation. The energy differences associated with the endocyclic bond angle (C&#8208;Z&#8208;C) changes noted in the calculations, might possibly account for the broad scope and high diastereodivergent selectivity observed.</dc:description>

      <title>The Chemistry of Azolium&#8208;Carboxylate Zwitterions and Related Compounds: a Survey of the Years 2009&#8211;2020</title>
      <dc:description>This review highlights the most significant advances that were accomplished in the chemistry of azolium&#8208;carboxylate betaines within the years 2009&#8211;2020. Whenever needed, prior, seminal achievements are also briefly recalled to help put recent developments in a broader perspective. The compounds under scrutiny are zwitterions obtained upon nucleophilic addition of N heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) onto carbon dioxide. We first present an overview of the various synthetic paths that give access to these inner salts before discussing their stability. The main part of this report then summarizes the numerous applications relying on NHC&#183;CO2 zwitterions &#8212;employed either in stoichiometric or catalytic proportions&#8212; in the fields of organometallic chemistry and homogeneous catalysis, organic synthesis and organocatalysis, polymer chemistry, and materials science. A particular emphasis is placed on the endeavors devoted to trap carbon dioxide and to convert this greenhouse gas into valuable chemicals via the intermediacy of NHC&#183;CO2 zwitterions. Whenever available, mechanistic considerations that help assess the pivotal role played by these species in CO2 activation are discussed. Because of their close relationship with azolium&#8208;carboxylate betaines, azolium hydrogencarbonate salts and azolium&#8208;methylenecarboxylate zwitterions resulting from the addition of carbon dioxide onto N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) are included in this survey, which also covers the reactivity of carbon monoxide toward NHCs and related carbene species.</dc:description>

      <title>Formate dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus jostii (RjFDH) &#8208; A high&#8208;performance tool for NADH regeneration</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. The use of formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) for regeneration of the important cofactor NADH in enzyme&#8208;catalysed synthetic reactions has several advantages over alternative systems. However, a major bottleneck for broad industrial applications is the low specific activity of the currently used FDHs. In this study, we introduce a novel NAD&#8208;dependent formate dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus jostii (RjFDH) with both high specific activity and stability. The enzyme was identified in a targeted database research and recombinantly obtained from Escherichia coli. RjFDH is a homodimer with a monomeric molecular mass of 44.7 kDa. The homology model shows that all amino acid residues of the NAD&#8208;dependent formate dehydrogenases are usually concerned with catalytic activity, substrate acceptance, and cofactor binding. The only substrate oxidised by these enzymes is formate. RjFDH had a specific activity of 19.9 U mg&#8208;1 at 22 &#176;C along with unimpaired activity and high stability over a broad pH range. The Km values for formate and NAD+ were 7.3 and 0.098 mmol L&#8208;1, respectively. 
	The optimum temperature was found to be 50 &#176;C, at which the enzyme activity increased to about 318%. Both activity and thermal stability were higher than those of the FDH from Candida boidinii (CbFDH), which is the standard enzyme currently in use for cofactor regeneration. Different solvents roughly had the same impact on the activity and stability of both RjFDH and CbFDH. The superior performance of RjFDH over CbFDH as a regeneration system for NADH was demonstrated for the synthesis of L&#8208;tert&#8208;leucine as well as (S)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol. In both systems, the concentration of RjFDH used was only one&#8208;third of the concentration of CbFDH required to achieve comparable conversion rates. Rational designing provided a promising NADP&#8208;accepting variant. Thus, RjFDH has a great potential to serve as an alternative system for NADH regeneration in enzyme&#8208;catalysed synthetic reactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Silylcarboxylic Acids as Bifunctional Reagents: Application in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed External&#8208;CO&#8208;Free Carbonylative Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed external&#8208;CO&#8208;free carbonylative Hiyama&#8208;Denmark cross&#8208;coupling reaction is presented. The introduction of silylcarboxylic acids as bifunctional reagents (CO and nucleophile source) avoids the need for external gaseous CO and a silylarene coupling partner. The transformation features high functional group tolerance and it is successful with electron&#8208;rich, &#8208;neutral, and &#8208;poor aryl iodides. Stoichiometric studies and control experiments provide insight into the reaction mechanism and support the hypothesized dual role of silylcarboxylic acids.</dc:description>

      <title>Zinc/Indium Bimetallic Lewis Acid Relay Catalysis for Dehydrogenative Silylation/Hydrosilylation Reaction of Terminal Alkynes with Bis(hydrosilane)s</title>
      <dc:description>When mixed with two different Lewis acid catalysts of zinc and indium, terminal alkynes were found to elegantly react with bis(hydrosilane)s to selectively give 1,1&#8208;disilylalkenes from among several possible products, by way of a sequential dehydrogenative silylation/intramolecular hydrosilylation reaction. Adding a pyridine base is crucial in this reaction; a switch as a catalyst of the zinc Lewis acid is turned on by forming a zinc&#8208;pyridine&#8208;base complex. A range of the 1,1&#8208;disilylalkenes can be obtained by a combination of aryl and aliphatic terminal alkynes plus aryl&#8208;, heteroaryl&#8208;, and naphthyl&#8208;tethered bis(hydrosilane)s. The 1,1&#8208;disilylalkene prepared here is available as a reagent for further transformations by utilizing its C&#8208;Si or C=C bond: the former includes Hiyama cross&#8208;coupling, bismuth&#8208;catalyzed ether formation, and iododesilylation; the latter includes double alkylation and epoxidation. Mechanistic studies clarified the role of the two Lewis acids: the zinc&#8208;pyridine&#8208;base complex catalyzes the dehydrogenative silylation as a first stage, and, following on this, the indium Lewis acid catalyzes the ring&#8208;closing hydrosilylation as a second stage, thus leading to the 1,1&#8208;disilylalkene.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Progress on Reductive Coupling of Nitroarenes by Using Organosilanes as Convenient Reductants</title>
      <dc:description>Nitroarenes are stable, low&#8208;cost, and readily available starting materials. The directly utilize nitroarenes in synthetically valuable C&#8211;N bond formation is of great significance, because the pre&#8208;reduction step to corresponding amines can be avoided. Previously, phosphines and carbon monoxide (CO) are the most widely used reductants in the reductive cyclization or/and carbonylation of nitroarenes. Currently, much attention has been attracted to organosilanes as new potential reducing agents, not only because they are inexpensive, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, and mild reagents, but also various novel reaction models of nitroarenes have been explored. In this review, we mainly summarize the recent progress on the reductive coupling of nitroarenes by using organosilanes as the end reductants. We hope that a deep understanding of the reaction model and underlying working mechanism can provide a timely guideline for researchers who are interested in this fantastic area, leading to further exploration of practical and efficient reductive coupling of nitroarenes for C&#8208;N bond formation and N&#8208;heterocycle synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Heteroarene&#8208;Fused Cyclopentadienes and Related Compounds Suitable for Metallocene Preparation</title>
      <dc:description>Metallocene catalysis is widely used in transformations of unsaturated organic compounds, including the bulk industrial synthesis of polyolefins. Over the last few decades, the electronic and structural properties of their &#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;coordinated ligands have been modified by introducing electron&#8208;donating, electron&#8208;withdrawing, and sterically hindered substituents to obtain desirable catalytic properties for the metallocenes. An efficient way to design &#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;coordinated ligands is to exploit the annelation of heterocyclic fragments with a cyclopentadiene ring. In the present review, we summarize, systematize, and analyze synthetic approaches to heterocycle&#8208;fused cyclopentadienes suitable for metallocene catalyst preparation.
