      <title>Application of Conjugated Carbonyls in the Synthesis of Heterocycles via Oxidative Cycloaddition and Cyclization Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Synthesis of pharmaceutically active heterocycles is always appealing as the majority of the widely used drugs contain heterocyclic moieties as their core structure. So, the straightforward construction of heterocycles from readily available/accessible reagents is one of the prime targets of the synthetic chemists. In this context, C&#8208;H functionalization has emerged as an effective tool for the designing and synthesis of various heterocyclic moieties as it offers a straight&#8208;forward and step&#8208;economic pathway. On the other hand, the readily available/accessible conjugated carbonyls are well&#8208;known reagents for the construction of carbocycles and heterocycles over the years. However, the employment of C&#8208;H functionalization of the two C&#8208;H bond of the conjugated alkene in carbocycle/heterocycle synthesis was not so explored. In the last decade, much focus has been paid 	on the synthesis of various pharmaceutically active heterocycles through C&#8208;H bond functionalization of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes/ketones. These protocols have been developed through either oxidative coupling of conjugated carbonyls with suitable coupling partners or intramolecular C&#8208;H bond functionalization of conjugated carbonyls. In this review, we will discuss all the methodologies developed for the synthesis of heterocycles employing intermolecular C&#8208;H bond functionalization of conjugated carbonyls. The mechanistic pathways and usefulness of the methodologies will be also highlighted.

      <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed and Air&#8208;Mediated C(sp3)&#8211;H Phosphorylation of 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds Involving C&#8211;C Bond Cleavage</title>
      <dc:description>A cheap and efficient C(sp3)&#8211;H phosphorylation has been achieved via the iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions between 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds and P(O)&#8211;H compounds involving C&#8211;C bond cleavages with air as the oxidant.

      <title>Benzylpalladium Intermediates: Unique and Versatile Reactive Intermediates for Aromatic Functionalization</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract: Aromatic functionalizations are of current interest and importance in organic chemistry, recent transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reactions can transform inert C&#8211;H bond into C&#8211;X (X = C, O, N, etc.) bonds, greatly enriching aromatic chemistry and related fields. Some well known palladium&#8211;containing intermediates such as palladacycles and allylpalladium intermediates play an important role in organic conversions. Similar with allyl group, benzyl group also possesses the capability of stabilizing palladium through &#951;3&#8208;binding. In the process of the formation of benzyl palladium intermediate, there is a transition state of dearomatization. Therefore, it is a challenging and meaningful research topic to seize these aromatic destruction intermediates, realize selective functionalization reaction on 	aromatic ring via them, and inhibit the formation of traditional benzylated products. Herein, we summarized the recent efforts on expanding the synthetic utility, as well as exploring the mechanism in aromatic functionalization via reactive benzyl palladium intermediates. We envision that the transformation via benzyl palladium intermediates will help promote the development in the &#64257;eld of palladium&#8211;catalyzed aromatic regioselective functionalization.</dc:description>

      <title>Tandem Annulations of Propargylic Alcohols to Indole Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>Indole derivatives are important heterocycles in organic synthesis for serving as privileged building blocks for functional material and as key components in a lot of bioactive compounds. Propargylic alcohols, bearing alkynyl and hydroxyl functional groups, have emerged as promising feedstock materials for the construction of carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. Especially, in the last decade, the Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acid catalysed tandem annulations of propargylic alcohols to build structurally diverse indole derivatives have been well&#8208;investigated. In this review, we summarize two main synthetic strategies toward indole derivatives via the cascade reactions of propargylic alcohols: indole&#8208;ring formation involved tandem reactions and the direct function&#8208;alization of indole skeletons. We hope this review would help to develop new and more efficient protocols for the synthesis of indole&#8208;included N&#8208;heterocycles.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Polychloromethylation Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Molecules with di&#8208; or trichloromethyl group are widely existed in natural products and man&#8208;made structures that represent special activities in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Besides, polychloromethyl&#8208;containing compounds are also high valuable intermediates in organic synthesis and also can be used as functional materials. Therefore, significant efforts have been made toward the incorporation of polychloromethyl groups into certain structures. In this field, a variety of polychloromethyl reagents, such as CH2Cl2, HCCl3, CCl4, TMSCCl3, TMSCCl2H, etc. have been utilized as the di&#8208; or trichloromethyl sources toward polychloromethylated structures through radical, nucleophilic, and other reaction patterns. 
In this review, we summarized and discussed the recent achievements in the synthesis of polychloromethylated compounds, mainly focused on the employment of different polychloromethyl reagents. Most of the works we investigated were reported after 2010. Mechanism discussions and outlooks were also given.</dc:description>

In this review, we summarized and discussed the recent achievements in the synthesis of polychloromethylated compounds, mainly focused on the employment of different polychloromethyl reagents. Most of the works we investigated were reported after 2010. Mechanism discussions and outlooks were also given.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of C2&#8208;Functionalized Pyridines and Quinolines Using &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Oxide Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>While remarkable progress has recently been made for the direct C&#8208;H&#8208;functionalization of azines, its application is still limited by a lack of accessible functional groups (primarily carbon&#8208;based) and poor regioselectivity. In contrast, C2&#8208;functionalized pyridines and quinolines can be easily synthesized by treating readily available N&#8208;oxides with various reagents under appropriate activation conditions. This review seeks to comprehensively document the available synthetic methods for introducing functional groups at the C2 position of pyridines and quinolines. In this work, we highlight recent developments in the C2&#8208;functionalization of pyridine and quinoline N&#8208;oxides and address both the mechanisms and regioselectivity of the reactions. We also describe the pathways and reactive species involved in these processes and highlight a number of medically relevant nitrogen heteroaromatics.</dc:description>

      <title>Cyclization of Vinylketene Dithioacetals: A Synthetic Strategy for Substituted Thiophenes</title>
      <dc:description>A synthetic strategy for the synthesis of substituted thiophenes is described by the one&#8208;pot reaction of indoles with ketene dithioacetals under mild reaction conditions. Promoted by triflic acid (TfOH), the reaction of indoles with the easily available &#945;&#8208;acetyl ketene dithioacetals resulted in the formation of vinylketene dithioacetals via condensation instead of the well known nucleophilic addition&#8208;alkylthio elimination process. In the presence of CuBr2, vinylketene dithioacetals can cyclize into the corresponding substituted thiophenes. This transformation may benefit from the acidic reaction conditions and the steric effects of the 2&#8208;substituted indoles.</dc:description>

      <title>A Nickel&#8208;Bisdiamine Porous Organic Polymer as Heterogeneous Chiral Catalyst for Asymmetric Michael Addition to Aliphatic Nitroalkenes</title>
      <dc:description>We report a polystyrene&#8208;incorporated chiral nickel(II)&#8208;bisdiamine complex, which is accessible on gram&#8208;scale. This metal complex functions as a heterogeneous catalyst for the enantioselective Michael addition between malonates and aliphatic nitroalkenes, and it provides yields and enantioselectivities on par with homogeneous catalysts. Good functional group tolerance is reported for this reaction. Upon recycling, the catalyst achieves significantly higher TONs than previously reported. We demonstrate scalability to multigram&#8208;scale, compatibility with continuous flow production (4.43 gram), and application to the synthesis of the blockbuster drug Pregabalin. Finally, a new tandem reaction is disclosed.</dc:description>

      <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of N&#8208;Propargyl Alkynes and Axial Chiral N&#8208;Allenes with Epimeric Pyrroloimidazolone Auxiliaries</title>
      <dc:description>
The front cover picture, provided by Dudding, Metallinos and co&#8208;workers, illustrates that N&#8208;propargyl derivatives of L&#8208;proline hydantoin participate in reactions that can be driven in several directions (even in reverse!). For example, opposite enantiomers of alkylated propargyl products can be prepared from epimeric starting materials that are geared to give a reversal in stereochemistry. Reactions can also be driven to give axial chiral allenes with selectable stereochemistry at a distal benzylic alcohol by shifting the reaction conditions. Choose the right gear to select your product! Details of this work can be found in the full paper on pages xxxx&#8211;xxxx (M. L. Sechi, M. Andrade, H. Foy, M. Pilkington, T. Dudding, C.

      <title>Propargylic Alcohols as Coupling Partners in Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Arene C&#8208;H Activation</title>
      <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed site selective arene C&#8208;H bond activation concomitant functionalization with various coupling partners gain magnificent attraction in synthetic organic chemistry as complementary to traditional transformations. Mechanistically, these C&#8208;H functionalization approaches involve directing group assisted concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation (CMD), migratory insertion, and reductive elimination sequences. In this realm, diverse categories of coupling partners were employed as C&#8208;H functionalization buddies. Particularly alkynes gain enormous  attention as annulating agents. These units coordinates with metalcycle through &#7467;&#8208;interaction produce annulation outcomes in a straightforward manner.
Very recently, propargylic alcohols were appointed as valuable archetypes in arene C&#8208;H activation armoury, as they have shown regio&#8208; and chemoselective migratory insertion into primary metalcycle species via hydroxy chelation. The influential regioselectivity was drawn by dual coordination of metal complexes with the pendent directing group and a propargylic hydroxyl group. In this review, we focused on annulations and functionalization of arenes and propargylic alcohols, which afford intricate cycles as well as complex acyclic motifs in a trouble&#8208;free manner. We categorized these transformations based on number of atoms  of propargylic alcohols involved in annulation along with some addition reactions. We anticipate to pave a way towards enhanced endeavours for discovering novel reaction avenues.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A process for the de novo synthesis of imino&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides is described. The methodology is based on the reaction of 1&#8208;C&#8208;stannylated iminosugars with various electrophiles under the conditions of Migita&#8211;Kosugi&#8211;Stille cross&#8208;couplings, which gives 1&#8208;C&#8208;substituted iminosugar derivatives in a stereoretentive process. The required iminoglycosyl stannanes are obtained by way of the highly stereoselective addition of tributylstannyllithium to (SR)&#8208; or (SS)&#8208;N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl glycosylamines, followed by an activation cyclization sequence.	Most interestingly, the methodology is tunable: the configuration of the tin adduct is controlled exclusively by the tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl auxiliary, thus giving access after ring formation to &#8216;&#945;&#8217;&#8208;configured or &#8216;&#946;&#8217;&#8208;configured iminoglycosyl stannanes.
