         <title>Enantioselective conjugate addition of stabilized arylzinc iodide to enones: an improved protocol of the Hayashi reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stabilised arylzinc iodide, prepared by direct insertion of zinc into aryl iodides, were used as nucleophiles in the Hayashi Rh&#8208;catalysed enantioselective conjugate addition to enones. The reaction conditions were optimized in the addition of phenylzinc iodide to 2&#8208;cyclohexen&#8208;1&#8208;one, obtaining good yields and 99% ee of the addition product. The general applicability of the protocol was checked using different arylzinc iodides and enones. Organometallic reagents endowed with both halogen and electrophilic groups were also successfully used.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Aryl Boronates as Building Blocks in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organoboron compounds are well known building blocks for many organic reactions. However, under basic conditions, polyfluorinated aryl boronic acid derivatives suffer from instability issues that are accelerated in compounds containing an ortho&#8208;fluorine group, which result in the formation of the corresponding protodeboronation products. Therefore, a considerable amount of research has focused on novel methodologies to synthesize these valuable compounds while avoiding the protodeboronation issue. This review summarizes the latest developments in the synthesis of fluorinated aryl boronic acid derivatives and their applications in cross&#8208;coupling reactions and other transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks in Catalytic Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which are built upon dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) with various organic building blocks, possess predesignable, highly ordered and crystalline porous structures. These features endow COFs with great potential in the development of function&#8208;tailored materials, particularly in catalytic organic synthesis. Start from selective oxidation reactions early introduced by Ferdi, Thomas and their co&#8208;workers, and then Wang and co&#8208;workers performed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction through integrating palladium into COFs, increasing numbers of works were established to explore their potentials in the 4.5catalysis of organic reactions. As heterogeneous organic catalysts, COFs bring benefits and solve problems, but also create new obstacles. Hence, we would like to establish a comprehensive system to review some pioneering works in this area. This will help us get a better view so that we can discuss the key and challenging issues we are currently confronted with.

Abstract
A P(III)&#8208;mediated entry towards construction of C&#8722;N/C&#8722;S bond has been devised. The developed heterocyclization method was exercised for the synthesis of a diverse range of N,S&#8208;heterocycles and related spiro molecules. P(NMe2)3 revealed the maximum efficacies under the aerobic reaction conditions and a spectrum of bis&#8208;nucleophiles, and isothiocyanates were tolerated well to serve the access of manifold immense molecules.

         <title>Reactions of Organophosphorus Compounds with Arynes: Reactivity and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl phosphorus compounds find versatile applications in material, medicinal and synthetic chemistry. As a powerful tool, aryne chemistry has been widely utilized in constructing aryl C&#8208;P bonds under mild conditions, which enabled facile accesses to a variety of structurally diverse P&#8208;aryl compounds in good efficiency. The present review aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the chemistry between arynes and organophosphorus compounds, with emphasis placed on reactivity modes and mechanistic aspects. According to the valency of phosphorus atoms, this paper is divided into two main sections, including reactions of arynes with organophosphorus(III) compounds and those with organophosphorus(V) compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we disclose a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed regioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization on the  piperazine core using aldehydes as alkylating agents. The present transformation appears to go through the dehydrogenation of the piperazine to propagate to enamine in situ, followed by nucleophilic addition to the aldehyde and hydrogenation to result in the regioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation. A variety of aromatic, heteroaromatic, aliphatic aldehydes were employed for the C&#8208;3 alkylation of N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N'&#8208;p&#8208;nitrophenyl substituted piperazines.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Construction of C&#8211;C and C=C Bonds by Manganese Catalyzed Coupling of Alcohols with Phosphorus Ylides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the manganese catalyzed coupling of alcohols with phosphorus ylides. The selectivity in the coupling of primary alcohols with phosphorus ylides to form carbon&#8211;carbon single (C&#8211;C) and carbon&#8211;carbon double (C=C) bonds can be controlled by the ligands. In the conversion of more challenging secondary alcohols with phosphorus ylides the selectivity towards the formation of C&#8211;C vs. C=C bonds can be controlled by the reaction conditions, namely the amount of base. The scope and limitations of the coupling reactions were thoroughly evaluated by the conversion of 21 alcohols and 15 ylides. Notably, compared to existing methods, which are based on precious metal complexes as catalysts, the present catalytic system is based on earth abundant manganese catalysts.The reaction can also be performed in a sequential one&#8208;pot reaction generating the phosphorus ylide in situ followed manganese catalyzed C&#8211;C and C=C bond formation. Mechanistic studies suggest that the C&#8211;C bond was generated via a borrowing hydrogen pathway and the C=C bond formation followed an acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling pathway.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a protocol for the NaHSO3&#8208;promoted esterification of sulfonyl hydrazides with alcohols for the synthesis of sulfinic esters. Various sulfonyl hydrazides could be converted to the corresponding sulfinic esters in good to high yields. The merits of this protocol include mild transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free reaction conditions, an inexpensive and available reagent, and operational simplicity. Controlled experiments reveal that this transformation probably undergoes via a radical pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium Catalyzed Ring Expansion Reaction of Isoxazolones with Isocyanides: Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Oxazin&#8208;6&#8208;One Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A palladium catalyzed ring expansion reaction of isoxazolones with isocyanides was disclosed. In the reaction, a cascade process involving ring&#8208;opening/cyclization was suggested. The reaction features high atomic economy due to no elimination of CO2 occurred. Moreover, products obtained demonstrate aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties with relatively high solid&#8208;state emission efficiencies.

         <dc:description>A method for Beckmann rearrangement (BKR) using ethyl 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfonyloxyimino) acetate (o&#8208;NosylOXY) under microwave irradiation is reported. Ketoximes (19 examples) are converted to the corresponding amides/lactams with 69&#8208;97% yields in ~10 minutes without any Lewis acid or co&#8208;catalyst. This is an example of halogen&#8208;free organocatalytic BKR. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)&#8208; and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)&#8208;based detailed mechanistic investigation suggest that o&#8208;NosylOXY acts as an initiator. Such initiators are reported before based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, we report here the HRMS signatures of two transient intermediates, the nitrilium ion and the nitrilium ion's dimeric species. Rigorous NMR&#8208;based investigation of the reaction mechanism is performed. Our results indicate that the reported BKR proceeds via two consecutive rearrangements.</dc:description>

         <title>Threat to the Throne: Can Two Cooperating Boron Atoms Rival Transition Metals in Chemical Bond Activation and Catalysis?</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Certain electron&#8208;rich 1,4&#8208;diborabenzene derivatives efficiently activate single, double, and triple bonds and thereby increasingly compete with transition metals in homogeneous catalysis. This review compares the activation of three model substrates (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by (i) 9,10&#8208;dihydro&#8208;9,10&#8208;diboraanthracene anions, (ii) their neutral carbene&#8208;stabilized congeners, (iii) 1,3,2,5&#8208;diazadiborinines, and (iv) 1,4,2,5&#8208;diazadiborinines. Distinct structure&#8208;properties relationships become apparent, the most influential factors being (i) the steric demands of the B&#8208;bonded substituents, (ii) the charges of the B&#8208;doped (hetero)arenes, (iii) charge polarization as a result of additional N&#8208;doping, and (iv) the energies and nodal structures of the frontier orbitals. The observed reactions are explained by a transition metal&#8208;like activation mechanism. If the two boron atoms are chemically inequivalent, contributions of a B(+I)/B(+III) mixed&#8208;valence state determine the observed regioselectivities when polar substrates are added.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Certain electron&#8208;rich 1,4&#8208;diborabenzene derivatives efficiently activate single, double, and triple bonds and thereby increasingly compete with transition metals in homogeneous catalysis. This review compares the activation of three model substrates (H&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, H&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;C=CH&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;) by (i) 9,10&#8208;dihydro&#8208;9,10&#8208;diboraanthracene anions, (ii) their neutral carbene&#8208;stabilized congeners, (iii) 1,3,2,5&#8208;diazadiborinines, and (iv) 1,4,2,5&#8208;diazadiborinines. Distinct structure&#8208;properties relationships become apparent, the most influential factors being (i) the steric demands of the B&#8208;bonded substituents, (ii) the charges of the B&#8208;doped (hetero)arenes, (iii) charge polarization as a result of additional N&#8208;doping, and (iv) the energies and nodal structures of the frontier orbitals. The observed reactions are explained by a transition metal&#8208;like activation mechanism. If the two boron atoms are chemically inequivalent, contributions of a B(+I)/B(+III) mixed&#8208;valence state determine the observed regioselectivities when polar substrates are added. The lessons learned from the conversions of the model substrates are subsequently used to rationalize the behavior of the B&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; heterocycles also toward more sophisticated substrate molecules. Finally, catalytic cycles based on H&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;&#8208; and H&#8722;&#8208;transfers, hydroboration reactions, and CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; reductions will be covered&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Bulky 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Bipyridine and (S)&#8208;Pyridine&#8208;Oxazoline Ligands</title>

Abstract
Bulky N,N&#8217;&#8208;bidentate ligands can furnish catalysts with enhanced catalytic activity compared to commercially available ligands. Straightforward methods to effectively synthesize a broad range of these ligands, however, are uncommon. In this work, a simple and efficient method is developed for the synthesis of bulky N,N&#8217;&#8208;bidentate ligands, including 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridines and enantioenriched pyridine&#8208;oxazolines. The Pd/NIXANTPHOS catalyst system enabled synthesis of a series of bulky 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;based ligands and (S)&#8208;pyridine oxazoline&#8208;based enantioenriched ligands with good to excellent yields. The ligands have been benchmarked in the aminofluorination of styrene.

         <title>Recent Advances in Asymmetric Organomulticatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Asymmetric multi&#8208;catalysis, designed to mimic catalytic processes in nature, is a powerful instrument to fulfil fascinating transformations. As a result, this area of research has attracted considerable interests within chemistry communities. Although there are numerous reviews involving multi&#8208;catalysis, reviews describing asymmetric organomulticatalysis remain rare. Taking into consideration that organocatalysts possess the superiorities of effortless availability, inexpensiveness, hypotoxicity, facile handling and hyposensitivity to moisture and oxygen, they have definite advantage in their own distinct modes of activation when utilized in multi&#8208;catalytic reactions. Organomulticatalysis refers to the synthetic strategies of modular combination of organo&#8208;catalyzed reactions into one synthetic operation with minimum workup or change in conditions. It is apparent that a variety reports utilizing the concept of enantioselective organomulticatalysis have substantially surfaced in the past few years. Hence, it is indispensable to succinctly present all such reports by means of disclosing the mechanistic analysis, as well as the challenges and issues associated in the development of the asymmetric catalytic system. Additionally, this review will introduce some of the unsettled conundrums and possible innovations in this field.

         <title>Halohydrin Dehalogenases and Their Potential in Industrial Application &#8211; A Viewpoint of Enzyme Reaction Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
At the moment, there are approx. 100 published papers investigating halohydrin dehalogenases from different aspects; enzymology, molecular biology and reactions they can catalyse. Unquestionably, these enzymes are of great importance and hold an immense potential due to the wide spectrum of different compounds that can be synthesized by their action. These compounds, such as chiral epoxides, &#946;&#8208;substituted alcohols, oxazolidinones etc., significantly enrich the chemist's toolbox and, moreover, open the possibility for the synthesis of even more complex compounds. Still, there are many unknowns, and it is the purpose of this work to demonstrate the possibilities and bottlenecks, in scientific sense, that could further help in broadening the applicative potential of these fascinating enzymes.

         <title>Metal&#8208;free, Multicomponent anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydroarylsulfonylation and Alkoxyarylsulfonylation of Vinyl Arenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. A unified strategy for the hydro&#8208;arylsulfonylation of vinyl arenes has been developed under catalyst, additive&#8208;free conditions at room temperature from the corresponding aryldiazonium salts, DABSO (DABCO&#183;2SO2), and thiophenol as hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reagent. Mechanistically, an incipient arylsulfonyl radical is generated from the corresponding aryl diazonium salts and DABSO which undergoes anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition to styrenes followed by hydrogen atom transfer from thiophenol. Interestingly, this multi&#8208;component reaction is highly chemoselective suppressing deleterious thiosulfonylation and thiol&#8208;ene reactions. Tuning the reaction condition, a four&#8208;component difunctionalization with alkoxy group has been achieved using 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene as an oxidant. Furthermore, base&#8208;promoted elimination to form vinyl sulfone has been also examined. The practicability of this present reaction has been demonstrated by the ex situ generation of sulfur dioxide in an H&#8208;type reaction vessel and subsequent hydro&#8208; and alkoxyarylsulfonylation in good to moderate yields. The hydroaylsulfonylation reaction is scalable and applied to a metal&#8208;free synthesis of the key intermediate for an anti&#8208;migraine drug eletriptan.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Pd&#8208;Catalysed Fujiwara&#8208;Moritani type Reaction of N,S&#8208;Heterocyclic Systems with Olefins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;thiazine skeletons bearing olefin fragment at their &#945;&#8208;position were prepared through a robust Pd(OAc)2&#8211;catalysed Fujiwara&#8208;Moritani type reaction via C&#8211;H alkenylation with olefins. This approach is selective, generalizable to a wide range of olefins and requires only 1 eq. of Ag2CO3 without the need of co&#8208;oxidant. The C&#8211;H bond activation proved to be strongly dependent on the olefin&#8217;s substitution while unfused dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;thiazines seemed to be affected by the oxidation state of the sulfur atom. The utility of olefins obtained was demonstrated by their implication in the dipolar cycloaddition reaction with a non&#8208;stabilized azomethine ylide.</dc:description>

The C&#8211;H bond activation proved to be strongly dependent on the olefin&#8217;s substitution while unfused dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;thiazines seemed to be affected by the oxidation state of the sulfur atom. The utility of olefins obtained was demonstrated by their implication in the dipolar cycloaddition reaction with a non&#8208;stabilized azomethine ylide.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Concise Route to 2&#8208;Sulfonylacetonitriles from Sodium Metabisulfite</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component reaction of aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates, sodium metabisulfite, and 3&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;methylbut&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;ol under mild conditions is described. By using abundant and cheap sodium metabisulfite as the sulfur dioxide surrogate, this protocol features good functional group compatibility, affording 2&#8208;arylsulfonylacetonitriles in moderate to good yields. The reaction proceeds smoothly at room temperature without the need of any catalysts or additives. Moreover, the synthetic utility of this method is demonstrated by the transformation of 2&#8208;arylsulfonylacetonitrile into 2&#8208;arylsulfonyl acetamide and 2&#8208;arylsulfonylethylamine.</dc:description>

         <title>Propargylic Alcohols as Coupling Partners in Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Arene C&#8208;H Activation</title>

Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed site selective arene C&#8722;H bond activation concomitant functionalization with various coupling partners gain magnificent attraction in synthetic organic chemistry as complementary to traditional transformations. Mechanistically, these C&#8722;H functionalization approaches involve directing group assisted concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation (CMD), migratory insertion, and reductive elimination sequences. In this realm, diverse categories of coupling partners were employed as C&#8722;H functionalization buddies. Particularly alkynes gain enormous attention as annulating agents. These units coordinates with metalcycle through &#960;&#8208;interaction produce annulation outcomes in a straightforward manner. Very recently, propargylic alcohols were appointed as valuable archetypes in arene C&#8722;H activation armoury, as they have shown regio&#8208; and chemoselective migratory insertion into primary metalcycle species via hydroxy chelation. The influential regioselectivity was drawn by dual coordination of metal complexes with the pendent directing group and a propargylic hydroxyl group. In this review, we focused on annulations and functionalization of arenes and propargylic alcohols, which afford intricate cycles as well as complex acyclic motifs in a trouble&#8208;free manner. We categorized these transformations based on number of atoms of propargylic alcohols involved in annulation along with some addition reactions. We anticipate to pave a way towards enhanced endeavours for discovering novel reaction avenues.

There is a famous sentence in Tao Te Ching: &#8220;The Tao produced one. One produced two. Two produced three. Three produced all things.&#8221; In this front cover picture, Tai Chi stands for Tao, and &#8220;N&#8221; and &#8220;O&#8221; in the two circles represent N&#8208;oxides of this paper. Thunder and lightning stimulate Tai Chi to produce everything, which is represented by the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Therefore, this picture indicates that pyridine N&#8208;oxides can produce numerous nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds under the action of activating reagent. Details can be found in the Review by Dong Wang and co&#8208;workers (L. D&#233;saubry, G. Li, M. Huang, S. Zheng), Adv. Synth. Catal. 2021, 363, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202000910).

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Pentacyclic Proaporphine Alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;Misramine</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An enantioselective total synthesis of pentacyclic proaporphine alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;misramine has been achieved. The synthetic route features a Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization to construct the fused B and C rings and a sequence of Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation, Pinnick oxidation, and pinacol&#8208;type cyclization to install the &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketal moiety. The absolute configuration of the pentacyclic framework was elucidated by X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal analyses of (&#8722;)&#8208;11&#8208;demethoxymisramine.

         <title>Direct C&#8722;H Arylation of Indole&#8208;3&#8208;Acetic Acid Derivatives Enabled by an Autonomous Self&#8208;Optimizing Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Described herein is a continuous&#8208;flow strategy for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8722;H arylation of indole&#8208;3&#8208;acetic acid derivatives with arenediazonium salts. A fully autonomous self&#8208;optimizing flow platform was used to efficiently optimize the coupling reaction in a three&#8208;dimensional space. The flow methodology developed is experimentally simple, mild, broad in scope, and safer than traditional batch approaches. Our continuous&#8208;flow approach is particularly convenient to prepare precursors of pharmaceutically relevant compounds.

         <title>Recent Developments in Radical Cross&#8208;Coupling of Redox&#8208;Active Cycloketone Oximes</title>

Abstract
Recent years have witnessed a renaissance of radical cross&#8208;coupling of cycloketone oximes which served as active cyanoalkyl radical via ring fragmentation in various transformations. It provided an efficient and practical strategy to introduce cyanoalkyl groups into organic compounds without using toxic cyanide sources. In this review, a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the field of redox&#8208;active cycloketone oximes&#8208;based cross&#8208;couplings were covered. This review was categorized into two broad parts: non&#8208;photocatalyzed and photocatalyzed cross&#8208;couplings according to the reaction conditions. Moreover, the two broad parts were further divided into several sub&#8208;sections depending on the nature of the bond formation. Some representative examples along with reaction mechanisms were also discussed.

         <title>Utilizing Alcohols for Cross&#8208;Coupling with Alkenyl Bromides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inside cover picture, designed by Takuya Suga, illustrates the merger of titanium&#8208;mediated homolytic C&#8211;OH bond cleavage and nickel catalysis that realizes a cross&#8208;coupling reaction between benzyl alcohols and alkenyl bromides. The direct application of alcohols to cross&#8208;coupling may set us free from tedious preparations of halides and homolysis&#8208;active esters. Manganese powder was used to reduce titanium(IV) and nickel(II) to their active low&#8208;valent forms that can cleave C&#8211;OH and C&#8211;Br bonds, respectively. More information can be found in the Communication by Suga, Takahashi, and Ukaii. (T. Suga, Y. Takahashi, Y. Ukaji, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2020, 362, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202000945).

         <title>Reduction of Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes Enabled by a Photoinduced Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Direct hydrogen atom transfer from a photoredox&#8208;generated Hantzsch ester radical cation to electron&#8208;deficient alkenes has enabled the development of an efficient formal hydrogenation under mild, operationally simple conditions. The HAT&#8208;driven mechanism is supported by experimental and computational studies. The reaction is applied to a variety of cinnamate derivatives and related structures, irrespective of the presence of electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents in the aromatic ring and with good functional group compatibility.

         <title>Gold Catalysis Meets Materials Science &#8211; A New Approach to &#960;&#8208;Extended Indolocarbazoles</title>

Abstract
Herein we describe a modular, convergent synthesis of substituted benzo[a]benzo[6,7]&#8208;indolo[2,3&#8208;h]carbazoles (BBICZs) using a bidirectional gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction as a key step. A building block strategy enabled the easy variation of substituents at different positions of the core structure and a general analysis of substitution effects on the materials properties of the target compounds. All BBICZs were fully characterized and their optical and electronic properties were studied experimentally as well as by computational methods. Organic thin&#8208;film transistors based on eight selected derivatives were fabricated by vacuum deposition and charge&#8208;carrier mobilities up to 1&#8197;cm2/Vs were measured.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Heterocyclics via Cascade Cyclization of Propargylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Heterocyclic compounds are important organic compounds and have emerged as key scaffolds in numerous drugs, natural products, vitamins, biologically and pharmaceutically active compounds. Over the past few decades, the development of versatile methodologies employing propargylic alcohols as synthons for the construction of heterocyclic skeletons has attracted great attention from synthetic chemists. In this review, recent developments in the cascade cyclization of propargylic alcohols with diverse nucleophiles to construct heterocyclic compounds are summarized. According to the types of nucleophiles, these reactions can be divided into four categories: 1) Reactions involving C&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation; 2) Reactions involving O, S&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation; 3) Reactions involving N, P&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation; 4) Reactions involving halo&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation.

Abstract
A direct carbocyclization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophthalazine&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones is achieved using isocyanates as carbonyl source via Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed sequential ortho&#8208;amidation followed by intramolecular nucleophilic substitution, delivering substituted indazolo[1,2&#8208;b]phthalazine&#8208;triones in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. For ortho&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophthalazine&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones, the corresponding amidated products were also isolated in excellent yields by modifying the reaction parameters. Application of isocyanates as carbonyl source, high functional group tolerance on the two coupling partners and diverse chemical transformation of the synthesized fused and functionalized phthalazinones are the key highlights of the work.

Abstract
An efficient approach to regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of (Z)&#8208;vinylsulfonylated quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;ones has been developed. This oxidative reaction involves copper&#8208;catalyzed vinylsulfonylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with alkynes and sulfonyl hydrazides. Various functionalized vinylsulfonylated quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives have been synthesized in excellent yields. The reaction proceeds via sulfonyl radicals generated from sulfonyl hydrazides.

Abstract
(R)&#8208;1&#8208;(4&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;(3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethan&#8208;1&#8208;ol [(R)&#8208;2] is a key chiral intermediate in the synthesis of telotristat ethyl, an anti&#8208;carcinoid syndrome drug. However, the synthetic methods for (R)&#8208;2 mainly include chemical reductions, rarely involving biocatalysis or bioreduction until now. Here, we report a method for obtaining (R)&#8208;2 by biocatalytic reduction of corresponding prochiral acetophenone (1) with bulky o&#8208;substitution using recombinant Lactobacillus fermentum short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase 1 (LfSDR1) as a biocatalyst. Further engineering of LfSDR1 variants could access asymmetric reduction of 1 and yield (R)&#8208;2 with a &gt;99% ee and a &gt;99% conversion. In addition, through the test of different co&#8208;solvents and a series of initial substrate concentrations, substrate 1 with the concentration of 60&#8197;g/L can be completely converted into (R)&#8208;2 on a preparative scale (1.13&#8197;g, 3.93&#8197;mmol, 75.6% isolated yield) in 24&#8197;hours. This study presents an efficient enzymatic process for the biocatalytic synthesis of key chiral intermediate (R)&#8208;2 in the synthesis of telotristat ethyl.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Bicyclic and [3+2]&#8208;Annulations of Internal Propargyl Alcohols with Nitrones and Imines To Yield to Two Distinct Heterocycles</title>

Abstract
A gold&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of 1,3&#8208;dihydrooxazolo[3,4&#8208;a]indoles from 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;4&#8208;ols and nitrones is described; this new bicyclic annulation presents the first examples that internal alkynes can react with nitrones to undergo an oxoarylation route. DFT calculations indicate a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic shift of initial alkenylgold intermediates to elude the intermediacy of gold carbenes. We also developed new [3+2]&#8208;annulations of the same 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;4&#8208;ols with imines, yielding oxazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;ylidene derivatives efficiently. The tethered alcohols of these 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;ynes allow trapping of their metastable 2&#8208;azadienium intermediates to enable a novel annulation. Our mechanistic analysis indicates that the two products, despite their structural relevance, are produced from two independent systems.

         <title>Lewis Acid Catalyzed Reductive Cyclization of 2&#8208;Aryloxybenzaldehydes and 2&#8208;(Arylthio)benzaldehydes to Unsubstituted 9H&#8208;Xanthenes and Thioxanthenes in Diisopropyl Ether</title>

Abstract
Readily accessible 2&#8208;aryloxybenzaldehydes and 2&#8208;(arylthio)benzaldehydes undergo a sequence of reactions leading to a wide variety of unsubstituted 9H&#8208;xanthenes and thioxanthenes in high yields when heated with a Lewis acid in diisopropyl ether. This reductive cyclization method is compatible with several important functional groups. The method is also applicable for the selective reductive cyclization of the more electron&#8208;rich aryl ring of a 2,6&#8208;bis(aryloxy)benzaldehyde. The key feature of this transformation is the chemoselective reduction of a transient xanthylium ion in the presence of aldehydic group via intermolecular hydride transfer from diisopropyl ether (solvent).

         <title>Synthesis of Hydrobenzoimidazoles from para&#8208;Quinamines and 1,3,5&#8208;Triazinanes via a Formal [3+2] Annulation Reaction</title>

Abstract
The synthesis of hydrobenzoimidazoles from para&#8208;quinamines and 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes was achieved via a formal [3+2] annulation reaction in the presence of In(OTf)3 as the catalyst. Further studies demonstrated that the synthesis of hydrobenzooxazoles could also be accomplished via the same strategy from para&#8208;quinols and 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Biaryls using Biaryl 2,5&#8208;Diphenylphospholanes as Ligands for Palladium&#8208;Catalysed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reactions</title>

Abstract
Here we describe the development of biaryl 2,5&#8208;diphenylphospholanes as a new class of C2&#8208;symmetric, monodentate ligands for asymmetric Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura (ASM) reactions. Screening of a series of exemplary phospholanes led to the identification of two ligands that were used to prepare a range of atropisomeric biaryl and heterobiaryl products with good to excellent levels of enantioselectivity (up to 97:3 e.r.) under mild conditions. DFT studies suggest that the formation of a constraining ligand pocket and coordination of one of the biaryl methoxy groups in the optimised ligands to the metal centre is crucial for restricting conformational freedom in the bond&#8208;forming step.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A direct synthesis of spiro[5.5] and [5.4]&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines has been developed through C(sp3)&#8212;H bond functionalization triggered by sequential [1,5]&#8208; hydride shift /cyclization sequence using ortho amino benzaldehydes and active methylene compounds such as 2&#8208;coumaranone, 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin, 3&#8208;coumaranone, and 3&#8208;isochromanone. This protocol provides a Lewis acid catalyst&#8208;free straight forward one&#8208;pot reaction in cases of 2&#8208;coumaranone and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin, Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed stepwise reaction for 3&#8208;coumaranone and 3&#8208;isochromanone to access a wide range of spiro&#8208;heterocycles in excellent to good yields and diastereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Achievements in the Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Concise Construction of Medium N&#8208;Heterocycles, Azepines and Azocines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Medium N&#8208;heterocycles, azepines and azocines, serve as important skeletons that occurred widely in natural products, however, due to the lack of efficient synthetic methodologies, their application potential in biologically active molecules, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals remained to be explored. In this context, rhodium catalysis in this field featured good reactivity and functional group tolerance, with readily available starting materials, and enabled rapid access to the azepines and azocines. Delightfully, great achievements in the concise construction of these 7 and 8&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles under rhodium catalysis have been made, which mainly included cycloisomerization of unsaturated C&#8722;X bonds (which might also combine the ring&#8208;opening strategy on strained rings), metal carbenoid or nitrene insertion involved transformations and direct C&#8722;H activation reactions. Considering the great performance of rhodium catalyst in the synthesis of azepines and azocines, herein, we summarized the recent results in this field, and wish to give further insight and inspired more encouraging methodologies and new drug discovery based on these 7 and 8&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles.

         <title>Modular Tandem Mizoroki&#8208;Heck/Reductive Heck Reactions to Construct Fluorenes from Cyclic Diaryliodoniums</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Starting from cyclic diaryliodoniums and terminal alkenes, a diverse set of fluorenes is conveniently constructed. The reactions catalyzed by palladium undergo one conventional Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reaction and one reductive Heck reaction. The scope of alkenes is general, leading to 29 fluorenes which would expand the structural diversity of fluorene reservoir.

         <title>Nickel/Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Hydrocyanation of Alkynes with Formamide as the Cyano Source, Dehydrant, Reductant, and Solvent</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A Ni/Co co&#8208;catalyzed reductive hydrocyanation of various alkynes was developed for the production of saturated nitriles. Hydrocyanic acid is generated in&#8197;situ from safe and readily available formamide. Formamide played multiple roles as a cyano source, dehydrant, and reductant for the NiII pre&#8208;catalyst and vinyl nitriles, along with acting as the co&#8208;solvent in this reaction. Detailed mechanistic investigation supported a pathway via hydrocyanation of C&#8801;C bond and the subsequent reduction of C=C bond. Wide substrate scope, the employment of a cheap and stable nickel salt as pre&#8208;catalyst, a safe cyano source and convenient experimental operation render this hydrocyanation practical for the laboratory synthesis of saturated nitriles.

         <title>Modular and Chemoselective Strategy for Accessing (Distinct) &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Dihaloketones from Weinreb Amides and Dihalomethyllithiums</title>

Abstract
The selective transfer of diversely functionalized dihalomethyllithiums (LiCHBrCl, LiCHClI, LiCHBrI, LiCHCl2, LiCHBr2, LiCHFI) to Weinreb amides for preparing gem&#8208;dihaloketones in one synthetic operation is reported. The capability of these amides as acylating agents and, the wide availability of dihalomethanes as pronucleophiles, enable a straightforward route to the title compounds under full chemocontrol. No racemization phenomena were evidenced in the case of optically active materials. Additionally, tolerance to sensitive functional groups (esters, amides, halogens, olefins etc.) was uniformly noticed, thus making this conceptually intuitive strategy flexible and tunable by the operator.

Abstract
The palladium&#8208;catalysed sp3 C&#8722;H arylation of a selection of saturated amine scaffolds was investigated using substituted picolinamide directing groups. On the bornylamine scaffold, highly selective monoarylation takes place using unsubstituted picolinamide or 3&#8208;methylpicolinamide, whereas a double C&#8722;H arylation occurs with other substituents present, becoming a significant product with 3&#8208;trifluoromethylpicolinamide. DFT calculations were used to help rationalise the effect of directing groups on the C&#8722;H palladation steps which were found experimentally to be irreversible. The substituted picolinamide directing groups were also examined on acyclic amine scaffolds and in many cases increased yields and selectivity could be obtained using methylpicolinamides. For a selection of other amine scaffolds, the yield of C&#8722;H arylation could be improved significantly using 3&#8208;methylpicolinamide as the directing group and/or 3&#8208;methylpentan&#8208;3&#8208;ol as the solvent

Abstract
A metal&#8208;free, visible&#8208;light promoted intramolecular azole C&#8722;H bond amination for the rapid and efficient synthesis of pharmaceutical important 1,2,3&#8208;triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]quinazolin&#8208;5(4H)&#8208;ones has been developed. Employing 2&#8208;(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzamides as the easily available precursors and catalytic amount of I2 as an initiator, the desired product were isolated in moderate to excellent yiels with a broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance. Furthermore, this protocol features mild conditions, operational simplicity, and easy scale&#8208;up. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested that a radical pathway might be involved during the reaction.

         <title>Differences in the Performance of Allyl Based Palladium Precatalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reactions</title>

Abstract
Palladium(II) precatalysts are used extensively to facilitate cross&#8208;coupling reactions because they are bench stable and give high activity. As a result, precatalysts such as Buchwald's palladacycles, Organ's PEPPSI species, Nolan's allyl&#8208;based complexes, and Yale's 1&#8208;tert&#8208;butylindenyl containing complexes, are all commercially available. Comparing the performance of the different classes of precatalysts is challenging because they are typically used under different conditions, in part because they are reduced to the active species via different pathways. However, within a particular class of precatalyst, it is easier to compare performance because they activate via similar pathways and are used under the same conditions. Here, we evaluate the activity of different allyl&#8208;based precatalysts, such as (&#951;3&#8208;allyl)PdCl(L), (&#951;3&#8208;crotyl)PdCl(L), (&#951;3&#8208;cinnamyl)PdCl(L), and (&#951;3&#8208;1&#8208;tert&#8208;butylindenyl)PdCl(L) in Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions. Specifically, we evaluate precatalyst performance as the ancillary ligand (NHC or phosphine), reaction conditions, and substrates are varied. In some cases, we connect relative activity to both the mechanism of activation and the prevalence of the formation of inactive palladium(I) dimers. Additionally, we compare the performance of in&#8197;situ generated precatalysts with commonly used palladium sources such as tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd2dba3), bis(acetonitrile)dichloropalladium(II) (Pd(CH3CN)2Cl2), and palladium acetate. Our results provide information about which precatalyst to use under different conditions.

Abstract
A catalytic defluorinative ring&#8208;opening indolylation of siloxydifluorocyclopropanes was reported. It was found that AgBF4&#8208;catalyzed reaction of siloxydifluorocyclopropanes with indoles could be controlled to deliver &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;indolyl&#8208;propanones within 1.5&#8197;hours at room temperature. Cyclization of these &#945;&#8208;fluoroketone derivatives were then carried out in the presence of trifluoroacetic anhydride in toluene at room temperature. Carbazoles were formed efficiently via an intramolecularly nucleophilic addition of the in&#8197;situ formed enamine intermediate to the keto carbonyl, followed by a sequential hydrolysis and eliminations of trifluoroacetic acid and hydrogen fluoride.

Abstract
The modification of strong Csp3&#8722;H bonds via iron carbene intermediates under mild reaction conditions has been an important challenge with attractive prospective in organic synthesis. In this work, we show the efficient combination of an electrophilic iron catalyst with a lithium Lewis acid for the functionalization of strong Csp3&#8722;H bonds of cyclic and linear alkanes by the activation of commercially available ethyl diazoacetate (EDA). The reaction proceeds with good yields, under mild reaction conditions (40&#8201;&#176;C) and large excess of substrate is not needed. In addition, excellent activity is observed in the cyclopropanation of challenging aliphatic olefins.

Abstract
A low cost FeCl3&#8208;mediated cascade annulation of trifluoroacetimidoyl chlorides and hydrazides for the efficient synthesis of 5&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoles has been developed. The transformation proceeds through a cascade base&#8208;promoted intermolecular C&#8722;N bond formation and FeCl3&#8208;mediated intramolecular dehydration sequence under mild conditions. The protocol exhibits many notable features and can be readily scaled up to gram scale.

Abstract
An acid&#8208;free N&#8208;nitrosation/nitration of the N&#8722;H bonds in secondary amines with Fe(NO3)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O as the nitroso/nitro source through an electrocatalyzed radical coupling reaction was developed. Cyclic aliphatic amines and N&#8208;heteroaromatic compounds were N&#8208;nitrosated and N&#8208;nitrated, respectively, under mild conditions. Control and competition experiments, as well as kinetic studies, demonstrate that N&#8208;nitrosation and N&#8208;nitration involve two different radical reaction pathways involving N+ and N. radicals. Moreover, the electrocatalysis method enables the preferential activation of the N&#8722;H bond over the electrode and thus provides high selectivity for specific N atoms. Finally, this strategy exhibits a broad scope and provides a green and straightforward approach to generate useful N&#8208;nitroso/nitro compounds in good yields.

Abstract
In this work, a one&#8208;pot sequential organocatalytic method for the synthesis of fused [1,2,3]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines through successive cyclization and condensation is presented. In this synthetic strategy, the intermolecular [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition occurs between 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds and o&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;substituted phenylazide compounds, for the formation of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazole intermediates. Subsequently, an intramolecular condensation reaction generates the fused quinoline ring by the new C&#8722;C bond formation, giving the products in yields ranging from moderate to excellent. All the reactions were performed using 20&#8197;mol% of 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU) as catalyst in the presence of DMSO as solvent at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 24&#8197;h and tolerate a range of 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds, such as &#946;&#8208;keto esters and 1,3&#8208;diketones, and o&#8208;formyl, o&#8208;acetyl or o&#8208;benzoyl substituted phenylazide compounds.

Abstract
We describe the application of S&#8722;H bond insertion reactions of aryl diazoacetates with cysteine residues that enabled metal&#8208;free, S&#8722;H functionalization under visible&#8208;light conditions. Moreover, this process could be intensified by a continuous&#8208;flow photomicroreactor on the acceleration of the reaction (6.5&#8197;min residence time). The batch and flow protocols described were applied to obtain a wide range of functionalized cysteine derivatives and cysteine&#8208;containing dipeptides, thus providing a straightforward and general platform for their functionalizations in mild conditions.

Abstract
A general and selective Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aromatic boronic acids with vinyl&#8208;imidazoles is disclosed. Unlike most cross&#8208;coupling reactions, this method operates well in absence of bases avoiding the formation of by&#8208;products. The reactivity is highly enhanced by the presence of nitrogen&#8208;based ligands, in particular bathocuproine. The method involves MnO2 as oxidant for the oxidation Pd (0)&#8594;Pd (II), a much weaker oxidant than previously reported in the literature. This allows for the use of reactants that possess a multitude of functional groups. A scope and limitation study involving a series of 24 boronic acids, whereof 18 afforded TMs in yields in the range 41&#8211;95%. The disclosed method constitutes the first general method for the oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling on the imidazole scaffold, which moreover operates with a selection of other heterocycles.

The front cover picture, designed by Peng&#8208;Cheng Wang and co&#8208;workers, illustrates the electrochemical N&#8208;nitrosation/N&#8208;nitration of cyclic aliphatic amines and N&#8208;heteroaromatic compounds, respectively, under acid&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. The electrocatalysis method enables the preferential activation of the N&#8208;H bond and shows high selectivity for specific N atoms. It exhibits a broad scope and provides a green and straightforward approach to generate useful N&#8208;nitroso/nitro compounds in good yields.

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;front cover picture&lt;/b&gt;, designed by Peng&#8208;Cheng Wang and co&#8208;workers, illustrates the electrochemical N&#8208;nitrosation/N&#8208;nitration of cyclic aliphatic amines and N&#8208;heteroaromatic compounds, respectively, under acid&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. The electrocatalysis method enables the preferential activation of the N&#8208;H bond and shows high selectivity for specific N atoms. It exhibits a broad scope and provides a green and straightforward approach to generate useful &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;nitroso/nitro compounds in good yields.

         <title>Recent Advances in Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Annulations to Benzazepines and Benzodiazepines</title>

Abstract
Benzazepines and benzodiazepines, benzofused seven&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles, compose an important family of natural products and pharmaceuticals. Although certainly important and effectives, classical synthetic methods of these cyclic compounds involve methodologies that often require multistep procedures, with generation of waste materials and lack of sustainability. By contrast, cycloadditions based on transition metal catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activations (oxidative annulations) have emerged as appealing strategies for more sustainable synthetic processes. In this review, we focus our attention to describe the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed annulations via C&#8722;H activations to benzazepines and benzodiazepines.

         <title>An Overview of Water&#8208;Mediated Alkyne Functionalization by Neighboring Group Participation of Carbonyl Groups</title>

Abstract
Reviewed herein, the progress employing the assistance of a neighboring carbonyl group for alkyne functionalization reactions that are mediated by water. Proper arrangement of these transformations is synthetically worthwhile because it will allow chemists to design straightforward synthetic routes for the construction of complex architectures with perfect regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity. Researchers must understand the mechanism before aiming a new idea based on these types of transformations as they proceed through a different way in comparison to the strategies that employ carbonyl groups as a directing group for C&#8722;H functionalization reactions. In general, an oxygen transposition event occurs in the presence of an alkyne activator. In an aim to expose the molecular diversity that can now be accessed employing intramolecular carbonyl assistance, all the precedents are organized systematically for the first time and can be expected to serve as a comprehensive reference work. Therefore, the key arrangement of this review is schemes accompanied by a concise explanatory text describing both advantages and limitations along with the mechanism. Different transformations are ordered in sections according to the chemical structure of the assisted groups. The overall objective of this review is to promote the application of carbonyl&#8208;assisted reactions beyond the methodologies dedicated to the regioselective synthesis of carbonyl derivatives and hence, serving it as a valuable reaction archetype in modern&#8208;day research for the synthesis of carbo&#8208; and heterocycles.

Abstract
Enantioenriched fluorinated &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;amino acids are often encountered in numerous pharmaceuticals and bioactive molecules, and also of great importance as probes in PET and NMR for studying the behavior of enzymes and for incorporation into peptides and drug candidates. Among various synthetic strategies developed, catalytic enantioselective synthesis proves to be one of the most facile and powerful protocols to construct such privileged structures. The past decade has witnessed considerable progress in the catalytic enantioselective construction of chiral fluorinated &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives with structural diversity. In this review, we summarize these impressive achievements according to the bond&#8208;forming way of fluorinated &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;amino acids, respectively, and underline the remaining challenges. This information would provide important guidance and some inspiration for the researchers engaged in organic fluorine and medicinal chemistry.

Abstract
In this review we present the transformations that have been developed with ynamides and free radicals. These reactions involve carbon&#8208;, heteroatom&#8208; or even metalloid&#8208;centered radicals and include inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;molecular reactions. The scope and mechanism of these transformations are discussed in details, including the most recent examples relying on photoredox catalysis.

Abstract
The trifluoromethyl (CF3) group is an advantageous structural motif in various biologically active molecules as well as materials, which is depicted by steadily increasing demand from the industries involved in drug discovery, agrochemicals and material development. &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethyl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds constitute a very efficient building blocks as starting material in the synthesis of fluorinated molecules. Their usage for the synthesis of various heterocycles and organic molecules bearing stereogenic carbon containing CF3 motif has received significant attention during the recent times. This review provides the existing methods for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;substituted trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones and the efforts made by researchers for the synthetic development through various reactions by employing them as synthetic building blocks for trifluoromethylated organic scaffolds.

Abstract
Nitrogen heterocycles are important structural subunits that occur widely in bioactive natural products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, dyes, cosmetics, and functional materials. Considering the importance of these useful compounds in modern science, the synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycles and their derivatives has always been a hot topic in organic synthesis. Recently, arenediazonium salts which can be easily prepared from inexpensive and abundantly available anilines, have been used as versatile nitrogen sources in the field of nitrogen heterocycle synthetic chemistry due to their ready availability, rich reactivity, and diverse transformations. The aim of the present review is to summarize the recent advances in the synthesis of nitrogen heterocycles using arenediazonium salts as nitrogen sources in the past ten years. Hopefully, it can provide practical guidance for the readers who are interested in utilizing arenediazonium salts as building blocks in organic synthesis. For simplicity and clarity, the organization of this review is based on the number of N atoms in the ring of nitrogen heterocycle.

Abstract
An approach for the preparation of boronated &#947;&#8208;lactams via palladium&#8208;catalyzed boryldifluoroalkylation of alkenes with &#945;&#8208;bromodifluoroacetamides was developed. This method exhibits good functional group tolerance. Various boronated products were obtained in moderate to good yields for 1&#8197;h. Mechanistic studies indicated that this reaction may involve an intramolecular radical cascade cyclization process.

Abstract
An unsymmetrical disulfides synthesis by Cs2CO3&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling reaction of thioacetate, sodium thiosulfate, and benzyl halide in water is described. The safe, stable, and non&#8208;toxic Na2S2O3 was invoked as the sulfur&#8208;source, successfully avoiding the odor generation in the process of S&#8722;S bond formation. A wide range of substrate suitability and appropriate functional group tolerance were observed for the transformation. Notably, the approach reported here was compatible with various biomolecules including glucose, coumarin, and quinolinone.

Abstract
The copper&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative [3+2] annulation of ethynyl benzoxazinanones with 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;arylpropanenitriles has been developed, producing tetrasubstituted furan derivatives in moderate to high yield. This reaction was generally compatible with a wide range of substrates. Notably, the intermediate copper&#8208;allenylidenes worked as a C2 synthon in the cycloaddition reaction.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed domino spiro&#8208;cyclization of carbamoyl chlorides with alkynes and benzynes, involving intramolecular C&#8722;H activation to afford valuable oxindole scaffolds bearing spiro quaternary stereocenters, has been developed. This one&#8208;step synthesis of spirooxindole is both step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economic, proceeding with high regioselectivity in moderate to excellent yields.

Abstract
This paper describes a method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyethyl dithiocarbamates via difunctionalization of alkenes involving C&#8722;S and C&#8722;O bonds formation with tetraalkylthiuram disulfides as the functional reagents. The reaction proceeded well under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions and afforded up to 88% yield of the desired products. Numerous useful functional groups were tolerated under the reaction conditions. This methodology provides a direct approach to &#946;&#8208;hydroxy dithiocarbamates, featuring readily available starting materials and broad substrate scope, which shows its practical synthetic value in organic synthesis.

Abstract
An efficient and convenient protocol for synthesis of dichlorocyanomethyl&#8208;functionalized oxindoles through the cascade reactions of dichlorocyanomethyl radical with N&#8208;arylacrylamides is reported. The electrophilic dichlorocyanomethyl radical, which is generated from readily available trichloroacetonitrile via a copper&#8208;catalyzed single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process, undergoes radical addition with the electron&#8208;deficient C=C bonds of N&#8208;arylacrylamides, followed by intramolecular cyclization, to provide dichlorocyanomethyl&#8208;functionalized oxindoles. No external oxidant is needed in this transformation.

         <title>Catalyst and Additive&#8208;Free Direct Amidation/Halogenation of Tertiary Arylamines with N&#8208;haloimide/amides</title>

Abstract
An approach has been developed for the amidation (halogenation) of tertiary arylamines by electrophilic activation using N&#8208;haloimide/amides. Several control experiments have been performed, and the coupling reaction outcomes indicated that the N&#8208;haloimide/amide brings three major functions, including electrophilic activation, aromatic halogenation and nucleophilic nitrogen sources. This cascade reaction features simple manipulation, requires no additional catalyst, oxidant or additives, and is performed under mild conditions.

Abstract
A deoxygenative 1,1&#8208;bis&#8208;trifluoromethylthiolation of readily available aromatic aldehydes with AgSCF3 in the presence of KI and (NH4)2SO4 was established. This reaction delivered a series of bis(trifluoromethylthio)methylarenes in moderate to high yields. The precise control of the generation and decomposition of SCF3 anion is the key to the successful transformation.

Abstract
The tandem cyclization of acrylamide with diselenides facilitated by electrochemical oxidation was successfully developed. This strategy provided an environmentally friendly method for the construction of C&#8722;Se bond. A series of seleno oxindoles with pharmacological activity were obtained by using this well&#8208;designed tandem cyclization strategy. The in&#8197;vitro antitumor activity of the compounds was also screened through MTT assay. Results showed that the seleno oxindoles exhibited better antitumor activity than other oxindole derivatives.

Abstract
The use of clean and renewable light sources is increasingly common in organic synthesis due to its safety, practicality and economy. Recently, photoredox catalysis has shown great application values in organic transformations because of its advantages of environmentally friendly and abundant resources. Indoles and their derivatives (indolines, oxindoles and isatins) are the core skeletons of some important organic compounds and widely&#8208;present in various natural products and pharmaceuticals with different biological activities. Therefore, the research on the synthesis and modification of indoles is particularly important for chemists and pharmacologists. This review summarizes the effects of photocatalysis on indole synthesis and modification in recent decades. These transformations are accomplished by using metal photocatalysts (i.&#8201;e., Ir, Ru, Ni, Cu, Fe, Au, Rh, TiO2, etc.) or non&#8208;metallic photocatalysts (i.&#8201;e., Rose Bengal, Eosin Y, quinones, naphthols, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, carbazoles, pyrylium salts, etc.), or without the need of photocatalysts. The detailed mechanisms of these photo&#8208;catalyzed/promoted organic reactions are also highlighted deeply. And we hope this review will be helpful to researchers interested in this promising field of photocatalyzed transformations.

Abstract
An iodine&#8208;promoted one&#8208;pot cascade oxidative annulation reaction has been developed for the synthesis of [1,2,3]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines from methyl azaarenes and N&#8208;tosylhydrazines. The reaction has a broad substrate scope and can be easily scaled up to gram&#8208;scale. 1,2,3&#8208;Triazoles are an important skeletal structure for the construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;P bonds, 2&#8208;cyclopropylquinolines and imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines, for which different synthetic applications were explored.

         <title>Regioselective and Chemodivergent Synthesis of Azulenolactones and Azulenolactams from Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions of Azulenecarboxamides with Sulfoxonium Ylides</title>

Abstract
A regioselective and chemodivergent synthetic approach for azulenolactones and azulenolactams as a new scaffold was demonstrated through Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed reaction of N&#8208;methoxyazulene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxamides with sulfoxonium ylides. Sulfoxonium ylides that act as a precursor of secondary carbene was described, leading to the selective formation of azulenolactones and azulenolactams bearing two substituents on a newly introduced double bond. This method demonstrated functionalization of less reactive 2&#8208;position of azulene to overcome the natural reactivity.

Abstract
A base&#8208;mediated, green, microwave&#8208;assisted efficient preparation of a diverse benzoxanthone library from variety of readily accessible &#947;&#8208;alkynyl 1,3&#8208;diketones is reported. The synthesis is based on tandem reactions involving intramolecular cyclization, propargyl&#8208;allenyl isomerization, and electrocyclization in one pot. Some of the benzoxanthones are also synthesized by the one&#8208;pot reaction of 1,3&#8208;diketone and alkynyl bromide under basic heating conditions. This transformation also results in the construction of one new C&#8722;C bond and one new C&#8722;O bond.

         <title>Stepwise Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling of Triborylalkenes Derived from Alkynyl&#8208;B(dan)s: Regioselective and Flexible Synthesis of Tetrasubstituted Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Alkenes with three boryl groups of differing reactivities were synthesized and subsequently cross&#8208;coupled regioselectively with aryl halides in a stepwise manner to afford tetrasubstituted alkenes. The key triborylalkene is derived from the platinum&#8208;catalyzed diboration of alkynyl&#8208;B(dan)s with B2(pin)2. Due to excellent regioselectivity and reaction efficiency of each step starting with alkynyl&#8208;B(dan)s, tetrasubstituted alkenes with desired carbon frameworks at desired positions can be prepared in high yields. For example, an alkene with four distinct aryl groups, p&#8208;MeOC6H4, p&#8208;CF3C6H4, p&#8208;MeC6H4, and p&#8208;NCC6H4, was obtained in 71% overall yield via six steps, starting with the dehydrogenative borylation of p&#8208;MeC6H4C&#8801;CH with HB(dan). Moreover, a variety of tetrasubstituted alkenes, including regio&#8208; and stereoisomers of the above tetraarylalkene, AIE&#8208;active TPTPE and derivatives thereof, and (Z)&#8208;tamoxifen, a well&#8208;known breast cancer drug, were accessed via the developed strategy.

         <title>Halogen Bond&#8208;Catalyzed Friedel&#8722;Crafts Reactions of Furans Using a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Bipyridine&#8208;Based Catalyst</title>

Abstract
A halogen bond donor based on a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine framework has been synthesized, and used to catalyze Friedel&#8722;Crafts reactions of furans. Electrophiles used successfully in these reactions included various enones, an aldehyde, and a carboxylic acid anhydride. The yields of the reactions were generally good using a moderate catalyst loading (0.025 or 0.1&#8197;equiv.) at a relatively low temperature (room temp. or 50&#8201;&#176;C) in acetonitrile. The catalyst used was designed with a biaryl scaffold so that if it indeed proved to be an efficient halogen bond donor organocatalyst, an enantioenriched version of it could potentially serve as a stereoselective catalyst.

         <title>Methyl Radical Initiated Kharasch and Related Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An improved procedure to run halogen atom and related chalcogen group transfer radical additions is reported. The procedure relies on the thermal decomposition of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylhyponitrite (DTBHN), a safer alternative to the explosive diacetyl peroxide, to produce highly reactive methyl radicals that can initiate the chain process. This mode of initiation generates byproducts that are either gaseous (N2) or volatile (acetone and methyl halide) thereby facilitating greatly product purification by either flash column chromatography or distillation. In addition, remarkably simple and mild reaction conditions (refluxing EtOAc during 30 minutes under normal atmosphere) and a low excess of the radical precursor reagent (2 equivalents) make this protocol particularly attractive for preparative synthetic applications. This initiation procedure has been demonstrated with a broad scope since it works efficiently to add a range of electrophilic radicals generated from iodides, bromides, selenides and xanthates over a range of unactivated terminal alkenes. A diverse set of radical trap substrates exemplifies a broad functional group tolerance. Finally, di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxyoxalate (DTBPO) is also demonstrated as alternative source of tert&#8208;butoxyl radicals to initiate these reactions under identical conditions which gives gaseous by&#8208;products (CO2).

         <title>Organic Azides: Versatile Synthons in Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;H Amination/Annulation for N&#8208;Heterocycle Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic azides are highly reactive, which have long established as versatile building blocks in the assembly of structurally diverse N&#8208;containing heterocycles. The conversion of organic azides into high&#8208;value compounds is of great importance and a subject of enormous current interest. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;H amination/annulation of organic azides provides a powerful tool for the transformation of organic azides into a wide range of biologically important heterocyclic frameworks. In this review, we aim to summarize the recent progress on organic azides&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8211;H amination/annulation for N&#8208;heterocycle synthesis enabled by transition metal catalysts. Representative strategies are discussed in detail, including catalytic systems, reaction scopes, limitations and mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereospecific Synthesis of Glycoside Mimics Through Migita&#8208;Kosugi&#8208;Stille Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of Chemically and Configurationally Stable 1&#8208;C&#8208;Tributylstannyl Iminosugars</title>

Abstract
A process for the de novo synthesis of imino&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides is described. The methodology is based on the reaction of 1&#8208;C&#8208;stannylated iminosugars with various electrophiles under the conditions of Migita&#8208;Kosugi&#8208;Stille cross&#8208;couplings, which gives 1&#8208;C&#8208;substituted iminosugar derivatives in a stereoretentive process. The required iminoglycosyl stannanes are obtained by way of the highly stereoselective addition of tributylstannyllithium to (SR)&#8208; or (SS)&#8208;N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl glycosylamines, followed by an activation cyclization sequence. Most interestingly, the methodology is tunable: the configuration of the tin adduct is controlled exclusively by the tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl auxiliary, thus giving access after ring formation to &#8216;&#945;&#8217;&#8208;configured or &#8216;&#946;&#8217;&#8208;configured iminoglycosyl stannanes. With the subsequent stereoretentive C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming process, the methodology allows the synthesis of pseudo anomers of imino&#8208;C&#8208;glycosyl compounds in a controlled fashion.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction of 2&#8208;(3&#8208;arylpropioloyl)benzaldehydes was developed, leading to benzylated 1,4&#8208;naphthoquinones via radical&#8208;triggered cascade cyclization. This example of an acylbenzylation involving internal alkynes could be carried out with a broad substrate scope and wide functional group tolerance.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
In recent years, the transition&#8208;metal catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of an aldehyde, an alkyne and an amine, commonly called A3 coupling has become a powerful tool in organic synthesis. The aim of this review is to give a general overview of A3 coupling utility in the synthesis of heterocycles, highlighting the variety of compounds that can be directly accessed from single reactions. The diverse A3 coupling based methodologies that have been developed for the synthesis of N,O,S&#8208;heterocycles are presented, emphasizing the influence of the reaction conditions and the use of additional reagents in the outcome of the transformations.

         <title>Cyclization of Polarized Divinyl Ketones under Aqueous and Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An &#8216;on&#8208;water&#8217; protocol has been developed for the synthesis of combretastatin A&#8208;4 (CA&#8208;4) analogues by cyclization of polarized triaryldivinyl ketones using hydrochloric acid as a promoter in 45&#8211;95% yields. The reaction time was reduced by about 30 times due to ultrasonic irradiation at ambient temperature. The other advantages of this new method are operational simplicity, easy workup, no column purification, and applicability on a gram&#8208;scale. It was shown that the amphiphilicity of the substrate and a low energy barrier of the reaction are a prerequisite for electrophilic and concerted reactions under aqueous and ambient conditions.

         <title>Gold&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H Functionalization of Phenothiazines with Aryldiazoacetates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Phenothiazine is an important structural motif in pharmaceuticals and advanced functional organic materials. However, the C&#8722;H functionalization reaction of N&#8208;protected phenothiazine is rather unexplored and often shadowed by its chemical reactivity on the heteroatomic centers, which limits the diversity of its potential applications. This report demonstrates a straightforward approach towards the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H functionalization of phenothiazine at the para&#8208;position of N atom via gold&#8208;catalyzed carbene transfer reactions (37&#8197;examples, up to 83% yield). The mechanism behind the regionselectivity of the C&#8722;H functionalization reaction was also elucidated by a combination of computational and experimental studies.

Abstract
Rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative annulation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines with maleimides is described. The reaction afforded 1H&#8208;benzo[e]pyrido[1&#8242;,2&#8242;:1,2]imidazo[4,5&#8208;g]isoindole&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;diones in high yields with wide range of functional group tolerance. The reaction proceeds through Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation, followed by maleimide insertion and intramolecular cyclization. Photophysical properties of 1H&#8208;benzo[e]pyrido[1&#8242;,2&#8242;:1,2]imidazo[4,5&#8208;g]isoindole&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;diones were studied with UV&#8208;visible and fluorescence spectroscopy and validated by quantum chemical calculations. All the annulated products showed large Stokes shift values with emission in the range of 530&#8211;618&#8201;nm, and moderate to high quantum yields.

         <title>Copper(II)&#8208;Catalysed Aerobic Oxidative Coupling of Arylamines with Hexafluoroisopropanol: An Alternative Methodology for Constructing Fluorinated Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The selective functionalisation of arylamine derivatives with hexafluoroisopropanol through copper(II)&#8208;catalysed aerobic oxidative coupling was developed to generate various fluoroalkylated arylamines under mild conditions. This method has a wide substrate scope with excellent functional group tolerance and provides the fluorinated products in good to excellent yields. Furthermore, preliminary studies indicate that this reaction occur via a radical mechanism. This protocol, which uses atmospheric O2 as an oxidant, provides an alternative green route for constructing fluorinated compounds.

         <title>Enantioselective Michael Addition Reactions to Construct SCF3&#8208;containing Stereocenter Catalyzed by Chiral Quaternary Phosphonium Salts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The trifluoromethylthio group is significant in drug design for its high stability, electronegativity, and lipophilicity. Herein, a series of indenone structures containing the SCF3 group and an adjacent chiral quaternary stereocenter were synthesized by an asymmetric Michael addition reaction using an ion pair catalyst derived from amino acids. The desired products were obtained in excellent yields (up to 98%) and good to high stereoselectivities (up to 97%&#8197;ee and &gt;20:1&#8197;dr).

         <title>Asymmetric Fluorination Reactions promoted by Chiral Hydrogen Bonding&#8208;based Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Fluorinated compounds can exhibit interesting biological properties. The importance of these species has made that the chemistry of fluorine has experienced a great development. On this review, the recent advances on asymmetric fluorination reactions promoted by chiral hydrogen bonding&#8208;based organocatalysts are discussed. Hence, examples using phosphoric acid, carboxylic acid, (thio)urea and squaramide derivatives are illustrated. The growth of this field is amazing. We have only considered pivotal works in which direct fluorination takes place using a fluorinating agent, leaving aside the reactions where a fluorine atom is incorporated from the beginning as part of other reactants. Herein, the scarce existing examples on this field of research have been compiled.

The inside cover picture shows the palladium&#8208;catalyzed selective carbofunctionalization of inert &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;O bonds of aliphatic amides by using the strategy of sp3 C&#8208;H activation/&#946;&#8208;O elimination/hydrocarbofunctionalization with the assistance of 8&#8208;aminoquinolyl directing group. Notable features of the strategy include (i) the use of hydroxypyridones and analogous hydroxypyrones as nucleophilic reagents for the first time to achieve carbofunctionalization of C(sp3)&#8208;O bonds, (ii) the realization of inert &#947;&#8208;methyl and methylene C(sp3)&#8208;O bonds cleavage, and (iii) high functional group tolerance.

Abstract
PdCl2/CuCl2/Bi(OTf)3&#8208;promoted intramolecular domino annulation of sulfonyl o&#8208;allylarylchromanones provides tetracyclic sulfonyl dibenzooxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes and bicyclic arylnaphthalenes with good to excellent yields in MeOH at room (25&#8201;&#176;C) and refluxing (65&#8201;&#176;C) temperature, respectively. The starting sulfonyl o&#8208;allylarylchromanones can be easily obtained from the intermolecular cyclocondensation of &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl o&#8208;hydroxyacetophenones and o&#8208;allylbenzaldehydes. The uses of various catalysts and solvent systems are investigated herein for convenient transformation. A plausible mechanism is proposed and discussed. This protocol provides one&#8208;pot ring closure via carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) bond formation.

Abstract
A silver&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling reaction of amines, 2&#8208;isocyanobenzaldehydes, and 2,2,2&#8208;trifluorodiazoethane has been developed. This reaction provides an efficient method for the construction of CF3&#8208;containing dihydroquinazolines. On the basis of this reaction, using trifluorodiazoethyl&#8208;substituted dihydroquinazolines as synthons, trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted indolo[1,2&#8208;c]quinazolines were prepared in high yields via a TBHP/KI&#8208;mediated sequential intramolecular cyclization and aromatization process.

Abstract
A remote cascade asymmetric inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand oxa&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of allyl ketones with isatin&#8208;derived &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;keto esters has been developed in the presence of a chiral bifunctional squaramide catalyst. Taking advantage of the secondary amide activating group, a series of enantioenriched 3,4&#8217;&#8208;pyranyl spirooxindole derivatives bearing three contiguous chiral centers were attained in high yields (84 to &gt;99%) with excellent enantioselectivities (96&#8211;99%&#8197;ee). Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and the construction of 1&#8208;benzazepine scaffold by the product were also demonstrated.

Abstract
A regio&#8208; and stereoselective [3+2] cycloaddition of phthalazinium dicyanomethanides with 2,4&#8208;dienals was achieved with the use of a commercially available MacMillan's calalyst via LUMO&#8208;lowering activation. The reaction proceeds through 1,6&#8208;additon to linear 2,4&#8208;dienals with remote control over stereochemistry, affording the cycloadducts having three stereogenic centers.

         <title>Benzyl Palladium Intermediates: Unique and Versatile Reactive Intermediates for Aromatic Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Aromatic functionalizations are of current interest and importance in organic chemistry, recent transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reactions can transform inert C&#8722;H bond into C&#8722;X (X=C, O, N, etc.) bonds, greatly enriching aromatic chemistry and related fields. Some well&#8208;known palladium&#8208;containing intermediates such as palladacycles and allylpalladium intermediates play an important role in organic conversions. Similar with allyl group, benzyl group also possesses the capability of stabilizing palladium through &#951;3&#8208;binding. In the process of the formation of benzyl palladium intermediate, there is a transition state of dearomatization. Therefore, it is a challenging and meaningful research topic to seize these aromatic destruction intermediates, realize selective functionalization reaction on aromatic ring via them, and inhibit the formation of traditional benzylated products. Herein, we summarized the recent efforts on expanding the synthetic utility, as well as exploring the mechanism in aromatic functionalization via reactive benzyl palladium intermediates. We envision that the transformation via benzyl palladium intermediates will help promote the development in the field of palladium&#8211;catalyzed aromatic regioselective functionalization.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Distal C&#8722;H Selenylation of 2&#8208;Aryl Acetamides with Diselenides and Selenyl Chlorides</title>

Abstract
A convenient and effective method of palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H selenylation of the 2&#8208;aryl acetamides assisted with removable 8&#8208;aminoquinoline with readily available diselenides and selenyl chlorides has been developed. This selenylation reaction is scalable and tolerates a wide range of functional groups, providing a straightforward way of the preparing unsymmetrical diaryl selenides and dibenzoselene&#8208;pinone. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that a single&#8208;electron transfer type mechanism and facile C&#8722;H metalation are operative.

Abstract
An efficient rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective functionalization of 4&#8208;anilinoquinazolines offers exciting possibilities for fused polycyclic 4&#8208;anilinoquinazoline derivatives and N&#8208;quinazoline&#8208;indoles by using diazo compounds as the elegant coupling partners. This one&#8208;pot cascade approach to establish various complex 4&#8208;anilinoquinazoline units with potential biological activities only depends on substrates and additives.

Abstract
Herein, metal&#8208;free oxidative tandem cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds with N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines is developed. The reaction affords two new C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds in one pot. A broad range of &#223;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds and N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines were compatible, and the desired products were synthesized in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields.

         <title>Asymmetric Oxidative Mannich Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The asymmetric Mannich reaction is one of the most straightforward methodologies for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral amines. In general, asymmetric Mannich reactions involve the use of imines as electrophiles. However, in recent years, several asymmetric oxidative Mannich reactions have been reported using amines as electrophiles. This review provides an overview of these recent publications, including the different oxidants used and the scope and limitations of the different catalytic systems.

Abstract
A simple and efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;initiated cascade reaction of 2&#8208;isothiocyanatonaphthalenes and amines with ambient dioxygen as the sole oxidant under additive&#8208;, external photocatalyst&#8208;free and ambient conditions was developed. 38 Examples of N&#8208;substituted naphtho[2,1&#8208;d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines were regioselectively constructed in good to excellent yields.

         <title>Ag&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of Arylboronic Acids with Elemental Selenium for the Synthesis of Selenaheterocycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A general method for the synthesis of five&#8208;membered and six&#8208;membered selenaheterocycles through Ag&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;Se bond&#8208;forming reaction is reported. This reaction proceeds via intramolecular cyclization of arylboronic acids with selenium powder. Preliminary mechanism studies demonstrate that this transformation involves a selenium&#8208;centred radical intermediate.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general method for the synthesis of five&#8208;membered and six&#8208;membered selenaheterocycles through Ag&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;Se bond&#8208;forming reaction is reported. This reaction proceeds via intramolecular cyclization of arylboronic acids with selenium powder. Preliminary mechanism studies demonstrate that this transformation involves a selenium&#8208;centred radical intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of &#945;&#8208;Silyl&#8208;Substituted Allylboronate Esters via Chemo&#8208; and Stereoselective Allylboration of Aldehydes</title>

Abstract
We describe the kinetic resolution of &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allylboronate esters via chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective allylboration of aldehydes. This process provides two synthetically versatile enantioenriched compounds, (Z)&#8208;&#948;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted anti&#8208;homoallylic alcohols and &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allylboronate esters, with a selectivity factor up to 328. We propose that the reaction proceeds through a closed chair&#8208;like transition state with the silane moiety occupying a pseudo&#8208;axial position, thus readily resolving &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allylboronate esters. The synthetic utility of the obtained enantioenriched compounds is highlighted by their further transformations to give a diverse set of enantioenriched molecules.

         <title>Application of Conjugated Carbonyls in the Synthesis of Heterocycles via Oxidative Cycloaddition and Cyclization Reactions</title>

Abstract
Synthesis of pharmaceutically active heterocycles is always appealing as the majority of the widely used drugs contain heterocyclic moieties as their core structure. So, the straightforward construction of heterocycles from readily available/accessible reagents is one of the prime targets of the synthetic chemists. In this context, C&#8722;H functionalization has emerged as an effective tool for the designing and synthesis of various heterocyclic moieties as it offers a straight&#8208;forward and step&#8208;economic pathway. On the other hand, the readily available/accessible conjugated carbonyls are well&#8208;known reagents for the construction of carbocycles and heterocycles over the years. However, the employment of C&#8722;H functionalization of the two C&#8722;H bonds of the conjugated alkene in carbocycle/heterocycle synthesis was not so explored. In the last decade, much focus has been paid on the synthesis of various pharmaceutically active heterocycles through C&#8722;H bond functionalization of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes/ketones. These protocols have been developed through either oxidative coupling of conjugated carbonyls with suitable coupling partners or intramolecular C&#8722;H bond functionalization of conjugated carbonyls. In this review, we will discuss all the methodologies developed for the synthesis of heterocycles employing intermolecular C&#8722;H bond functionalization of conjugated carbonyls. The mechanistic pathways and usefulness of the methodologies will be also highlighted.
