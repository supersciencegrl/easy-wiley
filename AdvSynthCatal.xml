      <title>Recent Trends and Prospects in Homogeneous Manganese&#8208;Catalysed Epoxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Epoxidation of alkenes is a significant reaction in organic chemistry due to its opportunities in producing compounds of biochemical interest. Catalytic epoxidation with first&#8208;row transition elements has gained attention in the latest years wherein manganese based catalysts stand superior by satisfying numerous principles of Green chemistry. In this review, we have summarized the recent developments in olefin epoxidation using homogenous manganese catalysts. Manganese complexes with porphyrin, schiff base, salen, and other non&#8208;heme ligands made efficient catalytic systems during the last five years. Notably, we witnessed greener approaches in recent reports wherein photo&#8208;catalysis is a promising strategy. We anticipate that the review will benefit the researchers to get a better understanding of the reaction and to choose the best catalysts for their reactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Developments in Z&#8208;Selective Olefin Metathesis Reactions by Molybdenum, Tungsten, Ruthenium, and Vanadium Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
This review article summarizes reports for Z&#8208;selective olefin metathesis reactions by molybdenum, tungsten, ruthenium, and vanadium catalysts. It is clearly demonstrated that the ligand modifications play essential roles in achieving the stereospecific olefin metathesis reactions. In particular, Mo&#8208; and W&#8208;alkylidene based complex catalysts having pyrrolide&#8208;aryloxide [or bis(aryloxide)] were highly effective in the efficient enantioselective ring opening/cross&#8208;metathesis (EROCM), cross metathesis (CM), homodimerization, ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), and in ring closing metathesis (RCM) with high Z&#8208; selectivities (&#8764;&gt;98%). Ruthenium&#8208;carbene catalysts having cycloadamantyl, catechothiolate, phenolate and thiophenolate ligands display pronounced Z&#8208;selectivity (&gt;98%) in efficient CM, ROCM, AROCM, RCM, ROMP reactions. Halogenated (arylimido)&#8208;alkoxo vanadium&#8208;alkylidenes were thermally robust and effective for efficient highly cis&#8208;specific ROMP of cyclic olefins to afford end&#8208;functionalized ring&#8208;opened polymers.

      <title>Zinc&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrosilylation of Cyclic Imines</title>
      <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates the application of Zn&#8208;complex as a key catalyst for enantioselective hydrosilylation of cyclic imines. As the replacement of platinum&#8208;group metals is currently an interesting challenge in catalysis, a promising alternative in asymmetric hydrosilylation, is to use environmentally benign and easily accessible chiral Zn&#8208;based catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;front cover picture&lt;/b&gt; illustrates the application of Zn&#8208;complex as a &lt;b&gt;key&lt;/b&gt; catalyst for enantioselective hydrosilylation of cyclic imines. As the replacement of platinum&#8208;group metals is currently an interesting challenge in catalysis, a promising alternative in asymmetric hydrosilylation, is to use environmentally benign and easily accessible chiral Zn&#8208;based catalysts. I. W&#281;glarz, K. Michalak and J. Mlynarski show that &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; generated zinc&#8208;ProPhenol complex with silane affords pharmaceutically relevant enantioenriched 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted pyrrolidines in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;).

      <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates the cascade cyclization of propargylic alcohols with diverse nucleophiles for the construction of heterocyclic compounds via the allenyl carbocation intermediate. In this review, these reactions can be divided into four categories based on the types of nucleophiles, such as C&#8208;nucleophiles, O,S&#8208;nucleophiles, N,P&#8208;nucleophiles, and halo&#8208;nucleophiles. A series of functionalized heterocyclic compounds were constructed under mild reaction conditions. Details can be found in the review by Qiang Xiao and co&#8208;workers (X.&#8208;R. Song, R. Yang, Q.

      <dc:description>Chiral 2&#8208;alkylquinazolinones are key synthetic intermediates, but their preparation in high optical purity is challenging.

Copper(II) chloride was essential to retaining enantiopurity, and reaction component structural changes were well tolerated, resulting in an efficient, all&#8208;in&#8208;one procedure that promotes sequential coupling, lactonization, aminolysis, and cyclization in good yields. The method was applied to the rapid assembly of four key intermediates used in the synthesis of high profile quinazolinones, including several PI3K inhibitor drugs.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Phenanthridine derivatives are one of the most intensively studied families of biologically active compounds.

      <title>Recent Advances in Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Couplings (CDC) of C&#8208;H Bond in Aqueous Media</title>
      <dc:description>To develop highly efficient synthetic reactions is quite important in organic chemistry. Cross dehydrogenative couplings (CDC) utilize C&#8208;H bonds of substrates to construct new C&#8208;X (X=C, S, O, N, P) bonds. For CDC, the pre&#8208;functionalization of reaction substrates can be avoided and the C&#8208;X (X=C, S, O, N, P) bonds can be newly formed by simple and efficient synthesis routes. Meanwhile, water is increasingly used as a substitute for organic solvents in cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling because of its rich content, non&#8208;toxicity, and non&#8208; flammability. In recent years, organic chemists are devoted their efforts to explore the cross dehydrogenative couplings (CDC) in aqueous phase which feature high atom utilization rate and environmental friendliness. Herein, we summarized the recent advances in the construction of C&#8208;C, C&#8208;S, C&#8208;O, C&#8208;N, and C&#8208;P bonds through CDC reactions of C&#8212;H bonds in water.</dc:description>

      <title>Dearomatization and Functionalization of Aromatic Rings via &#951;3&#8208;Benzyl Palladium Intermediates</title>
      <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates recent advances on selective dearomatization and functionalization of aromatic rings via &#951;3&#8208;benzyl palladium intermediates. The importance of this topic relies on providing efficient strategy for dearomatization and functionalization of arenes and heteroarenes in mild conditions. A series of C&#8722;C or C&#8208;heteroatom bond formation reactions is summarized. Theoretical calculations are also introduced in details, accounting for the reactions occurring regioselectively in the benzene ring, rather than benzylic position. Details can be found in the review by Ming Bao and co&#8208;workers (S. Zhang, Y. Yamamoto, M. Bao, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2021, 363, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202000838).

By selective bromination with NBS the heterocyclic ring can further be functionalized.

The atmosphere&#8208;controlled method (Ar/air) enabled the selective synthesis of hydroxyl&#8208; and acyl&#8208;containing quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones under mild reaction conditions without the use of any metal catalysts or toxic reagents. A fluorescent labelling experiment showed that hydroxyl&#8208;containing quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones may have utility in various biological applications as potent fluorophores.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Abstract. An asymmetric (4 + 1) annulation of 3&#8208;diazooxindoles/4&#8208;diazooxisoquinolines with para&#8208;quinone methides, catalyzed by a chiral phosphoric acid, has been described.

In this study, the possible reaction pathway was proposed and the synthetic applications were shown by a tenfold scale&#8208;up conversion as well as the further transformations into other structurally more complex spirocyclic compounds. The signi&#64257;cance of this protocol is highlighted by its metal&#8208;free participation with heterocyclic diazo compounds as the direct nucleophile and extremely high e&#64259;ciency in a straightforward and mild reaction process to access the structurally&#8208;diverse spiro&#8208;heterocyclic 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran derivatives with good to excellent stereocontrol.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Chemical and Enzymatic Carbene&#8208;Transfer Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>The use of diazo compounds in the transition metal catalyzed coupling reaction to form C&#8208;C and C&#8208;X (X=O, S, N, Si, P etc.) bonds have been a well&#8208;established approach in organic synthesis. In this context, various transition metals such as Pd, Cu, Rh, Ni, Co, Fe, Ir etc. have been proved useful to generate metal&#8208;carbene intermediate which subsequently undergoes carbene transfer or insertion to form C&#8208;C, C&#8208;Si or C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. However, the use of most abundant, cheaper and environmentally benign metal such as iron to catalyze carbene transfer reaction have attracted a great attention in the last few years. Iron is the second most abundant transition&#8208;metal in nature and also an integral part of various biological systems which made it highly valuable to use as a catalyst in organic chemistry. This review is summarizing the efforts made after 2013 in the area of iron&#8208;catalyzed chemical and enzymatic carbene transfer reactions using diazo compounds as carbene precursor.</dc:description>

      <title>Engineering an Alcohol Dehydrogenase from Kluyveromyces polyspora for Efficient Synthesis of Ibrutinib Intermediate</title>
      <dc:description>(S)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypiperidine [(S)&#8208;NBHP] is a key intermediate for the synthesis of mantle cell lymphoma drug, ibrutinib. Here, KpADH, an alcohol dehydrogenase from Kluyveromyces polyspora, exhibits evolutionary potential in the asymmetric reduction of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;3&#8208;piperidone (NBPO) to (S)&#8208;NBHP. By screening key resi&#8208;dues in substrate binding pocket of KpADH, an excellent variant Y127W was obtained with 6&#8208;fold improved activity of 119.3 U&#183;mg&#8208;1, 1.8&#8208;fold enhanced half&#8208;life of 147 h and strict S&#8208;stereoselectivity (&gt;99% ee). When catalyzed by Y127W, a complete conversion of 600 g&#183;L&#8208;1 NBPO was achieved at a substrate to catalyst ratio (S/C) of 30 in 10 h. Based on crystal&#8208;structure of Y127W, molecular docking and dynamic simulations reveal hydrogen bonds formed between W127 and Boc group of NBPO, as well as improved structural stability mainly contribute to the increased catalytic activity and stereoselectivity of Y127W. This study offers guidance for engineering ADHs for biosynthesis of chiral hetero&#8208;cyclic alcohols, and provides insights into mechanisms in catalytic activity and stereoselectivity toward car&#8208;bonyl&#8208;containing heterocyclic substrates.</dc:description>
