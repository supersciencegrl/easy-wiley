Abstract
The synthesis of trans&#8208;4a,12b&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[f,h]quinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones (2), dibenzo[f,h]quinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones (3) and 3,4&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[f,h]quinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones (4) via photo&#8208;induced annulation of 6&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones (1) under irradiation of a 313&#8197;nm UV light was described. Compounds 2 were obtained in 82&#8211;95% yields when the irradiation time was 3&#8197;h. Products 3 were obtained by irradiating 1 for 12&#8197;h in the presence of iodine. Heating the solutions of 2 in DMF at 130&#8201;&#176;C for 24&#8197;h gave compounds 4 via a double 1,3&#8208;H shift. The demonstrated protocols showed the diversity of photo&#8208;induced cyclization of compounds 1.

         <title>Oxidative Cleavage of Indoles Mediated by Urea Hydrogen Peroxide or H2O2 in Polar Solvents</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The oxidative cleavage of indoles (Witkop oxidation) involving the use of H2O2 or urea hydrogen peroxide in combination with a polar solvent has been described. Among these solvents, 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) stands out as the one affording the corresponding 2&#8208;ketoacetanilides generally in higher yields The protocol described has also enabled the oxidation of different pyrroles and furans derivatives. Furthermore, the procedure was implemented in a larger&#8208;scale and HFIP was distilled from the reaction mixture and reused (up to 4 cycles) without a significant detriment in the reaction outcome, which remarks its sustainability and applicability.

         <title>Dual Cobalt and Photoredox Catalysis Enabled Redox&#8208;Neutral Annulation of 2&#8208;Propynolphenols</title>

Abstract
A hydroxyl&#8208;assisted, organophotoredox/cobalt dual catalyzed annulation of 2&#8208;propynolphenols to form 2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;benzo[b]furans was developed by employing 1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) as photosensitizer and CoCl2(PPh3)2/5,5&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine as cobalt catalytic precursor. Various substrates and functional groups were tolerated. The practical applications of this reaction were further demonstrated by enlarged gram&#8208;scale and various derivations for complex heterocycles. Primary mechanistic studies suggested the involvement of cobalt&#8208;hydride mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process.

         <title>Synthesis of Enantioenriched Amines by Iron&#8208;Catalysed Amination of Alcohols Employing  at Least One Achiral Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of a broad range of enantioenriched amines by the direct Fe&#8208;catalysed coupling of amines with alcohols through the borrowing hydrogen strategy, while at least one of these substrates is achiral is reported. When starting from &#945;&#8208;chiral amines and achiral alcohols, a wide range of enantioenriched amine products, including N&#8208;heterocyclic moieties can be obtained with complete retention of stereochemistry and the power of this method is demonstrated in the one&#8208;step synthesis of known pharmaceuticals from commercially available, simple enantiopure primary amines and achiral alcohols. It was also found that the use of &#946;&#8208;branched enantioenriched primary alcohols and achiral amines as reaction partners leads to a partial loss of stereochemical integrity in the final product, however, a systematic optimization enabled partial retention of enantiopurity and possible parameters effecting for racemization were identified.</dc:description>

         <title>Potassium Base&#8208;Catalyzed Michael Additions of Allylic Alcohols to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Amides: Scope and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the first KHMDS&#8208;catalyzed Michael additions of allylic alcohols to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides through allylic isomerization. The reaction proceeds smoothly in the presence of only 5 mol% of KHMDS to afford a variety of 1,5&#8208;ketoamides in high yields. Mechanistic investigations, including experimental and computational studies, reveal that the KHMDS&#8208;catalyzed in&#8208;situ generation of the enolate from the allylic alcohol through a tunneling&#8208;assisted 1,2&#8208;hydride shift is the key to the success of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Sequential One&#8208;Pot Double Annulation of N&#8208;Methoxybenzamides with Symmetrical/Unsymmetrical Alkynes and Alkenes: Regioselective Construction of Isoindolo[2,1&#8208;b]isoquinolin&#8208;5(7H)&#8208;one Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient, practical and sequential one&#8208;pot strategy to produce isoindolo[2,1&#8208;b]isoquinolin&#8208;5(7H)&#8208;ones via the reaction of N&#8208;methoxybenzamides with symmetrical/unsymmetrical alkynes and alkenes has been developed, which proceeds through Ru&#8208;catalysed unsymmetrical double annulations using a single DG under single catalytic conditions.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An efficient, practical and sequential one-pot strategy to produce isoindolo[2,1-b]isoquinolin-5(7H)-ones via the reaction of N-methoxybenzamides with symmetrical/unsymmetrical alkynes and alkenes has been developed, which proceeds through Ru-catalysed unsymmetrical double annulations using a single DG under single catalytic conditions. Furthermore, we have developed amide-alkyne regioselective annulations using unsymmetrical internal alkynes having oxygen/nitrogen substituents leading to a single isomer. The developed procedure offers excellent substrate scope, tolerates a wide range of functional groups and affords high product yields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A series of strong &#960;&#8208;acceptor polyfluorinated and dicationic chelating phosphines have been synthesized and evaluated in the Rh&#8208;catalysed dimerization of norbornadiene (NBD) into its thermodynamically more stable dimer, heptacyclo[6.6.0.02,6.03,13.04,11.05,9.010,14] tetradecane (HCTD). While dicationic ligands direct the dimerization towards HCTD, by the use of neutral polyfluorinated ancillary ligands endo&#8208;endo&#8208;heptacyclo [8.4.0.02,12.03,8.04,6.05,9.011,13]tetradecane (BINOR&#8722;S) is selectively obtained. In addition, a selective Pd&#8208;catalysed arylation at position C8 of the HCTD framework is achieved by the use of a picolylamide directing group previously attached at C1. Theoretical calculations have been performed to understand the origin of that regioselectivity.

Abstract
The synthesis and photophysical properties of fluorescent pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines (PPs) are explored. An array of 5,7&#8208;disubstituted fluorescent PPs are prepared selectively by using &#946;,&#946;&#8208;difluoro peroxides as the 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;electrophiles. The synthesized PPs display a fairly significant stokes shift (up to 211&#8197;nm) and a large window of tunable emission wavelength that covers most of the visible spectrum (400&#8197;nm to 800&#8197;nm). Theoretical calculation indicates that the distinguished variation of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) ability upon the varied substituents is responsible for the color&#8208;tunable fluorescence emission.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Decarbonylative Trifluoromethylthiolation Enabled by Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex Photoactivation</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
A catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free decarbonylative trifluoromethylthiolation of aldehyde feedstocks has been developed. This operationally simple, scalable, and open&#8208;to&#8208;air transformation is driven by the selective photoexcitation of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes, stemming from the association of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (donor) with N&#8208;(trifluoromethylthio)phthalimide (acceptor), to trigger intermolecular single&#8208;electron transfer events under ambient&#8208; and visible light&#8208;promoted conditions. Extension to other electron acceptors enables the synthesis of thiocyanates and thioesters, as well as the difunctionalization of [1.1.1]propellane. The mechanistic intricacies of this photochemical paradigm are elucidated through a combination of experimental efforts and high&#8208;level quantum mechanical calculations [dispersion&#8208;corrected (U)DFT, DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T), and TD&#8208;DFT]. This comprehensive study highlights the necessity for EDA complexation for efficient alkyl radical generation. Computation of subsequent ground state pathways reveals that SH2 addition of the alkyl radical to the intermediate radical EDA complex is extremely exergonic and results in a charge transfer event from the dihydropyridine donor to the N&#8208;(trifluoromethylthio)phthalimide acceptor of the EDA complex. Experimental and computational results further suggest that product formation also occurs via SH2 reaction of alkyl radicals with 1,2&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)disulfane, generated in&#8208;situ through combination of thiyl radicals.

         <title>Pyrazoleamides in Catalytic Asymmetric Reactions: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture, designed by Sara and Luca Meninno, illustrates poorly reactive carboxylic acids and their ester and amide derivatives transformed into pyrazoleamides super&#8208;molecules with superpowers. Where carboxylic acids, esters and amides fail pyrazoleamides succeed, allowing the transition from a world with limited possibilities to a rich and futuristic world, meeting the increasing needs of the society. The super&#8208;powers consist in: i) easy one&#8208;step synthesis from readily available carboxylic acids; ii) easy metal and H&#8208;bonding coordination with catalysts, unlocking otherwise inaccessible reactions on carboxylic acid derivatives; iii) exceptional leaving group ability which enables several post&#8208;functionalizations with different nucleophiles. Pyrazoleamides, unlike carboxylic acid derivatives have proven increasingly useful starting materials in a variety of diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective metal&#8208;, organocatalytic and photoinduced transformations, giving access to valuable intermediates, heterocycles and pharmaceuticals. Details can be found in the Review by Meninno, Franco, Benaglia, and Lattanzi. (S. Meninno, F. Franco, M. Benaglia, A. Lattanzi, Adv. Synth.

Abstract
We report the development of a rapid approach for directly converting indoles into 2&#8208;oxindoles promoted by HOCl formed in&#8197;situ from the combination of (bis(trifluoroacetoxy) iodo)benzene (PIFA) and n&#8208;Bu4NCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O. The procedure is widely functional group tolerant and provides 2&#8208;oxindoles in up to 95% yield within 5&#8197;min. The potential applications of the developed methodology are demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale preparation of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole (11&#8201;a), the one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step syntheses of spiro&#8208;oxindoles 26&#8201;a and 26&#8201;b, and the formal synthesis of (&#8208;)&#8208;folicanthine (2).

         <title>Blue LED Induced Manganese (I) Catalysed Direct C2&#8722;H Activation of Pyrroles with Aryl Diazoesters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we have reported a blue LED mediated manganese pentacarbonyl bromide catalysed incorporation of carbene moieties from aryl diazoesters onto 1H&#8208;pyrroles via their selective C2&#8722;H activation. A manganese metal&#8208;carbene has been identified as the active catalyst to facilitate the reaction. Eighteen mono substituted pyrrole derivatives were isolated in good to excellent yields (67&#8594;82%) and the disubstituted products were also formed in minor quantities (5 to 8%). HPLC based kinetics study enabled optimization of the reaction. Control experiments, FT&#8208;IR, NMR and GC&#8208;MS based characterization elucidated the putative reaction mechanism.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthetic Use of Migration Reactions of Allyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allyl alcohol compounds are widely used structural units. In recent years, considerable attention has been devoted to exploring the migration reactions of allyl alcohols via semipinacol or neophyl rearrangements, and so on, providing an attractive and powerful strategy for obtaining various important carbonyl compounds. 
However, to date, no review has been published that summarizes the significant advances in the preparation of functionalized carbonyl compounds using these migration rearrangement reactions. In this paper, the latest progress in the use of allyl alcohols as flexile synthons involving group migration is introduced, and the reaction scopes, limitations, and some of the mechanisms are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Additional Capability from in Water Reaction Conditions: Aldol versus Knoevenagel Chemoselectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Aldol reaction chemoselectivity, racemic or enantioselective, has not been previously demonstrated in the presence of Knoevenagel active functional groups. Here, we show that unhindered &#946;&#8208;diketones remain unreacted while a ketone moiety undergoes a highly enantioselective aldol desymmetrization resulting in three new stereogenic centers using in water reaction conditions. A mechanistic hypothesis for the chemoselective formation of either aldol or Knoevenagel products is presented. It elucidates how these amino acid catalyzed reactions completely suppress formation of the expected Knoevenagel product under in water (heterogeneous) reaction conditions, but not when water is present as a dissolved cosolvent (homogeneous). Finally, the developed hypothesis reinforces and expands the role of water at an organic&#8208;water interface.

Abstract
The reactions of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) and isomeric &#946;&#8208;styrylmalonates with conformationally non&#8208;rigid &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines in the presence of Lewis acids were studied. The effect of the structural features of starting compounds on the process course was determined. The main attention was focused to discover the reaction conditions for the formal (4+2)&#8208;cycloaddition pathway with the possibility of variation of the &#945;&#8208;substituent in azadiene instead of known (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition synthetic methodology. Based on the results obtained, a method for the diastereoselective synthesis of substituted trans,trans&#8208;tetrahydropyridines was developed. Three substrate&#8208;sensitive diverse Lewis acid catalytic systems have been employed based on Sc(OTf)3, Sn(OTf)2, and GaCl3. The use of GaCl3 as a Lewis acid allows to obtain a minor product of the formal (2+2+2)&#8208;cycloaddition, which represents a fully 1,2,3,4,5,6&#8208;hexasubstituted cyclohexane derivative produced with diastereoselectivity &gt;30:1. Appropriate mechanistic and stereochemical models have been suggested.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereoselective Synthesis of (Z)&#8208;Conjugated Enynyl Homoallylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diastereoselective synthesis of anti&#8208;homoallylic alcohols bearing conjugated (Z)&#8208;enynes through a palladium&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction is described. This reaction features a broad substrate scope, good functional group compatibility, and high levels of (Z)&#8208;alkene stereocontrol. In this reaction, Pd(0) functions as a catalyst in two fundamental steps of the tandem sequence: 1) the generation of a borylated &#960;&#8208;allylpalladium species from bifunctional conjunctive reagents, inducing umpolung allylation of aldehydes, and 2) C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp) cross&#8208;coupling. Further transformations of the obtained products highlight their synthetic utility.</dc:description>

Abstract
A dynamic kinetic resolution &#8211; asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (DKR&#8208;ATH) methodology of &#945;&#8208;keto/enol&#8208;lactams was developed. We also propose a possible catalytic mechanism evolving a transition state stabilized by &#951;6&#8208;arene CH&#8722;O interaction. The efficient approach can be applied to a wide range of substrates including non&#8208;aryl ones which would be difficult to prepare by other asymmetric reduction methods.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Domino Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Difunctionalized Indoles via Migratory Insertion of Isocyanides in Batch and Continuous Flow</title>

Abstract
We report, herein, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade comprising carbopalladation, migratory insertion of isocyanide and triple bond activation followed by a nucleophilic attack (OR&#8722;) to construct difunctionalized acyl indoles. The process involves multiple bond formations via key palladium&#8208;chemistry steps, to construct these bis&#8208;heterocycles containing two privileged scaffolds (indole and oxindole) in a single operational step, along with attempts to generate enantioselectivity at a quaternary carbon center. The methodology also demonstrates a continuous&#8208;flow process to synthesize aryl isocyanides within minutes and using them in a telescopic manner.

         <title>An Amphiphilic (salen)Co Complex &#8211; Utilizing Hydrophobic Interactions to Enhance the Efficiency of a Cooperative Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An amphiphilic (salen)Co(III) complex is presented that accelerates the hydrolytic kinetic resolution (HKR) of epoxides almost 10&#8197;times faster than catalysts from commercially available sources. This was achieved by introducing hydrophobic chains that increase the rate of reaction in one of two ways &#8211; by enhancing cooperativity under homogeneous conditions, and increasing the interfacial area under biphasic reaction conditions. While numerous strategies have been employed to increase the efficiency of cooperative catalysts, the utilization of hydrophobic interactions is scarce. With the recent upsurge in green chemistry methods that conduct reactions &#8216;on water&#8217; and at the oil&#8208;water interface, the introduction of hydrophobic interactions has potential to become a general strategy for enhancing the catalytic efficiency of cooperative catalytic systems.

Abstract
An efficient method for targeting a variety of symmetrical and asymmetrical &#945;&#8208;substituted dithiomalonates (DTMs) is described, utilizing 1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;carbothioates as reactive acylating agents and MgBr2&#8901;OEt2/DBU or LiHMDS for soft or hard enolization conditions of thioesters, respectively. The utility of this methodology was demonstrated through the synthesis of the pyridopyrimidine mesoionic insecticides: triflumezopyrim and dicloromezotiaz.

         <title>Preparation, Structure, and Reactivity of Pseudocyclic &#946;&#8208;Trifluorosulfonyloxy Vinylbenziodoxolone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Pseudocyclic &#946;&#8208;trifluorosulfonyloxy vinylbenziodoxolones were prepared starting from hydroxybenziodoxolones and alkynes in the presence of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid. The reaction of these compounds with azide anion leads to &#946;&#8208;azido vinylbenziodoxolones as products of vinylic nucleophilic substitution in which addition&#8208;elimination reactions occur and the double bond configuration is retained.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pseudocyclic &#946;-trifluorosulfonyloxy vinylbenziodoxolones were prepared starting from hydroxybenziodoxolones and alkynes in the presence of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid. The reaction of these compounds with azide anion leads to &#946;-azido vinylbenziodoxolones as products of vinylic nucleophilic substitution in which addition-elimination reactions occur and the double bond configuration is retained. The structures of &#946;-trifluorosulfonyloxy vinylbenziodoxolone and &#946;-azido vinylbenziodoxolone were established by single crystal X-ray diffraction.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
A method for the selective synthesis of (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;fluoroenones and &#945;&#8208;difluoroalkyl ketones have been achieved. By employing water as oxygen source, potassium carbonate as base, tetrasubstituted &#946;&#8208;fluoroenones could be regio&#8208; and stereoselectively synthesized by oxy&#8208;difluoroalkylation of alkynes under visible light irradiated with moderate to good yields. &#945;&#8208;Difluoroalkyl ketones could be obtained while using phenylpyridine as base. This transformation features mild condition, wide functional tolerance and step economy. The large&#8208;scale transformations and further derivatization show its potential application in organic synthesis.

         <dc:description>A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method for the synthesis of arylselenides and aryltellurides has been established based on the oxidative cross&#8208;coupling between diorganyl dichalcogenides and aryl boronic acids. With trichloroisocyanuric acid as an oxidant, the reaction proceeded smoothly to afford the desired products in 45&#8208;97% yields at ambient temperature. Three reaction reagents used in this method are stoichiometric and the oxidation by&#8208;product isocyanuric acid can be easily isolated and recovered. Besides of arylboronic acids, aryl trifluoroborates and aryl trihydroxyborates salts are also able to perform this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Selective N&#8208;Arylation of Oxadiazolones by Diaryliodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report the method for copper&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation of diverse oxadiazolones by diaryliodonium salts in mild conditions in high yields (up to 92%) using available CuI as a catalyst. The developed method allows utilizing both symmetric and unsymmetric diaryliodonium salts bearing auxiliary groups such as 2,4,6&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl (TMP). We found that the steric effects in aryl moieties determined the chemoselectivity of N&#8208; and O&#8208;arylation of the 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;5(4H)&#8208;ones. Mesityl&#8208;substituted diaryliodonium salts demonstrated the high potential as a selective arylation reagent. The structural study suggests that steric accessibility of N&#8208;atom in 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;5(4H)&#8208;ones impact to arylation with sterically hindered diaryliodonium salts. The synthetic application of proposed method was also demonstrated on selective arylation of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;ones and 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;5&#8208;thiol.</dc:description>

         <title>Utilization of C(sp3)&#8208;Carboxylic Acids and Their Redox&#8208;Active Esters in Decarboxylative Carbon&#8722;Carbon Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Over the last several years, radical&#8208;mediated decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reactions employing alkyl carboxylic acids have emerged as a powerful tool for the regiospecific construction of carbon&#8722;carbon bonds. Under thermal or photocatalytic conditions, a wide variety of C(sp3)&#8208;carboxylic acids and their redox&#8208;active esters undergo decarboxylative C&#8722;C bond formation with suitable reactant partners, leading to complex chemical scaffolds with wide&#8208;ranging applications. This synthetic strategy has several advantages over the more conventional organometallic reagents, including abundant starting material availability and high functional group tolerance associated with the mild reaction conditions. This review article highlights recent developments in the functionalization of &#945;&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted carboxylic acids as well as the more challenging unactivated acids, with representative examples discussed against the backdrop of insightful comments on reaction mechanisms. In addition, examples of the synthesis of natural products, drug molecules, and the late&#8208;stage modification of bioactive molecules employing this non&#8208;traditional C&#8722;C bond formation strategy are included. This review has been categorized into three main sections that are organized around the type of C&#8722;C bond being forged: C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2), C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3), and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp). Further, the reactions of carboxylic acids and their redox&#8208;active esters have been organized separately in each section.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Oxyphosphorylation of Unactivated Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Here, we describe an application of hydroazidation in the instant activation of alkynes for achieving the oxyphosphorylation of unactivated alkynes with diarylphosphinoyl radicals under mild reaction conditions. This reaction provides a method for accessing &#946;&#8208;ketophosphine oxides and phosphorus&#8208;containing pyrroles.

Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of glycosyl chlorides with aryl bromides has been developed. The reaction proceeds smoothly under visible&#8208;light irradiation and features the use of bench&#8208;stable glycosyl chlorides, allowing the highly stereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;aryl glycosides.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Heck/Insertion/Decarboxylation Domino Sequence: Synthesis of Dihydrocyclohepta[de]naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization for the construction of fused dihydrocyclohepta[de]naphthalene skeletons was developed. The skeleton was assembled from 3&#8208;iodo&#8208;4H&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;one, norbornene and 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;naphthoic acid. Unlike the classic Catellani reaction, which involves the removal of norbornene, in the present system, norbornene acts as a building block for the construction of rigid nonplanar molecular architectures rather than as an ortho&#8208;directing transient mediator. This synthesis involves the formation of three C&#8722;C bonds via a one&#8208;pot process, and it is compatible of a series of substituents.

         <title>Development of a Radical Silylzincation of (Het)Aryl&#8208;Substituted Alkynes and Computational Insights into the Origin of the trans&#8208;Stereoselectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Volume 363, Issue 10, Page 2634-2647, May 18, 2021. </description>

Abstract
Aryl&#8208; and hetaryl&#8208;substituted acetylenes undergo regio&#8208; and stereoselective silylzincation by reaction with [(Me3Si)3Si]2Zn in the presence of Et2Zn (10&#8211;110&#8197;mol%) as additive. The distinctive feature of this addition across the C&#8722;C triple bond is its trans stereoselectivity. The radical nature of the silylzincation process is supported by diagnostic experiments and DFT calculations, which also corroborate the role played by steric effects to obtain that stereoselectivity. The procedure can be combined in one&#8208;pot with the copper(I)&#8208;mediated electrophilic substitution of the C(sp2)&#8722;Zn bond, with retention of the double bond geometry. This makes it valuable for the synthesis of stereodefined di&#8208; and trisubstituted vinylsilanes.

The distinctive feature of this addition across the C&#8722;C triple bond is its &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; stereoselectivity. The radical nature of the silylzincation process is supported by diagnostic experiments and DFT calculations, which also corroborate the role played by steric effects to obtain that stereoselectivity. The procedure can be combined in one-pot with the copper(I)-mediated electrophilic substitution of the C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;Zn bond, with retention of the double bond geometry. This makes it valuable for the synthesis of stereodefined di- and trisubstituted vinylsilanes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
The peculiar versatility of remotely enolizable 6&#8208;methyluracil&#8208;5&#8208;carbaldehydes as useful vinylogous pronucleophiles in direct, asymmetric [4+2] cyclizations with suitable nitroolefins has been demonstrated. Under the strategic exploitation of noncovalent bifunctional organocatalysis, a dearomative remote enolization strategy was implemented, to generate oQDM&#8208;type dienolate intermediates that were efficiently and stereoselectively trapped by either aromatic or aliphatic nitroolefins. A series of functionalized, chiral carbocycle&#8208;fused uracils embedding three contiguous stereocenters were thus collected in one step in good yields, with generally good levels of enantioselectivity, and complete diastereocontrol. Furthermore, the ability to provide enantiopure products via simple one&#8208;cycle recrystallizations and the possibility to further functionalize these scaffolds without losing their chiral integrity were demonstrated.

Abstract
A Y(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes with donor&#8208;acceptor aziridines has been developed, accessing diversely substituted imidazolidines high efficiency. Mechanistic investigations support the formation of imidazolidines through an SN1&#8208;like pathway. Furthermore, these imidazolidines exhibit promising anti&#8208;tumor activity against a series of human cancer cell lines.

Abstract
Employing silver/rhodium relay catalysis strategy, an intramolecular electrophilic cyclization and C&#8722;H activation followed by cascade hydrogenation and reductive amination has been developed. The acylmethylated isoquinoline derivatives could be afforded with broad substrate scope in 23&#8211;88% yields, which could be further transformed to the core skeleton of hexahydrodibenzo[a,g]quinolizine as drug&#8208;candidates. Moreover, this reaction was achieved in a gram&#8208;scale. A reasonable reaction mechanism has been proposed based on a series of control and KIE experiments.

Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot synthesis of 3&#8208;halo&#8208;2&#8208;organochalcogenylbenzo[b]chalcogenophenes has been developed using 1&#8208;(2&#8208;organochalcogenylethynyl)&#8208;2&#8208;butylchalcogenylbenzenes generated in&#8197;situ from 1&#8208;(2,2&#8208;dibromovinyl)&#8208;2&#8208;organochalcogenylbenzenes and diorganoyl dichalcogenides. By this method, several 2,3&#8208;disubstituted benzo[b]chalcogenophenes were prepared in yields of 48&#8211;93%. The mechanistic investigation suggests that the formation of chalcogenoacetylenes containing an adjacent chalcogen atom in the first step of this one&#8208;pot procedure involves acetylide anions formed from 1&#8208;(2,2&#8208;dibromovinyl)&#8208;2&#8208;organochalcogenylbenzenes and mild bases.

Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkynylation reactions are efficient transformations allowing the straightforward formation of functionalized alkynes. Therein, we disclose the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkynylation of vinylaziridines giving rise to both linear and branched enynes. The optimization of the reaction conditions allowed to determine the key parameters of the cobalt&#8208;based catalytic system. The scope investigation showed that the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkynylation is mainly limited to phenylacetylene derivatives. In most cases branched and linear enynes were isolated in equimolar proportions (20 examples). Additional experiments allowed us to propose a plausible mechanism. Finally, the hydroalkynylation products were further subjected to an iodocyclization affording a 2,3&#8208;dihydropyrrole derivative and a platinum&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization.

Abstract
In this paper, a high&#8208;yield, facile route for the scalable synthesis of sulfonyl 2&#8208;aroylbenzofurans via a Bi(OTf)3&#8208;mediated intermolecular double cyclocondensation of &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl o&#8208;hydroxyacetophenones with substituted &#945;&#8208;hydroxy arylketones under mild open&#8208;vessel reaction conditions is described. In the overall reaction, water is generated as the only byproduct. Various metal triflate&#8208;promoted reactions and conditions are investigated for the efficient one&#8208;pot (4+1) annulation reaction.

Abstract
A Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed chelation&#8208;assisted direct C6&#8722;H alkenylation of 2&#8208;pyridones with both terminal and internal alkynes in a highly regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective manner has been developed. The catalytic system consisting of Mn(CO)5Br catalyst and KOAc additive allows 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridones to undergo alkenylation with various terminal alkynes in methyl tert&#8208;butyl ether (MTBE) to furnish the C6&#8208;alkenylated 2&#8208;pyridone products in high yields, and the alkenylation with internal alkynes occurs in CH2Cl2 at increased catalyst and additive loadings. Mechanistic studies suggest the involvement of a five&#8208;membered organomanganese as the key intermediate in the catalytic cycle.

Abstract
A stereoselective synthetic route to chiral C3&#8208;spirooxindole&#8208; and C2&#8208;spiropseudoindoxyl&#8208;pyrrolidines was accomplished by an enantioselective organocatalyzed Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction of tryptamines and isotryptamines followed by a diastereoselective oxidative rearrangement using eco&#8208;friendly oxidants (i.&#8201;e., NaOCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;5H2O and Oxone&#174;). This sequential reaction enables rapid access to chiral C3&#8208;spirooxindole&#8208; and C2&#8208;spiropseudoindoxyl&#8208;pyrrolidines in a one&#8208;pot process. A Wnt signaling inhibitory assay of the prepared enantioenriched spiro compounds demonstrated that they exhibited moderate activities.

Abstract
A synthetic method is described to produce &#945;,&#945;&#8208;bis&#8208;sulfonyl arylketones from bromoalkynes and sulfinic acids under visible&#8208;light irradiation, this visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted multicomponent cascade processes are used without additives or photocatalysts. Replacing sulfinic acids with sodium arylsulfinates results in another multicomponent reaction for synthesizing multisubstituted conjugated dienes with 26%&#8211;54% yields via construction of a C&#8722;C bond and without the use of transition metals and other additives.

The front cover picture illustrates that N&#8208;hexylbenzamide is produced by flow. It depicts that the methyl benzoate and n&#8208;hexylamine as starting materials flow from upstream, and they react with each other to form an amide product by passing through pebbles that stand for the zirconium oxide catalysts. The new flow system enables direct reaction of fundamental substrates, carboxylic acid ester and amine, to realize green chemistry such as low environment load, high efficiency substance conversion, and safe process.

Abstract
Spirocyclic molecules are widely recognized for their complex three&#8208;dimensional features and structural rigidity. Among this class of molecules, the spiro&#8208;lactams subclass stands out, being extensively explored due to its bioactivity and utility in a variety of scientific fields such as drug design and organic synthesis. Given the recognition of spirocyclic lactams&#8217; broad potential, several efforts have been engaged on the pursuit of new synthetic strategies towards these molecules. The present review gathers advances on the synthesis of both spiro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams (spiroazetidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones) and spiro&#8208;&#948;&#8208;lactams (spiropiperidon&#8208;2&#8208;ones) reported since 2015. The work is divided into two distinct parts, each one dedicated to one of these types of spiro&#8208;lactam, with the approach used for building the spirocyclic system being extensively discussed, according to the method's scope, efficiency, selectivity, and reaction mechanism.

Abstract
Organoboron compounds have found widespread application in everyday organic synthesis. The Lewis acidic properties, non&#8208;toxicity, stability, and easy commercial availability of organoboron compounds have resulted in considerable attention from organic chemists. Over the last several decades, there has been a sizeable development of new organoboron compounds useful in organic synthesis. Allenylboron compounds have emerged as a promising scaffold for various synthetic transformations, including allenylation and propargylation of carbonyl compounds, imines, activated olefins, and others; hydroboration&#8208;allylation with carbonyl/imine, and more. On the other hand, a good number of synthetic methods have evolved over the years to access substituted allenylboron compounds in good yield. This review highlights the methods known to date for the synthesis and reactivity of allenylboron compounds in a chronological manner.

         <title>Oxime&#8208;Derived Iminyl Radicals in Selective Processes of Hydrogen Atom Transfer and Addition to Carbon&#8208;Carbon &#960;&#8208;Bonds</title>

Abstract
Oximes represent one of the fundamental organic compound classes with a wide range of synthetic applications. In the last decade O&#8208;substituted oximes were recognized as the synthetically available and versatile precursors of iminyl radicals via one&#8208;electron oxidation or one&#8208;electron reduction employing visible light photoredox catalysts, salts of abundant metals (such as Cu or Fe), or other convenient reagents. Iminyl radicals are powerful synthons for various processes of cyclization, ring&#8208;opening, CH&#8208;functionalization, and coupling. The present review is focused on the synthetic methods based on oxime&#8208;derived iminyl radicals developed in the last few years excluding ring opening reactions of cyclic iminyl radicals that were summarized in recent publications. The review consists of two main parts: (1) reactions of iminyl radicals involving 1,n&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (n=5 in most cases) and (2) reactions involving the addition of iminyl radical to the carbon&#8208;carbon &#960;&#8208;bond.

Abstract
A protocol involving intramolecular formal [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of in&#8197;situ generated o&#8208;aza&#8208;quinone methide for the facile synthesis of 1,4&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;fused quinoline motifs is demonstrated. The cascade involved tandem C&#8722;O, C&#8722;C, and C&#8722;N bond formation and also exhibited excellent functional group tolerance. Enantiomerically enriched 1,4&#8208;oxazepino quinolines were synthesized using alkynols derived from L&#8208;amino acids. The sulfoxide embedded quinolines were transformed to pentacyclic 1,4&#8208;thiepino tethered indeno&#8208;quinoline scaffolds via Pummerer cyclization.

Abstract
By visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis with copper complexes, sulfoximidoyl chlorides add to terminal aryl alkynes to give the corresponding (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;chlorovinyl sulfoximines with exclusive regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities in high yields. Two representative products have been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis. Radicals appear to be decisive intermediates. As demonstrated by two subsequent reactions, the products can be derivatized.

         <title>Zirconium Oxide&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Amidation of Unactivated Esters under Continuous&#8208;Flow Conditions</title>

Abstract
A sustainable and environmentally benign direct amidation reaction of unactivated esters with amines has been developed in a continuous&#8208;flow system. A commercially available amorphous zirconium oxide was found to be an efficient catalyst for this reaction. While the typical amidation of esters with amines requires a stoichiometric amount of a promoter or metal activator, the present continuous&#8208;flow method enabled the direct amidation reaction under additive&#8208;free conditions with an extensive diversity towards various functional groups. High yields of the products were obtained with a nearly equimolar proportion of starting materials to reduce byproduct formation, which renders this process applicable for use in a sequential&#8208;flow system.

Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and base&#8208;promoted one&#8208;pot reaction of ynones with 2&#8208;aminobenzonitriles is described. The reaction was initiated through sequential aza&#8208;Michael addition/intramolecular annulation to afford various multisubstituted 4&#8208;aminoquinolines and 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridines in good to excellent yields. Operational simplicity, high atom&#8208;economy with broad substrate scope makes this protocol more attractive. Also, the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and further transformation of the product were studied. Additionally, 2&#8208;haloarylyones as substrate provide N&#8208;arylquinolones as the sole product via the SNAr mechanism.

Abstract
We report a simple oxidative Csp3&#8722;H functionalization reaction of glycine derivatives by visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis. A wide range of glycine derivatives readily undergo the oxidative cyclization to afford various 2&#8208;substituted benzoxazoles. Importantly, this photocatalytic intramolecular dehydrogenative coupling reaction allows for the C&#8722;H functionalization of glycine derivatives involving short peptides under mild conditions, which may have value in preparing peptide&#8208;derived pharmacologically active molecules.

Abstract
A convenient procedure for the synthesis of thioesters has been developed via a palladium&#8208;catalyzed thiocarbonylation of benzyl chlorides with sulfonyl chlorides. Various arylacetyl thioesters were produced in good yields by using sulfonyl chlorides as an odorless sulfur source. Furthermore, W(CO)6 exhibited dual roles as both a solid CO surrogate and reductant here.

Abstract
A chiral phosphorus acid catalyzed enantioselective 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition of arylamines to in&#8197;situ formed 7&#8208;methylene&#8208;7H&#8208;indoles from 7&#8208;indolylmethanols has been developed for the first time. Without additives, the catalytic protocol enabled the formation of 1,4&#8208;adducts with a nitrogen&#8208;containing tertiary carbon stereocenter in 66&#8211;96% yield with 70&#8211;89% ee under mild conditions.

Abstract
A synthetic method is presented for S&#8722;N bond formation starting from cheap and affordable materials. We show that (un)substituted N&#8208;protected cyclic eight&#8208;membered C2&#8208;symmetric sulfenamides have been prepared in a few steps using this procedure. The synthetic utility of these ambipolar derivatives was demonstrated in a variety of synthetic transformations affording different S,N&#8208;heterocyles of pharmaceutical relevance in one or two steps from simple starting materials.

Abstract
A method to synthesize pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]cinnolines via rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation of pyrazolidinones and subsequent [4+2] annulation of sulfoxonium ylides was developed. 5&#8208;Substituted or 5,10&#8208;disubstituted pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]cinnolines could be obtained by slightly adjusting the reaction conditions. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and practical transformations proved the practicability of this method. The mechanism of this method was proposed in the article on the basis of preliminary mechanistic results and previous reports. This method features simplified operation, metal&#8208;oxidant free, and readily available reactants.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Functionalization of Selenocystine&#8208;Containing Peptides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A straightforward and atom&#8208;economic method for the functionalization of short selenocystine&#8208;containing peptides is presented. This method is shown to be tolerant to unprotected peptides. The detailed protocol is based on the generation of a selenium radical via visible light&#8208;initiated reaction in the presence of transition metal&#8208;free photocatalyst. The selenium radical is further oxidized to an electrophile and trapped by N&#8208;heterocycles. The mechanism is confirmed by NMR, HRMS, UV, EPR and cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments and photocatalyst emission quenching studies. A visible light&#8208;initiated reaction is employed for the synthesis of selenocysteine&#8208;containing indole&#8208;based macrocycles via intramolecular Se&#8722;C bond formation.

Abstract
A [4+3] annulation of 2&#8208;ylideneoxindoles with crotonate&#8208;derived sulfur ylides has been developed. A series of oxepino[3,2&#8208;b]indoles were prepared in moderate to excellent yields (62&#8208;93%) under mild conditions. Moreover, the synthetic oxepino[3,2&#8208;b] indoles can be further transformed into more complex cyclopropa[5,6]oxepino[3,2&#8208;b]indoles via a [2+1] cyclopropanation. In addition, the synthetic compounds show certain antiproliferative activity against K562 and MCF&#8208;7 cells, and its IC50 values for these two kinds of tumor cells up to 5.40&#177;0.88&#8197;&#956;M and 18.41&#177;0.50&#8197;&#956;M, respectively.

         <title>Enantioselective Catalyzed Synthesis of Amino Derivatives Using Electrophilic Open&#8208;Chain N&#8208;Activated Ketimines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
N&#8208;Activated ketimines are characterized by the presence of acyl, sulfonyl, and phosphinoyl groups linked to the nitrogen atom of the azomethine system. These electron&#8208;withdrawing groups enhance the electrophilic character of the imino moiety allowing the addition of even weak nucleophilic reagents. The presence of the oxygen atoms in these activating groups with its coordinating and Lewis or Br&#248;nsted properties is of paramount importance in asymmetric catalyzed reactions. This review collects the results that have appeared in the literature during the last two decades on the utilization of open&#8208;chain N&#8208;activated ketimines for the synthesis of optically active &#945;&#8208;disubstituted and &#945;&#8208;trisubstituted amino derivatives including nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds.

Abstract
An iron&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component cyanoalkylsulfonylation of 2,3&#8208;allenoic acids, K2S2O5, and the ring&#8208;opening of cyclobutanone oxime esters is described. The radical tandem cyclization route allows access to diverse cyanoalkylsulfonylated butenolides in moderate to good yields under mild conditions. Moreover, the products are further converted, offering the corresponding derivatives.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Rational Engineering of Toluene Dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida F1 towards Oxyfunctionalization of Bicyclic Aromatics</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture, designed and donated by WesWizzArt and painted by the Mexican artist Way (Wayra Castillo&#8208;Guerrero), illustrates the toluene dioxygenase&#8208;catalyzed conversion of aromatics. The enzyme exhibits a high affinity for monocyclic, but only a low one for bicyclic substrates. A semi&#8208;rational designed mutant library opened the way for the conversion of the bicyclic substrates naphthalene, 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline and 2&#8208;phenylpyridine at unprecedented rates, enabling the biosynthesis of their products in substantial quantities. Variants at active site positions M220, A223 and F366 exhibited a major influence in product formation and selectivity. Details can be found in the Research Article by Bernhard Hauer and co&#8208;workers (J. L. Wissner, J. T. Schelle, W. Escobedo&#8208;Hinojosa, A. Vogel, B. Hauer, Adv. Synth.

         <title>Catalytic Formal Hydroamination of Allylic Alcohols Using Manganese PNP&#8208;Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture, designed by L. Duarte de Almeida et al. illustrates the successful application of a well&#8208;defined manganese PNP pincer complex in the formal hydroamination of allylic alcohols with primary and secondary amines as well as with N&#8208;heterocycles. The corresponding &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols were obtained in up to 94% yield in a tandem reaction combining dehydrogenation/Michael addition/hydrogenation sequence. The properties of these non&#8208;innocent pincer ligands allowed application of this non&#8208;noble metal catalyst in organic synthesis with a broad substrate scope. Details can be found in the communication by M. Beller, K. Junge and co&#8208;workers (L. Duarte de Almeida, F. Bourriquen, K. Junge, M. Beller, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2021, 363, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202100081).

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation/Annulation Cascade of Aryl Oximes and Propargyl Alcohols to Isoquinoline N&#8208;Oxides</title>

Abstract
A &#946;&#8208;hydroxy elimination instead of common oxidization to carbonyl group in secondary propargyl alcohols was successfully developed to form 2&#8208;benzyl substituted isoquinoline N&#8208;oxides by a Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation and annulation cascade, in which moderate to excellent yields (up to 92%) could be obtained under mild reaction conditions, along with good regioselectivity, broad generality and applicability.

Abstract
We developed a method for the preparation of (diacetoxyiodo)&#8208;2&#8208;(N&#8208;alkylamido)benzene as an aniline&#8208;type hypervalent iodine(III). We also achieved direct cyclizations via C&#8722;H bond abstraction, such as the Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag reaction, a direct amination, and a direct lactonization, using the aniline&#8208;type hypervalent iodine(III) to obtain corresponding products in high yields.

         <title>Chemoselective Peptide Backbone Diversification and Bioorthogonal Ligation by Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation/Annulation</title>

Abstract
The field of peptide derivatization by metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation has been mostly directed to modify the side chains, but poor attention has been given to the peptide backbone. Here we report a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation/annulation process that can chemoselectively modify the peptide backbone producing functionalized isoquinolone scaffolds with high regioselectivity in a rapid and step&#8208;economical manner. This strategy is characterized by racemization&#8208;free conditions and the production of fluorescent peptides, and peptide conjugates to drugs, natural products and other peptide fragments, providing a chemical approach for the construction of novel peptide&#8208;pharmacophore conjugates. Mechanistic studies suggest that amide bonds of peptide backbone act as the bidentate directing group to promote the C&#8722;H activation/annulation process. This report provides an unprecedented example of peptide backbone diversification and bioorthogonal ligation exploiting the power of ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation.

Abstract
Directing group&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H activation has been widely used to control regioselectivity in the field of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization. Common functionalities found in complex organic molecules and/or readily available reagents are the most appealing directing groups, as they circumvent the need to install/remove the directing group. The aldehyde group is an important functional group in many areas including pharmaceuticals and material science. In this review, we present the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in aldehyde&#8208;assisted, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed sp2 C&#8722;H functionalization of arenes.

Abstract
An organoselenium&#8208;enabled radical relay Azidation&#8208;carbocyclization reaction for the preparation of azide&#8208;substituted quinoline&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones was developed. A series of previously unknown structurally diverse azide&#8208; substituted quinoline&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones were obtained under metal&#8208;free and room&#8208;temperature conditions. The key features of this reaction are a broad substrate scope, amenability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and easy product derivatization. Preliminary mechanistic studies support participation of an organoselenium species in a radical relay pathway.

         <title>Effective [3+1+1+1] Cycloaddition to Six&#8208;Membered Carbocycle Based on DMSO as Dual Carbon Synthon</title>

Abstract
A [3+1+1+1] cycloaddition was developed among 2&#8208;arylpropene, ketone and DMSO in the presence of K2S2O8. 2&#8208;arylpropene provides three carbons, ketone offers one carbon, and DMSO as dual carbon donor contributes two carbons to the six&#8208;membered carbocycle. It gave the cyclohexene motif and spirocyclohexene skeleton. Four C&#8722;C bonds formed in this process. Both propylene and ketone could be well tolerated and give the corresponding cyclohexene or spirocyclohexene motif in useful yields. Based on the controlled experiments, a possible mechanism was proposed.

         <title>Alkene, Bromide, and ROH &#8211; How To Achieve Selectivity? Electrochemical Synthesis of Bromohydrins and Their Ethers</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Bromohydrins and their ethers were electrochemically synthesized via hydroxy&#8208; and alkoxybromination of alkenes using potassium bromide and water or alcohols. High selectivity of bromohydrins formation was achieved only with the use of DMSO as the solvent and an acid as the additive. The proposed combination of starting reagents, additives, and solvents allowed to form bromohydrins or their ethers selectively despite the variety of side&#8208;products (epoxides, dibromides, diols). Bromohydrins were obtained in high yields, up to 96%, with a broad substrate scope in an undivided electrochemical cell equipped with glassy carbon and platinum electrodes at high current density.

         <title>Ir(NHC)&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Alkylated Alcohols via Borrowing Hydrogen Strategy: Influence of Bimetallic Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Multi N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene(NHC)&#8208;modified iridium catalysts were employed in the &#946;&#8208;alkylation of alcohols; dimerization of primary alcohols (Guerbet reaction), cross&#8208;coupling of secondary and primary alcohols, and intramolecular cyclization of alcohols. Mechanistic studies of Guerbet reaction, including kinetic experiments, mass analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, were employed to explain the fast reaction promoted by bimetallic catalysts, and the dramatic reactivity increase of monometallic catalysts at the late stage of the reaction.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Spirocyclopentane Oxindoles via [2+3] Annulation with 2&#8208;(2&#8208;Oxoindolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)malononitriles as 1,2&#8208;Carbon Bisnucleophiles</title>

Abstract
Carbon bisnucleophiles are important building blocks in organic synthesis and have widespread applications in the construction of carbocyclic compounds. Among them, 1,2&#8208;carbon bisnucleophile has been much less explored. Herein, we developed a [2+3] annulation of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;oxoindolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)malononitrile with 2&#8208;nitroallylic acetates, where 2&#8208;(2&#8208;oxoindolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)malononitrile served as a new type of 1,2&#8208;carbon bisnucleophile. Remarkably, the annulation reaction exhibits exclusive chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. A Michael addition/SN2 mechanism was proposed to avoid the &#8220;anti&#8208;Baldwin&#8221; cyclization. This stereoselective strategy provides a facile synthetic route for a new series of spirocyclopentane oxindole derivatives containing three stereogenic centers.

Abstract
A metal&#8208;free approach for the synthesis of 5&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoles via I2&#8208;mediated [4+1] annulation of readily available trifluoroacetimidohydrazides and methyl ketones has been achieved. The transformation involves iodination/Kornblum oxidation, intermolecular dehydration condensation and an iodine&#8208;mediated intramolecular cyclization/aromatization sequence.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A metal-free approach for the synthesis of 5-trifluoromethyl-1,2,4-triazoles via I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated [4+1] annulation of readily available trifluoroacetimidohydrazides and methyl ketones has been achieved. The transformation involves iodination/Kornblum oxidation, intermolecular dehydration condensation and an iodine-mediated intramolecular cyclization/aromatization sequence. The developed protocol can be easily scaled up to 3&#8197;mmol scale without obvious efficiency decrease and be implemented by a consecutive one-pot manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
2&#8208;(2&#8208;Oxoalkylidene)&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazolidine derivatives were synthesized in good to excellent yields regiospecifically through the catalyst&#8208;free electrophilic ring expansion of N&#8208;unprotected aziridines and the ketene C=O double bond of &#945;&#8208;oxoketenes, in&#8197;situ generated from the microwave&#8208;assisted Wolff rearrangement of 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diketones. The ring expansion predominantly underwent an SN1 process and the hydrogen bond decides the (E)&#8208;configuration of products.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208; and Substrate&#8208;Dependent Chemodivergent Reactivity of Stabilised Sulfur Ylides with Salicylaldehydes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Stabilised sulfur ylides are synthetically appealing compounds, which reactivity under Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis has been poorly explored. Herein, we report a new catalyst&#8208; and substrate&#8208; dependent chemodivergent reaction between stabilised sulfur ylides and salicylaldehydes, leading to the (suprising) formation of 2H&#8208;chromenes or dihydrobenzofurans products. Particular attention was set on the unusual mechanisms involved. Two unique reaction routes including two ylide units in the reactions are proposed. These pathways were validated by performing a selectivity switch in some cases, enabled by the modulation of the nucleophilicity of the sulfur ylide, and by the loading of the Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst in the reaction.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Phloretin &#945;&#8208;Glucosides Using a Sucrose Phosphorylase Mutant and its Effect on Solubility, Antioxidant Properties and Skin Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Glycosylation of polyphenols may increase their aqueous solubility, stability, bioavailability and pharmacological activity. Herein, we used a mutant of sucrose phosphorylase from Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum engineered to accept large polyphenols (variant TtSPP_R134A) to produce phloretin glucosides. The reaction was performed using 10% (v/v) acetone as cosolvent. The selective formation of a monoglucoside or a diglucoside (53% and 73% maximum conversion percentage, respectively) can be kinetically controlled. MS and 2D&#8208;NMR determined that the monoglucoside was phloretin 4&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside and the diglucoside phloretin&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;[&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranosyl&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;O&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside], a novel compound. The molecular features that determine the specificity of this enzyme for 4&#8217;&#8208;OH phenolic group were analysed by induced&#8208;fit docking analysis of each putative derivative, using the crystal structure of TtSPP and changing the mutated residue. The mono&#8208; and diglucoside were, respectively, 71&#8208; and 1200&#8208;fold more soluble in water than phloretin at room temperature. The &#945;&#8208;glucosylation decreased the antioxidant capacity of phloretin, measured by DPPH and ABTS assays; however, this loss was moderate and the activity could be recovered upon deglycosylation in&#8197;vivo. Since phloretin attracts a great interest in dermocosmetic applications, we analyzed the percutaneous absorption of glucosides and the aglycon employing a pig skin model. Although the three compounds were detected in all skin layers (except the fluid receptor), the diglucoside was present mainly on superficial layers.

Abstract
The substrate scope of the asymmetric allylation with zinc organyls catalyzed by 3,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl)&#8208;1,1&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl hydrogenphosphate (TRIP) has been extended to non&#8208;cyclic ester organozinc reagents and ketones. Tertiary chiral alcohols are obtained with ee's up to 94% and two stereogenic centers can be created. Compared to the previous lactone reagent the stereopreference switches almost completely, proving the fact that the nature of the organometallic compound is of immense importance for the asymmetry of the product.

Abstract
Herein, a copper(II)&#8208;catalyzed dearomative cyclization amination of N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminobenzoyl) indoles is presented. Under mild reaction conditions, the cyclization proceeds to afford tetracyclic indolines by forming a new C&#8722;N bond in good yields. The tetracyclic 5a,6&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,1&#8208;b]quinazolin&#8208;12(5H)&#8208;ones are obtained in good to excellent yields (up to 99% yield) by using trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH) mediated N&#8722;Ts bond cleavage. The obtained compounds could be easily functionalized by simple synthetic methods.

Abstract
Enzyme discovery for use in the manufacture of chemicals, requiring high stereoselectivities, continues to be an important avenue of research. Here, a sequence directed metagenomics approach is described to identify short chain carbonyl reductases. PCR from a metagenomic template generated 37 enzymes, with an average 25% sequence identity, twelve of which showed interesting activities in initial screens. Six of the most productive enzymes were then tested against a panel of 21 substrates, including bulkier substrates that have been noted as challenging in biocatalytic reductions. Two enzymes were selected for further studies with the Wieland Miescher ketone. Notably, enzyme SDR&#8208;17, when co&#8208;expressed with a co&#8208;factor recycling system produced the anti&#8208;(4aR,5S) isomer in excellent isolated yields of 89% and 99% e.e. These results demonstrate the viability of a sequence directed metagenomics approach for the identification of multiple homologous sequences with low similarity, that can yield highly stereoselective enzymes with applicability in industrial biocatalysis.

         <title>Decarboxylation&#8208;Initiated Intermolecular Carbon&#8208;Heteroatom Bond Formation</title>

Abstract
Carboxylic acids are among the most used feedstock chemicals due to their great structural diversity and easy handling. The use of carboxylic acids and their derivatives in decarboxylative couplings has proven to be a valuable tool for the construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. This synthetic strategy provides a complementary bond disconnection to traditional cross&#8208;coupling methods. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of decarboxylation&#8208;initiated intermolecular C&#8208;heteroatom bond formation, outlining several main mechanistic concepts combined with early examples and highlighting the achievements made in the past decade until January 2021. In these reactions, carboxylic acids and their derivatives undergo initial decarboxylation and then react with other heteroatom electrophiles and nucleophiles, thus replacing the carboxylate group with a valuable and prevalent heteroatom functionality.

         <title>Chemodivergent Photocatalytic Synthesis of Dihydrofurans and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones</title>

Abstract
A synthetic procedure, catalysed by Ir(ppy)3 under visible&#8208;light irradiation, for the chemodivergent synthesis of 2,3&#8208;dihydrofurans (3) or &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones (7) starting from &#945;&#8208;halo ketones (1) and alkenes (2) has been developed. The mild reaction conditions and the redox&#8208;neutral nature of the process make it particularly sustainable avoiding the use of both sacrificial reactants and stoichiometric strong oxidants. Careful experimental investigations, supported by DFT calculations, allowed to disclose in details a possible mechanistic pathway and to direct the synthesis chemodivergently either toward 3 or 7, depending not only on the nature of the substrates, but also on the choice of the experimental conditions.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts Alkylation Reactions of Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Substituted and annulated pyrroles containing chiral centers are potentially accessible by means of an organocatalytic enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation (FCA) reaction. They are interesting compounds because of their abundant natural occurrence and their different biological activities. In comparison to indoles, for which a myriad of asymmetric procedures involving the FCA have been developed, pyrroles have been relatively less used as nucleophilic counterparts in this reaction. However, in the last two decades, huge synthetic efforts have been performed around this interesting asymmetric transformation and several methodologies have been devised. In this context, this review article provides a general overview of the organocatalytic enantioselective FCA chemistry of pyrroles, which has not been revised to date.

         <title>The Trityl&#8208;Cation Mediated Phosphine Oxides Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Reduction of phosphine oxides into the corresponding phosphines using PhSiH3 as a reducing agent and Ph3C+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; as an initiator is described. The process is highly efficient, reducing a broad range of secondary and tertiary alkyl and arylphosphines, bearing various functional groups in generally good yields. The reaction is believed to proceed through the generation of a silyl cation, which reaction with the phosphine oxide provides a phosphonium salt, further reduced by the silane to afford the desired phosphine along with siloxanes.

         <title>Copper(0) nanoparticle catalyzed Z&#8208;Selective Transfer Semihydrogenation of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The use of copper(0) nanoparticles in the transfer semihydrogenation of alkynes has been investigated as a lead&#8208;free alternative to Lindlar catalysts. A stereo&#8208;selective methodology for the hydrogenation of internal alkynes to the corresponding (Z)&#8208;alkenes in high isolated yields (86% average) has been developed. This green and sustainable transfer hydrogenation protocol relies on non&#8208;noble copper nanoparticles for reduction of both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient, aliphatic&#8208;substituted and aromatic&#8208; substituted internal alkynes. Polyols, such as ethylene glycol and glycerol, have been proven to act as hydrogen sources, and excellent stereo&#8208; and chemoselectivity have been observed. Enabling technologies, such as microwave and ultrasound irradiation are shown to enhance heat and mass transfer, whether used alone or in combination, resulting in a decrease in reaction time from hours to minutes.

Abstract
A relay Cu(I)/Br&#248;nsted base catalyzed one&#8208;pot phospha&#8208;Michael addition/5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization/isomerization of in&#8197;situ generated aza&#8208;alkynyl o&#8208;quinone methides (N&#8208;o&#8208;AQMs) from 1&#8208;(o&#8208;aminophenyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;ynols with P(O)&#8208;compounds has been established to afford C3&#8208;phosphorylated indoles. It demonstrates that the 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition adduct from N&#8208;o&#8208;AQMs could undergo further cyclization with the tethered alkyne moiety to afford N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkene Thioacylation: A C&#8722;S Bond Activation Approach for Accessing Indanone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular alkene thioacylation reaction initiated by the activation of thioester C(acyl)&#8722;S bonds is reported. This approach successfully suppressed decarbonylation and &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination with related acyl and alkyl metal thiolate intermediates, providing an efficient and atom&#8208;economical method to access indanone scaffolds. Mechanistic studies provide support for C(acyl)&#8722;Pd bond insertion of olefins. The synthetic utility of this protocol is demonstrated by the further conversion of the newly formed methylene sulfide substituent.

         <title>Electrochemical Generation of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes for Use in Synthesis and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The electrochemical generation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) offers a mild and selective alternative to traditional synthetic methods that usually rely on strong bases and air&#8208;sensitive materials. The use of electrons as reagents results in an efficient and clean synthesis that enables the direct use of NHCs in various applications. Herein, the use of electrogenerated NHCs in organocatalysis, synthesis and organometallic chemistry is explored.

Abstract
The review summarizes recent advances in the synthesis of C2&#8208;halogenated nitrogen heterocycles via nucleophilic halogenation of corresponding N&#8208;oxides as well as application of this methodology in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. Both scientific and patent literature is reviewed mostly over the period of the last ten years. The review contains a practical guide (typical procedures and infographic based on extensive literature analysis), which can help practitioners in choosing optimal reagents/conditions for nucleophilic halogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles of different types. The bibliography contains 199&#8197;references.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Chemoselective and Stereoselective Approach to Synthesis of Spiro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;Lactams with Potent Anticancer Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Chemoselective approaches were developed for derivatizing diastereoselective chromanone spiro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams through the Michael&#8208;type addition by using amide as a weak nucleophile to construct the spiro&#8208;carbon center under basic conditions. To expand the scope of this post&#8208;Ugi cascade reaction, a new series of oxidized chromone derivatives was synthesized by altering solvent from EtOH to DMF. Compounds 7&#8201;a and 7&#8201;b which could be synthesized in one day, demonstrated comparable anticancer activities with legendary anticancer drug paclitaxel in the PANC and U87&#8197;cell lines. This methodology offers a new approach to construct spiro&#8208;carbon centers with functionalized chromanones or chromones under mild reaction conditions.

         <dc:description>








Abstract
Functionalized coumarins are privileged scaffolds which display diverse pharmacological and physiological activities, and a myriad of applications in medical science and biomedical research. Owing to these multifarious activities of coumarins, synthetic chemists are actively engaged in developing new and superior methods for their synthesis. In the last decade, the synthesis of functionalized coumarins via visible light&#8208;induced methodologies has turned into one of the most significant and fundamental missions in organic synthesis. This review covers the literature on the synthesis of functionalized coumarins under visible light&#8208;assisted methodologies.

         <title>Recent Advances in Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Functionalization of Indoles</title>

Abstract
Indole is one of the most important heterocycles in organic synthesis, natural products, and drug discovery. Recently, tremendous advances in the selective functionalization of indoles have been reported. Although the most important advances have been powered by transition metal catalysis, exceedingly useful methods in the absence of transition metals have also been reported. In this review, we provide an overview of functionalization reactions of indoles that have been published in the last years with a focus on the most recent advances, aims, and future trends. The review is organized by the positional selectivity and type of methods used for functionalization. In particular, we discuss major advances in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization at the classical C2/C3 positions, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization at the remote C4/C7 positions, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling, and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free functionalization.
