         <title>L&#8208;Proline Derived Thioamide Small Organic Molecule for the &#945;&#8208;Stereoselective Synthesis of 2&#8208;Deoxyglycosides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>L&#8208;Prolinethioamide catalysed direct stereoselective glycosylation of glycal donors to access 2&#8208;deoxyglycosides under moderate reaction condition. This proposed glycosylation protocol produced the desired products with upto 88% yields and shows greater tolerance of glycosyl acceptors, broad substrate scope with better stereoselectivity. This method is also applicable for less nucleophilic acceptors such as phenol. In addition, 1,1&#8242;&#8208;linked trehalose&#8208;type analogues can also be accessed through this methodology.  Further, mechanistic studies suggest that in this glycosylation L&#8208;prolinethioamide operate via Br&#248;nsted acid/base catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Michael Addition and Oxidative Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Oxo Ketene Dithioacetals and Maleimides:  Switchable Synthesis of 3&#8208;Alkenyl Succinimides and Maleimides</title>

         <dc:description>Switchable synthesis of 3&#8208;alkenyl succinimides and maleimides has been achieved from Michael addition and oxidative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of &#945;&#8208;oxo ketene dithioacetals and maleimides by switching different reaction conditions. In the presence of 30 mol% of CH3SO3H in DCE at 120 oC, Michael addition reaction of &#945;&#8208;oxo ketene dithioacetals and maleimides occurred to afford 3&#8208;alkenyl succin&#8208;imides in 40&#8208;90% yields, whereas in the presence of 30 mol% of Pd(OAc)2 in DMF at 20 oC, 3&#8208;alkenyl maleimides were obtained in 40&#8208;80% yields from the oxidative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of &#945;&#8208;oxo ketene dithioacetals with maleimides. The presupposition of directing groups onto the substrates is not required in Michael addition reaction. The method can extend to gram scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Ga&#8208;catalyzed Temperature&#8208;dependent Oxazolidinone/Piperazine Synthesis from Phenyl Aziridines Involving a Divergent Ligand&#8208;assisted Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Application of a binary Ga&#8208;based catalyst system for the coupling of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and aziridines to form oxazolidinones is presented. It has been possible to optimize the catalyst system for the selective formation of a single regioisomer, in excellent yield, under relatively mild reaction conditions. The optimized catalyst system has been successfully applied to a range of substituted aziridines derived from styrene oxide. It has been observed that aziridines bearing two aromatic substituents result in piperazine formation through an unexpected dimerization reaction. These piperazine products can be selectively formed in the absence of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or are favoured at lower reaction temperatures. A detailed DFT study into the reaction mechanism for the formation of both products has been carried out and an unusual ligand assistance in the case of oxazolidinone synthesis has been identified. More specifically, this ligand interaction promotes the initial ring&#8208;opening of the aziridine and this work presents the first fully elucidated mechanism involving this intermediate.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Applications of both halogen and chalcogen bonding in organocatalysis are by now well established with various examples. However, the combination of both interactions within one catalyst is currently unknown. Herein, we describe the synthesis of such a mixed chalcogen&#8208; and halogen&#8208;bond donor and present a first indication of its catalytic activity in a benchmark reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven, Persulfate&#8208;Mediated Hydrocarboxylation of Vinylsulfones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a visible light&#8208;mediated approach for the radical hydrocarboxylation of vinylsulfone derivatives. Using cheap and easily accessible sodium formate as C1&#8208;source and K2S2O8 as reagent, a set of vinylsulfone substrates could be efficiently hydrocarboxylated in aqueous medium without any additional catalyst or reagent; and the concept could be also applied for direct hydroacylations, hydroalkylations and hydrophosphorylations. The control experiments clearly indicated that the reaction proceeds via radical mechanism without the generation of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes; supporting the working model of K2S2O8&#8208;initiated in situ formation of CO2 radical anion.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydrogenation of Azides and One&#8208;pot Synthesis of Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a single&#8208;atom cobalt&#8208;catalyzed  transfer hydrogenation (TH) of azides is reported under mild conditions (at 30 &#8451; in 30 min) using NH2NH2.H2O as the hydrogen source. Employing this protocol, a wide range of azides were transformed to their corresponding amines. This methodology was extended towards the synthesis of several important N&#8208;substituted pyrroles from azides in one&#8208;pot manner. The control experiments suggested, the transfer hydrogenation favoured by electron withdrawing substituents and one&#8208;pot pyrrole synthesis favoured by electron&#8208;donating substituents. The recyclability test revealed the catalysts could be recycled up to 7th times without significant loss in the catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Transfer Hydrogenation of Azoarenes to Hydrazoarenes by Ammonia Borane Complex Catalyzed by Au Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Minute amounts of supported Au nanoparticles on TiO2 (0.1 mol%) catalyze quantitatively at room temperature the transfer hydrogenation of azoarenes to hydrazoarenes by ammonia borane complex, in ethanol as solvent. At 1 mol% catalyst loading level and 2.5 molar equivalents of ammonia borane the process occurs instantaneously. The catalyst is recyclable and reusable. In the absence of reducing agent, hydrazoarenes undergo smooth Au/TiO2&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation back to azoarenes.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Construction of Fluorinated Chiral Alcohols via Sequential Substitution/Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Bromoarylketones and Fluoroalcohols</title>

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot synthesis of fluorinated chiral alcohols from &#945;&#8208;bromoarylketones and fluoroalcohols is described. The fluorinated ketone intermediates were formed from &#945;&#8208;bromoarylketones with fluoroalcohols as nucleophiles and solvents, which were reduced subsequentially by adding a chiral Ru catalyst and a mixture of formic acid and triethyl amines (FA: TEA=1.1:1) as hydrogen donor to give 27 examples of fluorinated chiral alcohols in 60&#8211;93% yields and 85&#8211;98% ee values. Notably, K3PO4 acts as a base in nucleophilic substitution and an additive in reductive step to enhance the reactivity and enantioselectivity, which is crucial for constructing compatible conditions for one&#8208;pot process. This one&#8208;pot process is also applicable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

         <title>Short and Scalable Synthesis of Plant&#8208;Based Cholesterol in GMP Grade</title>

Abstract
A plant&#8208;based straightforward and short four&#8208;step synthesis of cholesterol starting from commercially available diosgenin is reported. This offers a large&#8208;scale production of highly needed GMP&#8208;grade cholesterol, which is part of the lipid cocktail for the assembly of effective mRNA&#8208;based vaccines against the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. These lipids are formulated into the delivery system of the mRNA fragments by forming Lipid Nano Particles (LNP) that introduce the mRNA into the cells. Cholesterol plays a crucial role because it stabilizes LNP and facilitates endosome escape of the mRNA into the cytosol.

Abstract
We report a photocatalytic strategy for selective reduction of nitroarenes to azoxy&#8208;, azo&#8208; and hydrazo&#8208;compounds catalyzed by bismuth porphyrin metal organic framework (Bi&#8208;MOF) through controlling time, atmosphere, or the quantity of NaBH4 under mild conditions (Rt, Light). The photocatalytic protocol exhibited excellent functional group compatibility, and the recyclability of Bi&#8208;MOF was demonstrated by five cycle tests. More importantly, the scale&#8208;up experiment of 10&#8197;g can also be carried out smoothly with excellent yield of 95%. This green and effective photocatalytic strategy provides a practical possibility for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of azo intermediates.

Abstract
Effective access to azolium salts with varying stereoelectronic properties has always fascinated the organometallic chemists. Herein, we described a Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;step access to diverse meta&#8208;alkylated N&#8208;aryl (benz)imidazolium salts (&gt;40&#8197;examples) via &#963;&#8208;bond activation strategy starting from the readily available azolium salts using alkyl bromide. Notably, the present method is compatible with a wide range of azolium salts and secondary/tertiary alkyl bromides, including the biologically relevant motifs. Various control experiments along with the DFT calculation established the reaction pathway of orthometalated Ru(II)&#8208;NHC complex (6) formation followed by the generation of a Ru(III)&#8208;intermediate, which controls the observed meta&#8208;selectivity, via single electron transfer. Crucially, detailed insight of the reaction mechanism helped to comprehend why some substrates are challenging for this methodology.

Abstract
N,N&#8217;&#8208;Diaryl ethylenediamines are common feedstocks in organic synthesis and important structural motifs in medicinal chemistry. Whereas the C&#8722;N formation reactions based on anilines and aryl halides are the most direct methods to access N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl ethylenediamines, the photocatalytic synthetic version remains undeveloped. Herein we describe the dual nickel/photoredox&#8208;catalyzed amination reaction using nitroarenes and trimethylamine as reaction substrates. This cascade transformation hinges on the multiple C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C coupling events based on the nitrogen radical and &#945;&#8208;aminomethyl radical derived from nitroarene and trimethylamine, respectively. A variety of N&#8208;formyl N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl ethylenediamines can be obtained under the reaction protocol. Subsequent hydrolysis offers the N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl ethylenediamines for further derivatizations.

This cascade transformation hinges on the multiple C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C coupling events based on the nitrogen radical and &#945;-aminomethyl radical derived from nitroarene and trimethylamine, respectively. A variety of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-formyl &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8217;-diaryl ethylenediamines can be obtained under the reaction protocol. Subsequent hydrolysis offers the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8217;-diaryl ethylenediamines for further derivatizations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A synthetic method to prepare 1,2&#8208;diamines efficiently that relies on the 4CzPN&#8208;catalysed &#945;&#8208;aminoalkylation of azomethine imines by secondary and tertiary &#945;&#8208;silylamines under blue light emitting diode (LED) light (456&#8197;nm) is described. Achieved under metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free reaction conditions at room temperature, the synthetic protocol was shown to afford product yields up to 99% and applicable to the late&#8208;stage functionalisation of three drug molecules and the gramme&#8208;scale preparation of one example.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation of Ynamides with Aminocarbonyls as a Route to 2&#8208;Aminoquinolines Diversely Substituted at the 4th&#8208;Position</title>

Abstract
Gold&#8208;catalyzed interplay between ynamides and aminocarbonyls comprises a route to 2&#8208;aminoquinolines. This modular annulation proceeds under relatively mild conditions (Ph3PAuCl/AgNTf2 5&#8197;mol&#8201;%, DCE, 60&#8211;80 &#176;C), and a number of functionalities were compatible (42&#8197;examples; 25&#8211;98% yields). In contrast to a group of other gold&#8208;catalyzed methods employing the ynamide/amine combinations for the assembly of 2&#8208;aminoquinolines, the developed approach utilizes a diversity of aminocarbonyl substrates and, in particular, allows a variation of the substituents in the 4th quinoline position. The synthetic potential of the obtained heterocyclic products was illustrated by post&#8208;modifications of the quinoline backbone and the peripheral substituents.

Abstract
This report describes a general method for the one&#8208;pot direct N&#8208;acylation of N&#8208;heterocycles using our previously developed 4&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethylamino)pyridine N&#8208;oxide (DMAPO)/di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl dicarbonate (Boc2O) system. This system enables one&#8208;pot N&#8208;acylation reactions to provide bulky N&#8208;acyl heterocycles starting from a wide variety of less nucleophilic N&#8208;heterocycles and sterically hindered &#945;&#8208;fully substituted carboxylic acids in high yields. Moreover, this one&#8208;pot method does not involve pre&#8208;activation of substrates. The protocol has been successfully extended to one&#8208;pot N&#8208;acylation of 7&#8208;azaindoles.

         <title>Dehydrogenative Fluorination of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes to Access Multi&#8208;Substituted Trifluoromethylalkenes</title>

Abstract
A dehydrogenative fluorination method is developed to access multi&#8208;substituted trifluoromethylalkenes starting from a variety of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. The reaction proceeds with electrophilic fluorination source NFSI only and accommodates a wide range of functional groups, thus complementing the previously reported protocols. Additionally, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted stereoinversion is revealed to enable the access to E&#8208;isomer enriched products.

Abstract
We describe the preparation of S&#8208;perfluoroalkyl benzodithiazole trioxides as radical perfluoroalkylating reagents. Their syntheses were performed on a multi&#8208;gram scale by an oxidative cyclization connecting the nitrogen of a sulfoximine and a sulfur atom previously introduced in the ortho position of this group. The structures and properties of these new molecules were carefully examined by X&#8208;Ray diffraction, DFT calculations and cyclic voltammetry. These data clearly highlight the enhanced reactivity of these cyclic sulfoximines compared to their open analogues. This was confirmed by photoredox catalysis experiments that revealed interesting reactivity, most especially for the introduction of di&#8208; and monofluoroalkyl chains.

Abstract
Phosphonothioates, phosphinothioates and phosphorothioates are regarded as an important class of sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds. Because of the unique P(O)S&#8722;R group, these compounds have important biological activities and thus have been widely used in the fields of pharmaceuticals and pesticides. In recent years, the development of sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds by radical processes has attracted considerable attention in organophosphorus chemistry. Along these lines, in this review, the recent advances in the synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds were systematically summarized. According to the different ways of generating radicals during the formation process of phosphonothioates, phosphinothioates and phosphorothioates, these transformations can be divided into four categories: (1) Oxidant or metal&#8208;free promoted radical transformation to fabricate sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds; (2) Copper&#8208;catalyzed radical transformation to produce sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds; (3) Photo&#8208;induced radical transformation to prepare sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds; (4) Electro&#8208;induced radical transformation to derive sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds.

         <title>Recent Developments in Selenylation and Thiolation of Alkenes via Three&#8208;component Reactions</title>

Abstract
Alkenes are valuable feedstocks in organic synthesis. Selenium or sulfur&#8208;containing coumpounds with a neighboring functional group can be easily prepared by direct difunctionalization of alkenes via three&#8208;component reactions. It will reduce the number of steps and waste generation, and form complicated molecules from simple starting materials. Herein, recent developments (2013&#8211;2022) have been summarized via two categories: (1)&#8197;selenylation via seleniranium intermediates or Se&#8208;centered radicals; (2)&#8197;thiolation with more diverse mechanisms and products Reactions with electron&#8208;rich arenes, alcohols, water, acids, NaN3, amines, KSCN, and sulfamides, TMSNCS, TMSN3, Et3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3HF, SOCl2, HCl, NFSI, tBuONO, pyridinium salts, tBuOOH, ArN2BF4, CO2, CO, O2, CF3SO2Cl, R2P(O)&#8722;H, (RO)2P(O)SH, (RO)2P(O)OH et al will be discussed. We hope this review will do help for future research in this area.

Abstract
The employing visible light to drive organic transformations is the most promising choice to meet the needs for green synthesis, in which the reactions promoted by visible light may provide a more efficient and greener method. Currently, the most abundant methods for activation and functionalization of reaction substrates have relied on the direct single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) between the excited photocatalyst and substrates, and these wonderful works were summarized and docoumented in many reviews. As a complement to the above reactions, the photoredox&#8208;mediated atom transfer transformations (photocatalyst&#8208;to&#8208;HAT catalyst&#8208;to&#8208;substrates) to generate radical species are showing an explosively growing trend. In this review, we highlight recent significant developments in this rapidly growing area, mainly focusing on the photoinduced base&#8208;to&#8208;substrates charge transfer reactions.

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot synthesis of 2,3,4&#8208;unprotected &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;glycopyranosides from glycals and amines with exclusive &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity under room temperature conditions is reported. This method was achieved via palladium&#8208;catalyzed Tsuji&#8208;Trost amination followed by dihydroxylation directly, tolerating anilines, heterocyclic aromatic amines, and N,O&#8208;dimethylhydroxylamine, especially the reaction of primary amines and glycals has not been reported before. Furthermore, the protocol was applied to modify clinical drugs (prazosin, imiquimod) and construct the analogue of the natural product amphimedoside A.

Abstract
Accessing homogenous glycoconjugates is of significance for assessing their biophysical activities and sometimes as vaccine candidate. Synthesis of glycoconjugates involves two species of which, glycosyl donor plays pivotal role in controlling the outcome of the glycosylation. Recently discovered alkynyl glycosyl carbonate donors possess self&#8208;stability, high reactivity, and fast reaction time (15&#8211;30&#8197;min) when activated with [Au]/[Ag]&#8208;catalysts. Herein, we report metal free conditions for the activation of the same alkynyl glycosyl carbonate donors using I2/TMSOTf in stoichiometric quantities. Extrusion product was characterized to be the vinylidene iodide by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The reaction conditions were illustrated to be suitable for synthesis of various glycosides, purine/pyrimidine nucleosides and a pentasaccharide repeating unit of Klebsiella pneumoniae (O&#8208;3&#8208;antigen).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessing homogenous glycoconjugates is of significance for assessing their biophysical activities and sometimes as vaccine candidate. Synthesis of glycoconjugates involves two species of which, glycosyl donor plays pivotal role in controlling the outcome of the glycosylation. Recently discovered alkynyl glycosyl carbonate donors possess self-stability, high reactivity, and fast reaction time (15&#8211;30&#8197;min) when activated with [Au]/[Ag]-catalysts. Herein, we report metal free conditions for the activation of the same alkynyl glycosyl carbonate donors using I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TMSOTf in stoichiometric quantities. Extrusion product was characterized to be the vinylidene iodide by single crystal X-ray analysis. The reaction conditions were illustrated to be suitable for synthesis of various glycosides, purine/pyrimidine nucleosides and a pentasaccharide repeating unit of &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; (O-3-antigen).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A mild photocatalyzed approach to achieve the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of esters via formation of an &#945; &#8208;radical is disclosed here. Cesium enolates of esters were generated in&#8197;situ using Cs2CO3 as a base. A subsequent photocatalyzed oxidation at the &#945;&#8208;carbon of these enolates produced an &#945;&#8208;radical that was added into activated alkenes. This is the first example accessing the &#945;&#8208;carbon radical of esters in photoredox catalyed transformations.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed allylic C&#8722;H oxidative allylation of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones to synthesize skipped 1,4&#8208;dienes is demonstrated. This direct allylic alkylation reaction has excellent site selectivity, tolerates a wide range of functional groups, and affords 1,4&#8208;dienes in moderate to good yield. Moreover, this olefination method allows the regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of 1,4&#8208;dienes containing a trisubstituted alkene. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction undergoes allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H activation and a subsequent carbene migratory insertion.

         <title>Cobalt(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Diamination of &#945;&#8208;Alkyl Styrenes with Anilines</title>

Abstract
A commercially available cobalt complex Cp*CoIII(CO)I2 has been found to effectively catalyze the diamination of &#945;&#8208;alkyl styrenes with anilines under a mild reaction condition, using dioxygen as the oxidant. This reaction features a reasonably good substrate scope of amines and a good functional group tolerance. Preliminary mechanistic studies have shown that Cp*CoIII(CO)I2 alone can promote the diamination reaction.

Abstract
Spirocyclic frameworks could enhance the drug&#8208;like properties of planar bioactive molecules by increasing their three&#8208;dimensionality, making the development of synthetic methodology and bioactivity assays for spiro compounds highly attractive. This work reported the silver&#8208;catalyzed tandem cycloisomerization/Povarov reaction between &#946;&#8208;alkynyl ketones and hexahydro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazines, access to spiro[isochromene&#8208;1,4&#8217;&#8208;quinoline]. This synthetic protocol was characterized by remarkable efficiency, low catalyst&#8208;loading and high diastereoselectivity. Moreover, the spirocyclic quinolines exhibited good cytotoxicity in U937 cells by activating the Notch&#8208;signaling pathway exclusively.

Abstract
The mono&#8208;&#945;&#8208;arylation of 2&#8208;tetrahydropyranyl O&#8208;protection of hydroxyacetone is reported. When using a catalyst system comprised of [Pd(cinnamyl)Cl]2 and the JosiPhos ligands PhPF&#8208;tBu or (4&#8208;CF3Ph)PF&#8208;tBu, such transformations are achieved with ortho&#8208;substituted aryl bromides and triflates in the presence of potentially contending functionalities including chloro groups.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Olefinic C(sp2)&#8722;H Activation/Carbene Insertion/Ester Hydrolysis/Cyclization with Aryl Diazo Esters for the Synthesis of Multisubstituted Furanones</title>

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed olefinic C(sp2)&#8722;H activation/carbene insertion/ester hydrolysis/cyclization sequence has been developed for the synthesis of substituted 2(5H)&#8208;furanones employing readily available enaminones and aryl diazo esters as substrates. This method features operationally simple and good functional group tolerance. The transformation could be scaled up to gram quantities and the obtained 2(5H)&#8208;furanone derivatives could be easily converted to a wide range of useful synthetic building blocks, indicative of the applicability of the synthetic strategy. Isotope labeling experiments demonstrated the ester group of diazo esters was hydrolyzed during the reaction.

         <title>Zinc Chelate Complexes of N&#8208;Acyl Hydrazones as Substrates for Addition of Alkyl and Fluorinated Radicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Zinc chelate complexes can be generated in&#8197;situ from N&#8208;acyl hydrazones by treatment with isopropyl zinc iodide. These complexes couple with alkyl and fluorinated radicals under photoredox conditions. Alkyl radicals were generated from organozinc halides using an organic photocatalyst and afford hydrazines as a result of reductive mode of addition. Fluorinated radicals were formed from perfluorinated alkyl iodides under photoredox conditions leading to fluoroalkylated hydrazones via neutral reaction pathway.

         <title>C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage of &#945;&#8208;Pyridinium Amides: A Synthetic Approach to Hydantoin Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
This study reports a mild reaction&#8208;condition approach for the direct C&#8722;C bond cleavage of amides to form hydantoin structures in the presence of 4&#8208;methylpyridine and a base. This approach presents an amide C&#8722;C bond cleavage strategy enabling nucleophilic addition to the amide carbonyl involving a reactive spiro intermediate. A broad spectrum of pseudo peptide Ugi adducts as bifunctional starting materials was synthesized and used in this transformation. The mechanistic pathway of this reaction was investigated using experimental and theoretical studies.

Abstract
This work describes the palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective C8&#8208;H olefination of 1&#8208;naphthamides. Interestingly, naphthamide fused lactam 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[de]isoquinolin&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives were also synthesized in the case of a particular class of napthamides. This protocol was found well compatible with a diverse range of acrylates and styrenes leading to product formation in good yields along with a wide functional group tolerance. The developed strategy was further applied to the synthesis of different drug derivatives.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H Bond Aminosulfonylation of Maleimides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed direct C(sp2)&#8722;H bond aminosulfonylation of maleimides is demonstrated. This protocol enables concurrent construction of C(sp2)&#8722;N and C(sp2)&#8722;SO2 bonds in one&#8208;step and features high efficiency, broad substrate scopes, good functional&#8208;group tolerance, and mild reaction conditions. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction probably involves a radical way. Significantly, this method is applicable to synthesize derivatives of pharmaceuticals such as Desloratadine, Fluoxetine, Atomoxetine, and Maprotiline.

Abstract
We found that gold nanoparticles function as single&#8208;electron transfer catalysts to promote decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling between N&#8208;hydroxy phthalimide esters and disilanes or diborons. A variety of disilanes coupled with alkyl radicals could be generated from N&#8208;hydroxy phthalimide esters via single&#8208;electron reduction by active carbon&#8208;supported gold nanoparticle catalysts to afford diverse alkylsilanes without the need for external bases. Furthermore, the present gold catalytic system was also effective for decarboxylative carbon&#8208;boron coupling to afford alkyl boronates. A detailed mechanistic investigation revealed that single&#8208;electron transfer mediated by supported gold nanoparticles enabled the generation of alkyl radical and silyl radical, thereby enabling radical cross&#8208;coupling. The reusability and environmentally&#8208;friendly nature of supported gold catalyst as well as the scalability of the reaction system enable the practical transformation of carboxylic acid derivatives into value&#8208;added organosilicon and organoboron compounds.

Abstract
A concise and flexible protocol to assemble structurally diverse 1H&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]quinoline&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;diones (29 examples, 70&#8211;87% yields) has been developed via one&#8208;pot stepwise synthesis. The potentially valuable quinine&#8208;fused heterocycles were synthetized by utilizing aliphatic alcohol hydroxyl as directing group which promoted a sequential transformation to form functionalized aminomaleimides, and then underwent an I2&#8208;oxidized tandem annulations. This route involved the formation of multiple new chemical bonds (C=N, 2C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C) in a one&#8208;pot fashion under mild conditions.

Abstract
We present here an iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidative Csp3&#8722;Csp3 bond cleavage of unstrained tertiary alkyl aromatics to provide a range of synthetically useful arylketones even with H2O2 as the oxidant. This method is operationally simple, scalable, and eco&#8208;friendly, as well as suitable for the late&#8208;stage oxidation of complex molecules bearing hydroxy groups, making it a valuable tool in organic synthesis.

         <title>Harnessing the Power of the De Mayo Reaction: Unveiling a Photochemical and Photocatalytic Masked [2+2] Methodology for Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. In 1962, Paul J. de Mayo initially described the photochemical reaction involving 1,3&#8208;diketones and double bonds, resulting in the formation of 1,5&#8208;diketones. Since then, this reaction has been extensively utilized for the synthesis of a wide range of fascinating natural products. Over time, this synthetic methodology has been applied to various carbonyl systems, including locked enol&#8208;tautomers of diketones, &#946;&#8208;keto esters, and &#946;&#8208;enaminones. Additionally, it has found application in other unsaturated systems such as allenes and alkynes.
In this review article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the classical de Mayo reaction, highlighting its scope and potential. Furthermore, we focus on recent advances achieved 	through photocatalytic conditions. Special emphasis is placed on the regioselectivity of the process and the underlying reaction mechanism, particularly within the context of photocatalysis.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the present study, for the first time environmentally friendly deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are used as reaction media to perform an efficient, simple and straightforward photocatalytic amide synthesis at room temperature using thioacids and amines. This method features mild conditions, a broad substrate scope, high yields (&#8804;99%) under ambient conditions with air and moisture tolerance. Moreover, the applied operationally mild reaction conditions tolerate the presence of several different functional group substituents on the amine counterpart. Finally, the developed approach allows the recycling of the reaction medium and catalyst for at least three consecutive cycles without a significant decrease in the reaction yield</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The potential of phosphites as nucleophiles for the synthesis of chiral chromene derivatives has been overlooked in the literature. Herein, we report a promising approach via asymmetric organocatalyzed phospha&#8208;Michael addition to iminochromenes, using a bifunctional squaramide, which gives access to chromenylphosphonates, an interesting family of bioactive compounds. Our optimized protocol provides very good reactivity, affording yields of up to 95% and with chiral products exhibiting an enantiomeric excess of up to 98%.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We have developed an electrochemical reaction for the synthesis of 3&#8208;selenylchromones and deutero&#8208;selenylated chalcones of alkynyl aryl ketones. This method is free from metal catalysts and oxidants, and is regulated by solvents. The reaction conditions are mild, and a wide range of substrates can be employed to produce selenylated chromones and deutero&#8208;selenylated chalcones, displaying potential anti&#8208;inflammatory activities. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the applicability of this approach for the late&#8208;stage deutero&#8208;selenylation of the drug molecule, metochalcone.</dc:description>

         <title>Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Hydration/C&#8211;F Bond Cleavage of Fluorinated Diazoalkanes Enabling Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates</title>

         <dc:description>(&#946;&#8208;Diazo&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroethyl)phosphonates have been emerging as useful building blocks in organic synthetic chemistry in recent years, which can be used as diazo analog or masked carbene for the rapid assembly of difluoromethylene phosphonate&#8208;containing compounds. Herein, we elaborate a method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates from hydration/C&#8211;F bond cleavage of in situ generated (&#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroethyl)phosphonates via a Rh&#8208;carbene intermediate. Divers (&#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroethyl)phosphonates are tolerated in this reaction affording &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates in good yields. This reaction used the in situ generated water as the coupling partner, which represents a reaction of (&#946;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroethyl)phosphonates and also a method for generating bioactive &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions between 1,5&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;ols and nitrones to deliver carbazole derivatives are described. Such cascade reactions are applicable to facile synthesis of polyaromatic compounds containing carbazole subunits. Notably, the reaction mechanism involves unexpected oxoarylations, rather than oxidative Mannich reactions as known for but&#8208;1&#8208;yn&#8208;4&#8208;ols. Our control experiments indicate that the presence of a second alkyne as in 1,5&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;ols enables such oxoarylations due to a weak bonding between gold and this alkyne, rending the tethered alcohol less conformationally flexible.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A variety of functionalized 2&#8208;pyrrolidinones bearing N&#8208;trifluoromethylphenyl moieties were prepared in moderate to good yields with high diastereoselectivity through copper(II)&#8208;catalyst and base co&#8208;catalyzed formal [4+1] cycloaddition of cinnamaldehyde nitrones with 1&#8208;ethynylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ols in the presence of m&#8208;CPBA as the oxidant. The triple bond of 1&#8208;ethynylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol served as one&#8208;carbon synthon for the pyrrolidinone ring formation. Mechanistic studies revealed that m&#8208;CPBA played an important role to interrupt the intramolecular O&#8208;cyclization to afford the 2&#8208;pyrrolidinones. Moreover, the reaction could be easily performed at gram scales and the obtained products were selectively converted into diverse pyrroline scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Access to Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;Aminothiophenes via Regio&#8208; and Chemoselective Domino Reactions of Dithioesters with Fumaronitrile at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot viable protocol to synthesize tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;aminothiophenes engaging readily accessible &#945;&#8208;enolic dithioesters and abundant fumaronitrile under metal&#8208;free conditions at room temperature in open air. The reaction proceeds via successive Michael&#8208;type addition/intramolecular cyclization/isomerization cascades. The added features are benign conditions, exclusive regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity, excellent atom&#8208;/step&#8208;economy, easy purification, and tolerance of wide range of functional groups of a diverse electronic and steric nature. This protocol not only provided a robust and modular approach to various 2&#8208;aminothiophenes in moderate to excellent yields, but also demonstrated the potential of dithioesters and fumaronitrile in the challenging intermolecular 100% atom&#8208;economic cross&#8208;coupling reactions widening the arsenal of synthetic methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Direct Intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H Alkylation of Saccharides and Switching of Reaction Sites by Changing Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
We developed a site&#8208;selective intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation of saccharides with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes using photocatalysis by anthraquinone and tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT). The main reaction site of anthraquinone&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation is determined by the weakness of the C&#8722;H bond. The reaction site can be switched by changing the photocatalyst to TBADT, and the site&#8208;selectivity is controlled by the steric hindrance between the bulkier TBADT photocatalyst and the substituents of the saccharides. The reaction is compatible with several electron&#8208;deficient alkenes and saccharides, and provides C&#8208;saccharides in good yields. Furthermore, the monoalkylated product was obtained in excellent yield, even on the gram scale, under TBADT photocatalysis. Applicability was demonstrated by site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation of glycosyl derivatives. The reactions proceed via a site&#8208;selective hydrogen atom transfer between the photocatalyst and saccharide, and the generated carbon radical reacts with an electron&#8208;deficient alkene to give alkylated products.

Abstract
Chiral aza&#8208;heterocycles, as a sort of key frameworks of natural products et al, are deeply concerned by synthetic chemists. In recent years, catalytic asymmetric reactions of several types of zwitterionic intermediates, originating form benzoxazinone derivatives, have become a popular and efficient approach to obtain chiral aza&#8208;heterocycles. Given that, this review attempts to summarize recent development in the field of catalytic asymmetric reactions of benzoxazinone derivatives as a powerful dipole precursors for the construction of aza&#8208;heterocycles. In the past years, various benzoxazinone derivatives and their catalytic asymmetric reactions have been developed. Herein, this review is organized by the types of benzoxazinone derivatives and their catalytic asymmetric reactions to display their important synthetic potentials and values.

         <title>Quaternary Ammonium Salts: Catalysts for Hydrosilylation of Alkynes with Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixing i&#8208;PrI and DABCO in solvent EtCN gave two quaternary ammonium salts (QASs) quantitatively, one of which is monocationic (QAS&#8208;1) and the other is dicationic (QAS&#8208;2). These QASs were found to catalyze hydrosilylation of alkynes with hydrosilanes (HAH) without the aid of metal and metalloid catalysts. This organocatalysis can be applied to a variety of alkynes: terminal/internal aryl and alkyl alkynes with/without a functional group. With dihydrosilanes (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si), the HAH occurred with high E&#8208;selectivity through syn addition, which was exclusively observed when using terminal alkyl alkynes, irrespective of a hydrosilane used. A scalable HAH is also feasible. The H&#8208;Si unit remaining in alkenylsilanes derived from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si is available for dehydrogenative alkynylation and N&#8208;heteroarylation under zinc&#8208;pyridine catalysis. This synthetic application delivers unique silicon compounds that have, for instance, alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, and alkynyl groups in a single molecule. Mechanistic studies suggested that alkynes activated by QASs irreversibly react with hydrosilanes that become more nucleophilic by the coordination of EtCN. A radical pathway is unlikely. The QAS catalysts can be recovered and reused at least 5 times.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances and Development in Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Glycosylation: An Expanding Research Area in Glycochemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
In the last fifteen years, the development of visible&#8208;light photocatalysis, metal/photoredox dual catalysis has become the forefront as a new paradigm in organic synthesis as well as in carbohydrate chemistry. It led to the discovery of unprecedented transformations and also the improvement of known reactions under mild conditions, employing simple household light sources and bench&#8208;stable precursors, which meet the requirements of green chemistry and sustainable development in excellent yield and stereocontrol. In a general sense, the exploitation of photoredox catalysis hinges on the capability of photocatalyst or redox mediator to transform visible light into chemical energy via photo&#8208;irradiated SET (single electron transfer), PET (photoinduced electron transfer), HAT (hydrogen atom transfer), and XAT (halogen atom transfer) to potentially unlock unique reaction pathways, thereby generating a diverse array of reactive intermediates. In view of reaction type, mechanism, and status, this review will systematically summarize the latest advances in visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photocatalytic glycosylation reactions, which are driven by single or dual photoredox catalysis and by the photoactivity of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes.

Although the catalytic asymmetric construction of these highly congested centers poses a formidable challenge, this field has been extensively explored in the past few decades, and several elegant strategies, such as the asymmetric conjugate addition to &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted nitroalkenes, have been developed. The resultant &#946;&#8208;nitro quaternary stereocenters can be conveniently transformed into the corresponding &#946;&#8208;amino quaternary stereocenters commonly found in bioactive compounds. This review summarizes the recent advances in the construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary or hetero&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via metal&#8208;catalyzed and organocatalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition to &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted nitroalkenes, focusing on the scope, applications, and mechanisms of these reactions.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective, Intramolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition of Allenes, Promoted by Visible Light Photocatalysis</title>

Abstract
Enallenylamides have been utilized for the synthesis of heterobicycle[4.2.0]octane derivatives via Ir/h&#957; promoted [2+2] cycloaddition reaction. The reaction specifically targets the distal double bond of the allene moiety, and results in the exclusive formation of the trans product. The process is conducted at room temperature and under an inert atmosphere. An extensive study on the substituent propensities during the cycloaddition step revealed variable effects. Electron&#8208;withdrawing groups conjugated with the double bond participating in the cycloaddition either hindered the process or reduced its yield. Conversely, electron&#8208;donating substituents enhanced the efficiency, resulting in product yields ranging from 60% to 88%. Our study also demonstrated the influence of protecting groups on the reaction pathway.

The use of inorganic base additives such as cesium carbonate in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 as a phase transfer catalyst was crucial to induce high reactivity. Control experiments revealed that the basic additives might not only facilitate high&#8208;turnover hypoiodite catalysis, but also be involved in the activation of coupling partners.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An azidobenziodoxole (BIN3)&#8208;mediated tunable radical reaction system for selective chlorination and bromination of tertiary and secondary C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds of alkyl substrates using haloform as the halogen donor was developed. Reactions of various substrates with BIN3 under visible light irradiation without any photo or metal catalysts gave C&#8211;H chlorinated or brominated products. These reactions are selective, and compatible with many functional groups. Mechanistic studies suggest that haloform serves as the halogen atom donor and HN3 generated in situ from the reaction of BIN3 and water relays the radical chain reaction as the hydrogen atom donor. HN3 reacts with CHX2&#8226; to form CH2X2 and N3&#8226;, which propagates a radical chain by abstracting a hydrogen atom of the alkane substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Photochemical Flow Synthesis of Structurally Diverse Benzyne and Triazine Precursors</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Benzyne and related arynes are classical high&#8208;energy species with a rich history of widespread applications in synthesis. However, despite several synthetic routes being available to generate arynes and their precursors, none represents an ideal entry to benzyne chemistry in view of safety, scalability, and sustainability. Here we report a new photochemical flow process allowing for the generation of benzyne precursors in high yields, and throughput, with easy isolation of multigram quantities of products. This process leverages a catalyst&#8208;free photochemical rearrangement via a photoexcited nitro arene which involves a cyclic hydroxylamine intermediate that has been fully characterized. The resulting precursors were converted to benzynes via a second photochemical flow process generating heterocyclic targets upon trapping with azide and sydnone partners. Remarkably, when reacting the benzyne precursors with secondary amines, a wide range of aryl triazines is obtained in good yields via a third photo&#8208;flow transformation. This represents a modular approach to synthesize these species, that avoids the use of potentially explosive diazonium salts. Ultimately, three photochemical flow processes using a single high&#8208;power LED light source (365&#8197;nm, adjustable in&#8208;put power) are presented with manifest benefits compared to batch processing. Moreover, the functionalization of a pendent carboxyl group to form sets of biologically relevant aryl triazine&#8208;based amides highlights further applications of these unique and industrially relevant triazine entities.

Moreover, the functionalization of a pendent carboxyl group to form sets of biologically relevant aryl triazine-based amides highlights further applications of these unique and industrially relevant triazine entities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Radical&#8208;Mediated Hydroperfluoroalkylation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The direct hydroperfluoroalkylation of a wide range of unactivated alkenes has been achieved at room temperature with readily available iodoperfluoroalkanes using 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcatechol as a source of hydrogen atom and triethylborane. The hydrotrifluoromethylation could also be achieved under these conditions using gaseous trifluoromethyl iodide. An experimentally simple two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot hydrotrifluoromethylation process using the easy&#8208;to&#8208;use trifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride as the source of trifluoromethyl radicals has also been developed. Using these two approaches, a broad range of substrates, including isoprenoid natural products, were efficiently derivatized.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Homoallylamines from Unactivated Imines and Allyl Bromides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed umpolung strategy for the synthesis of homoallylamines from unactivated imines and allyl bromides is described. This strategy exploited N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) as an auxiliary agent to indirectly realize the cross&#8208;coupling of imines and allyl bromides. Various sterically hindered homoallylamines were synthesized by combining photocatalysis with halogen atom transfer (XAT). Notable characteristics of this approach include water&#8208;insensitive reaction conditions, high yield (up to 99%), wide substrate scope (suitable for N&#8208;aryl/alkyl and C&#8208;aryl ketimines and aldimines, 39 examples), and high tolerance of functional groups (such as cyano, ester, amide, and thioamide).

Abstract
Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular cyclization of 2&#8208;amidoazulene derivatives, prepared by the reaction of 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;aminoazulene derivatives with perfluoroalkyl acid anhydrides, resulted in the formation of 2&#8208;perfluoroalkylazuleno[2,1&#8208;d]pyrimidin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones. Heating of these products in phosphoryl chloride led to 4&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;perfluoroalkylazuleno[2,1&#8208;d]pyrimidines. We also evaluated the reactivity of these pyrimidin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones and pyrimidine derivatives toward the electrophilic and nucleophilic substitution reactions, revealing that a variety of functional groups can be incorporated into these derivatives. The NMR studies, NICS calculations, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analyses revealed structural features including the bond&#8208;length alternation of the azuleno[2,1&#8208;d]pyrimidin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones and pyrimidine derivatives.

Abstract
A general method for the functionalization of 4a&#8208;aza&#8208;8a&#8208;boranaphthalene in the position &#946; to the nitrogen atom has been developed. This method is based on a regioselective iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation process for the introduction of a boronate group, which can subsequently be transformed into a variety of aryl or alkynyl groups via cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Selective mono&#8208; or difunctionalization can be achieved by controlling the reaction conditions during the borylation step. The photophysical properties of the obtained 3&#8208; or 3,6&#8208;substituted BN&#8208;naphthalenes have been evaluated, and some of them have been found to be significantly fluorescent, with fluorescence quantum yields up to 0.85.

Abstract
A step&#8208;economical and operationally simple nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of aryl phosphates with aryl bromides through C&#8722;O bond cleavage, which precluded the employment of relatively moisture&#8208;labile and unreadily available organometallics, was developed. The reaction proceeded smoothly in the presence of magnesium turnings and lithium chloride in THF to afford the corresponding biaryls in moderate to good yields with reasonable functionality tolerance.

Abstract
Herein, Bi(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type annulation of sulfonyl o&#8208;hydroxyacetophenones with benzofused cycloethers is described. This single&#8208;step strategy provides a variety of functionalized dibenzofused medium&#8208;size (9&#8211;12) oxacycles through the formation of carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;oxygen single bonds. Further, the oxidative application of target oxacycles was investigated. The chemical structures of the key products were determined based on the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. In the overall process, water was generated as the byproduct.

         <title>Cu(III) Trifluoromethyl Complexes with 1,3&#8208;Diketonate Ligands and Their Versatile Reactivity in C&#8211;H Trifluoromethylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;valent Cu(III) trifluoromethyl complexes with 1,3&#8208;diketonates as bidentate oxygen donor ligands LCuIII(CF3)2 were prepared for the first time and fully characterized, including by X&#8208;ray crystallography. These complexes are bench stable and soluble in most organic solvents. Promising reactivity of Cu(III) trifluoromethyl diketonates in radical and radical&#8211;polar crossover trifluoromethylation reactions was demonstrated. Direct C&#8211;H trifluoromethylation of electron&#8208;rich arenes and indoles using Cu(III) trifluoromethyl diketonates under blue light irradiation is described. Azolo&#8208; and oxy&#8208;trifluoromethylation of terminal alkynes and S&#8208;trifluoromethylation of aromatic thiol can be achieved using LCuIII(CF3)2 in mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>3H&#8208;Phenothiazin&#8208;3&#8208;one: A New Photocatalyst for the Aerobic Photochemical Oxidation of Sulfides to Sulfoxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aerobic photochemistry is a rapidly advancing field that provides sustainable solutions for traditional transformations. In this study, 3H&#8208;phenothiazin&#8208;3&#8208;one is identified as a photocatalyst for the photochemical oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides. This new photocatalytic method uses a low catalyst loading (0.05 mol%), molecular oxygen as the sole oxidant, and a blue LED lamp as the irradiation source. It can be applied to the oxidation of both alkyl&#8208;aryl and alkyl&#8208;alkyl sulfides. Moreover, the method is also applicable in the synthesis of the known pharmaceutically active compounds Modafinil and Sulforaphane.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Tetraazamacrocycles by Sequential Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Substitution Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we focused on the synthesis of tetraazamacrocycles, an essential class of macrocyclic compounds with applications in coordination chemistry, pharmaceuticals, and catalysis. To accomplish this, we developed a ligand&#8208;controlled palladium&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution approach using bicyclic bridgehead phosphoramidite (briphos) ligands. This approach allowed us to selectively achieve [1 + 1] and [1 + 2] allylic aminations between allylic diols and diamines, while avoiding the formation of cyclic [1 + 1] products. By combining this approach with sequential acetylation and allylic amination, we successfully synthesized tetraazamacrocycles with ring sizes ranging from 16 to 38. These findings demonstrate the potential of a sequential allylation strategy for synthesizing complex molecules with broad applications in the fields of chemistry, pharmaceuticals, and medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Trivalent Phosphine&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions Using Fluorinated Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The development of novel synthetic methodologies to incorporate fluorine/s or fluoroalkyl group/s into the frameworks of organic molecules has become a highly prioritized research area because such modifications can tune their physiochemical and biological properties. In recent years, nucleophilic phosphine catalysis has been extensively explored to achieve this goal, and significant progress has been made.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of novel synthetic methodologies to incorporate fluorine/s or fluoroalkyl group/s into the frameworks of organic molecules has become a highly prioritized research area because such modifications can tune their physiochemical and biological properties. In recent years, nucleophilic phosphine catalysis has been extensively explored to achieve this goal, and significant progress has been made. This review summarizes the methodological advancements of cycloaddition, addition and coupling reactions employing fluorinated building blocks as electrophilic and/or nucleophilic reaction partners under phosphine catalysis to construct structurally and synthetically valuable organofluorine compounds, with special emphasis on the synthetic strategies, proposed reaction mechanisms and synthetic utilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This inside cover picture illustrates how the developed saccharin&#8208;based electrophilic reagents can incorporate SCH2CF3 and SCH2CF2H motifs into electronically rich substrates such as indole or pyrrole under mild and direct conditions. These reactions are favored by the presence of trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) and exhibit high compatibility with water, enabling open&#8208;flask reactions. Moreover, they allow access to sulfone derivatives, providing agrochemical modification, among others. Details can be found in the Communication by Omar Boutureira and co&#8208;workers (P. Casas&#250;s, J. Mestre, M. Bern&#250;s, S. Castill&#243;n, O. Boutureira, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2023, 365, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202300586)

         <dc:description>
The front cover picture, designed by Yoshimura, illustrates applications of benziodoxoles as group transfer reagents. Cyclic hypervalent iodine compounds based on the benziodoxole system have higher stability compared to their acyclic analogues, which makes possible the preparation and safe handling of the reagents with special ligands such as azido, cyano, and trifluoromethyl groups. Substituted benziodoxoles have been widely utilized as reagents for transfer of the substituent on hypervalent iodine to organic substrates. Details can be found in the Review Article by Akira Yoshimura, Akio Saito, and Viktor Zhdankin (A. Yoshimura, A. Saito, V. V. Zhdankin, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2023, 365, xxxx&#8208;xxxx; DOl: 10.1002/adsc.202300275)

Abstract
Two saccharine&#8208;based electrophilic reagents were developed for the direct introduction of SCH2CF3 and SCH2CF2H motifs via a C&#8722;S bond forming reaction. Their large&#8208;scale preparation and reactivity performance has been carefully examined, enabling access to a series of indoles through open&#8208;flask reactions. Sulfone and sulfoxide analogs (S(O)nCH2RF, n=1,2) are also accessible by sequential oxidation reactions.

         <title>Catalytic Difluoromethylation of Alkenes with Difluoroacetic Anhydride: Reactivity of Fluorinated Diacyl Peroxides and Radicals.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates the difluoromethylation of alkenes with bis(difluoroacetyl) peroxide (BDFAP), which is easily preparable from difluoroacetic anhydride and hydrogen peroxide. The use of a copper catalyst enables amino&#8208;, allylic, and oxy&#8208;difluoromethylation under thermal conditions. Moreover, metal&#8208;free carbo&#8208;difluoromethylation of an alkene bearing a pendant aromatic group takes place through a radical chain mechanism. Computational investigations shed light on the unique reactivity of BDFAP and the difluoromethyl radical. Details can be found in Research Article by Shintaro Kawamura, Mikiko Sodeoka and co&#8208;workers (T. Tagami, Y. Mitani, S. Kawamura, M. Sodeoka, Adv. Synth.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Transformations Involving the Heck Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Elaborated molecular architectures including complex carbocycles, heterocycles, and polycyclic molecular structures represent an important class of organic compounds because they are ubiquitous structural units in a broad variety of biologically and pharmacologically relevant natural products, medicinal molecules, and functional materials. A major challenge in modern synthetic methodology is the development of strategically efficient and selective construction of these compounds from readily available starting materials. Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations involving Heck reaction as the pivotal step have afforded a powerful approach for accessing sophisticated polycyclic skeletons from a set of easy&#8208;to handle starting materials, thus highlighting its potential significance in streamlining the drug discovery process. Over the past few decades, significant effort has been devoted to accessing complex polycyclic derivatives in efficient and versatile routes, and a number of powerful and direct synthetic strategies have been reported. In this review, the latest advances in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations involving Heck reaction as the critical step are summarized, which could be divided into six categories: 1) Heck/Sonogashira tandem reaction; 2) Heck/Suzuki tandem reaction; 3) Heck/Heck tandem reaction; 4) Heck/Hiyama tandem reaction; 5) Heck/Cacchi tandem reaction; 6) Heck/C&#8722;H bond functionalization tandem reaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elaborated molecular architectures including complex carbocycles, heterocycles, and polycyclic molecular structures represent an important class of organic compounds because they are ubiquitous structural units in a broad variety of biologically and pharmacologically relevant natural products, medicinal molecules, and functional materials. A major challenge in modern synthetic methodology is the development of strategically efficient and selective construction of these compounds from readily available starting materials. Transition-metal-catalyzed transformations involving Heck reaction as the pivotal step have afforded a powerful approach for accessing sophisticated polycyclic skeletons from a set of easy-to handle starting materials, thus highlighting its potential significance in streamlining the drug discovery process. Over the past few decades, significant effort has been devoted to accessing complex polycyclic derivatives in efficient and versatile routes, and a number of powerful and direct synthetic strategies have been reported. In this review, the latest advances in transition-metal-catalyzed transformations involving Heck reaction as the critical step are summarized, which could be divided into six categories: 1) Heck/Sonogashira tandem reaction; 2) Heck/Suzuki tandem reaction; 3) Heck/Heck tandem reaction; 4) Heck/Hiyama tandem reaction; 5) Heck/Cacchi tandem reaction; 6) Heck/C&#8722;H bond functionalization tandem reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Fluorinated Substrates as Michael Acceptors Towards Fine Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Michael addition reaction, known since the 19th century, appeared as a relevant method with a great potential to design new organofluorinated fine chemicals and enlarged their structural diversity. In the Michael addition reaction for the synthesis of organofluorine compounds, the fluorinated blocks can be both used as the Michael donors and acceptors, but the latter is relatively rare. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the use of fluorinated substrates as Michael acceptors in Michael reactions.

         <title>Hypervalent Halogen Compounds in Electrochemical Reactions: Advantages and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The clean and facile electrochemical synthesis of hypervalent iodine reagents is a fast growing field. In the past 5&#8197;years, a diverse number of reaction types have been established, from fluorinations, oxidative cyclizations, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;H couplings and oxidations. Electrochemistry is beneficial in terms of sustainability as the requirement for chemical oxidants is eliminated. This contributes to cleaner processes with limited by&#8208;product waste. Often, the purification of iodine(III) compounds is simple, since electrolysis is performed in the absence stoichiometric oxidants. Significant breakthroughs have been made recently, including the first asymmetric application, electrocatalytic applications, and even the synthesis of bromine(III) reagents using similar methodologies.

         <title>Continuous Synthesis of Epoxides from Alkenes by Hydrogen Peroxide with Titanium Silicalite&#8208;1 Catalyst Using Flow Reactors</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Abstract. Continuous&#8208;flow epoxidation of aliphatic and aromatic alkenes with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was carried out to give epoxides using a fixed&#8208;bed liquid flow reactor equipped with a solid titanium silicalite&#8208;1 (TS&#8208;1) catalyst column. The developed flow reaction enables continuous synthesis of 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;epoxybutane from 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;butene in 90%&#8211;98% yields (22.4&#8197;g) for 150&#8197;h from a catalyst column of 5&#8197;mm inner diameter with 100&#8197;mm length. Employment of a mixed solution of MeCN and MeOH with preservation of the Ti active site in TS&#8208;1 crystal structures with few defects permits continuous epoxidation of less&#8208;reactive long&#8208;chain terminal alkene and multifunctional alkene to give epoxides in 12%&#8211;98% yields with 78%&#8211;99% selectivity.

         <title>Palladium and Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts Acylation with Activated Amides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation reaction between activated amides and arenes was carried out by employing [Pd(cinnamyl)Cl]2 and Cu(OTf)2 as catalysts. A range of N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;N&#8208;tosylbenzamides, which were substituted at the phenyl ring of the benzamide moiety, underwent reaction with various arenes, such as mesitylene, toluene, anisole, 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzene, o&#8208;xylene, m&#8208;xylene, and p&#8208;xylene, affording the corresponding diaryl ketones with yields ranging from 49% to 89%.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free O&#8208;Arylation of N&#8208;Alkoxybenzamides Enabled by Aryl(trimethoxyphenyl)iodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we develop a metal catalyst&#8208;free protocol for O&#8208;arylation of benzamide hydroxamate esters. The chemoselective O&#8208; versus N&#8208;arylation of the amides was tuned by varying the electronic and/or steric properties of the diaryliodonium salt and/or the substrate. The O&#8208;arylation reaction would preferentially occur for sterically and electronically diverse substrates. This study, which reveals the possibility of substituent&#8208; and reagent&#8208;controlled chemoselectivity, with diaryliodonium salts might attract interest in the area of hypervalent iodine chemistry.

         <title>Synthesis of Dibenzo[b,f]azepines via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade [4 + 3] Annulation of o&#8208;Alkenyl Bromoarenes and o&#8208;Bromoaniline Derivatives</title>

Abstract
A cascade [4+3] annulation of o&#8208;alkenyl bromoarenes and o&#8208;bromoaniline derivatives was described. Various dibenzo[b,f]azepines with substitutions on the 10/11 position were obtained in 14&#8211;97% yields. The synthetic versatility of this protocol is highlighted by the preparation of a precursor of the drug molecule oxcarbazepine, a gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and two product transformations. Unlike previous amination/Heck sequence, this cascade process is supposed to undergo a C(vinyl), C(aryl)&#8208;palladacycle involved pathway.

Treating 2&#8208;acetyl&#8208;1&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;1&#955;3&#8208;benzo[d][1,2]iodazol&#8208;3&#8208;one 1&#8201;f with sliver cyanate in dried chloroform was found to give hypervalent isocyanato&#8208;iodine(III) reagent 5 in excellent yield, while the oxo&#8208;bridged 1,1&#8242;&#8208;oxybis(2&#8208;acetyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;1&#955;3&#8208;benzo[d][1,2]iodaz&#8208;ol&#8208;3&#8208;one) 6 was obtained when a mixture of chloroform and water was used as solvent. Structure of these two hypervalent iodine reagents were established by X&#8208;ray crystallography and their reaction with base, aniline, methanol and cyclic ether were investigated. A previously reported 1&#8208;cyanato benziodoxole compound was revisited and its structure was revised.

         <title>Dibenzoylperoxide as a Versatile Oxidant for Oxidative Azidations of Phenols Using Quaternary Ammonium Iodides or Bromides.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Dibenzoylperoxide emerged as a versatile oxidant for quaternary ammonium iodide or bromide&#8208;catalyzed reactions of phenol derivatives with NaN3. While the use of iodides allowed for efficient benzylic azidations under these oxidative conditions, the use of bromides allowed for dearomative azidations instead. Both approaches have been successfully applied to different phenol derivatives and a first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for an enantioselective variant using chiral quat. ammonium bromides has been obtained as well.

         <title>Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Organocatalytic Synthesis of Spirocyclopropyl Pyrazolones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of spirocyclopropylpyrazolones has been described through a Michael/alkylation cascade reaction of 4&#8208;arylidenepyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones with diethyl 2&#8208;bromomalonate catalyzed by (DHQ)2AQN. The reaction afforded selectively the corresponding spirocyclic compounds with 30&#8211;83% yield, diastereoselectivities ranging from 60:40 to &gt;95:5 and 26&#8211;93% enantiomeric excess under mild reaction conditions. Moreover, we performed two selective transformations with the corresponding chiral compounds.

         <title>Computational Insights into the Reactivity Difference between Hypervalent Bromine(III) and Hypervalent Iodine(III) Reagent in the C&#8722;H Amination and Alkene Aziridination</title>

Abstract
We present herein a computational exploration into the mechanism and origin of the reactivity difference between N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodane and N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;bromane in the C&#8722;H amination and alkene aziridination. Our calculations revealed that the preferred mechanism for C&#8722;H amination involves the generation of free nitrene intermediate, while the alkene aziridination proceeds via a concerted reaction mechanism. The superior reactivity of N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;bromane over N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodane could be mainly ascribed to better nucleofugality of the bromanyl moiety, which can be characterized by the strength of I&#8722;N and Br&#8722;N bond. The effect of solvent polarity on the reactivity of N&#8208;triflylimino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;bromane as a nitrene precursor will be discussed.

         <title>Enantioselective Intramolecular Hydroacylation of Alkynes by Rhodium Catalysis through Dynamic Kinetic Resolution.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroacylation of racemic alkynals having a substituent at the &#945;&#8208;position of the carbonyl group. Mechanistic studies revealed that hydroacylation occurs preferentially from one enantiomer of the racemic substrate via a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process. The picture shows an outline of the DKR process by using an illustration of soccer, in which the player getting the good ball (i.&#8201;e., enantiomer) successfully scores a goal. Details can be found in the Communication by Yoshihiro Sato and co&#8208;workers (Y. Oonishi, K. Takagishi, Y.&#8208;M. Liu, Y. Sato, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2023, 365, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202300206).

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Aminopiperidines via I(III)&#8208;Mediated Olefin Diamination with (Hetero)aryl Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
3&#8208;Aminopiperidines are a valuable motif present in small molecule pharmaceuticals and bioactive natural products. Synthesis of these moieties via olefin diamination would be an attractive approach, however significant challenges remain with regards to both regioselectivity and exogenous nucleophile scope. Herein, we report a metal&#8208;free olefin diamination via a &#8220;heterocyclic group transfer&#8220; (HGT) reaction of I(III) N&#8208;HVI reagents, giving rise to 3&#8208;aminopiperidines with high selectivity. The HGT strategy leverages heteroarenes as oxidatively masked amine nucleophiles, giving rise to (hetero)arylonium salt products which are isolated via simple trituration and provide a versatile handle for downstream diversification. This represents only the second 6&#8208;endo selective I(III)&#8208;mediated diamination reaction and mechanistic studies indicate ring opening of an intermediate aziridinium ion is responsible for the 6&#8208;endo selectivity.

Abstract
The combination of the catalytic power of amorphous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (aMOFs) and biocatalysis has greatly boosted the development of novel synthetic strategies due to its functional diversity and stereospecificity. 2&#8208;Cyanoacrylamides are important building blocks for many biologically active molecules. Herein, we described a chemical&#8208;biological relay catalytic method to access (E)&#8208;2&#8208;cyanoacrylamides based on the catalysis of amorphous porphyrin&#8208;MOFs SPUZ&#8208;1 and whole cells of Rhodococcus rhodochrous (nitrile hydratase). The approach was proved to be simple and efficient, and the highest conversion was up to 99%

         <title>Discovery and Engineering of an Ene&#8208;reductase for Kinetic Resolution and Cascade Reduction of Hajos&#8208;Parrish/Wieland&#8208;Miescher Ketones</title>

Abstract
Ene&#8208;reductase (ERED)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones is an attractive method in organic synthesis. Through the discovery and further structure&#8208;guided protein engineering of BsER, an ERED from Bacillus subtilis, the selective bio&#8208;reduction of the well&#8208;known building blocks Hajos&#8208;Parrish ketone (HPK, 1&#8201;a) and Wieland&#8208;Miescher ketone (WMK, 1&#8201;b) was achieved in this study. The optically pure (R)&#8208;HPK ((R)&#8208;1&#8201;a) and (R)&#8208;WMK ((R)&#8208;1&#8201;b) with corresponding &gt;99% and 98% enantiomeric excess (ee) values were obtained by kinetic resolution of the racemic substrates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of ERED mediated kinetic resolution of rac&#8208;HPK and rac&#8208;WMK. In addition, the reduction products cis&#8208;7a&#8208;methylhexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;indene&#8208;1,5(4H)&#8208;dione (cis&#8208;2&#8201;a) and cis&#8208;8a&#8208;methylhexahydronaphtha&#8208; lene&#8208;1,6(2H,5H)&#8208;dione (cis&#8208;2&#8201;b) with high diastereomeric ratios (dr) were also obtained. We also developed four routes of biocatalytic cascade reduction involving BsER and ketoreductases (KREDs). Using optimized ERED&#8208;KRED and KRED&#8208;ERED cascades, (S)&#8208;HPK ((S)&#8208;1&#8201;a) and (S)&#8208;WMK ((S)&#8208;1&#8201;b) could be reduced stepwise, yielding the bioactive products all with &gt;91% purity. This study presents a biocatalytic strategy for the kinetic resolution and cascade reduction of HPK and WMK (1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b).

         <title>In situ Generated Copper(II)&#8208;Quinoline Complexes as Robust and Versatile Photocatalysts for the Chlorosulfonylation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A series of copper complexes was synthesized and studied as photocatalysts for the chlorosulfonylation of olefins. Featuring a tetradentate ligand consisting of one amino quinoline and two methyl pyridine moieties, the resulting Cu(II)&#8208;complex is effective under visible light irradiation to add sulfonyl chlorides to alkenes and alkynes, including unactivated aliphatic olefins. A weak base additive such as Na2CO3 prevents catalyst poisoning, resulting in an improvement of reaction yields and catalyst lifetime. A broad scope of sulfonyl chlorides and alkenes/alkynes as coupling partners are amenable for the title process, including examples previously reported unsuccessful with established copper&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Enantioselective Intramolecular Hydroacylation of Alkynes by Rhodium Catalysis through Dynamic Kinetic Resolution.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroacylation of racemic alkynals having a substituent at the &#945;&#8208;position of the carbonyl group. Mechanistic studies revealed that hydroacylation occurs preferentially from one enantiomer of the racemic substrate via a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process. The picture shows an outline of the DKR process by using an illustration of soccer, in which the player getting the good ball (i.&#8201;e., enantiomer) successfully scores a goal. Details can be found in the Communication by Yoshihiro Sato and co&#8208;workers (Y. Oonishi, K. Takagishi, Y.&#8208;M. Liu, Y. Sato, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2023, 365, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202300206).

         <title>Catalytic Difluoromethylation of Alkenes with Difluoroacetic Anhydride: Reactivity of Fluorinated Diacyl Peroxides and Radicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Given the importance of difluoromethylated molecules for drug and agrochemical development, much attention has been drawn to the establishment of related synthetic protocols, as exemplified by the CF2H radical&#8208;mediated catalytic difluoromethylation of alkenes. However, most of these difluoromethylations proceed under photocatalytic conditions, whereas those requiring thermal conditions are few. Herein, we developed a general and practical method of Cu&#8208;catalyzed alkene difluoromethylation with difluoroacetic anhydride (DFAA) as a CF2H source, showing that the thus realized amino&#8208;, allylic&#8208;, and oxy&#8208;difluoromethylations involve bis(difluoroacetyl) peroxide (BDFAP) in&#8197;situ generated from DFAA and H2O2 and further demonstrating the occurrence of carbo&#8208;difluoromethylation under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The obtained results pave the way to the simple and efficient synthesis of a broad range of difluoromethylated species and thus facilitate their practical applications, including those in medicinal and agricultural chemistry. Moreover, we probed the mechanisms of the observed transformations, rationalized the extraordinary fast decomposition of BDFAP compared to that of diacyl peroxides containing CF3 or CF2Cl groups, and performed DFT calculations to shed light on the low stability and decomposition mode of BDFAP. Finally, we examined the influence of fluorinated radical philicity on the reaction outcome.

         <title>Merging Continuous Flow Technology, Photochemistry and Biocatalysis to Streamline Steroid Synthesis</title>

Abstract
Since their structural elucidation in 1935, the introduction and substitution of functional groups and the modification of the steroidal scaffolds have been a fertile ground of research for synthetic and medicinal chemists. The discovery of steroids with hormonal and pharmacological activity has stimulated tremendous efforts to the development of highly selective and efficient synthetic procedures. Despite the progress made, steroid chemistry remains challenging and the preparation of steroidal compounds of pharmaceutical interests and in clinical practice, often requires long and elaborated synthesis. In recent years, a new impetus in the field came with the advent of enabling chemical technologies, such as continuous flow chemistry, which are exploited to overcome problems that arise from batch synthesis. Although it is still a niche sector, the use of flow technology in steroid synthesis and functionalization holds the premise to empower methodology development and to provide innovative tactics also for many hitherto uncharted chemistries. In this review, scientific contributions are reported and discussed in terms of flow set&#8208;up and advantages offered concerning process efficiency, optimization, waste minimization, safety improvement, easy scale&#8208;up and costs. We also highlight the main challenges, key improvements and the future trajectory in the application of continuous flow chemistry and its implementation to different disciplines such as photochemistry and biocatalysis with the ultimate goal of streamlining steroid synthesis.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Enabled Photo&#8208;Sulfonylation of Aryl Halides Using Alkylsulfinates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A photochemical synthetic method to access sulfones from aryl halides and sodium alkylsulfinates in the presence of CuCl is reported. Regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity for the sulfonylation is observed for polyhalogenated arenes. Mechanistic studies indicate that a copper sulfinate reagent is formed in&#8197;situ from CuCl and sodium sulfinate based on NMR experiments. Potential reaction intermediates, including excited state aryl halides are studied using density functional theory calculations and reveal energetically accessible non&#8208;planar triplet geometries.

Abstract
Herein, we report the &#945;&#8722;C&#8722;H acyloxylation of sulfides and disulfides enabled by hypervalent iodine(III) reagents via photoredox catalysis. The methoxylbenziodoxole derivatives serve as the hydrogen atom transfer agent, the mild oxidant, and the acyloxylation source in the reaction. External nucleophiles can also be introduced to the &#945;&#8722;C&#8722;H of sulfides. The reaction applies to various aryl and alkyl sulfides including methionine peptide derivatives. Disulfides are applicable for the first time with excellent chemoselectivity and functional group compatibility.

         <title>Advancements in the Synthesis of Diaryliodonium Salts: Updated Protocols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Our group has reported several one&#8208;pot protocols for the synthesis of diaryliodonium salts, which have been recognized as attractive multi&#8208;purpose reagents in areas ranging from organic synthesis to materials chemistry. Over the years, we have identified limitations in the published protocols concerning synthesis of mixed electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor, as well as highly electron&#8208;poor diaryliodonium salts, as the corresponding starting materials are either too reactive or too unreactive. In this update, we discuss the underlying limitations concerning the stability and reactivity of the involved reagents and provide strategies to overcome these challenges through updated synthetic protocols.

         <title>Enantioselective Intramolecular Hydroacylation of Alkynes by Rhodium Catalysis through Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroacylation of racemic alkynals having a substituent at the &#945;&#8208;position of the carbonyl group is described. This reaction can be applied for the wide range of substrates (22 examples), and mechanistic studies revealed that a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process occurs during the hydroacylation, giving various cyclic ketones in 47&#8211;93% yields with 59:41 to 97:3 er from racemic starting materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rhodium-catalyzed enantioselective hydroacylation of racemic alkynals having a substituent at the &#945;-position of the carbonyl group is described. This reaction can be applied for the wide range of substrates (22 examples), and mechanistic studies revealed that a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process occurs during the hydroacylation, giving various cyclic ketones in 47&#8211;93% yields with 59:41 to 97:3 er from racemic starting materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Recent Progress in Synthetic Applications of Cyclic Hypervalent Iodine(III) Reagents</title>

Abstract
Hypervalent iodine compounds have found broad application in modern organic chemistry as reagents and catalysts. Cyclic hypervalent iodine reagents based on the benziodoxole heterocyclic system have higher stability compared to their acyclic analogues, which makes possible the preparation and safe handling of the reagents with special ligands such as azido, cyano, and trifluoromethyl groups. Numerous iodine&#8208;substituted benziodoxole derivatives have been prepared and utilized as reagents for transfer of the substituent on hypervalent iodine to organic substrate. Reactions of these reagents with organic substrates can be performed under metal&#8208;free conditions, in the presence of transition metal catalysts, or using photocatalysts under photoirradiation conditions. In this review, we focus on the most recent synthetic applications of cyclic hypervalent iodine(III) reagents with the following ligands: N3, NHR, CN, CF3, SCF3, OR, OAc, ONO2, and C(=N2)CO2R. The review covers literature published mainly in the last 5&#8197;years.

Abstract
A new N&#8722;F reagent, N,N&#8242;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium bis(tetrafluoroborate), for iodoarene&#8208;catalyzed fluorination reactions as a terminal oxidant is reported. This reaction is effective for the fluorination of simple alkenes, aromatic alkenes and 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds, giving 1,2&#8208;difluorinated alkanes, geminal difluorinated compounds, 2&#8208;fluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds in good to high yields, respectively. This is a useful fluorination reaction that not only improves the issues of the fluorination reaction using conventional mCPBA as a terminal oxidant but also constructs a simpler catalytic cycle. The present N&#8722;F reagent can be recovered as 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine.

         <title>Synthesis of Fluoroalkylated Pyrrolidines through Neat Reaction of Fluoroalkyl Iodides with N, N&#8208;Diallylamines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
We presented a cascade transformation of N, N&#8208;diallylamines and fluoroalkyl iodides into various functionalized fluoroalkylated pyrrolidines through a visible light&#8208;induced synthetic process in the solvent&#8208;free conditions. In this reaction system, the substrate N, N&#8208;diallylamine acted both as the base and the electron donor. We further demonstrated the practicality of this protocol by the direct modification of amino acids and pharmaceutical molecules.

         <title>Multifaceted Domino Knoevenagel&#8208;Cyclization Reactions; Four Movements for 2H&#8208;Chromenes and Chromans</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Domino Knoevenagel&#8208;cyclization reactions of 2H&#8208;chromene and chroman derivatives containing o&#8208;formylaryl amine or ether side&#8208;chain was carried out to produce four series of chiral condensed heterocycles representing four novel skeletons and exhibiting antiproliferative activity. The cyclization step occurred with four different mechanisms: a concerted intramolecular hetero Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (IMHDA), a stepwise polar [2+2] cycloaddition, a [1,5]&#8208;hydride shift&#8208;6&#8208;endo cyclization or a multi&#8208;step nitro hetero Diels&#8208;Alder&#8208;ring&#8208;opening&#8208;Cadogan&#8208;type cyclization sequence. The latter reaction provided a new route to hydroxyindoles by an inverse Cadogan&#8208;type cyclization, in which the nitro group is deoxygenated by a nitro IMHDA&#8208;ring&#8208;opening sequence. The cyclization mechanisms and their stereoselectivity were studied by DFT calculations, based on which we proposed a mechanism for the multi&#8208;step cyclization to hydroxyindoles and explained the observed diastereoselectivity.

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot strategy for the synthesis of substituted isocoumarin, flavone, and isoquinolinedione derivatives through a switchable C&#8208;arylation/lactonization or SNAr reaction from a wide range of soft nucleophiles and o&#8208;quinol acetates has been developed. This base&#8208;mediated protocol proceeds under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions and selectively affords various heteroarenes in 13&#8211;98% yields from readily prepared or commercially available 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl and &#945;&#8208;EWG&#8208;substituted carbonyl compounds. The synthetic utility is further demonstrated in the synthesis of potential anti&#8208;HIV and anti&#8208;coronavirus derivatives and COX&#8208;2 inhibitors. In addition, detailed experimental and computational studies are performed to provide an intensive understanding and strong support of the reaction mechanism.

Abstract
In this study, regio&#8208; and diastereoselective ring&#8208;opening cyclization of spirocyclopropanes with phosphorus ylides stabilized by electron&#8208;withdrawing groups were developed. The reaction of various cyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione&#8208;2&#8208;spirocyclopropanes with phosphorus ylides bearing alkoxycarbonyl groups proceeded smoothly without any additives to provide the corresponding 6,7&#8208;dihydroindan&#8208;4&#8208;ones in 32&#8211;87% yields. Cycloheptane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione&#8208;2&#8208;spirocyclopropanes were also used in this reaction, producing the corresponding products 1,2,3,6,7,8&#8208;hexahydroazulen&#8208;4&#8208;ones in 52&#8211;67% yields. The resulting [5.6]&#8208; and [5.7]&#8208;fused carbocyclic products were readily converted into highly substituted indanes and azulenes, respectively, by oxidation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, regio- and diastereoselective ring-opening cyclization of spirocyclopropanes with phosphorus ylides stabilized by electron-withdrawing groups were developed. The reaction of various cyclohexane-1,3-dione-2-spirocyclopropanes with phosphorus ylides bearing alkoxycarbonyl groups proceeded smoothly without any additives to provide the corresponding 6,7-dihydroindan-4-ones in 32&#8211;87% yields. Cycloheptane-1,3-dione-2-spirocyclopropanes were also used in this reaction, producing the corresponding products 1,2,3,6,7,8-hexahydroazulen-4-ones in 52&#8211;67% yields. The resulting [5.6]- and [5.7]-fused carbocyclic products were readily converted into highly substituted indanes and azulenes, respectively, by oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
