         <title>Double&#8208;Sided Control of Product Type Preference in the Visible&#8208;Light Initiated Reaction of 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds with Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The demonstrated light&#8208;initiated addition of radicals formed on an active methylene group to styrene derivatives exhibits a product selectivity influenced by the presence of a protic solvent. Under protic conditions, the predominant products are branched compounds with the alkene moiety attached to the methylene group. In the absence of a proton source, an alkene is incorporated between the carbonyl group and the methylene group, leading to the formation of products known from the De Mayo reaction. The utility of the presented method was confirmed by a broad substrate range of alkenes and compounds bearing active methylene groups. A comprehensive mechanistic study revealed that both types of products can be formed via the radical pathway. This suggests a previously unreported mechanistic pathway as an alternative to the De Mayo reaction, which gives the same type of products.

         <title>A General Catalytic Sulfide&#8208;based Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex Platform for Decarboxylative Transformations of N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide Esters</title>

Abstract
This study develops a general platform using a catalytic electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) system, which combines inexpensive and readily available sulfides and N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters. This general platform facilitates various redox&#8208;neutral and net&#8208;reductive reactions, including intramolecular cyclization, hydrodecarboxylation, hydroalkylation, heterocyclic synthesis, and C&#8722;H imidation of arenes, through simple operations. For example, the intramolecular cyclization with the N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) ester derivatives achieves yields of up to 84%, while hydrodecarboxylation and hydroalkylation reactions proceed with yields of 78% and 81%, respectively. Heterocyclic synthesis and C&#8722;H imidation are also accomplished with yields of up to 76% and 74%, respectively. Mechanistic investigations reveal that, in the presence of lithium ions, the distance between the sulfur atom and the closest atom of the NHPI ester 1&#8201;a in the EDA complex decreases from 3.43 to 3.29&#8197;&#197;, whereas the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap decreases from 5.42 to 5.32&#8197;eV. These results confirm that lithium ions serve as Lewis acids, enhancing the interaction within the EDA complex. The robustness of this catalytic EDA platform is demonstrated by its compatibility with water and air, conditions that challenge conventional photoredox platforms. This study highlights sulfides as effective catalytic electron donors.

         <title>Electrochemical Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover Enabled Multi&#8208;ester Functionalized O&#8208;Containing Heterocycles Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
We report an electrochemical radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) strategy for the radical cyclization of olefinic amides with C&#8722;H nucleophiles with H2 as the byproduct. Enabled by this strategy, structurally diverse multi&#8208;ester functionalized benzoxazines and iminoisobenzofurans were obtained with good yields. Notably, the resulting triple&#8208;ester functionalized O&#8208;heterocycles are inaccessible by other means. This protocol features catalyst&#8208; and external oxidant&#8208;free conditions, high atom economy, and broad substrate scope. The scalable synthesis as well as product derivatization highlight the synthetic utility of this electrochemical protocol.

         <title>Synthesis of Furans/Pyrroles through Palladium&#8208;Gold Relay Catalyzed Skeletal Editing of Carbonates or Carbamates via a Decarboxylative&#8208;Aromatization Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. A novel Pd(0)/Au(I) relay catalysis strategy for converting propargylic cyclic carbonates into furans is reported. The method capitalizes on the sequential transformation of a palladium&#8208;stabilized alkoxide&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate into a gold&#8208;stabilized dihydrofuran species, enabled by the cooperative action of palladium and gold catalysts. This approach is notable for its simplicity, broad functional group compatibility, and use of readily available substrates. By extending the methodology to five&#8208;membered carbamates substrates, the construction of pyrrole frameworks is also demonstrated. Additionally, the method facilitates the synthesis of polycyclic furans and pyrroles via Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, achieving high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydration reactions of diynes to access tetrasubstituted cyclohexenones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;carboalkoxy&#8208;3&#8208;substituted&#8208;cyclohexenones are powerful building blocks for the synthesis of a variety of bioactive target molecules. Their preparations requires multi&#8208;steps sequence involving the use of stoichiometric quantities of various reagents, while the catalytic approaches are limitited to trisubstituted cyclohexenones. We describe here an efficient catalytic approach based on gold(I)&#8208;catalysis starting from unsymmetrical diynyl mono&#8208;ester or symmetrical diynyl di&#8208;ester substrates. The carbon chain linking the two alkyne functions can bear two or one substituent, or even be unsubstituted. Regardless of the nature of the substrates and independently of its substitution, the cyclohexenone derivatives are cleanly produced.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Few methods have been reported for the alkynylhydroxylation of unactivated alkenes, which could synchronously introduce both alkyne and hydroxyl groups into alkene moieties to construct homopropargylic alcohol scaffolds. Herein, we explored an unprecedented Ni(II)&#8208;catalyzed selective Heck&#8208;type 1,2&#8208;alkynylhydroxylation of unactivated alkenes with alkynylsilanes under air. The &#946;, &#947;&#8208; and &#947;, &#948;&#8208;unsaturated amides, including mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted alkenyl amides, were reactive substrates to afford a powerful platform for preparing important homopropargylic alcohols with excellent regio&#8208; and diastereo&#8208;selectivity. This method was suitable for use in late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract: Highly enantioselective transfer hydrogenation of &#947;&#8208;indolyl &#946;, &#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;keto amides and &#945;&#8208;keto esters with Hantzsch ester catalyzed by chiral zinc complex is reported. Using 5 mol% of Zn(OTf)2&#8208;imidazolidine&#8208;pyrroloimidazolone pyridine as the catalyst, the C=C bond in &#947;&#8208;indolyl &#946;, &#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;keto amides is selectively reduced, affording hydrogenation products in high yields (up to 99% yield) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). Using the same catalyst system, the C=O bond in &#945;&#8208;keto esters is reduced, generating &#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters in good results (up to 99% yield and 98% ee). A retro&#8208;Michael pathway and subsequent transfer hydrogenation reaction are proposed for the explanation of the side product in the transfer hydrogenation of &#947;&#8208;indolyl &#946;, &#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;keto amides.</dc:description>

Using 5 mol% of Zn(OTf)2-imidazolidine-pyrroloimidazolone pyridine as the catalyst, the C=C bond in &#947;-indolyl &#946;, &#947;-unsaturated &#945;-keto amides is selectively reduced, affording hydrogenation products in high yields (up to 99% yield) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). Using the same catalyst system, the C=O bond in &#945;-keto esters is reduced, generating &#945;-hydroxy esters in good results (up to 99% yield and 98% ee).

         <dc:description>A modular synthesis of 2,3,4,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted thieno[2,3&#8208;c]furans, which employs a formal [3+2] cycloaddition utilizing the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement and a subsequent Br&#248;nsted base&#8208;mediated cyclization, has been established, providing an efficient access to a wide range of densely functionalized thieno[2,3&#8208;c]furans that are otherwise difficult to synthesize. This method is also applicable to the synthesis of 2,3,4,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted selenolo[2,3&#8208;c]furans and can be extended to the synthesis of hexasubstituted benzothiophenes.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel, synthetically straightforward, selective DMAP&#8208;promoted [4 + 2]/[3 + 3] annulation domino reaction of o&#8208;acylamino&#8208;aryl Morita&#8722;Baylis&#8722;Hillman (MBH) carbonates with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines to construct complex fused [2,7]naphthyridine frameworks has been developed. The reaction provides a step&#8208;economic strategy for the direct synthesis of functionalized benzo[c][2,7]naphthyridines containing three stereogenic centers in high yields with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and diastereoselectivity under mild reaction conditions. More importantly, this transformation 	enables the simultaneous formation of four new bonds and two new six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles in only one step. Additionally, the synthetic utility of this method has been demonstrated through its application in the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceutically active molecules.

         <title>Understanding Chiral Proton Catalysis using Cinchonium Derivatives in aza&#8208;Michael Additions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work presents a detailed mechanistic study of a quininium&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;Michael reaction, providing essential information for advancing chiral proton catalysis (CPC). The use of cinchona derivatives as chiral proton catalysts demonstrates their potential beyond their conventional roles as base&#8208;promoted and phase&#8208;transfer catalysts. Competitive reaction pathways are explored using density functional theory (DFT), wavefunction theory, and microkinetic simulations. Theoretical analyses are complemented with experimental titration and kinetic techniques to verify the intrinsic details of the reaction. This study reveals an intricate hydrogen bond network formed in the rate&#8208; and selectivity&#8208;determining step, involving four noncovalently attached components that favor a stronger substrate&#183;&#183;&#183;catalyst interaction in the R transition state. Significantly, this research emphasizes the pivotal role of carboxylate anions as nucleophile&#8208;activating bases impacting reaction yield and enantioselectivity. Therefore, this work introduces cinchonium derivatives as new options for CPC and provides a thorough mechanistic analysis significant in expanding this underdeveloped catalytic domain.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(II) complex dispersed in imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid: Recyclable catalyst system for regioselective and chemoselective hydrobromination and hydrochlorination of alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a recyclable catalyst system combining Cu(II)O and 4,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline in a 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid for the hydrohalogenation of alkynes. The reaction efficiently yields alkenyl bromides and chlorides with good functional group tolerance and regioselectivity across a range of functionalized alkynes. Remarkably, the reaction exhibits unprecedented chemoselectivity for alkyne over alkenes in polyenynes and enables late&#8208;stage modifications to rapidly synthesize brominated polyenes. The catalyst system could be recycled for up to six runs without significant reduction of the reaction yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Difunctionalization of Glycals and their Derivatives: Strategies and Applications in the Synthesis of Bioactive Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycals serve as crucial donor molecules in the synthesis of biologically active compounds. These moieties can undergo functionalization at various positions, such as C&#8208;1, C&#8208;2, and di&#8208;functionalization at multiple sites, including 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization, 2,3&#8208;difunctionalization, and 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization. Among these, 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization can be achieved using diverse methodologies, including metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions, cyclopropane ring opening, epoxide ring opening, and more. Additionally, glycals can be converted into dihalogenated compounds through simple and efficient protocols.Moreover, the 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization process typically involves glycosylation at the anomeric position, followed by the attack of a suitable acceptor. These transformations have proven instrumental in synthesizing various medicinally significant molecules, such as restricticin, SGLT&#8208;2 inhibitors, bergenin, papulacandins A&#8208;D, and tricyclic flavonoids. This review provides an overview of the diverse strategies employed for the difunctionalization of glycals and highlights their application in synthesizing difunctionalized natural products.</dc:description>

These transformations have proven instrumental in synthesizing various medicinally significant molecules, such as restricticin, SGLT-2 inhibitors, bergenin, papulacandins A-D, and tricyclic flavonoids. This review provides an overview of the diverse strategies employed for the difunctionalization of glycals and highlights their application in synthesizing difunctionalized natural products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Diaryl and heteroaryl ethers are important and common motifs in drug discovery and agrochemicals. Here we present a catalytic system for the copper catalysed arylation of phenols with aryl halides. Bidentate N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands provide a well&#8208;defined catalytic system that enable low loading of copper in effective coupling reactions (0.5&#8197;mol% Cu or lower). The reaction scope of aryl iodides and aryl bromides is developed, that is tolerant of functional groups and a library of biaryl ethers with lead&#8208;like properties is prepared. The presence of excess ligand (in a 1:3 ratio) is shown to be optimal to prevent catalyst degradation, presumably by avoiding decomplexation of the ligand. This is also supported by the catalytic results obtained with pre&#8208;formed copper complexes. The kinetics of the reaction are examined and shown to be first order in copper, supportive of a well&#8208;defined catalyst species, first order in phenol and aryl iodide, and zero order in base under the developed conditions. Computational studies performed using Minnesota MN15&#8208;L parametrisation method support an oxidative addition&#8208;reductive elimination sequence with both steps having similar enegies and the reductive elimination occurring through an intimate ion pair intermediate.

Abstract
We developed a temperature&#8208;controlled intermolecular dearomative [5+1] spiroannulation and [5+2] cyclization of indoles with enynones, smoothly delivering a variety of spiroindolenines and dihydrocyclohepta[b]indolones under 40&#8201;&#176;C and 80&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. A three&#8208;step cascade reaction was also realized by using OTBS or NHBoc containing enynones in the reaction with the indole under the identical condition. And a novel valuable highly&#8208;oriented three&#8208;dimensional indole&#8208;based tetracyclic scaffold was produced in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities. Additionally, various spiroindolines and spirooxindoles were facilely produced through simple operations. This highly efficient domino&#8208;reaction represents an emblematic method for the preparation of indole&#8208;based polycycles through the intermolecular pathway.

Abstract
Dibenzoxasilepine is an important skeleton in both synthetic organic and medicinal chemistry. Here, we have succeeded in obtaining it in higher yield than the conventional method, elucidating for the first time the rearrangement tendency of the two aromatic rings during the ring expansion reaction on the cyclic pentacoordinate silicon intermediate.

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Benzo[f]chromanes and Hydroxyalkyl Naphthols: Catalytic Coupling of Naphthols and Allylic Alcohols</title>

Abstract
Catalytic dearomatization of arenols is an uphill task that can serve as a powerful method to construct C&#8722;C bonds with unsaturated coupling partners. Herein, a simple and efficient strategy for coupling naphthols with allylic alcohols is reported. A single Ru(II) pincer catalyzed coupling of naphthols with primary allylic alcohols led to the formation of benzo(f)chromanes, whereas the use of secondary alcohols delivered the hydroxyalkyl naphthols. Broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance are demonstrated. Notably, a high diastereoselectivity is attained on chromanes. Hydroxyalkyl naphthols are synthetically transformed into spiroethers, and dearomative bromination is achieved on chromanes. Mechanistic studies revealed the involvement of tandem reactions, a formal O&#8722;H bond activation of allylic alcohols by an active catalyst via amine&#8208;amide metal&#8208;ligand cooperation provided &#945;&#8208;&#946;, unsaturated carbonyl intermediates, which further underwent 1,4 conjugate addition with dearomatized naphthols. One of the crucial intermediates, naphthyl radical, is elucidated by EPR studies and trapped using a radical scavenger. Liberated hydrogen and water molecules are the only byproducts in these transformations.

Abstract
We present a novel and highly efficient method for synthesizing polyfunctionalized 1,2,4&#8208;triazoles. This approach leverages visible light and arylazo sulfones in combination with N&#8208;vinyl amides, in the environmentally friendly solvent ethyl acetate. Remarkably, the reaction proceeds without the need for (photo)catalysts, ensuring near&#8208;perfect atom economy and producing only water as a by&#8208;product. This method exhibits excellent functional group tolerance and can be scaled for both batch and continuous&#8208;flow processes.

Abstract
A concise and practical sustainable strategy for modular access to isoquinoline&#8208;fused benzo[f][1,3]oxazepine derivatives through a formal [4+3] annulation of commercially available salicyaldehydes with isoquinolinium salts has been developed. The reactions proceeded through the formation of two new bonds (C=C and C&#8722;O) and a seven&#8208;membered heterocyclic ring in one pot. Remarkably, use of simple NaHCO3 as a mild base, open atmosphere, nonhazardous reagents, nice functional group tolerance, and easily scale up are added characteristics to this approach. A wide range of substrates are compatible with this mild reaction system, thereby proving a facile and reliable protocol for constructing a benzo[f][1,3]oxazepine skeletons.

Abstract
Chloroarenes constitute fundamental building blocks in organic synthesis and are widely applied in the synthesis of bioactive compounds, fine chemicals, materials, natural products and pharmaceuticals. Electrochemical chlorination has been recognized as a promising synthetic method for accessing chloroarenes, but it has proved challenging to achieve in practice as shown by the limited number of existing protocols. Herein, we report on a highly general electrocatalytic strategy for the regioselective chlorination of various substituted heteroaryl scaffolds in an undivided cell setup, using ethyl chloroformate as the chlorine source. This strategy offers several practical advantages over existing methodologies, including an operationally simple experimental setup, exceptional functional group tolerance, and the possibility to form either the mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;chlorinated products in high selectivity depending on the choice of catalyst loading, electric current and ethyl chloroformate equivalents. The practicality and selectivity of the protocol were demonstrated by the successful chlorination of an array of densely&#8208;substituted arene frameworks as well as by the synthesis of chlorinated bioactive molecules.

Abstract
Merging the stereoisomeric mixture of substrate into a single product through stereospecific transformation is a challenging but higher&#8208;order synthetic strategy, which perfectly meets the demand of cost control in the precise chemical production. In this work, the stereoconvergent synthesis of Z&#8208;allylic boronates was realized with protoborylation of E/Z&#8208;mixed 1,3&#8208;dienes catalyzed by a novel copper&#8208;guanidine complex. The reaction could proceed smoothly under very mild conditions with good functional group tolerance, and convert diverse aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes into the desired Z&#8208;1,4&#8208;addition products with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivities in minutes. Detailed mechanistic studies also helped to disclose the origin of stereoconvergency. Both E&#8208; and Z&#8208;diene were found directly undergoing a rapid borylation without E/Z isomerization of C=C bond, followed by a convergent formation of the same thermodynamically stable allylcopper intermediate before the slow protonation step occurred.

         <title>Photoinduced Metal&#8208;Free Hydrocarboxylation of Allylamines</title>

Abstract
Herein, we disclose a new photochemical process to prepare &#947;&#8208;amino acids from allylamines and formic acid salts. The investigated redox&#8208;neutral hydrocarboxylation process produces high yields across a wide range of functionalized allylamine substrates with excellent regioselectivity. The developed operationally simple protocol can be readily scaled with low photocatalyst loading (from 1% up to 0.02&#8197;mol%) without the need for any precautions to exclude air or moisture. The mechanistic working model utilizes a thiol&#8208;catalyzed radical chain process, delivering the hydrogen atom and CO2 from formic acid salt across the alkene substrate through the carboxylate radical (CO2&#8901;&#8722;), a crucial reactive intermediate.

Abstract
An unprecedented cascade reaction of simple inactive alkenes, azo compounds and H2O to produce valuable poly&#8208;substituted oxazolidinones is reported herein. The transformation possesses exclusive regioselectivity and features mild reaction conditions and a broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies indicated this transformation underwent a N&#8208;alkylation&#8208;hydroxylation&#8208;transesterification cascade process. This research not only pushes the boundaries of the essential difunctionalization of alkenes but also exploits a new chemistry for azo compounds.

Abstract
Imidazolium&#8208;dithiocarboxylate zwitterions (NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2), a novel organocatalyst that derived from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC), was used to activate cyclopropenones. Under the catalysis of 10&#8197;mol% NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2, a range of phenols, alcohols, primary and secondary amines react with cyclopropenones to produce trisubstituted &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters and amides in 46&#8211;95% yield. More than 68 products, including 7 natural product derivatives have been synthesized through this method. Mechanism study showed NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2 act as a Lewis base to activate the C=C double bond of cyclopropenones and trigger the ring&#8208;opening reaction. HRMS analysis indicated the formation of the key adduct of NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2 and cyclopropenone. More importantly, this study demonstrated completely different catalytic activity of NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2 and NHC catalysts, the latter one cannot catalyse these reactions.

Abstract
Herein, we report an efficient approach to synthesizing hybrid 3&#8208;spiropiperidine heterocycles that incorporate both 3&#8208;isochromanone and 3&#8208;isoindolinone units through a one&#8208;pot, double cascade reaction facilitated by an economical K2CO3/TBAB catalytic system. By examining the nucleophilicity of the lactone 3&#8208;isochromanone, we developed a cascade reaction pathway that first generates a bi&#8208;nucleophilic hybrid intermediate, which then undergoes [3+3] spirocyclization with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The regioselectivity of the spirocyclization strongly depends on the substitution pattern of lactam ring.The process exhibits high diastereoselectivity, even with the formation of three or four stereocenters, including two contiguous tetra&#8208;substituted carbons. These sequential cascade reactions were successfully scaled up, and the subsequent reactivity was readily analyzed, enabling the transformation of existing functional groups into valuable new functionalities.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Direct Synthesis of Alkyl&#8208;Substituted Phosphonodithioates from White Phosphorus (P4)</title>

Abstract
The direct synthesis of organic phosphorus compounds from white phosphorus (P4) is a longstanding challenge in organic synthesis. Here, we present a novel visible light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component functionalization reaction that integrates P4, disulfide compounds, and N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) esters to produce alkyl&#8208;substituted phosphonodithioates in a one&#8208;pot process. Using 2,4,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) as a photocatalyst, blue LEDs (456&#8197;nm) as the light source, and N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) as the reducing agent in an acetone&#8208;toluene solvent system, this method achieves moderate to good yields of structurally diverse phosphonodithioates. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, ensures complete conversion of P4, avoids chlorination, and uses inexpensive, readily available starting materials, offering potential for large&#8208;scale applications.

Abstract
The synthesis of architecturally complex polyheterocyclic structures embedding the indole ring represents a growing field of interest. Carbolines and their partially dehydro derivatives, pyrazinoindoles, indoloindoles, azepinoindoles and other medium&#8208;sized derivatives are only some examples of indole&#8208;containing polycyclic compounds featured by enhanced pharmacological and photophysical properties. Among various synthetic protocols to prepare these important target compounds those based on the utilization of 2&#8208;aminoindoles and 2&#8208;iminoindolines are gaining increasing interest because of the ease of their preparation. The presence of a couple of reactive sites in these derivatives is instrumental for the assembling of polyheterocyclic structures exploiting single step operations featured by efficient cascade or tandem processes. Several of these methods employ catalyzed reactions which can be developed for the asymmetric synthesis of enantiopure compounds. This review provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date report on the currently available methods for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aminoindoles and 2&#8208;iminoindolines and their application to the preparation of polyheterocyclic derivatives.

Abstract
Divergent hydroelementation reactions offer a cost&#8208;effective synthetic protocol to prepare two or more products starting from same set of reactant molecules by altering one or more reaction parameters. This strategy is quite helpful in functionalizing unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds into several value&#8208;added chemical compounds by using various organic and metal&#8208;based catalysts. In this regard, catalysts derived from 3d metals have come to the fore, providing an alternative to heavier transition metals and rare&#8208;earth elements. In this review, we summarize and elucidate the recent developments of divergent hydroelementation of alkenes and alkynes using the first&#8208;row transition metal complexes by categorizing them into three classes: (1) Catalyst and ligand&#8208;controlled; (2) Reaction component&#8208;controlled and (3) Substrate&#8208;controlled. Given the importance of hydroelementation reactions, we hope this review will be helpful to the organic chemistry community.

Abstract
A Rubottom&#8208;type oxidation of N&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aminoacrylate substituted indoles with m&#8208;CPBA, providing direct routes to a series of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amidines was reported. In addition, inspired by this oxidation reaction, a solvent&#8208;controlled switchable bromination of N&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aminoacrylate substituted indoles selectively leading to either 3,3&#8208;dibromo&#8208;oxindole based &#945;&#8208;bromo amidines or tribromo&#8208;substituted indole derivatives was also developed.

         <title>Dual HATs&#8208;Mediated Catalyst&#8208;Free sp3 C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization for Regioselective Radical Hydroalkylation of Ynazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 6, March 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Direct hydroalkylation of ynazoles, facilitating the efficient synthesis of linear N&#8208;&#946;&#8208;vinylazoles, is accomplished through the functionalization of sp3 C&#8722;H bonds using trace amounts of dioxygen as an initiator. This catalyst&#8208;free method eliminates the need for exogenous reagents and proceeds through a radical chain mechanism involving dual hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes. Its application potential is exemplified through the implementation of scale&#8208;up operations.

Abstract
Herein, we disclose a readily available phenothiazine derivative as an oxidizing organic photocatalyst, that serves to induce radical cascade sulfonylation/cyclization reaction of enaminones. A variety of 3&#8208;sulfonyl chromones have been obtained with moderate to excellent yields. This catalytic platform proceeds under metal&#8208;free conditions with a wide substrate scope and broad functional group compatibility, which unlocks the new reactivity of phenothiazine derivatives and adds significant synthetic values to O&#8208;heterocycles.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced 3&#8208;Alkylation of Coumarins with Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 6, March 18, 2025. </description>

Abstract
A method for the direct 3&#8208;alkylation of coumarins utilizing alkyl halides as the alkylating agents has been achieved. This versatile reaction is compatible with a range of alkyl halides, including activated alkyl bromides, perfluoroalkyl iodides, and unactivated alkyl iodides. We propose a mechanism involving photoinduced electron transfer between alkyl halides and coumarins in the first singlet excited (S1) state, which generates alkyl radicals essential for the 3&#8208;alkylation process.

Abstract
Replacing hydrogen with deuterium raises the activation energy for C&#8722;D bond cleavage. This approach has gained attention in drug design, especially to protect the ortho&#8208;position of pyridines, which are susceptible to enzymatic oxidation. Until now, direct hydrogen isotope exchange has been largely restricted to the use of reactive organolithium reagents or metal&#8208;catalysed deuteration methods. In this work, we present a metal&#8208;free, selective ortho&#8208;deuteration of N&#8208;heterocycles starting from their N&#8208;oxides, proceeding at room temperature in just 5 minutes. This method achieves high deuterium incorporation across a broad range of N&#8208;heterocycles, including bioactive compounds. Experimental and computational studies have elucidated the mechanism of the reaction, showing that regioselectivity is driven by a successful increase in acidity at the ortho&#8208;position, enabling deprotonation by the in&#8208;situ generated dimsyl anion.

Abstract
Gem&#8208;difluoroethylene moiety holds pivotal roles in drug research owing to its unique ability as a bioisostere of the carbonyl group. Here, magnesium&#8208;mediated reductive defluorinative cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrene with carbon&#8208;centered electrophiles was developed. This method featured readily accessible reagents, mild conditions, and wide substrate scope, enabling the efficient production of gem&#8208;difluoroallyl carboxylic acid and ketones. The establishment of this protocol will offer a general alternative for the acquisition of gem&#8208;difluoroethylene compounds.

Abstract
The utility of alkyl boronic acids as alkyl radical precursors in photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reactions has been limited due to their low reactivity. A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical alkylation/cyclization of functional arylisocyanides with alkyl boronic acids is reported herein. This strategy allows the formation of alkyl radicals from boronic acids containing primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl groups, which are subsequently transformed into structurally diverse alkylated products, including quinoxalines, phenanthridines, benzothiazoles, benzoselenazoles and quinolines. This transformation features readily available radical precursors and a broad substrate scope. The reaction mechanism is investigated by fluorescence quenching, light on/off, and cyclic voltammograms (CV) experiments. The combination of alkyl boronic acids with DBU may lead to the formation of the alkyl radical via a single electron transfer (SET) process, while the arylisocyanides may undergo an energy transfer (EnT) process with photocatalyst under visible light to generate the carbon radical or act as a radical acceptor to react with the alkyl radical.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Oxidative C&#8722;H Esterification of Quinoxalinones with Arylaldehydes under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The first example for photo&#8208;induced oxidative C&#8722;H esterification of quinoxalinones with arylaldehydes under benign conditions has been reported. This method is distinguished by its capacity to accommodate a diverse array of quinoxalinones and arylaldehydes, culminating in the synthesis of the corresponding esters with moderate to good yields. The protocol is lauded for its environmental benignity, eschewing the need for hazardous transition metals and costly photocatalysts, and relies solely on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as the oxidant. Moreover, the scalability of the synthesis and the derivative transformations of the products have been demonstrated, underscoring its practical utility in organic synthesis.

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of Acyl Fluoride via 1,3&#8208;Chelation&#8208;Assisted Transhalogenation and Its Application in the Valorization of Biomass&#8208;Derived Alcohol in Aqueous System</title>

Abstract
We developed an environmentally friendly method for synthesizing acyl fluorides and achieving the selective mono&#8208;acylation of water&#8208;soluble alcohols using acyl fluorides in green media. Our method offers substantial advantages over the existing technologies for acyl fluoride production, particularly in terms of cost and environmental impact. Notably, our approach is augmented by an unusual 1,3&#8208;chelation via transhalogenation, and the use of an eco&#8208;friendly solvent and a simple base aligns with the principles of sustainable chemistry. We also explored the direct and highly efficient mono&#8208;acylation of biomass&#8208;derived water&#8208;soluble alcohols, such as ethylene glycol and glycerol, in the presence of water. The key arrangements, such as the role of the K2CO3 base and unusual 1,3&#8208;chelation between acyl fluoride and potassium ion, were characterized by HRMS and NMR spectroscopic analysis, and controlled experiments. These findings underscore the effectiveness of this method and provide deeper insights into the reaction mechanism.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed an environmentally friendly method for synthesizing acyl fluorides and achieving the selective mono-acylation of water-soluble alcohols using acyl fluorides in green media. Our method offers substantial advantages over the existing technologies for acyl fluoride production, particularly in terms of cost and environmental impact. Notably, our approach is augmented by an unusual 1,3-chelation via transhalogenation, and the use of an eco-friendly solvent and a simple base aligns with the principles of sustainable chemistry. We also explored the direct and highly efficient mono-acylation of biomass-derived water-soluble alcohols, such as ethylene glycol and glycerol, in the presence of water. The key arrangements, such as the role of the K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; base and unusual 1,3-chelation between acyl fluoride and potassium ion, were characterized by HRMS and NMR spectroscopic analysis, and controlled experiments. These findings underscore the effectiveness of this method and provide deeper insights into the reaction mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A rhodium&#8197;(II)&#8208;catalyzed transannulation reaction between aldehyde&#8208;tethered N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles and indoles was reported, which resulted in the formation of functionalized tetrahydroisoquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones. This reaction is notable for its broad substrate scope, including a variety of N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles and different indoles. The addition of a protonic acid is essential for improving the yield of the desired tetrahydroisoquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;one products.

         <title>Raney Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Deuterium Labeling of Nitrogen Containing Heterocycles and Pharmaceuticals under Continuous Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Deuterium&#8208;labeled compounds play a pivotal role in physical organic chemistry, life sciences, and materials science. This has resulted in a surge of interest in deuterium&#8208;labeled active pharmaceutical ingredients in recent years. In this study, we present a continuous flow Raney nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange process that boasts compatibility with a wide spectrum of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles and pharmaceutical compounds. The broad applicability of the developed method was demonstrated through successful labeling of various purine bases, imidazoles, pyridines, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including complex structures like abacavir and remdesivir. Control experiments revealed Raney nickel&#8216;s crucial role in the exchange process, showcasing the superiority of the continuous flow approach over batch reactions. Furthermore, a scaled&#8208;up experiment demonstrated the robustness of the catalyst.

         <title>Photoredox Assisted Net&#8208;Neutral Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover &#945;&#8208;Acylation of Enol Acetates with Acyl Chlorides: Access to 1,3&#8208;Diketones</title>

Abstract
We report a photoredox assisted &#945;&#8208;acylation of enol acetates with acyl chlorides using catalytic amount of Ir(ppy)3. The reaction proceeds via net&#8208;redox neutral radical&#8208;polar crossover pathway and furnishes 1,3&#8208;diketones in moderate to high yields under mild conditions without an external oxidant. The application of this method is demonstrated in the synthesis of Avobenzone (main ingredient in sunscreens), one&#8208;pot synthesis of anti&#8208;bacterial 4H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzothiazines and organic&#8208;laser dye boron difluoride hemicurcuminoid complex.

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Photocatalysis with a Stable and Recyclable Chromium(III) Photocatalyst in Acetonitrile and in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of stable photosensitizers made on a multigram&#8208;scale from cheap and available starting materials offers an extraordinary opportunity to translate small&#8208;scale proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept photoreactions to widespread applications in non&#8208;specialized laboratories, thereby promoting the implementation of light&#8208;driven syntheses. Herein, we report an easy, multigram&#8208;scale preparation of the exceptionally photo&#8208; and redoxstable chromium(III) complex [Cr(tpe)2]3+ (tpe = 1,1,1&#8208;tris(pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethane) at room temperature. This photocatalyst was successfully employed in acetonitrile and in the &#8220;green&#8221; solvent water as demonstrated in visible&#8208;light induced Schenck&#8208;Ene reactions, Newman&#8208;Kwart rearrangements, radical cation Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadditions, oxidative decarboxylation and trifluoromethylation reactions with excellent substrate conversions and high turnover numbers. Gram&#8208;scale photocatalytic reactions were conducted using a simple round&#8208;bottom flask as reaction vessel and irradiation with energy&#8208;efficient blue LEDs or even with sunlight. The stable photocatalyst was successfully recycled in up to 90&#8211;92 % yields after the photoreactions.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Diboron&#8208;Substrate Cooperatively Facilitate Direct Amidation of Carboxylic Acids and Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report that an efficient and practical organocatalyzed strategy enables direct amidation of a wide range of carboxylic acids and variety of amines. The organocatalyzed system is proved to be suitable for the synthesis of small molecular peptides from protected amino acids, and the method was successfully applied to the late stage functionalization of drug molecules or pharmaceutical intermediates. Mechanistic studies by control experiments, in situ infrared spectroscopy, 11B nuclear magnetic resonance (11B NMR), and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, reveal that N&#8208;propyl&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylamino)phenyl) formamide reacts with B2pin2 to form the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;diboron adduct, and the boron atom of NHC&#8208;diboron adduct is able to coordinate to the carboxyl oxygen atom of the carboxylic acid to generate the true active species of NHC&#8208;diboron&#8208;carboxylic acid for catalyzing the amidation of carboxylic acids and amines. The discovery of in situ generation of catalytic system in combination of multi&#8208;catalytic components with substrates may open the door to cooperative catalysis for the synthesis of important organic molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Preparation of (Aza&#8208;)Indolines: Diastereoselective Synthesis and Polarity Reversal Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present the first light&#8208;mediated, diastereoselective de novo synthesis for 2,3&#8208;substituted indolines, a privileged scaffold in pharmaceuticals. The protocol was tested with various aryl and alkyl groups, maintaining high yields up to 85% across different substituents. The approach was further extended to enantioselective synthesis, yielding trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;substituted indolines with high enantiomeric excesses (94%&#8208;96% ee). Drawbacks resulting from low efficiencies for nucleophilic radicals in previous studies were addressed by a polarity reversal strategy, incorporating electron&#8208;withdrawing groups to improve the efficiency of the initial radical addition. Finally, the methodology was utilized for the synthesis of azaindolines, a highly valuable target in pharmaceutical research. Our approach now encompasses modifications to the aromatic backbone, the use of both nucleophilic and electrophilic radicals as coupling partners, the synthesis of indolines, azaindolines, and tetrahydroquinolines, variation of protecting groups, and the diastereoselective synthesis of 2,3&#8208;substituted indolines.</dc:description>

         <title>Aromatization of 1,3&#8208;Cyclohexanedione: Modular Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Disubstituted
Phenols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multifunctional arenes play a crucial role in the chemical and pharmaceutical
industries, yet their synthesis remains a significant synthetic challenge. In this study,
we introduce a novel one&#8208;step strategy for the efficient synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted
phenols containing hydroxy, halogen, and sulfonamido groups, all of which
demonstrate notable biological activity. This work represents the first example of an
aromatization&#8208;driven approach to 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted benzene derivatives. Remarkably,
the resulting 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted benzene scaffold is amenable to multiple late&#8208;stage
modifications, facilitating the synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzene
derivatives&#8212;compounds that are typically challenging to obtain using conventional
synthetic methods. Furthermore, the method offers compatibility with diverse functional
groups, it proceeds under mild reaction conditions, and it uses readily available starting
materials, positioning it as a highly promising tool for pharmaceutical and materials
research.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable photocatalytic synthesis of multisubstituted quinazolines and quinolines by naphthalene diimide.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Substituted quinazolines are pharmaceutically important molecules, whose preparation from alcohol substrates are limited by precious metal, high reaction temperature and anaerobic conditions. We report herein an organophotocatalyst, naphthalene diimide (NDI) that fabricates such class of molecule in very high yield, from two different alcohols and ammonium acetate at room temperature and under aerobic atmosphere. Additionally, a three&#8208;component coupling from three different alcohols leads to 2,3&#8208;substituted quinolines in high yield, which attests to the remarkable dehydrogenating ability of the photocatalyst. This is the first use of NDI where the dehydrogenative ability of its one&#8208;electron reduced form has been exploited to execute smooth dehydrogenation reactions. A series of control experiments, Stern&#8208;Volmer analysis, EPR detection of the monoreduced NDI altogether establish the reaction mechanism and rationalizes such a strong dehydrogenation ability that leads to the preparation of heterocycles under mild condition.</dc:description>

Abstract
A challenge for the acid&#8208;mediated formation of oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonenes is side product formation. Presented herein is a Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed method towards these structures from aldehydes and &#945;&#8208;pinene, forming the endo diastereomer exclusively. We include a proposal for the stereochemical reassignment of previously reported exo diastereomers supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, 1H NMR, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The reactive system includes a range of aldehyde substrates. Experimental observations along with quantum chemical simulations suggest that an Fe(III)&#8208;aldehyde aggregate functions as the active catalyst.

         <title>Selectivity Rules for the Dearomative (3+2) Annulation Reaction Between Substituted Indoles and Oxyallyl Cations</title>

Abstract
We report a collection of &#8220;selectivity rules&#8221; for the dearomative (3+2) annulation reaction between substituted indoles and oxyallyl cations. The application of these rules enables us to synthesize four different regioisomeric permutations of the annulation products in a stereoselective fashion. We demonstrated that these products could be further transformed into hexahydro&#8208; and tetrahydrocarbazoles by nucleophile&#8208;intercepted Beckmann fragmentation (NuBFr) and Beckmann fragmentation (BFr).

         <title>Constant enzymatic &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; production of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for an Unspecific Peroxygenase by an L&#8208;amino acid oxidase</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unspecific Peroxygenases have been the subject of a lot of research in the recent past as they offer opportunities for green hydroxylation reactions using hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as donor. A striking problem of UPOs is their low stability against their own co&#8208;substrate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In order to prevent the deactivation, we developed an enzyme cascade with an L&#8208;amino acid oxidase (LAAO) to produce hydrogen peroxide &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; at a constant low concentration, aiming for much higher lifespan and therefore longer working time of the enzyme. This way, we are able to convert a variety of substrates with conversion rates up to 95 %.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A novel metal&#8208; and base&#8208;free approach for the synthesis of benzoxazino and benzoxazepino fused isoquinoline derivatives from ortho&#8208;alkynyl aldehydes and amines under mild reaction conditions has been described. The formation of new C&#8208;O and C&#8208;N bonds via metal&#8208;free cyclization with internal alkyne aided by water molecules without using external ligands and bases has been described. In addition, a series of control experiments are performed, and mechanistic studies are discussed elaborately by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale synthesis and photophysical studies of the synthesized compounds and their quantum yield calculation have been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new method for the synthesis of indolyl&#8208;7&#8208;azanobornanes.  The process involves the generation of a meta&#8208;stable tetrahydro&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazepine intermediate that decomposes by extrusion of molecular nitrogen and ultimately leads to the formation of the observed products.  The intermediacy of the triazepine intermediate was substantiated by trapping with allyl bromide to give an allylated triazepine compound that was sufficiently stable to be fully characterized in the usual ways.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Click reactions display many of the goals desired for more sustainable chemical
conversions.  Yet, the solvent used is an often overlooked aspect in determining the
environmental impact of reactions. In the current paper we develop the first
mechanochemical method for the efficient and solvent&#8208;free SuFEx reaction of sulfonyl
fluorides with a wide range of phenols.  After outlining the optimization process, which
yields an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use and robust method, we provide indications of the very wide
scope of this approach, and demonstrate this potential via the application to a range of
natural phenols that also display other functionalities, and several gram&#8208;scale

         <title>Carboxylic acids as enabling directing groups in C&#8208;H activation and functionalization: A decade review</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the last decade, carboxylic acids have drawn profound interest in synthetic chemistry, due to its exceptional adaptability as traceless directing groups (TDGs) in the construction of complex organic molecules in the realm of C&#8208;H activation. The chameleonic nature of such privileged functionality startles each time in portraying its diversity by either trace elimination of acid group or by inherent annulation which makes an aura of distinction from other conventional DGs. In this review, the recent developments of carboxylic acid as a directing group (DG) are emphasized from the year 2017 with apparent late&#8208;stage applications. In view of synthetic chemistry context and substrate scope, innovative avenues are addressed along with multiple approaches in utilising carboxylic acids as efficient DGs.</dc:description>

Abstract
A simple and efficient Ag&#8208;catalyzed tandem selanylation/cyclization of o&#8208;alkynyl benzylazides/o&#8208;alkynyloxy benzylazides with diselenides has been developed. The reaction afforded a series of 3&#8208;seleno&#8208;8H&#8208;[1,2,3]triazolo[5,1&#8208;a]isoindoles and 3&#8208;seleno&#8208;4H,10H&#8208;benzo[f][1,2,3]triazolo[5,1&#8208;c][1,4]oxazepanes in moderate to good yields. The mechanistic study revealed that the intramolecular AAC reaction of an alkynyl selenium intermediate occurred. The synthesized compound 3&#8201;k showed potent cancer cell&#8208;growth inhibition activities.

         <title>Heterogeneously Catalyzed Cascade Oxidative Coupling/Dearomative Spirocyclization of Diarylamines: Facile Access to Spiroacridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Spirocyclic compounds, particularly spirocyclohexadienones, are important in pharmaceuticals due to their biological activity. In this study, we develop a catalytic cascade oxidative spirocyclization of diarylamines for the rapid access to highly functionalized spirocyclohexadienones. Using commercially available recyclable heterogeneous metal catalysts, cascade process via oxidative coupling and dearomative spiroannulation proceeds efficiently under mild aerobic conditions, providing spirocyclohexadienones fused with an acridine skeleton in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. This method provides efficient and rapid access to nitrogen&#8208;containing fused spiro compounds in a highly atom&#8208;economical and environmentally friendly manner.

         <title>Lithium Chloride&#8208;Promoted Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts Alkylation Reaction of Indoles with Aldehydes and Ketones &#8220;on Water&#8221;</title>

Abstract
The Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction between indoles and ketones poses a significant challenge. In this study, we developed an efficient and environmentally friendly approach for the synthesis of bis(indolyl)methanes bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary and tertiary centers at room temperature under &#8220;on water&#8221; conditions. Notably, the utilization of saturated lithium chloride as a solvent greatly enhances the Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed double additions of indoles to ketones and aldehydes by promoting hydrophobic interactions. Additionally, LiCl acts as a Lewis acid catalyst for carbonyl activation and facilitates dehydration. This methodology demonstrates compatibility with various ketone substrates such as alkyl alkyl ketones and aryl alkyl ketones, along with aldehyde substrates. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale productions were successful, and the LiCl solutions demonstrate reusability.

         <title>FeCl3&#8208;Catalyzed Photochemical Reductive Transamidation of Nitroarenes: A Sustainable Approach Using Sacrificial C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A sustainable photochemical reductive transamidation of nitroarenes catalyzed by FeCl3 under blue LED irradiation is reported. This method eliminates the need for pre&#8208;reduction steps or stoichiometric reducing agents by utilizing sacrificial C&#8722;H bonds from organic solvents. The reaction proceeds via FeCl3&#8208;catalyzed single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) cascades. A previously unreported intermediate formed between nitroarenes and N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone (NMP) is discovered, playing a crucial role in facilitating substitution with amides. The method exhibits broad functional group tolerance and achieves yields up to 82%, demonstrating compatibility with a wide range of nitroarenes and amides.

         <title>Synthesis of Oxadendralenes by Thermal Oxy&#8208;Cope Type Rearrangement of Bis(&#945;&#8208;Hydroxyallenes)</title>

Abstract
We report the direct and selective synthesis of oxadendralenes starting from readily available bis(&#945;&#8208;hydroxyallenes). The designed sequence involves a hitherto unknown oxy&#8208;Cope rearrangement of allenols by supplying a site for the migration of the 1,2&#8208;diene moiety. Moreover, the so&#8208;prepared oxadendralenes were converted into valuable polyfunctionalized scaffolds through effective late&#8208;stage diversification.

Abstract
In this paper, we reported a novel sequential reaction sequence consisting of two processes including domino [3+2]/[2+1] annulation and in&#8197;situ Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement reaction, which enabled synthesis of a series of structurally complex polycyclic pyrrolizine derivatives in 51&#8211;96% yields and excellent diastereoselectivities. The viability of the existing protocol was additionally illustrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis and further modifications. In addition, some of these valuable ring&#8208;fused pyrrolizines displayed some extent of anticancer activity, demonstrating their potential application in the medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Aldehyde Dehydrogenase from Klebsiella pneumoniae: A Robust Biocatalyst for Preparing Heteroatom&#8208;Containing Carboxylic Acids</title>

Abstract
Heterocyclic scaffolds have broad applications in organic synthesis, resulting in the production of essential compounds utilized in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and dietary products. In this study, we present the characterization of a discovered succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase from Klebsiella pneumoniae (KpSSADH) and elucidate its crystallographic structure. Further investigation into the catalytic performance of KpSSADH reveals its remarkable efficiency in converting various heteroatom&#8208;containing (including N, S, O, and their combinations) cyclic aldehydes into the corresponding acids with conversions reaching up to 99%. To expand the range of available substrates, we designed cascade reactions by integrating thiol oxidase from Methylovorus sp. MP688 or unspecific peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita with KpSSADH. Through this approach, the desired acids via alcohol oxidation and C&#8722;H bond oxyfunctionalization were obtained, respectively. The discovery of KpSSADH and the envisioned cascade reactions have significantly broadened the biocatalytic toolbox for synthesizing heteroatom&#8208;containing carboxylic acids, thereby holding potential for applications in the modern pharmaceutical industry.

         <title>Advances of Chiral Metal Complexes as Standalone Photocatalyst for Asymmetric Organic Transformations</title>

Abstract
Many enantiopure chiral organic molecules are very important unit for drug discovery. Ready access to a wide range of enantiopure organic compounds, attached with one or more chiral centres significantly enhance the quality and diversity of chemical libraries for screening of drug discovery. The ability to control the stereochemistry of many organic reactions remains an area of interest in organic synthesis to allow the development of novel, structurally diverse 3D molecules. Asymmetric catalysis has been extensively studied for controlling the stereochemistry in modern synthetic organic chemistry. Recently, the use of light as the energy source with a chiral photocatalysts for photocatalytic asymmetric organic reactions has drawn much attentions but limited in numbers. The short lifetime of excited chiral photocatalysts and very fast reactions make the stereocontrol difficult in many reactions. However, by making a chiral photoactive metal complex with a suitable metal and ligands, this problem could be solved. As these chiral metal complexes are stable under light irradiation, versatile, having easy tuneable properties, these can provide more chiral inductions in many asymmetric organic reactions. So, in this review, we have focused on the recent development on chiral metal complexes as the standalone chiral photocatalysts for asymmetric organic reactions. We hope this review will help to understand the scopes and limitations to the research community in the field of asymmetric synthesis.

         <title>Electromagnetic mill promoted mechanochemical Sonogashira coupling reaction and mechanism insight into the catalytic complex</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A solid&#8208;state Pd/Cu co&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling facilitated by electromagnetic milling (EMM) was realized without solvent or additional heating. This strategy exhibited excellent substitutions tolerance and widely substrate scope. The physical parameters were investigated, which proved both of magnetic field strength and frequency to be positive correlation to yields. Meanwhile, the suitable size of the grinding medium is key to the transformation. The coordination between copper, palladium and ligands were investigated by mass measurement and 31P NMR, proving that CuI, PPh&#8323;, and DABCO coordinated in a 1:1:1 ratio under EMM, and DABCO could efficiently inhibit the homocoupling by&#8208;product from alkyne. The active catalyst complex for the Sonogashira coupling reaction in EMM is generated in situ. The EMM system offers a straightforward method for Sonogashira coupling and demonstrates significant potential for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric All&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Based Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction of Conjugated Vinyl Azides: Synthesis of Chiral Fused and Spiro Cyclohexenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of conjugated vinyl azides with &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;keto esters and amides was achieved. With C1&#8208;symmetric imidazolidine&#8208;pyrroloimidazolone pyridine as the tridentate ligand and Cu(OTf)2 as the Lewis acid, diverse chiral fused and spiro cyclohexenes with an azido group containing three continuous stereogenic centers were obtained in good yields (up to 92% yield), excellent diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). The developed method was applied to the derivatization of complex molecules including buspirone&#8208;derived ketoamide. The functional group vinyl azide was capable of participating in a subsequent click reaction.

         <title>Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced difunctionalization of styrenes with 4&#8208;cyanopyridines and thioacetates or thiosulfonates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simultaneous thiolation/pyridinylation of alkenes was achieved in a three&#8208;component reaction under visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced conditions. By employing 4CzIPN as a photocatalyst and DIPEA as a base, a variety of alkenes and cyanopyridines reacted well with thioacetates or thiosulfonates to obtain the difunctionalized products in excellent yields with high regio&#8208;selectivity. The thiolation/pyridinylation products could easily transfer to 4&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)pyridine or dithioperoxoate compounds. Furthermore, the in vitro antitumor activities of selected compounds were screened through MTT assay and the results showed that compound 6f exhibited similar antitumor activity with 5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU).</dc:description>

         <title>Fe&#8208;Catalyzed Stereospecific Intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type Reaction of Fluoroalkyl Cyclopropyl Carbinols via Non&#8208;classical Carbocation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we describe a Fe&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type reaction of polysubstituted stereodefined fluoroalkyl cyclopropyl carbinols. This transformation provides access to a series of fluoroalkyl group&#8208;substituted dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;indenols bearing three continuous stereogenic centers including two congested tetra&#8208;substituted stereocenters. The key to the realization of this reaction relies on the electronic destabilizing effect of fluoroalkyl group to tune the stability and reactivity of non&#8208;classical cyclopropyl&#8208;carbinyl cation intermediate. Functional group interconversions of the obtained diastereomerically pure dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;indenols further demonstrated the synthetic utility of this rationally designed reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photo&#8208;Dual Catalytic Strategy for Azo Compound Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azo compounds as a class of privileged molecules continue to attract significant attention in many fields including drug discovery, organic synthesis, and materials science. Despite notable progress in their synthesis, the use of visible light to directly construct azo compounds under photocatalytic conditions from amine precursors remains a challenging endeavour. Herein, we report the first instance of photo&#8208;dual catalytic Cu/photosensitizer (PS) synthesis of symmetric and non&#8208;symmetric azo compounds from readily available amines using renewable light energy input, ambient conditions, and ubiquitous air as a stoichiometric oxidant. This reliable and efficient photo&#8208;driven procedure is scalable and tolerates a variety of functional groups with broad substrate scope and allows for the preparation of azo&#8208;based photoswitches, arylazopyrazoles, and diazocines. The origin of this remarkable reactivity is delineated by in&#8208;depth experimental and computational studies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) is an efficient and mild way to obtain chiral compounds. However, the toxic metal ions and the low turnover number (TON) in aqueous ATH limited the further application. We reported a polystyrene&#8208;covered mesoporous SiO2 supported Noyori&#8217;s Ru&#8208;TsDPEN named Ru&#8208;PCMS, consisting of an inner mesoporous silica core and an outer organic polystyrene layer, which could promote the aqueous ATH of &#946;&#8208;keto esters to afford various chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ester with excellent yields (up to 99%) and ee values (up to 97%).

         <title>Synthesis of Unnatural Amino Acids via &#946;&#8208;Aminoaldehyde C&#8211;H Arylation using HAT&#8208;Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unnatural amino acids play a crucial role in advancing protein engineering and drug development. In this study, we present the synthesis of a series of &#947; aryl&#8208;keto&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids through the direct C&#8211;H arylation of readily accessible &#946;&#8208;aminoaldehydes and aryl bromides, promoted by hydrogen atom transfer combined with metallaphotoredox catalysis. This direct and mild methodology provides access to enantiopure L&#8208; and D&#8208; amino acids, either N&#8208;protected or unprotected, with broad functional group compatibility, including pyridine heterocycles. These features highlight the potential relevance of this strategy for pharmaceutical synthesis and biotechnological research.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of immobilized chiral iridium catalysts by strengthening coordination bonds for Z&#8208;retentive asymmetric allylic substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allyl substitution is pivotal for constructing chiral compounds. However, addressing Ir scarcity and developing sustainable catalysts for industrial applications remains a significant challenge. This study presents a polymer&#8208;supported heterogeneous chiral single&#8208;Ir&#8208;site catalyst, wherein the coordination is optimized through modulation of anions, resulting in a significant reduction in metal leaching. The catalysts exhibit exceptional performance in terms of enhanced enantioselectivity and broad applicability in Z&#8208;retentive asymmetric allylic substitution reactions, even accommodating a wide range of diverse functional groups. Specifically, the catalyst demonstrates minimal metal leaching over 14 cycles, marking a notable improvement compared to previously reported catalysts. The practical optimization of this reaction highlights the potential application value of such catalysts, offering insights for the development of chiral heterogeneous catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis: A Modular In Situ Vicinal Functionalization Strategy for Recent Developments of Carbohydrate Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis, first identified by Catellani in 1997, provides an efficient approach for synthesizing highly functionalized aromatic compounds that are challenging to obtain through conventional methods. The developed synthetic approach integrates selective C&#8722;H bond activation with sequential reactions, allowing for the targeted functionalization of both the ortho and ipso positions of aryl halides via aryl&#8208;norbornadiene&#8208;palladacycle (ANP), which in turn ensures high chemoselectivity and regioselectivity of the products. It is estimated that approximately 20% of all natural products are glycosylated, with the carbohydrates linked to these compounds frequently playing a critical role in their biological activity. Currently, research in carbohydrate chemistry predominantly concentrates on polysubstitutional derivatization or vicinal functionalization strategies. However, the limited availability of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted compounds has been scarcely investigated, and previous studies often relied on directional group assistance to achieve disubstitution. Recently, significant advancements have been achieved with Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis, an area that has gained considerable importance in carbohydrate chemistry, presenting an opportunity to inspire further research interest in Catellani reactions. In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the Pd/NBE strategy within the realm of sugar chemistry, encompass early research and advancement in catalytic reactions, outline synthetic potential, highlight the significant progress made, and emphasize the most recent developments and their applications in&#8197;situ vicinal functionalization of carbohydrate derivatives.

Abstract
Despite the formidable challenge of concurrently managing both the regiochemistry and stereochemistry of the process, organocatalytic remote stereocontrol has emerged as an appealing approach to establish stereocenters at specified locations distant from reactive functional groups. Herein, we achieved the first organocatalyzed remote stereocontrolled (4+2) annulation of 2&#8208;(4H&#8208;benzo[d][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)acrylates with 4&#8208;methyleneisoxazol&#8208;5(4H)&#8208;ones. The nucleophilic attack of a suitable chiral amine to 2&#8208;(4H&#8208;benzo[d][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)acrylates generated the key amine&#8208;dipole intermediate, followed by the enantioselective aza&#8208;1,4&#8208;addition of 4&#8208;methyleneisoxazol&#8208;5(4H)&#8208;ones and intramolecular annulation cascade reaction to construct spiro[isoxazole&#8208;4,3&#8217;&#8208;quinolin]&#8208;5&#8208;one frameworks bearing continuous three stereocenters. More importantly, different from the well&#8208;established reactions of MBH carbonates, this work successfully established a novel platform for the direct enantioselective synthesis of continuous three stereocenters, inclusive of an &#1013;&#8208;stereocenter.

Abstract
Regio&#8208; and stereoselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalizations of saturated nitrogen heterocycles, amines/amides are challenging and have emerged as an important topic of research in the area of C(sp3)&#8722;H activation. Herein, we have summarized various &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H activation/functionalization methods; this review provides an overview of various trending approaches for &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation/functionalization of saturated nitrogen heterocycles, amines/amides. The regio&#8208; and stereoselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation methods are classified based on the reaction pathways. The literature methods including directing group or ligand&#8208;assisted transformations, reactions proceeding through enamine intermediate, redox&#8208;neutral methods and other trending methods including photoredox and transitional metal&#8208;free methods are discussed with recent updates.

         <title>Amide Synthesis via Transaminative Amidation of Aromatic Aldehydes/Ketones: An Entry to 15N Isotopologs</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Herein, we develop the first one&#8208;pot amide synthesis from aldehyde/ketone and amino acids via transaminative amidation reaction and the method requires no catalyst or promoters, by allowing a concise access to structurally diverse amides and lactams with good efficiency. This transformation could also proceed smoothly by direct use of ether solvent as the formylated reagent in stead of formylic acid, thus furnishing an unique synthesis of formamides. The underlying principles of this unique amide synthesis was rationalized by a series of mechanistic studies, which involved a concerted decarboxylatively structural isomerization/acylation process as the key for amidation and a transamination/imine formation/aerobic oxidation cascade for formamidation. The potential utility of this strategy has been demonstrated by the readily accessible late&#8208;stage transformation of biologically active molecules by 15N incorporating. This protocol was also applied to the total synthesis of a kind of drug Butenafine with 15N&#8208;enrichment.

Abstract
Catalytic formal aldol condensation reactions between &#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates and arylaldehydes, in which the C&#8722;C double bond formation occurs at the &#947;&#8208;position of the &#946;&#8208;ketophosphonate, are reported. The reactions were performed in the presence of a catalyst system composed of p&#8208;anisidine and trifluoroacetic acid under mild conditions. Mechanistic investigations suggest that a Mannich reaction followed by elimination results in the formation of the &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated &#946;&#8208;ketophosphonate. Although the &#946;&#8208;ketophosphonate has an active methylene group, the bond formation occurred selectively at the &#947;&#8208;position of the &#946;&#8208;ketophosphonate.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a straightforward and efficient method for the synthesis of spiropyrazoline oxindoles using CuCl2&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; as the Lewis acid catalyst. This approach involves a one&#8208;pot domino process, consisting of a condensation step between indolin&#8208;2&#8208;one and phenylhydrazine derivatives, followed by a copper&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction. 
The methodology enabled the synthesis of 32 diversely functionalized spiro compounds with yields ranging from moderate to excellent, achieving up to 98%.

         <title>Photo&#8208; or Electrochemical N&#8208;P Cross&#8208;Hetero&#8208;Dehydrogenative Couplings between Amines and Phosphonothioates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a dual synthetic approach utilizing both photochemical and electrochemical strategies for the synthesis of diversely functionalized thiophosphoramidates via N&#8208;P cross&#8208;hetero&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling. Both methods provide a practical and efficient route to access this significant class of biologically relevant thiophosphoramidates. Key advantages of the protocol include mild reaction conditions, the use of visible light and electrochemical cells as sustainable tools, and energy efficiency enabled by a low&#8208;energy visible light source and low&#8208;current operation. Furthermore, the process utilizes low&#8208;cost substrates and a nontoxic photosensitizer, delivers high yields, exhibits broad substrate scope with excellent functional group tolerance, and offers operational simplicity with a strong emphasis on eco&#8208;friendliness.</dc:description>

         <title>Lanthanide One&#8208;Dimensional Coordination Polymer Catalyzed [3+2] Annulation Reaction: Synthesis of N,N&#8217;&#8208;Bicyclic Pyrazolidine Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of the multidendate ligand (H2L) with lanthanide metal salts leads to the formation of one&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers (CP). The structural analysis of the molecule suggests the formation of CP with ladder&#8208;type arrangements of ligands with metal centers. The polymers CP&#8208;1 and CP&#8208;2 with europium and terbium were found to be anionic and coordinatively unsaturated with the existence of solvent molecules in the vacant sites. The CPs were found to be suitable catalysts for the regioselective annulation of aza&#8208;MBH adducts with N,N, cyclic azomethine imines that lead to the formation of N,N&#8217;&#8208;bicyclic pyrazolidine scaffolds via [3+2] cycloaddition. The protocol tolerates a wide substrate scope with different functionalities by producing the bicyclic scaffold with better yield and excellent diastereoselectivity. The X&#8208;ray and NMR analysis suggests the formation of cis diastereomer which is stabilized by N&#8208;H&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;O interaction. The synthetic utility of the pyrazolidine scaffolds is attempted for various functional group interconversions.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of a Cobalt&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework in Carbodiimide Synthesis</title>

Abstract
The synthesis of carbodiimides via nitrene transfer to isocyanides has garnered significant attention in recent years. However, this reaction predominantly relies on homogeneous catalytic systems with high catalyst loadings. In this study, we employed ZIF&#8208;67 MOF as a heterogeneous catalyst for carbodiimide synthesis and conducted an in&#8208;depth analysis of its stability. Our findings reveal the non&#8208;innocent role of catalyst leaching, demonstrating that even as little as 0.04&#8197;mol% of leached cobalt species is sufficient to catalyze this reaction. This result is in contrast with previous reports, where 5&#8211;10&#8197;mol% of homogeneous cobalt&#8208;loading is required. Furthermore, this study highlights that lower catalyst loadings are more efficient, particularly in cases where isocyanides exhibit limited stability.

         <title>Recent Advances in Iodine&#8208;Mediated Radical Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
Over the past two decades, iodine&#8208;mediated free radical reactions have been extensively explored and employed in chemical transformations that complement traditional ionic reactions. In this review, we have updated the progress of the iodine&#8208;mediated radical reactions in organic synthesis reported between 2015 and mid&#8208;2024, and organized the reactions according to their mechanistic pathways. In general, the proposed mechanisms can be divided into four categories based on the radical initiation or its preceding steps, namely, (1) formation of a covalent X&#8722;I (X=C, N, S, Se) bond, which subsequently participates in a radical reaction; (2) formation of a noncovalent N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I bond, which assists the homolysis of the I&#8722;I bond; (3) formation of the key iodine radicals by visible&#8208;light or heat induced homolysis of I2 or by electrochemical oxidation of iodide; (4) iodine induced peroxide decomposition via single electron transfer (SET) mechanism to generate alkoxy or alkyl peroxy radicals. We hope this review will provide readers with a comprehensive update on the iodine&#8208;mediated radical reactions, thereby further inspiring more exciting advances in this emerging field.

Abstract
We describe a novel cobalt/salicyloxazoline (Salox) catalytic system for enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization, enabling the synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic and axially chiral cyclic phosphinic amides. Chiral Salox ligands, conveniently prepared in a single step from salicylonitriles and chiral amino alcohols, facilitated this transformation with excellent enantioselectivities (92&#8208;99% ee) and moderate to good yields (31 examples, 45&#8211;89%). Mechanistic studies implicate a cobalt (III/IV/II) catalytic cycle in the C&#8722;H annulation process, providing valuable insights into the stereoselective reaction pathway.

         <title>CuF2&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;N Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Silanes: Expanding the Scope of Chan&#8208;Lam Type Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8211;Lam type N&#8208;arylation of various amides, sulfonamides, urea, azoles, and amines has been demonstrated using a CuF2/DMSO catalytic system with structurally diverse aryl(trimethoxy)silanes under base and ligand&#8208;free conditions. This approach facilitates effective C&#8208;N cross&#8208;coupling with user&#8208;friendly organosilicon reagents without requiring an external fluoride source. CuF2 serves a dual function as both a catalyst and a desilylating agent, facilitating the cleavage of the aryl&#8208;silane 	bond. The process is compatible with a broad range of substrates, ensuring high efficiency and excellent functional group compatibility. Moreover, this protocol is proven to be valuable for late&#8208;stage modification of amide and sulfonamide&#8208;containing drug molecules, as well as for synthesizing agrochemicals.

Abstract
A strategy for the immobilization of Johnston's Mono(AMidine) catalyst (MAM) onto polystyrene, silica and hybrid silica&#8208;polystyrene nanoparticles is presented. The catalyst activity was evaluated in the stereoselective aza&#8208;Henry reaction leading to the pivotal &#946;&#8208;amino nitroalkane precursors of the anti&#8208;cancer agents Nutlins (with Nutlin&#8208;3a as the most active drug). The effect of the support and the linker on the catalytic performance was investigated, observing an interesting match/mismatch effect when using a chiral linker. The polystyrene&#8208;supported 3&#8208;pyrrolidinol&#8208;linked PS&#8208;(S)&#8208;Pyr&#8208;MAM organocatalyst showed the best activity among the tested catalysts, behaving very similarly to the homogeneous counterpart in the synthesis of a library of Nutlins precursors: yield up to 95%, ee up to 99%, and dr up to &gt;99:1. The catalyst recyclability was also assessed through simple filtration, yielding a satisfactory 93% ee after 5 cycles, showing only a moderate decrease in conversion efficiency (ca. 5% after each cycle), which resulted in an accumulated turnover number (TON) of 69.7.

         <title>Second&#8208;Generation One&#8208;Pot Enantioselective Heck&#8208;Matsuda Arylations of Unactivated Olefins Directly from Anilines and Nitroarenes</title>

Abstract
A highly improved second generation of the one&#8208;pot enantioselective Heck&#8208;Matsuda reaction directly from anilines and nitroarenes is reported. This practical arylation method, featuring 56 examples, relies on the in&#8197;situ diazotization of anilines and 3&#8208;aminothiophenes, or from the in&#8197;situ reduction&#8208;diazotization of nitrobenzene derivatives. The in&#8197;situ diazotization of the aniline, directly or from the in&#8208;situ reduction of the nitroarene, synchronizes smoothly with the enantioselective Heck&#8208;Matsuda reaction under mildly acidic conditions, bypassing the synthesis and handling of some unstable and/or difficult&#8208;to&#8208;prepare arenediazonium salts. The protocol was applied to the desymmetrization of unactivated olefins leading to the synthesis of functionalized spirocyclopentenyl hydantoins, aryl cyclopentenes, and &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones, in high yields (up to 99%) and er (up to 99:1). The efficiency of the method is showcased by the formal total synthesis of the bioactive compound VPC01091, a potential drug candidate for multiple sclerosis treatment at the gram scale in excellent yield (94%), in 97:3 er and 20&gt;1 dr.

Abstract
A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bond activation reaction of aryl oximes and CF3&#8208;substituted imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides (TFISYs) has been described, producing a wide variety of N&#8208;(2&#8208;cyanoaryl)&#8208;3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)isoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;imines in moderate to excellent yields. The transformation might involve a consecutive C(sp2)&#8211;H bond activation, intramolecular spiro&#8208;cyclization, C&#8722;C bond activation and N&#8722;O bond cleavage sequence. This developed protocol provides a direct entry to diverse trifluoromethyl and nitrile&#8208;containing heterocycles with the generation of water and dimethyl sulfoxide as by&#8208;products.

Abstract
The electrochemical catalyst&#8208;free generation of carbon radicals bearing three electron&#8208;withdrawing groups from the corresponding C&#8722;H nucleophiles remains unexplored. To this end, we report a direct electro&#8208;oxidation strategy to access these electrophilic carbon radicals under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. Enabled by this strategy, the radical 1,2&#8208;alkylarylations of allylic alcohols was realized, affording &#946;&#8208;quaternary ketones with high functional group compatibility. This protocol is operationally simple and also easy to scale up.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Analysis of Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Semihydrogenations of Alkynes</title>

Abstract
The semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes has historically been an essential technique in organic chemistry. In this context, researchers often employ transition metal complexes to achieve this conversion. Given the pronounced polarization of results, often yielding either very high or very low values, it remains challenging to discern the factors influencing reactivity and selectivity in many cases. In this work, we combine different sub&#8208;disciplines of digital chemistry with experimental outcomes to rationalize the results of a model Ni&#8208;catalyzed semihydrogenation that leads to E&#8208;alkenes. First, we analyze the main factors behind successful reactions using a machine learning classification model. The descriptors are computed directly from the SMILES strings of the reacting alkynes using an automated protocol that relies on structural features, molecular mechanics, and semi&#8208;empirical techniques. This workflow requires minimal human intervention and provides a fast and effective approach. Next, we couple the same descriptors with activation barriers calculated with density functional theory, generating a regression model that explains reactivity based on the properties of the alkyne substrates. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of using a combination of digital chemistry techniques to uncover reaction trends in Ni&#8208;catalyzed semihydrogenations of alkynes, an area where human intuition proves limited in application.

         <title>Biomimetic Orthogonal Removal of Arylacyl Protecting Groups from the C&#8208;Terminus of Substituted Amino Acids and Oligopeptides via Flavin N(5)&#8208;iminium Covalent Adducts</title>

Abstract
Flavin co&#8208;factors and other flavin derivatives are traditionally associated with one&#8208; or two&#8208;electron redox reactions. Flavins also form covalent intermediates with a variety of substrates. While extensive attention has focused on reactions at the C(4a) position of the flavin ring, recent interest has shifted toward the dynamic potential of the N(5) atom. In our study, we demonstrate the formation of artificial flavin N(5)&#8208;iminium covalent adducts via nucleophilic attack by enolates derived from arylacyl esters at the flavin N(5) position. This interaction mimics the biosynthesis of ether phospholipids catalysed by alkyl&#8208;dihydroxyacetone phosphate synthase via an N(5)&#8208;FAD iminium adduct formation and fatty acid release. Accordingly, we developed a method for the selective removal of phenacyl and 2&#8208;naphthylacetyl protecting groups from the C&#8208;terminus of &#945;&#8208;amino acids and di&#8208; and tripeptides using biomimetic flavin organocatalysis. Although many approaches are currently available for protection of C&#8208;terminus of peptides, their removal often requires harsh conditions, which cause racemization and the loss of optical purity, together with other side reactions. Our method is versatile, mild, orthogonal to most functional and protecting groups and maintains optical purity of &#945;&#8208;amino acids. From general point of view, the method signifies the groundbreaking application of the non&#8208;canonical reactivity of flavins in organic synthesis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flavin co-factors and other flavin derivatives are traditionally associated with one- or two-electron redox reactions. Flavins also form covalent intermediates with a variety of substrates. While extensive attention has focused on reactions at the C(4a) position of the flavin ring, recent interest has shifted toward the dynamic potential of the N(5) atom. In our study, we demonstrate the formation of artificial flavin N(5)-iminium covalent adducts via nucleophilic attack by enolates derived from arylacyl esters at the flavin N(5) position. This interaction mimics the biosynthesis of ether phospholipids catalysed by alkyl-dihydroxyacetone phosphate synthase via an N(5)-FAD iminium adduct formation and fatty acid release. Accordingly, we developed a method for the selective removal of phenacyl and 2-naphthylacetyl protecting groups from the C-terminus of &#945;-amino acids and di- and tripeptides using biomimetic flavin organocatalysis. Although many approaches are currently available for protection of C-terminus of peptides, their removal often requires harsh conditions, which cause racemization and the loss of optical purity, together with other side reactions. Our method is versatile, mild, orthogonal to most functional and protecting groups and maintains optical purity of &#945;-amino acids. From general point of view, the method signifies the groundbreaking application of the non-canonical reactivity of flavins in organic synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A functionalized heterogeneous Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Cu&#8208;2D&#8208;MOF) was synthesized through the reaction of Cu(NO3)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O with 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoroterephthalic acid and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine. The synthesized material underwent comprehensive characterization using various techniques, including FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy, N2 physical adsorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Subsequently, the catalytic performance of Cu&#8208;2D&#8208;MOFs was assessed in the hydrophosphorylation and aerobic oxidative dehydrogenative coupling reactions involving alkynes and P&#8722;H bonds. The catalyst demonstrated remarkable catalytic activity in both transformations, effectively yielding a wide variety of (E)&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;phosphoryl and alkynyl&#8208;phosphoryl compounds, respectively. Notably, the incorporation of this MOF material facilitated the phosphorylation reaction to proceed seamlessly, eliminating the necessity for supplementary small molecular organic ligands. Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrated ease of recovery and recyclability through a simple recovery process. Employing a systematic approach of sequential control experiments, we have delineated the potential transformation pathway of the reaction and consequently hypothesized a probable reaction mechanism for the observed transformation.

Abstract
This article presents a method for asymmetric formal cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of benzylic alcohols with ketones through combined electrooxidation and organocatalysis. Employing inexpensive and environmentally friendly proline as a chiral organocatalyst, various benzylic alcohols and simple ketones serve as substrates to directly obtain diverse chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxycarbonyl compounds with moderate to good yields (up to 85%) and excellent stereoselectivity (up to 99% ee and 99:1&#8197;dr). The reaction proceeds under mild conditions at room temperature in air, without oxidants or additives, demonstrating robust functional group tolerance and atom efficiency. Hydrogen gas released at the cathode is the sole byproduct. Using L&#8208; or D&#8208;proline allows straightforward access to both chiral configurations of &#946;&#8208;hydroxycarbonyl compounds.

Abstract
Functionalized pyridines and 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines are crucial organic entities in natural products, organic materials, drugs and catalysts. Despite progress, a facile and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis remains desirable so far. In this context, we disclose a novel visible light&#8208;promoted radical cascade sulfonylation&#8208;cyclization&#8208;aromatization of N&#8208;propargyl enamides with selenosulfonates. This approach avoids the use of metal&#8208; or photocatalyst, bases and external oxidants, marking a significant advance in sustainable and green chemistry accords. Utilizing this protocol, we successfully synthesized a diverse range of sulfonated 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines and pyridines, featuring good functional group compatibility, simple operation and mild condition.

         <title>Scalable Electrochemical Dehalogenative Carboxylation without a Sacrificial Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A scalable electrochemical procedure for the synthesis of carboxylic acids from organic halides has been developed using a spinning cylinder electrode electrochemical reactor. The electrochemical process is based on the reductive dehalogenation of the starting material followed by trapping of the resulting carbanion with CO2. The protocol is compatible both with organic chlorides and bromides and uses inexpensive graphite and stainless steel as electrode materials. As sacrificial metal anodes are avoided, the method can be readily scaled up in flow mode. The procedure is compatible with a wide range of substrates (24 examples), including aryl and alkyl halides as well as heterocyclic compounds. Multigram scale preparations in flow mode have been demonstrated by processing 600&#8197;mL of reaction mixture in an electrolyte recirculation setup.

Abstract
A molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenation of sulfoxides, pyridine and quinoline N&#8208;oxides, N&#8208;hydroxybenzotriazoles, as well as the reduction of nitroarenes to anilines, has been developed using monocyclic terpenes such as &#947;&#8208;terpinene as an environmentally benign hydrogen surrogate. The only byproducts generated are water and p&#8208;cymene, under neat reaction conditions in which the terpene acts as both solvent and reducing agent. These features make this approach a highly attractive and sustainable alternative for the reduction of S&#8208;O and N&#8208;O containing compounds. Additionally, the reaction exhibited excellent chemoselectivity, tolerating a wide variety of functional groups.

         <title>NFSI&#8208;TEMPO Catalysed Stereoselective Synthesis of 2&#8208;Deoxyglycosides from Glycals</title>

Abstract
2&#8208;deoxyglycosides are prominent constituents of diverse naturally occurring glycans and are known to participate in crucial biological pathways. We herein demonstrate NFSI&#8208;TEMPO as an efficient organocatalyst for the formation of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glycosides from glycals. For the first time a catalytic behaviour of NFSI&#8208;TEMPO combination has been observed. The reaction conditions have been found suitable for the generation of glycosides from commercial alcohols, amino acid, sterol, phenols and monosaccharide derived alcohols. Broad range of protecting groups on both glycal and glycosyl acceptors as well as alcohols of varied reactivity were found to be compatible for the generation of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glycosides in moderate to good yields. The synthetic potential of the newly established transformation was illustrated by application in trisaccharide synthesis and gram&#8208;scale reaction.

Abstract
A base&#8208;mediated one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step, four&#8208;component reaction has been developed to synthesize imidazole&#8208;4(2H)&#8208;ones, utilizing commercially available amino acid esters, aldehydes, alkynes, and amino alcohols. Control experiments and isolation of the intermediate revealed the mechanistic details. This four&#8208;component reaction proceeds via imine formation, followed by the nucleophilic addition of alkyne to form a propargylamine precursor. Subsequently, the propargylamine precursor under undergoes base&#8208;mediated conversion into 1&#8208;azadiene, followed by in situ ketene formation to generate (allylideneamino)prop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;one. The nucleophilic addition of amino alcohol and subsequent intramolecular cyclization provides imidazole&#8208;4 (2H)&#8208;ones exclusively.

         <title>Au(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Hydroarylation of Allenes for the Synthesis of Tetrahydrodiazepines or Tetrahydrodiazonines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Allenes tethered to pyrroles undergo Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation leading to tetrahydrodiazepines or tetrahydrodiazonines. The regioselectivity of the reaction is governed by both the substitution pattern of the allene and the nature of the Au(I) ligand. Hence, alkyl&#8208;gem&#8208;disubstituted allenes preferentially lead to tetrahydrodiazepines via 7&#8208;exo&#8208;cyclizations, while aryl&#8208;substituted allenes preferentially lead to tetrahydrodiazonines via 9&#8208;endo&#8208;cyclization when a phosphite ligand is used. Enantioselective reactions have been developed with the SEGPHOS chiral ligand, leading to chiral heterocycles with high enantioselectivity (up to 96% ee). In addition, DFT calculations have streamlined the regioselectivity (7&#8208;exo vs 9&#8208;endo) of these gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations.

Abstract
A chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of axially chiral alkenes was developed via an enantioselective and para&#8208;selective Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction between phenols and 1&#8208;alkynylnaphth&#8208;2&#8208;ols. This methodology features an efficient hydroarylation with high functional group tolerance, complete para&#8208;selectivity, excellent yields (up to 99%), and enantioselectivities (up to 94% ee) in the presence of a N&#8208;triflylphosphoramide catalyst. DFT calculations were performed to investigate para&#8208;selectivity and results indicate that both kinetics and thermodynamics parameters are more favorable compared to ortho&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Controlling Catalyst Speciation to Achieve Room Temperature Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Aminations with Aryl and Heteroaryl Chlorides</title>

Abstract
The amination of aryl halides with palladium catalysts (Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination) is a widely used transformation in synthetic and drug discovery chemistry. In this report, we demonstrate that a monometallic 2&#8208;phosphinoimidazole Pd catalyst exhibits comparable or enhanced reactivity when compared to all ligands screened for room temperature amination of aryl chlorides with secondary amines. The di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine derivative showed extremely high reactivity while the di&#8208;isopropyl variant led to almost complete loss of catalytic activity. Computational and experimental mechanistic and kinetic studies indicate that a monometallic Pd structure rather than a bimetallic Pd structure is key to fast catalysis. The di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine ligand has fast catalysis because it thermodynamically disfavors the formation of a much less active bimetallic Pd complex. A wide substrate scope is demonstrated for the arylation of secondary amines with aryl chlorides using our new catalyst system.

         <title>Alkylation of Imines with Alkyl Halides under Electrochemical Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An electrochemical protocol for the alkylation of imines was developed by using easily available alkyl halides as the alkyl sources, graphite felt (GF) as anode and zinc plate as cathode. Various substituted imines, alkyl bromides and alkyl iodides were suitable for this reaction and a series of &#945;&#8208;branched amines were obtained in moderate to good yields. This method provides a green way for the addition of imines to avoid the need for metal reagents, chemical oxidants and reductants, which makes it has a good application prospect in drug synthesis.

         <title>Photoinduced Catalytic Alkylation of Active Methine Compounds with Nonactivated Alkenes Using Yttrium Triflate as a Lewis Acid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Photoinduced catalytic alkylation reactions of active methine compounds with nonactivated alkenes have been developed using an organophotocatalyst, a metal Lewis acid, an arylthiol, and an amine base catalyst system. The alkylation reactions proceeded smoothly under ambient conditions with blue light irradiation, affording the desired products bearing quaternary carbon centers in high yields. Furthermore, enantioselective alkylation with an nonactivated alkene was achieved using a chiral Lewis acid.

         <title>Preparation of Mesoporous Cu2O Nanospheres for Green Synthesis in the Enantioselective Boron Conjugate Addition of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Chiral Compounds in Aqueous Phase</title>

Abstract
Chiral organoboron compounds are essential intermediates in various significant reactions. However, there are still few efficient catalysts for their synthesis. This paper reports a novel catalytic material for chiral asymmetric boron conjugate addition reactions: mesoporous Cu2O nanospheres (M&#8722;Cu2O). M&#8722;Cu2O is approximately 0.55&#8197;&#956;m, exhibiting dense and uniformly distributed worm&#8208;like pores. It features a specific surface area of 15.7&#8197;m2/g and an average pore size of 14.3&#8197;nm. Under the conditions of Toluene:H2O=9:1, with a chiral ligand amount of 3.6&#8197;mol% and no additional base, it achieves a high yield (98% yield) and impressive enantioselectivity (99% ee) for the template substrate chalcone using only 3.0&#8197;mol% of the catalyst. Notably, the catalyst can be easily recovered and maintains robust catalytic performance after seven cycles, yielding 92% and an ee value of 90%. This work presents a mild and effective method for synthesizing chiral boron compounds in an aqueous phase, significantly enhancing the application potential of mesoporous copper oxide nanospheres.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Carbonylation/Coupling Reaction Using Anode to Oxidize the Trasition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyst and Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reported an electrochemical oxidative carbonylation of N&#8208;phenylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amine derivatives under mild condtions without an external oxidant. Our approach demonstrated a novel electrochemical oxidative carbonylation reaction mode in which the simultaneous reaction of catalyst and substrate with the anode has been developed. Furthermore, an electrochemical C&#8208;H activation for the synthesis of cyclized pyridinium ion has also been realized. Mechanistic investigations suggested that the process involved a &#8220;PdII/PdIII/PdI/PdII&#8221; catalytic cycle, and H2 was generated at the cathode.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative and Deconstructive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Acrylic Acids with Ketone&#8208;Derived Dihydroquinazolinones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, an iron&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the aromatization&#8208;driven deconstruction and decarboxylation of ketone&#8208;derived dihydroquinazolinones in reaction with unsaturated carboxylic acids is reported. A diverse range of fluoroacrylic acids and cinnamic acids reacted effectively with dihydroquinazolinones, yielding essential monofluoroalkenes and alkenes with excellent stereoselectivity. Additionally, spiro&#8208;dihydroquinazolinones served as suitable substrates, facilitating the synthesis of valuable quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones featuring alkene motifs. This protocol is notable for its operational simplicity and versatility, enabling the chemical diversification of active molecules.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Cascade Synthesis of 5&#8208;Alkylidene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;Lactams via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Hydro&#8208;Oxycarbonylation</title>

Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrofunctionalization of alkynes and, more precisely, the intramolecular hydro&#8208;oxycarbonylation (cycloisomerization) of acetylenic acids, has been widely employed as a key step in cascade processes for the construction of valuable and complex molecules. However, in contrast with other aminonucleophiles, no method has been reported for the reaction between primary monoamines and non&#8208;activated alkynoic acids. Hence, a procedure has been devised for the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective preparation of 5&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams via a copper&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction between alkynoic acids and amines. The developed protocol proves to be scalable and demonstrates significant tolerance to a wide range of structurally diverse alkynoic acids and amines bearing various functional groups, as evidenced by 60 high&#8208;yielding examples. An exhaustive experimental and computational analysis of the reaction is also provided to unravel the nature and role of the copper catalyst, the observed regioselectivity and the mechanism of the reaction.

         <title>Multifunctionalization of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Boranes by a Single Metal&#8208;free Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Selective access to densely functionalized boranes, with identical or distinct functional groups at the boron center, has great potentials in materials science, organic synthesis and drug discovery. However, assembling multifunctional boranes was heavily dependent on hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (HAT) at high temperatures, hazardous radical initiators, metal photocatalysts and HAT reagents, respectively. Simultaneously, competitive side reactions such as polymerizations and regioisomers formation remain highly challenging. Herein, a programmable multifunctionalization of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) boranes is developed for the first time powered by a single, metal&#8208;free photocatalyst, in which boryl radicals from sequential substituted boranes are generated instead of polymerizations. This robust and versatile catalytic system leads to an extremely broad variety of boranes incorporated with diverse alkyl or alkenyl groups in high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities.

Abstract
Chiral, vicinal diols are of high interest for academic research and industrial applications. For synthesizing chiral diols, enzymes are important catalysts due to their high selectivity and ability to work under tolerable temperature and no pressure. In this study, two consecutive enzyme&#8208;catalyzed steps were used for the asymmetric synthesis of aliphatic, vicinal diols with high product concentrations and chiral purity. The reaction comprised a ligation step employing lyases and a subsequent reduction step using oxidoreductases. Either in an aqueous buffer or an organic solvent, the potentially biobased aldehydes acetaldehyde, propanal, butanal, and pentanal were used as substrates. Here, all possible stereoisomers of 2,3&#8208;butanediol, 3,4&#8208;hexanediol, 4,5&#8208;octanediol, and 5,6&#8208;decanediol were produced with isomeric content values between 72% and &gt;99%, and concentrations between 4.1 and 115&#8197;mM. This work shows how four symmetric, chiral, vicinal diols can be synthesized by combining enzymes in a modular way, including exemplarily scaling.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aminoquinazolines through I2&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of 2&#8208;Aminoaryl Ketone Oximes and Isocyanides</title>

Abstract
An I2/cumene hydroperoxide (CHP)&#8208;mediated tandem cyclization of 2&#8208;aminoaryl ketone oximes with isocyanides has been developed. Various 2&#8208;aminoquinazolines were obtained in 49&#8211;96% yields under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, and the resulting 4&#8208;phenylquinazolin&#8208;2&#8208;amines show typical fluorescent emission properties. The key to the success of this strategy involves the formation of iminyl radical via the N&#8722;O bond cleavage of hydroxy oxime.

Abstract
Phosphorus Fluoride Exchange (PFEx) is a new click chemistry technology that hinges on the creation of innovative hubs to unlock its potential and broaden its applications. In this study, we outline some guiding principles for PFEx hub development and validate these principles by developing a new hub, 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyclotriphosphazenes (SACPs). These SACPs serve as versatile PFEx hubs with stable functionality and orthogonal reactivity, exemplifying their utility within the Diversity Oriented Clicking (DOC) framework. We demonstrate that SACPs interact with various 1,3&#8208;dipoles, enabling the synthesis of phosphorus&#8208;rich compounds through sequential cycloaddition and PFEx reactions, thus pioneering new synthetic routes for wide application of click chemistry.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Engineering of Oleate Hydratase for the Synthesis of Small Chiral Alcohols without Decoy Molecule</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Small and chiral secondary alcohols are sought&#8208;after compounds that are frequently used in the synthesis of biologically active compounds. However, their stereochemically correct synthesis remains a challenge for the chemical industry. Synthetic routes are restrained by multiple steps and thus low atom efficiency. Here we employ engineered variants from the oleate hydratase from E. meningoseptica to produce chiral C5&#8208;C8 secondary alcohols within a single step. First, we established a two&#8208;phase system (2&#8208;PS) to trap the volatile substrates/products which facilitated semi&#8208;rational mutagenesis in the active site and tunnel of the enzyme. These efforts led to variants with an up to 20&#8208;fold increase in catalytic activity and &gt;99% ee, notably, without the use of a decoy molecule. Computational analysis indicated structural changes in the tunnel radius, ligand transport and energy profiles, which gave us hints to explain the enhanced performance of the variants. Interestingly, scaling up the reaction volume demonstrated significant increases in product concentrations, leading up to a 100&#8208;fold increase in comparison to the current benchmark. This new 2&#8208;PS and the engineered enzyme variants offer a promising approach for a scalable, asymmetric hydration of small unactivated alkenes, which would drastically ease the access to chiral alcohol&#8208;based pheromones or drugs.

         <title>Organophotocatalytic Site&#8208;Selective Radical Deuteration at Sterically Hindered Benzylic Positions by Consecutive Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond activation or exchange labeling with hydrogen isotope are of vital importance, in particular for high&#8208;specific&#8208;selectivity deuteration of pharmaceuticals. While catalytic approaches relying on closed&#8208;shell manifolds have been well documented for efficient delivery of deuterium at sterically less hindered benzylic positions, complementary strategies target sterically bulky benzylic positions remain a long&#8208;standing challenge. We herein disclose a mild, versatile approach to achieve efficient and selective radical deuteration by merging organophotoredox catalysis and bromine radical catalysis. This open&#8208;shell strategy provides the unparalleled ability of the convergent unification of readily available quinoxalinones and para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) and D2O through a simultaneous highly cross&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and chem&#8208;selective radical coupling&#8208;H/D exchange approach. Furthermore, the long&#8208;standing challenge of the incorporation of deuterium to sterically bulky benzylic positions has been addressed through this approach.

         <title>Photoredox Hydroacylative Dearomatization of Indoles with Aromatic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein we reported for the first time a photocatalytic dearomative hydroacylation reaction of electron&#8208;deficient indoles with readily available aromatic acids through a phosphoranyl radical&#8208;assisted deoxygenative process. A range of racemic and optically active 2&#8208;acylindoline derivatives were obtained in good yields (up to 94%) with good diastereoselectivity. The synthetic robustness is highlighted by the enantioselective dearomatization of indoles and the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and pharmaceutical molecules. This protocol features broad substrate scope and mild reaction conditions, providing a reliable entry to developing deoxygenative strategies in dearomatization reactions. Preliminary mechanistic studies and DFT calculations suggest that a Giese&#8208;type radical addition pathway should be involved.

         <title>Disclosing the Intra&#8208;Catalyst Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in Tetrahydropyran&#8208;Based Dipeptidic Catalysts</title>

Abstract
Herein, we describe how minor structural modifications to our bifunctional organocatalysts based on sugar amino acids (SAAs) can alter the network of non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) within the catalyst, leading to significant changes in their catalytic activity. This is attributed to the intra&#8208;catalyst NCIs, which induce conformational changes that are reflected in the transition state of the rate&#8208;determining step of the Michael addition of aldehydes to trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes. Through kinetic experiments, conformational analysis, and DFT calculations, we found that the presence of a methoxy group at the C4 position of the tetrahydropyran ring reduces the catalytic activity by a factor of five compared to the catalyst without the methoxy group. Additionally, we have identified the different intra&#8208;catalyst NCIs, both attractive and repulsive, that drive the conformational changes, ultimately modifying the energy levels of the transition states of the rate&#8208; and enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step of the reaction.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;C Coupling of Alkenyl Boronates and Bromodifluoroacetates</title>

Abstract
The reaction of alkenyl boronates and bromodifluoroacetates in the presence of copper powder and TMEDA as the catalytic system was developed. The corresponding C&#8722;C coupling products were obtained in 35&#8211;93% yield. The method tolerated a variety of functional groups, namely, phenol, (thio)ether, protected amino&#8208;, hydroxy&#8208;, ketone, and carboxylic acid moieties, as well as various saturated carbo&#8208; and heterocycles, and was compatible with multigram scale&#8208;up (to 76&#8197;g). The diastereoselectivity of the process was typically low so that ca. 1:1 E/Z isomeric mixtures were formed from pure E or Z alkenyl boronates. Further functional group transformations demonstrated the utility of the prepared compounds as valuable building blocks for synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Based on the obtained results and the literature data, a plausible reaction mechanism was proposed involving the formation of radical and organocopper intermediates.

Abstract
An iodine&#8208;catalyzed C3&#8208;arylation of indoles with cyclohexanones to selectively synthesize 2&#8208;(indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenols has been described. Mechanism studies indicate that the oxygen atom in 2&#8208;(indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenols is originally from DMSO. This cascade involving dehydration condensation, selective oxygenation, dehydrogenation, and aromatization was achieved in one pot under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Organoselenyl Quinolines through the Reduction of Alkynes Mediated by Electrophilic Organoselenium Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A methodology for the synthesis and functionalization of quinolines was developed. This approach involves the cyclization of 2&#8208;amino arylalkynyl ketones to 3&#8208;(organoselanyl)&#8208;4&#8208;iodoquinolines through a sequential reaction pathway. The process includes: (i) in&#8197;situ formation of an electrophilic organoselenyl species, (ii) activation of the alkyne&#8216;s carbon&#8208;carbon bond via a seleniranium ion intermediate, (iii) anti&#8208;nucleophilic attack of iodide on the activated triple bond, and (iv) subsequent condensation. The resulting 3&#8208;(organoselanyl)&#8208;4&#8208;iodoquinolines were demonstrated to be versatile substrates, efficiently undergoing Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling to produce 4&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;quinolines and Ullmann&#8208;type reactions to yield the corresponding sulfides. Furthermore, the 4&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;quinolines were readily converted into selenophene derivatives via halogen&#8208;promoted electrophilic cyclization, highlighting the broad applicability of the developed method.
