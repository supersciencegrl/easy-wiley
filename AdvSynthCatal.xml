         <dc:description>Cyanoimines (C=N&#8208;CN) are eliciting increased attention because of their extensive presence in medicine and biologically active molecules. This study demonstrated the use of the electrochemical oxidative carbon&#8208;atom multifunctionalization and N&#8208;cyanation of imine to synthesize (Z)&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;cyano&#8208;N&#8208;carbamimidothioate. This multicomponent reaction showed good step economy, thereby providing a tool to construct various cyanoimines. Moreover, good functional&#8208;group tolerance and large&#8208;scale synthesis were achieved under metal&#8208;free and external&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free conditions, indicating the potential applicability of this methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress in Synthetic Applications of Cyclic Hypervalent Iodine(III) Reagents</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypervalent iodine compounds have found broad
application in modern organic chemistry as reagents and
catalysts. Cyclic hypervalent iodine reagents based on the
benziodoxole heterocyclic system have higher stability
compared to their acyclic analogues, which makes possible
the preparation and safe handling of the reagents with special
ligands such as azido, cyano, and trifluoromethyl groups.
Numerous iodine&#8208;substituted benziodoxole derivatives have
been prepared and utilized as reagents for transfer of the
substituent on hypervalent iodine to organic substrate.
Reactions of these reagents with organic substrates can be
performed under metal&#8208;free conditions, in the presence of
transition metal catalysts, or using photocatalysts under
photoirradiation conditions. In this review, we focus on the
most recent synthetic applications of cyclic hypervalent
iodine(III) reagents with the following ligands: N3, NHR, CN,
CF3, SCF3, OR, OAc, ONO2, and C(=N2)CO2R. The review
covers literature published mainly in the last 5 years.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Radical Reactions of Azo Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Azo compounds have attracted much attention in the past decades, due to their unique properties. Recently, the free radical strategy has been widely applied to the chemical transformations of azobenzenes, dialkyl azodicarboxylates, mainly including hydrogenation and functionalization of N=N double bond, and N&#8208;functionalization reactions via the cleavage of the N=N double bonds. In this review, we systematically summarized these reactions as well as their mechanisms are discussed.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Fluoromethoxylation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Fluoroalkyl ethers have attracted considerable research interest in the fields of pharmaceutical, agrochemical, nuclear imaging and material sciences, forging the development of new synthetic methods to access this class of compounds. Radical fluoroalkoxylation has recently emerged as a promising approach for synthesizing fluoroalkyl ethers. Herein, a solid, easy&#8208;to&#8208;access redox&#8208;active N&#8722;O reagent, 1&#8208;(fluoromethoxy)&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;benzotriazolium triflate (FMBT), serving as a radical source of (mono)fluoromethoxy group under photocatalytic conditions, was introduced. The synthetic potential of FMBT was demonstrated in the functionalization of olefins to access amino and keto&#8208;monofluoromethyl ethers, benefiting the related study in the context of chemical biology and drug discovery.

Abstract
Herein, we present a chiral boro&#8208;phosphate catalyzed atroposelective asymmetric transfer hydrogenation method, leading to a family of axially chiral styrene&#8208;type allylalcohols. This dynamic kinetic resolution approach portrays simple procedure, mild conditions and good enantiocontrol (51&#8211;95% ee), thus providing an important alternative to assemble the challenging atropisomeric aryl&#8208;acyclic alkene scaffolds.

         <dc:description>Herein, we present the effective synthesis of a copper nanoparticle&#8208;graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) composite for the efficient (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;selective transfer semihydrogenation of alkynes. A fluorescence&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput screening method was applied to identify the most synergistic support for &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;generated copper nanoparticles. The derived Cu(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/g&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; system exhibited more than five&#8208;fold increase in the turnover frequency compared to the copper nanoparticle catalyst in the absence of g&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Various alkynes were selectively reduced to the corresponding (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;alkenes under mild reactions conditions, affording up to 99% isolated yields. The present work demonstrates a simple and cost&#8208;effective method for the synthesis of a copper nanoparticle&#8208;g&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; composite for the efficient (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;selective transfer semihydrogenation of alkynes.</dc:description>

Abstract
An approach for the construction of 5&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazines has been developed via base&#8208;mediated [3+3] cycloaddition of in&#8208;situ generated nitrile imines and CF3&#8208;substituted imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides. The metal&#8208;free protocol is characterized by readily available starting materials, mild conditions, a broad substrate scope, high efficiency, good synthetic prospect, and scalability.

         <title>Synthesis of 4&#8208;Phosphinylpyrrolidin&#8208;3&#8208;ones via [3+2] Cycloaddition of Nitrones with Phosphinylallenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A variety of 4&#8208;phosphinylpyrrolidin&#8208;3&#8208;ones was prepared via a [3+2] cycloaddition between aryl aldonitrones and phosphinylallenes. The products were isolated as unique 4,5&#8208;trans diastereomers, in yields between 47% and 80%, over 23 examples. In the case of chiral racemic allenes, a 2:1 to 4:1 moderate 2,5&#8208;diastereoselectivity was observed. Under the reaction conditions, the cycloadducts directly undergo a rearrangement to afford selectively the corresponding pyrrolidin&#8208;3&#8208;ones. DFT calculations provide some insights into the mechanism, involving the homolytic cleavage of the N&#8722;O bond of the cycloadduct.

         <title>Diversity&#8208;Oriented Synthesis of Spiro&#8208; and 3&#8208;Methylene&#8208;hydroquinoline&#8208;Indandiones via an Organobase&#8208;Controlled Cascade Strategy</title>

Abstract
The catalyst&#8208;controlled diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of spirohydroquinoline&#8208;indandiones and 3&#8208;methylenehydroquinoline&#8208;indandiones from ortho&#8208;sulfonamidophenyl&#8208;substituted para&#8208;quinone methides and allylidene&#8208;indandiones is reported. The strategies utilized an organobase such as DMAP or TMG to control the reaction pathway chemoselectively, furnishing the corresponding products in 40&#8211;99% yields with excellent diastereoselectivities. The mechanistic studies revealed that spirohydroquinoline&#8208;indandione was the kinetic product to afford 3&#8208;methylenehydroquinoline&#8208;indandione in the presence of TMG, which probably involved an unusual base&#8208;initiated 1,3&#8208;nitrogen rearrangement process.

         <title>Differentiating the Allyl and Propargyl Groups on &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Carboxylic Acids via Chiral Bifunctional Sulfide&#8208;Catalyzed Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic kinetic resolution of racemic organic compounds is a reliable method to enantioselectively prepare important chiral molecules. Substrates for the kinetic resolution, however, generally required significantly different substituents at a chiral center. Catalytic kinetic resolution of racemic molecules possessing two similar substituents at a chiral center has remained a formidable challenge. In this context, we became interested in the catalytic kinetic resolution of racemic compounds bearing both allyl and propargyl groups, which are similar but useful substituents, at a chiral center. Herein, we report a kinetic resolution of &#945;&#8208;allyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;propargyl carboxylic acids bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter via chiral bifunctional sulfide&#8208;catalyzed bromolactonization. The synthetic utility of the resultant optically active compounds obtained via kinetic resolution was also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Aryl Isoxazolidines by Photo&#8208;Promoted N&#8208;Selective Arylation of Oximes and Cyclization Using Hypervalent Iodine Reagents and Copper Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oximes undergo photo&#8208;promoted, copper&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;selective arylation with diaryl iodonium salts to produce nitrones, which in turn undergo intra&#8208; or intermolecular 1,3&#8208;dipolar cyclization with olefins to afford N&#8208;aryl isoxazolidines. Hypervalent iodine reagents substituted with either electron&#8208;rich or electron&#8208;deficient groups afford the corresponding N&#8208;aryl isoxazolidines in 26&#8208;95% yields. This method offers a faster reaction rate, lower catalyst loading and broader substrate scope of oxime than similar nitrone syntheses employing Chan&#8211;Lam&#8211;Evans coupling. The reaction involves via a radical/single electron transfer (SET) pathway, and does not proceed in the absence of photoirradiation.</dc:description>

This method offers a faster reaction rate, lower catalyst loading and broader substrate scope of oxime than similar nitrone syntheses employing Chan&#8211;Lam&#8211;Evans coupling. The reaction involves via a radical/single electron transfer (SET) pathway, and does not proceed in the absence of photoirradiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Decarboxylative Direct Formylation of Nitrogen Heterocycles (Azaindoles, Indoles, Pyrroles) and Anilines Utilizing Glyoxylic Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A new method for formylation of nitrogen heterocycles overcoming the limitations of classical approaches using a cheap feedstock formylating agent especially under mild and neutral conditions is the subject of this current investigation. This work describes direct formylation of nitrogen heterocycles (azaindoles, indoles, pyrroles) and anilines using glyoxylic acid as the formyl source and K2S2O8 as the exclusive reagent. The key features include a general method for both C&#8208; and N&#8208;formylation under neutral and mild reaction conditions. The application of the method is further demonstrated in the tandem synthesis of nitrogen heterocycles, pharmaceuticals, and a natural product. Unlike aroylation with arylglyoxylic acids, a previously unknown pathway for the direct formylation with glyoxylic acid in the presence of K2S2O8 is now unveiled.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral &#945;&#8208;Amino Ketones via Transition Metal Catalyzed or Photoredox Cross&#8208;Coupling and Olefin Photo&#8208;Cleavage Reaction Sequence</title>

Abstract
We report a convenient two&#8208;step approach to &#945;&#8208;amino ketones involving cross&#8208;coupling and oxidative cleavage sequence. The cross&#8208;coupling reaction creates a divergent functionalization of the molecular platform, e.&#8201;g., N&#8208;(2&#8208;bromoallyl)amine, whereas the oxidative cleavage establishes the carbonyl functionality. This strategy allows for an introduction of aryl/heteroaryl and alkyl groups, either through the Suzuki reaction with arylboronic acids or via dual photoredox/Ni&#8208;catalysis to install alkyl groups. The oxidative cleavage to provide target &#945;&#8208;amino ketones can be realized either by treating with ozone or by employing milder photochemical protocols involving oxygen or photoexcited nitroarenes as oxidants. We successfully demonstrate the scalability of this protocol, which, together with its simplicity, generality, and its ability to provide access to amino ketones that are inaccessible through other strategies, highlights the suitability of this approach for a wide range of applications across the different chemical sciences.

         <title>Iron(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Cyanoalkylsulfonylation/Annulation Cascades toward Functionalized Sulfonylated Pyrrolidone Alkylnitriles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Under heating conditions, an iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyanoalkylsulfonylation/cyclization reaction is developed to produce cyanoalkylsulfonylated pyrrolidones bearing with a free CN moiety. This alkyl radical disconnection and cascade annulation protocol enjoys chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity with the tolerance toward a range of functional groups. The reactive cyanoalkyl radical, which was originated from the ring&#8208;opening reaction of a cyclic imine radical, was found to be capable of capturing the in&#8208;situ generated &#8220;SO2&#8221; species from DABSO, thus leading to the production of a cyanoalkyl sulfonyl radical and the subsequent alkene annulation sequences.

The protocol could be performed on a gram&#8208;scale with a relatively low catalyst loading (2000 S/C) and the resulting products allow for several useful transformations, in particular for the synthesis of chiral drugs, such as, (S)&#8208;Orphenadrine and (S)&#8208;Neobenodine. Deuterium labeling and control experiments revealed that the RuPHOX&#8208;Ru&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation is fully subject to hydrogenation with H2 as the sole hydrogen source.

Abstract
Herein, we report a solvent&#8208; and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, iodine&#8208;catalyzed formation of C&#8722;S (sulfone) bonds for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;keto sulfones using readily accessible methyl ketones and sulfonyl hydrazides. This study also features the &#945;&#8208;functionalization of &#946;&#8208;keto sulfones to synthesize &#946;&#8208;keto thiosulfones and &#945;&#8208;iodo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto sulfones via iodine&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8208;sulfide (C&#8722;S) bond formation under solvent&#8208;free conditions and iodine&#8208;mediated C&#8722;I bond formation under aqueous conditions, respectively. The analytical studies and control experiments allow insights into a free&#8208;radical coupling strategy. Overall, the presented protocol is operationally simple and scalable, has a broad range of functional group tolerance, and provides access to three functionalized organic scaffolds.

Abstract
Herein we disclose a catalytic asymmetric dearomatization reaction of &#946;&#8208;naphthols with 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3,5&#8208;diones. A chiral phosphoric acid with spiro motif was found to be effective for this reaction. The chiral urazole embedded naphthalenones having both axial and central chirality were obtained in good to high yields (70&#8211;85%) with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (&gt;20:1, 8&#8211;96% ees), having C&#8722;N rotational energy barrier 31.54&#8197;K.Cal.mol&#8722;1 and t1/225&#8201;&#176;C=589.8&#8197;years. The scope of the reaction was broad and few applications including a bromo&#8208;amination reaction have been demonstrated.

Abstract
A new N&#8722;F reagent, N,N&#8242;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium bis(tetrafluoroborate), for iodoarene&#8208;catalyzed fluorination reactions as a terminal oxidant is reported. This reaction is effective for the fluorination of simple alkenes, aromatic alkenes and 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds, giving 1,2&#8208;difluorinated alkanes, geminal difluorinated compounds, 2&#8208;fluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds in good to high yields, respectively. This is a useful fluorination reaction that not only improves the issues of the fluorination reaction using conventional mCPBA as a terminal oxidant but also constructs a simpler catalytic cycle. The present N&#8722;F reagent can be recovered as 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine.

         <dc:description>A mechanochemical nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular difunctionalization reaction of alkene tethered aryl halides with alkyl halides is herein described. This method allows for synthesis of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted heterocycles, namely oxindoles, with shorter reaction times than solution&#8208;phase counterparts. Additionally, this process is solvent minimized, with DMA used in liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG) quantities and circumvents the need for chemical activation of the terminal reductant (manganese) through mechanical grinding. The process can be scaled up to yield over a gram of product and modest enantioinduction is possible by utilizing a chiral PyrOx ligand.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>One&#8208;pot (CF3CO)2O/K2CO3&#8208;mediated tandem cyclocondensation of &#946;&#8208;ketosulfones with carboxylic acids provides diversified 3&#8208;sulfonylchromones in good to excellent yields by refluxing MeCN under high&#8208;pressure (using a sealed tube) and dry&#8208;nitrogen atmospheric conditions. This study proposed and discussed a plausible mechanism. The paper also described the formation of 3&#8208;sulfonylflavones and gram&#8208;scale synthesis of 3&#8208;sulfonylchromones. Various combinations of anhydrides and bases&#8208;promoted reaction conditions were investigated for the (4+2) annulation via one carbon&#8208;oxygen (C&#8208;O) bond and one carbon&#8208;carbon (C=C) bond formations.</dc:description>

This study proposed and discussed a plausible mechanism. The paper also described the formation of 3-sulfonylflavones and gram-scale synthesis of 3-sulfonylchromones. Various combinations of anhydrides and bases-promoted reaction conditions were investigated for the (4+2) annulation via one carbon-oxygen (C-O) bond and one carbon-carbon (C=C) bond formations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Organocatalytic Addition of Nitromethane to Trifluoromethyl Aryl Ketimines Promoted by Electron&#8208;Rich Bifunctional Iminophosphoranes</title>

Abstract
Thiourea&#8208;based iminophosphorane (BIMP) organocatalysts featuring SPhos&#8208; or BIDIME phosphine units have been developed and successfully applied in the asymmetric addition of nitromethane to N&#8208;Boc&#8208;protected trifluoromethyl aryl ketimines. &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl &#946;&#8208;nitroamines were obtained in 40&#8211;82% isolated yields and 80&#8211;95% enantioselectivities. A careful evaluation of the catalytic activity of BIMPs indicates that the catalysts derived from the combination via Staudinger reaction of a chiral 1,2&#8208;amino alcohol&#8208;derived thiourea&#8208;organoazide with electron&#8208;rich phosphines, promote the aza&#8208;Henry reaction on fluorinated ketimines with the highest enantioselectivity, leading to the amine featuring a tetrasubstituted stereocenter in up to 95% ee. The reaction was performed also on gram scale, without loss of enantioselectivity.

Abstract
Two visible&#8208;light mediated protocols (based on a copper photoredox catalyzed and on a photochemical reaction, respectively) for the preparation of aryl thiocyanates and aryl selenocyanates from arylazo sulfones are presented herein, by exploiting the peculiar photoreactivity and redox activity of such substrates. The developed reactions take place in good to satisfactory yields and with a large scope.

         <title>Photoinduced Radical Cyclization of 1,6&#8208;Diynes: Rapid Access to Highly Substituted Carbocyclic and Heterocyclic Compounds</title>

Abstract
We have developed photoinduced sulfonyl radical&#8208;triggered cyclization of 1,6&#8208;dynes without metals, oxidants, or additives. During the reaction, three new bonds are formed (&#8722;SO2&#8722;C, C&#8722;C, and C&#8722;I/C&#8722;Se&#8722;) under mild conditions, with excellent selectivity. The conversion is temporally and atomically economical and is easy to handle even on a gram scale. Detailed mechanistic studies showed that the reaction proceeds via a radical pathway. Subsequent synthetic transformations of the new products produced various substituted compounds. Importantly, we observed an unprecedented and selective C&#8722;C single bond cleavage with boronic acid insertion under Suzuki reaction conditions.

Abstract
An access to functionalised eight&#8208;membered carbocyclic ring compounds was developed by simply stirring an unusual vinylogous Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropane (DAC) in boiling o&#8208;xylene. Both experimental and computational studies were performed to explain the diastereoselectivity/regioselectivity transfer observed and to provide an overall picture of the mechanism.

Abstract
L&#8208;Methionine is the unique sulfur&#8208;containing amino acid essential for humans and animals, which is widely used in pharmaceutical, food and feed industries. Its green and efficient production has attracted a great deal of attention. Fermentation&#8208;enzymatic coupling route is regarded to be promising for L&#8208;methionine biosynthesis, while O&#8208;succinyl&#8208;L&#8208;homoserine mercaptotransferase (MetZ) is the key biocatalyst. Exploring and engineering of MetZ with ideal catalytic properties is highly desired. Herein, the MetZ from Chromobacterium violaceum (CvMetZ) was screened and through in silico analyses, potential beneficial amino acid residues both at the access channel and around the oxygen anion holes were anchored for site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis. The positive mutants were obtained with improved activity for L&#8208;methionine biosynthesis using O&#8208;succinyl&#8208;L&#8208;homoserine (OSH) and methyl mercaptan as substrate. The best mutant was further applied for L&#8208;methionine production and supply of methyl mercaptan was optimized in a fed&#8208;batch approach. The conversion of 100&#8197;g/L OSH reached 92% with L&#8208;methionine yield of 62.6&#8197;g/L, which was well coupled with the OSH fermentation level.

Abstract
An operationally simple aqueous phase three&#8208;component photochemical strategy for the alkylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with diethyl &#945;&#8208;bromomalonate and unactivated alkenes in the absence of both photoredox catalysts and additive has been developed. This reaction is driven by the photochemical activity of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes formed by quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and diethyl &#945;&#8208;bromomalonate. Irradiation with visible light triggered single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) from the quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones to the diethyl &#945;&#8208;bromomalonate, inducing the formation of the corresponding alkyl radical and the subsequent radical tandem reaction. It provides an efficient way to construct alkylated quinoxalinones from simple small molecules.

Abstract
Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed chelation&#8208;assisted C8&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkenylation and alkylation of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tretrahydroquinolines with styrenes and allylic alcohols have been realized. The cationic Rh(III) catalytic system in combination with a catalytic amount of copper acetate uses oxygen as the terminal oxidant and catalyzes the stereoselective C8&#8208;alkenylation of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines with styrenes to give the corresponding products in 56&#8211;93% yields with wide substrate scope and broad functional group compatibility. The reaction can be scaled up. Moreover, this protocol can be extended to the C8&#8208;alkylation of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines with allylic alcohols, providing access to various 8&#8208;(3&#8208;oxoalkyl)&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines in 77&#8211;90% yields. The selection of N&#8208;directing group is essential for catalysis, and the readily installable and removable N&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrimidyl) group proves to be optimal choice. Preliminary mechanistic studies are performed to gain insights into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Switchable Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Ring Contraction of Cyclooctatetraene Oxide Towards the Enantioselective Synthesis of Cycloheptatrienyl&#8208;Substituted Homoallylic Alcohols and Oxaborinanes</title>

Abstract
The ability of cyclooctatetraene oxide to undergo two sequential ring contraction events under mild conditions, using Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis, has been studied in detail. We have found that the selectivity can be controlled by the acidity of the catalyst and by the temperature, being able to obtain selectively either the cycloheptatriene carbaldehyde product, arising from a single ring&#8208;contraction event, or phenylacetaldehyde that is formed after a second ring contraction process. A complete mechanistic picture of the reaction and a rationale behind the influence of the catalyst is provided based on both experimental and computational data. Finally, this acid&#8208;catalyzed ring contraction has been coupled with an in&#8197;situ enantioselective allylation reaction, delivering enantioenriched cycloheptatrienyl&#8208;substituted homoallylic alcohols when it is carried out in the presence of a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst. These homoallylic alcohols have also been converted into enantioenriched oxaborinanes through copper&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic borylation/cyclization protocol.

         <title>Gold and Biocatalysis for the Stereodivergent Synthesis of Nor(pseudo)ephedrine Derivatives: Cascade Design Toward Amino Alcohols, Diols, and Diamines</title>

Abstract
The combination of gold(I) and enzyme catalysis has provided access to a series of nor(pseudo)ephedrine derivatives in a regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner. The approach involves developing IPrAuNTf2&#8208;catalyzed hydration of 1&#8208;phenylprop&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;yl acetate or N&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylprop&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;yl)acetamide, followed by (dynamic) asymmetric biotransamination or bioreduction of the corresponding keto ester or keto amide intermediates. Enzyme actions were completely selective towards the modification of the methyl ketones in a highly stereoselective manner, allowing the synthesis of enantio&#8208; and diastereomerically enriched products using either racemic or optically active starting materials. Thus, a series of amino alcohol, diol, and diamine derivatives were produced from propargyl esters or amides (57 to 86% isolated yield), the biocatalyst of choice determining the (stereo)selectivity of the overall cascade process (70&#8211;99% diastereomeric excess and &gt;98% enantiomeric excess), and providing access to nor(pseudo)ephedrine compounds in a straightforward manner.

Abstract
Being in its infancy, radical cross&#8208;coupling is highly efficient for C&#8722;C bond construction, though suffers from selectivity problems and limited reaction types. New methodologies to realize radical cross&#8208;coupling selectively are highly desired. Herein, an iron catalyzed deconstructive cyanomethylation of unstrained cyclic and linear alcohols with acetonitrile has been developed through radical cross&#8208;coupling. The unprecedented method enables a ring&#8208;opening functionalization of cyclohexanols to produce &#945;&#8208;cyanomethyl ketones. Notably, the highly challenging reaction involves twice C&#8722;C single bond cleavage through &#946;&#8208;scission of alkoxyl radical intermediates, and twice C(sp3)&#8722;H bond transformation via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) procedures, resulting in two carbon radical species that realize a radical cross&#8208;coupling process to form a new C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond selectively. &#945;&#8208;arylketo and &#945;&#8208;aryl substituted tertiary alcohols can also be applied as substrates, leading to terminal cyano&#8208;functionalized linear products, with ketone as the leaving fragment. Mechanistically, a new procedure to generate alkoxyl radical with chlorine radical through the in&#8208;situ formed intermediate cycloalkyl hypochlorite was suggested.

Abstract
Isocyanides (isonitriles or carbylamine) have been intensively used in organic synthesis to prepare a diverse variety of N&#8208;heterocycles on the basis of the carbene&#8208;like reactivity of their divalent carbon atom. Isocyanides participate in a variety of reactions involving one, two, or more isocyanides. Compared to the popularity of single isocyanide reactions, few examples of reactions involving two or more isocyanides have been reported. In this review, we categorized and classified the literatures of reactions involving two or more isocyanides especially double isocyanide insertions under metal&#8208;catalyzed or metal&#8208;free conditions from 2014 to 2022.

Abstract
The preparation of primary amines attracts huge attention in the molecular synthetic community. Indeed, amines play a crucial role in chemistry as they are important substructures in a huge amount of drug molecules, agrochemicals, dyes and molecular materials. Compared to stoichiometric reductions using metal hydride based reagents, the catalyzed reduction of nitroarenes, nitriles and carboxamides appears to be an attractive option, mainly when associated to first row transition metals such as manganese, iron, or cobalt. In this short review, we illustrate the progress achieved in homogeneous hydrogenation, hydrogen transfer, hydrogen borrowing and hydrosilylation of nitroarenes, nitriles and carboxamides.

Abstract
A synthesis of 1,4&#8208;diborylated benzenes was achieved by the Ru&#8208;catalyzed regioselective co&#8208;cyclotrimerization of alkynes with a commercially available ethynyl boronate. The reaction is applicable to a wide array of alkynes with metal&#8208;coordinating groups, providing synthetically useful diborylated benzenes in 23&#8211;68% isolated yields. DFT calculations shed light on the reaction course and the origin of its remarkable regioselectivity. Selected diborylated benzenes were converted into various products, such as quinones and hydroquinones, including three natural bioactive small molecules.

         <title>Sulfonamide as Photoinduced Hydrogen Atom Transfer Catalyst for Organophotoredox Hydrosilylation and Hydrogermylation of Activated Alkenes</title>

Abstract
Readily available, sterically, and electronically tunable sulfonamides have been developed as effective photoinduced hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysts for selective Si&#8722;H functionalizations of a broad range of silanes. N&#8208;centered radicals, catalytically generated from sulfonamides by photoredox catalyzed single&#8208;electron oxidation, are the key intermediates that enable an effective HAT process for silyl radical generation to achieve hydrosilylation of activated alkenes. Additionally, this catalytic system can also be applied for the activation of Ge&#8722;H bond for hydrogermylation of activated alkenes through hydrogen atom transfer by sulfonamide derived nitrogen centered radical. The ability to generate silyl and germyl radical using this photochemical HAT process offers new avenue towards the sustainable synthesis of organosilicon and organogermanium compounds.

         <title>Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted Benzofuran via HNTf2/TMSOTf Catalyzed Intermolecular Reaction of o&#8208;alkenyl phenols and Aldehydes</title>

Abstract
The synthetic methods of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted benzofurans have been widely studied, however, the maneuvers of using o&#8208;alkenyl phenols as starting materials are less explored. Herein, we report a general and efficient strategy via HNTf2/TMSOTf catalyzed cascade reaction with readily available o&#8208;alkenyl phenols and aldehydes as starting materials, which provides 2,3&#8208;disubstituted benzofuran derivatives in moderate to good yields. This method features metal&#8208;free circumstances, broad substrate scope, mild reaction conditions, and easy scale preparation.

Abstract
Iridium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;alkylation of methyl ketones with primary carbohydrate alcohols proceeded via borrowing hydrogen strategy. Protected sugar derivatives having one free primary hydroxyl group reacted with methyl ketones to give the &#945;&#8208;alkylation products or alkylated 4,5&#8208;unsaturated sugars along with the elimination of an alkoxy group.

         <title>Multicomponent Tandem Triple Functionalization of Indoles via a Directing&#8208;group&#8208;free Strategy</title>

Abstract
The position&#8208;selective functionalization of the poorly reactive benzenoid nucleus of indoles has remained a great challenge in organic chemistry. Here we describe a directing&#8208;group&#8208;free, three&#8208;component tandem C3&#8208;acylation/C5,6&#8208;H disulfenylation of indoles via an iodine&#8208;, Lewis acid&#8208; and Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;cooperated mediated strategy. This protocol is remarkable for its exceptional regio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;selectivity, broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance and mild reaction conditions. Advantageously, the present protocol offers great potential for the development of general site&#8208;selective functionalization at the benzenoid nucleus of indoles, removing the requirement for neighbouring activating groups.

         <title>Biocatalytic Transamination of Aldolase&#8208;Derived 3&#8208;Hydroxy Ketones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although optical pure amino alcohols are in high demand due to their widespread applicability, they still remain challenging to synthesize, since commonly elaborated protection strategies are required. Here, a multi&#8208;enzymatic methodology is presented that circumvents this obstacle furnishing enantioenriched 1,3&#8208;amino alcohols out of commodity chemicals. The carbon backbone is forged by a Type I aldolase, which was subsequently subjected to enzymatic transamination. A panel of 194 TAs was tested on diverse nine aldol products prepared through different nucleophiles and electrophiles. Due to the availability of (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;selective TAs, both diastereomers of the 1,3&#8208;amino alcohol motif were accessible. A two&#8208;step process enabled the synthesis of the desired amino alcohols with up to three chiral centers with de up to &gt;97 in the final products.</dc:description>

         <title>CH&#8208;Functionalization of Heterocycles with the Formation of C&#8211;O, C&#8211;N, C&#8211;S/Se, and C&#8211;P Bonds by Intermolecular Addition of Heteroatom&#8208;Centered Radicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the last decade, free radicals have found a wide application in functionalization of unsaturated compounds, such as alkenes, alkynes, and arenes, via the free&#8208;radical addition to carbon&#8211;carbon &#960;&#8208;bonds. In these processes, intermolecular free&#8208;radical attack on the aromatic substrates represents a challenge due to relatively high resistance of aromatic &#960;&#8208;system to addition reactions in comparison to alkene C=C bonds. The free&#8208;radical functionalization of heterocycles is especially interesting due to the diversity of their structures and chemical properties as well as their importance for medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and materials science. Addition of C&#8208;centered radicals to heterocycles is widely known as the Minisci&#8208;type reactions and well&#8208;reviewed. In this paper, we have summarized the main achievements in less explored group of processes: functionalization of heterocycles by intermolecular addition of heteroatom&#8208;centered radicals (O&#8208;, N&#8208;, S&#8208;/Se&#8208;, and P&#8208;radicals) with the emphasis on the papers published after 2010. Literature analysis revealed the strong trend towards the usage of electrochemistry and photoredox&#8208;catalysis for the generation of free radicals in recent years. The remaining fundamental problem in this field is the lack of strong experimental support for the proposed mechanisms and frequent existence of several plausible reaction pathways. The progress in mechanistic studies can significantly improve the prediction of optimal reaction conditions depending on the substrates structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Geminal/Vicinal Amino&#8208; and Oxy&#8208;Trifluoromethylation of ortho&#8208;Ethynyl Anilines and Phenols by Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports geminal amino&#8208; and oxy&#8208;trifluoromethylation of ortho&#8208;ethynyl anilines/phenols by phenCu(III)(CF3)3 (phen denotes 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), which constructs indole and benzofuran skeleton with concurrent incorporation of a CF3 group to the C2 position. Sequential trifluoromethylation of the terminal alkyne followed by 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization of amino/hydroxyl with alkyne is involved. This method addresses the troublesome regioselectivity issue in C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of arenes/heteroarenes wherein complicated mixtures of regioisomers were often obtained. A competing vicinal fluoro&#8208;trifluoromethylation of terminal alkynes is suppressed under the optimal conditions wherein the Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 compound acts as a bifunctional reagent to provide both CF3 and F. Interestingly, when an acylamino group is present at the ortho&#8208;position of phenylacetylene, vicinal syn&#8208;amidate&#8208;trifluoromethylation of the alkyne group occurs preferentially through 6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization to produce benzoxazines with a trifluoroethylidene at the C4&#8208;position. The controllable and concise synthesis of valuable trifluoromethylated N&#8208; and O&#8208;heterocyclic compounds shows the synthetic value of Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 compounds in medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Stepwise (4+2) Cycloaddition toward Chiral Fused Uracil Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism of the previously reported stereoselective (4+2) cycloaddition of N&#8208;protected 6&#8208;methyluracil&#8208;5&#8208;carbaldehydes and (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes catalyzed by Takemoto's tertiary amine/thiourea organocatalyst was explored, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations on a model representative reaction. The cyclization reaction, which afforded notable enantioenriched carbocycle&#8208;fused uracils embedding three contiguous stereocenters, was here proven to be the result of a four&#8208;step sequence comprising a key stereo&#8208;defining Michael addition, followed by a completely diastereoselective intramolecular Henry reaction. Going beyond the hitherto reported activation modes, a complex and unprecedented network of hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between the chiral catalyst and the reaction partners has been disclosed, in which the protonated tertiary amine and the thiourea moiety of the catalyst simultaneously activate both the electrophile and the nucleophile components. By applying the Energetic Span Model (ESM) to four competitive energetic profiles, we unveiled the most plausible reaction pathways best fitting the experimental data, envisaging almost perfectly the observed enantiomeric ratio of the product, with close correlation with the observed enantiomeric ratio of the product.</dc:description>

         <title>COAP&#8208;Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Linear Allylic Alkylation of Vinyl Benzoxazinanones for Multifunctional 3,3&#8242;&#8208;Disubstituted Oxindole Derivatives</title>

Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective linear&#8208;allylic alkylation of vinyl benzoxazinanones with a series of 3&#8208;substituted oxindoles was reported in the presence of a chiral oxamide&#8208;phosphine ligand (COAP&#8722;Bn) under mild reaction conditions. A series of optically active multifunctional 3,3&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted oxindole derivatives bearing a quaternary stereogenic center and a linear aryl amino side chain were respectively obtained in 55&#8211;98% yields with 96&#8211;99% ee for 3&#8208;(hetero)aryl substituted oxindoles. The developed protocol demonstrates that the COAP ligands could serve as a privileged chiral ligand to construct diverse chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindole compounds with various quaternary stereogenic centers, such as aza&#8208;, thio&#8208; or all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic centers. The salient features of the method include broad substrate scope, N&#8208;protecting group free, base&#8208;free, and high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.

&lt;p&gt;A Pd-catalyzed enantioselective linear-allylic alkylation of vinyl benzoxazinanones with a series of 3-substituted oxindoles was reported in the presence of a chiral oxamide-phosphine ligand (COAP&#8722;Bn) under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Base&#8208;Controlled Chemoselective Reaction of High&#8208;Valent Cu(III)&#8722;CF3 Compounds with Anilines: Access to Formamides or Hydrazines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
This study reports reactivity properties of Cu(III)&#8722;CF3 compounds with anilines, wherein basicity&#8208;dictated distinct reactivities are achieved, giving rise to formamides or hydrazines. Competing generation of difluorocarbene and N&#8208;centered radical is proposed that is controlled by the basicity of the reaction solution. Specifically, under acidic or neutral conditions, reaction of anilines with Cu(III)&#8722;CF3 compounds produces formamides, where difluorocarbene is involved, undergoing aniline formylation. In contrast, in the presence of a base, this same reaction selectively gives hydrazines instead, where Cu(III)&#8722;CF3 compounds act as an oxidizing reagent to allow dehydrogenative N&#8722;H/N&#8722;H coupling of two anilines through an N&#8208;centered radical. The scope of both reactions is studied, and application to medicinally relevant compounds is shown. This study shows the unusual use of high&#8208;valent Cu(III) trifluoromethyl compounds as hydrogen&#8208;abstracting reagents to allow dehydrogenative reactions.

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Dehydrogenation of Substituted Cyclohexanones to Phenols</title>

Abstract
The preparation of substituted phenols via a direct carbonyl desaturation is an intrinsic challenging task in modern synthetic chemistry. Herein, we develop a modular catalytic protocol for the synthesis of substituted phenols via the direct dehydrogenative aromatization of simple cyclohexanones in a metal&#8208;free manner. A broad variety of substrates bearing an assortment of functional substituent groups are compatible with this protocol. Preliminary mechanistic investigations revealed that the reaction underwent a hydride leaving mechanism in the presence of a catalytic amount of tetrabutylammonium iodide. The current approach features simple operation, low reagent cost and green conditions. Insight gained from our studies is expected to advance general efforts towards the green synthesis of structurally diverse phenols via readily available raw materials, offering an alternative strategy for the carbonyl desaturation in organic synthesis.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Application of C2&#8208;Symmetric Cycloglycerodiphosphate Catalysts</title>

Abstract
Chiral phosphoric acids (CPAs) and their salts are the privileged catalysts in a plethora of asymmetric transformations. All of the scaffolds of efficient CPAs rely on C2&#8208;symmetry and axial chirality, while the only examples of punctually chiral CPAs are TADDOL derivatives. Herein, we present the design and the synthesis of C2&#8208;symmetric cycloglycerophosphates (cGPAs) and their application throughout the addition of trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) to aldehydes and ketones, to obtain the corresponding cyanohydrins in yields between 77 and 99% and ee between 84.2 and 99.5% (27 examples). A DFT computational model is moreover performed to rationalize the reaction mechanism and its stereochemical outcome.

Abstract
In this protocol, we apply reductive cobalt catalysis in the allylic defluorinative cross&#8208;electrophile coupling reaction between 1,1&#8208;difluoroalkyl halides and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes. This reaction features broad substrate scope (39 examples), good tolerance of various functionalities, and circumvention of pregenerating organometallics, offering a general synthetic route to prepare diverse organofluorines incorporating both a gem&#8208;difluoroalkene and a gem&#8208;difluoroalkane moiety.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Substituted 4&#8208;Quinolones via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;N Coupling and Base&#8208;Promoted Reactions</title>

Abstract
A highly efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of N&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;quinolones was developed via C&#8722;N coupling reaction. Various chiral quinolones were readily obtained with desirable enantioselectivity (up to 95% ee) and excellent yield (up to 99%), enabled by a simple system of palladium acetate and chiral ferrocene bisphosphine as auxiliary ligand. The corresponding racemic derivatives can also be synthesized by a transition metal&#8208;free strategy of potassium hydroxide in DMSO. The influence of temperature on the configurational stability of these C&#8722;N axially chiral compounds was also investigated. The efficient functionalization at 3&#8208;position further expands the application range of this synthetic technique.

Abstract
An oxidative [3+2+1] cyclization of enaminones and N&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidinone is described for the synthesis of 4&#8208;alkylated 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (1,4&#8208;DHPs). By using terminal olefin as the C4 source of the 1,4&#8208;DHP skeleton, this synthetic strategy provides a series of 1,4&#8208;DHPs through a 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization/cyclization process. In this protocol, two C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bonds and a C(sp2)&#8722;N bond are simultaneously formed, the hydrogen source on the newly formed methyl group of the 1,4&#8208;DHP skeleton is confirmed and a possible mechanism is proposed.

         <title>Condition&#8208;Controlled Divergent Synthesis of Imidazoindolone Spiroisoquinolinones from N&#8208;Alkoxycarboxamide Indoles and Diazo Homophthalimides</title>

Abstract
Presented herein is a condition&#8208;controlled divergent synthesis of imidazoindolone spiro&#8208;isoquinolinones (IISIQs) via the cascade reactions of N&#8208;alkoxycarboxamide indoles with diazo homophthalimides. When the reaction is carried out under air and in the absence of an acid additive, IISIQ tethered with a N&#8208;alkoxy moiety (IISIQ&#8208;OR) is formed through Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H metalation, carbene formation/ migratory insertion followed by reductive elimination, in which air acts as an oxidant to regenerate the Rh(III) catalyst. When the reaction is run under argon and in the presence of MesCO2H, on the other hand, IISIQ&#8722;H is formed through rhodacycle intermediate formation, carbene insertion followed by acid&#8208;assisted intramolecular substitution/annulation and N&#8722;O bond cleavge. In general, this method provides a divergent approach toward spiroheterocyclic scaffolds and features accessible substrates, functional group compatibility and air as an external oxidant. Moreover, the value of this developed protocol is further showcased by gram&#8208;scale synthesis and structural transformation of products.

Abstract
Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation of arenes for oxidative annulations with alkynes stands out as a protocol for polycyclic scaffolds. This perspective drives us to disclose herein a rhodium catalyzed regioselective triple annulation of enaminones with hydroxyl&#8208;alkynoates via double C&#8722;H functionalization for polycyclic naphtho&#8208;pyran scaffolds. Secondary coordination of OH in alkynoate dictated the regioselectivity. Initial lactonization occurred chemoselectively on to enamine part via carbo rhodation followed by reductive elimination. This protocol was scalable and has shown high functionality tolerance. KIE studies were done to get insight in to the mechanism, and some downstream transformations were achieved to show the synthetic potential of the method.

Abstract
A practical electrochemical Minisci&#8208;type reaction for the synthesis of silylated heterocycles is described. Using N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) as the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalyst and trialkylsilanes as the silyl radical sources, a wide range of electron&#8208;deficient heterocycles in&#8208;cluding quinoline, quinoxaline, phthalazine, 3,6&#8208;dichloropyridazine, phenanthridine, 6&#8208;chloroimidazo[1,2&#8208;b]pyridazine and coumarin, etc. were easily converted to the corresponding silylated products in 37&#8211;83% yields.

         <title>RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3&#8208;Catalyzed Isomerization of Homoallyl Silyl Ethers and Carbonates to Allyl Silyl Ethers and Carbonates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The selective olefin isomerization of homoallyl silyl ethers and carbonates was studied using RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 as a catalyst. While an aryl or alkyl substituent at the &#945;&#8208;position to the oxygen atom caused the selective conversion to allyl silyl ethers, no substituent at the &#945;&#8208;position resulted in the isomerization to enol silyl ethers. In contrast, the isomerization of homoallyl carbonates gave the corresponding allyl carbonates selectively regardless of the substituent at &#945;&#8208;position.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Benzylation of Carbonyl Compounds Enabled by Synergistic Copper/Amine Catalyzed Decarboxylation of Arylacetic Acids</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report synergistic copper/amine&#8208;catalyzed reactions for directly &#945;&#8208;benzylating carbonyl compounds with arylacetic acids. These reactions represent the first examples of decarboxylative oxidative synergistic transition&#8208;metal/enamine catalysis for &#945;&#8208;functionalizing carbonyl compounds. The process features starting&#8208;material availability, good functional group tolerance, mild reaction conditions, and good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. Dibenzylated products were formed in moderate yields under slightly altered reaction conditions, and some products were transformed into 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indole derivatives by acid&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular cyclization reactions with indoles. Moreover, biological studies revealed that some products have anticancer properties and may be useful in drug&#8208;discovery studies.

         <title>Electrochemical Dearomative Amination of Phenol Derivatives: Access to Spirooxazolidinones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An electrochemical oxidative approach to spirooxazolidinones from phenol derivatives via intramolecular dearomative amination reactions is developed. This reaction proceeds without metal catalysts and external chemical oxidants, and shows broad substrate scope and diverse functional group compatibility. The synthetic utility of this strategy is further exhibited by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage functionalization. By slightly tunning the reaction conditions, the alcohols (1&#176;, 2&#176; and 3&#176;) can be afforded from phenol derivatives, which is a good strategy for the deprotection of para&#8208;methoxyphenyl (PMP) group to recover the alcohol function.

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component synthesis of 3&#8208;(arylsulfonyl)benzothiophenes was developed. The reaction did not require any catalysts or additives. The desired products were obtained via an intramolecular radical cyclization. Acetic acid was employed as the solvent and a quencher for side reactions involving methyl radicals. Moreover, inexpensive potassium metabisulfite was used as a sulfur dioxide surrogate. This process provides more opportunities for synthesizing benzothiophene derivatives, which are found in many bioactive compounds.

         <title>Synthesis of Fluoroalkylated Pyrrolidines through Neat Reaction of Fluoroalkyl Iodides with N, N&#8208;Diallylamines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We presented a cascade transformation of N, N&#8208;diallylamines and fluoroalkyl iodides into various functionalized fluoroalkylated pyrrolidines through a visible light&#8208;induced synthetic process in the solvent&#8208;free conditions. In this reaction system, the substrate N, N&#8208;diallylamine acted both as the base and the electron donor. We further demonstrated the practicality of this protocol by the direct modification of amino acids and pharmaceutical molecules.

In this reaction system, the substrate &lt;i&gt;N, N&lt;/i&gt;-diallylamine acted both as the base and the electron donor. We further demonstrated the practicality of this protocol by the direct modification of amino acids and pharmaceutical molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Recent Advances in Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor (EDA)&#8208;Complex Reactions involving Quaternary Pyridinium Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quaternary pyridinium compounds are valuable intermediates in organic synthesis, which have gained immense popularity in the synthetic community. The application of transition metal or photoredox catalysis in transforming quaternary pyridinium compounds into various C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X bonds is well established. A majority of these methods require high temperatures, expansive catalysts, and delicate conditions for successful execution. On the other hand, the use of transition metal&#8208;free and photocatalysis&#8208;free strategies in constructing C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X bonds using quaternary pyridinium derivatives has been sought&#8208;after. In this context, the electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA)&#8208;complex reactions have emerged as a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic synthetic methodology, which do not require any photocatalyst for their successful execution. EDA&#8208;complex photochemistry takes advantage of the electron&#8208;acceptor ability of quaternary pyridinium derivatives, which can quickly generate a radical precursor via the deaminative process. These newly generated radical intermediates are useful in several valuable transformations. We hereby, in this review, discuss an area of major progress in EDA&#8208;complex mediated reactions involving quaternary pyridinium compounds with mechanism, substrate scope, and limitations.

         <title>Multifaceted Domino Knoevenagel&#8208;Cyclization Reactions; Four Movements for 2H&#8208;Chromenes and Chromans</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Domino Knoevenagel&#8208;cyclization reactions of 2H&#8208;chromene and chroman derivatives containing o&#8208;formylaryl amine or ether side&#8208;chain was carried out to produce four series of chiral condensed heterocycles representing four novel skeletons and exhibiting antiproliferative activity. The cyclization step occurred with four different mechanisms: a concerted intramolecular hetero Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (IMHDA), a stepwise polar [2+2] cycloaddition, a [1,5]&#8208;hydride shift&#8208;6&#8208;endo cyclization or a multi&#8208;step nitro hetero Diels&#8208;Alder&#8208;ring&#8208;opening&#8208;Cadogan&#8208;type cyclization sequence. The latter reaction provided a new route to hydroxyindoles by an inverse Cadogan&#8208;type cyclization, in which the nitro group is deoxygenated by a nitro IMHDA&#8208;ring&#8208;opening sequence. The cyclization mechanisms and their stereoselectivity were studied by DFT calculations, based on which we proposed a mechanism for the multi&#8208;step cyclization to hydroxyindoles and explained the observed diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Highlighting the Rich Chemistry of the Allenone Moiety</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Conjugated and non&#8208;conjugated allenones appear as recurring motifs in organic synthesis, natural products and mechanistic investigations showing unique properties and applications. The ability of allenones to build cycles has provided a direct access to strained systems, medium&#8208;sized rings, arenes, heterocycles and complex polycycles. In addition, allenones have served as models in mechanistic investigations and catalysis. The critic compilation herein presented will provide an exhaustive overview of the synthetic possibilities allenones may offer, which certainly will inspire our community in their search of more efficient synthetic methodologies, preparation of biological and pharmaceutical targets, and improve our knowledge in theoretical organic chemistry. Great part of this review will discuss synthetic aspects, catalysis innovation and mechanistic insights of the chemical transformations implying the allenone motif. In addition, many examples on total synthesis and pharmacologically active compounds will be described. We hope that this overview will be attractive to the organic chemistry, synthetic chemistry, catalysis, theoretical chemistry, natural products and medicinal chemistry communities.

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot strategy for the synthesis of substituted isocoumarin, flavone, and isoquinolinedione derivatives through a switchable C&#8208;arylation/lactonization or SNAr reaction from a wide range of soft nucleophiles and o&#8208;quinol acetates has been developed. This base&#8208;mediated protocol proceeds under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions and selectively affords various heteroarenes in 13&#8211;98% yields from readily prepared or commercially available 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl and &#945;&#8208;EWG&#8208;substituted carbonyl compounds. The synthetic utility is further demonstrated in the synthesis of potential anti&#8208;HIV and anti&#8208;coronavirus derivatives and COX&#8208;2 inhibitors. In addition, detailed experimental and computational studies are performed to provide an intensive understanding and strong support of the reaction mechanism.

The front cover picture, designed by Tsuchimoto, illustrates the world of the formation of o&#8208;bis(3&#8208;indolyl)arenes that we had not anticipated. Before starting this research project, our purpose was to develop a unique&#8208;forming process of 3&#8208;arylindoles by reacting indoles with 7&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept&#8208;5&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;one in the presence of a (Lewis) acid catalyst and H&#8722;Si. Contrary to our expectations, the treatment of the two substrates in the presence of catalyst CF3SO3H but without H&#8722;Si was found to yield o&#8208;bis(3&#8208;indolyl)arenes with structural diversity. Details can be found in the Research Article presented by Tsuchimoto and co&#8208;workers (R. Tokunaga, T. Okusa, T. Tsuchimoto, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2023, 365, xxxx&#8211;xxxx; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202201340)

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalytic system is described in which achiral Ni is immobilized on mesoporous silica material with external addition of a chiral modifier enabling continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective reactions with catalyst&#8208;packed bed reactors. Continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective 1,4&#8208;addition reactions of dimethyl malonate with nitroalkenes proceeded with co&#8208;feeding of a chiral diamine ligand, and the corresponding products were obtained in high yields with high enantioselectivities for more than 80 h with a turnover frequency of 3.1 h&#8211;1 based on [Ni].</dc:description>

         <title>Short and Scalable Synthesis of Plant&#8208;Based Cholesterol in GMP Grade</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A plant&#8208;based straightforward and short four&#8208;step synthesis of cholesterol starting from commercially available diosgenin is reported. This offers a large&#8208;scale production of highly needed GMP&#8208;grade cholesterol, which is part of the lipid cocktail for the assembly of effective mRNA&#8208;based vaccines against the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. These lipids are formulated into the delivery system of the mRNA fragments by forming Lipid Nano Particles (LNP) that introduce the mRNA into the cells. Cholesterol plays a crucial role because it stabilizes LNP and facilitates endosome escape of the mRNA into the cytosol.

         <title>Advancements in the Preparation of 4H&#8208;Chromenes: An Overview</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Functionalized 4H&#8208;chromenes represent one class of the most important structural scaffolds in both synthetic and medicinal chemistry. They often appear in an arrange of biological natural products, pharmaceutical agents and drug candidates. The significance has stimulated the development of efficient methodologies for the synthesis of such compounds. In this review, a comprehensive discussion on different synthetic approaches to 4H&#8208;chromenes has been presented with an emphasis on reaction features and mechanisms. Three main categories are outlined: 1) nucleophilic addition to 2H&#8208;chromene derivatives, 2) 4H&#8208;chromene ring formation involved cycloaddition or cyclization reactions, and 3) miscellaneous reactions.

         <title>Cyclic Diaryliodonium Salts: Eco&#8208;Friendly and Versatile Building Blocks for Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Cyclic diaryliodoniums are an important class of high&#8208;valent aromatic iodine reagents for the synthesis of various axially chiral biaryls and biaryl compounds. Moreover, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed annulation has been established for the construction of various heterocyclic rings and ladder&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with readily available cyclic diaryliodoniums as the starting materials. As halogen&#8208;bonding donors, cyclic aryliodoniums have been explored as organocatalysts in a variety of organic reactions. In this review, the application progress of cyclic diaryliodoniums has been systematically outlined, which highlights recent developments in the application reactions of cyclic diaryliodoniums, including synthetic application, limitations and reaction mechanisms in representative cascade reactions to provide insights for the development prospects of cyclic diaryliodoniums.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Cyclization of Spirocyclopropanes with Stabilized Phosphorus Ylides: Access to Indane and Azulene Skeletons</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
In this study, regio&#8208; and diastereoselective ring&#8208;opening cyclization of spirocyclopropanes with phosphorus ylides stabilized by electron&#8208;withdrawing groups were developed. The reaction of various cyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione&#8208;2&#8208;spirocyclopropanes with phosphorus ylides bearing alkoxycarbonyl groups proceeded smoothly without any additives to provide the corresponding 6,7&#8208;dihydroindan&#8208;4&#8208;ones in 32&#8211;87% yields. Cycloheptane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione&#8208;2&#8208;spirocyclopropanes were also used in this reaction, producing the corresponding products 1,2,3,6,7,8&#8208;hexahydroazulen&#8208;4&#8208;ones in 52&#8211;67% yields. The resulting [5.6]&#8208; and [5.7]&#8208;fused carbocyclic products were readily converted into highly substituted indanes and azulenes, respectively, by oxidation.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
This review outlines the most noteworthy achievements of the last few years in the renascent field of positional and geometrical isomerization of alkenes using iron catalysis, from a mechanistic perspective. Particular attention will be placed on the developments beyond the seminal contributions of iron carbonyl complexes and on their mechanistic aspects underlying the nature of the active iron species. The relevant literature has been covered until late 2022.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed One&#8208;Pot Cycloisomerization/Nucleophilic Addition/Rearrangement of Acenaphthylene Carbaldehyde Derivatives</title>

Abstract
Merging the latest advances in the field of gold catalysis and the efficiency of hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP), a gold&#8208;catalyzed orthogonal tandem reaction has been developed to access carbocyclic ketone on naphthalene substrates. The methodology involved a cycloisomerization/nucleophilic addition and a C&#8594;O rearrangement. The HFIP solvent most probably acted as a Lewis&#8208;acid on isochromene derivatives, through hydrogen donor bond activity. A large range of acenaphthylene carbaldehyde has been engaged in this process coupling gold catalysis and Lewis&#8208;acid behavior of HFIP leading to cyclic ketones with a yield ranging from 15 to 91% (27 compounds). The mechanism was investigated, and the reaction most presumably occurred via a classical cyclization process followed by a [Au]&#8208;HFIP interaction for the final rearrangement. The interest of such transformation was demonstrated by performing it on a gram&#8208;scale. Moreover, a post&#8208;functionalization bromination was performed, as well as the isomerization of some functionalized ketones leading to full trans derivatives with a yield ranging from 78 to 90% yields.

Abstract
We described an Rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed divergent C&#8722;H bond functionalization of N&#8208;aryl amidines with iodonium ylides. Carbazolones and zwitterionic salts were diversely constructed through intermolecular annulation and intramolecular proton transfer under the different reaction conditions. This protocol is operationally simple and tolerates a variety of functional groups. The efficient post&#8208;modification of pharmaceutical molecules demonstrates its practicability.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Trisubstituted Piperidines via Biocatalytic Transamination and Diastereoselective Enamine or Imine Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Substituted piperidine rings are a common motif in natural products and pharmaceutical drugs. The asymmetric synthesis of piperidines bearing multiple stereocentres remains a challenge, and current approaches often rely on lengthy reaction sequences and &#8216;chiral pool&#8217; strategies. Herein, we report multi&#8208;enzymatic and chemo&#8208;enzymatic methods that allow the preparation of piperidines with three chirality centres in only two steps from achiral diketoester precursors. Stereocontrol is achieved by a highly enantioselective transamination leading to optically pure (ee &gt;99%) enamine or imine intermediates, followed by diastereoselective reduction of these unsaturated N&#8208;heterocycles using either platinum(0)&#8208;catalysed flow hydrogenation or enzymatic imine reduction. In the latter case, coupling of the two biocatalytic reactions in a concurrent one&#8208;pot process is possible, thus reducing the synthetic sequence to a single biotransformation. In total, nine trisubstituted piperidines were prepared in high stereoisomeric purities (dr &#8805;98:2) and isolated yields of up to 73%. Lead&#8208;likeness analysis of five representative products using an open&#8208;source webtool suggests that these compounds possess considerable application potential as building blocks in drug discovery.

         <title>A Scalable Synthesis of Chiral Himbert Diene Ligands for Asymmetric Catalysis.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates that intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition of a simply attained chiral allenecarboxanilide affords the pseudoenantiomeric alkenyl bromides shown, which can be readily functionalized to give diverse chiral &#8220;Himbert diene&#8221; ligands.

         <title>Synthesis of o&#8208;Bis(3&#8208;indolyl)arenes under Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalysis: Carbonyl Compounds as Sources of Aryl Groups</title>

Abstract
A method of synthesizing o&#8208;bis(3&#8208;indolyl)arenes was developed by reacting indoles with 7&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept&#8208;5&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;one and derivatives thereof having no aromatic ring. All 23 unknown o&#8208;bis(3&#8208;indolyl)arenes could be obtained using this method. Palladium catalysis is useful for enlarging the &#960;&#8208;conjugated area of o&#8208;bis(3&#8208;indolyl)arenes, delivering aryl&#8208;, alkynyl&#8208;, and alkenyl&#8208;unit&#8208;installed o&#8208;bis(3&#8208;indolyl)arenes, and benzo[c]indolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazoles, the derivatization to which is effective for raising fluorescence quantum yield. A possible reaction mechanism is proposed based on several mechanistic studies.

Abstract
Chiral dienes are important ligands in asymmetric catalysis but they are less accessible than other commonly used ligands such as chiral bisphosphines. Here, we show that intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition of a simply attained chiral allenecarboxanilide readily affords pseudoenantiomeric bicyclo[2.2.2]octa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dienes containing an alkenyl bromide, which can be readily functionalized to give diverse chiral diene ligands. The synthesis is straightforward and easily conducted on multigram scales. These ligands exhibit high performance in nine types of enantioselective Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;addition or 1,2&#8208;addition reactions.

         <title>Oxidative Annulation of Aldehydes, 5&#8208;Aminopyrazoles, and Nitriles: Synthesis and Applications of Pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;d]Pyrimidines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The oxidative [3+2+1] annulation reaction of aldehydes, 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles, and nitriles is achieved under the oxidation of I2/O2, affording various valuable pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidines in 27%&#8211;91% yields. The salient feature of this reaction is transition&#8208;metal free, operationally simple, broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and gram&#8208;scalable. Remarkably, the corresponding products exhibited intriguing photophysical properties such as Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and showed good potential to specifically light up lipid droplets (LDs) in living cells with bright fluorescence, low cytotoxicity, and good photostability.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Construction of Fluorinated Chiral Alcohols via Sequential Substitution/Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Bromoarylketones and Fluoroalcohols</title>

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot synthesis of fluorinated chiral alcohols from &#945;&#8208;bromoarylketones and fluoroalcohols is described. The fluorinated ketone intermediates were formed from &#945;&#8208;bromoarylketones with fluoroalcohols as nucleophiles and solvents, which were reduced subsequentially by adding a chiral Ru catalyst and a mixture of formic acid and triethyl amines (FA: TEA=1.1:1) as hydrogen donor to give 27 examples of fluorinated chiral alcohols in 60&#8211;93% yields and 85&#8211;98% ee values. Notably, K3PO4 acts as a base in nucleophilic substitution and an additive in reductive step to enhance the reactivity and enantioselectivity, which is crucial for constructing compatible conditions for one&#8208;pot process. This one&#8208;pot process is also applicable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

         <title>Unexpected Stereoselective Access to 2&#8208;Aminooxazolines from Propargyl Ureas by Silver Salts under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Propargyl ureas can lead to a range of possible heterocyclic compounds, mainly depending on the employed catalyst. Silver salts are known to promote the N&#8208;5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization mode to imidazolidinone derivatives. Conversely, a versatile and stereoselective O&#8208;5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization of propargyl ureas to 2&#8208;aminooxazolines by Ag(I) catalysis is here disclosed. Good to excellent yields and complete stereoselectivity of the external double bond have been achieved under milder reaction conditions (50&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C). A one&#8208;pot protocol starting from the corresponding propargylic amines and isocyanates has been developed as well. N,N&#8217;&#8208;Dipropargyl ureas underwent a uncommon O&#8208;5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig/N&#8208;5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig double cyclization sequence. Finally, insights into the tautomeric equilibrium of 2&#8208;aminooxazoles and on their relative reactivity are provided.
