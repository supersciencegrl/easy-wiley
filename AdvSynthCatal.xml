         <title>PTC in the polyenolate&#8208;mediated [10+2]&#8208;cycloaddition for the synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acid precursors</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. The manuscript describes a formal [10+2] higher&#8208;order cycloaddition between 2&#8208;benzylideneindan&#8208;1&#8208;ones and &#945;&#8208;alkilidene azlactones as higherene precursors and  higherenofiles respectively. The reaction is realized under Br&#248;nsted&#8208;base catalysis utilizing the phase transfer catalysis approach. The key intermediate is an isobenzofulvene&#8208;derived polyenolate which acts as a 10&#8208;electron component in the higher&#8208;order cycloaddition. By using this strategy, a series of structurally diverse compounds containing a polycyclic hydrocarbon scaffold was prepared in 79&#8208;99% yields. In addition, the potential of the obtained [10+2]&#8208;cycloadducts has been confirmed by transformations, including the synthesis of a highly&#8208;valuable alpha,alpha&#8208;disubstituted N&#8208;protected alpha&#8208;aminoester.</dc:description>

The reaction is realized under Br&#248;nsted-base catalysis utilizing the phase transfer catalysis approach. The key intermediate is an isobenzofulvene-derived polyenolate which acts as a 10-electron component in the higher-order cycloaddition.

         <title>Enantiocomplementary Synthesis of Tetrahydrofurans by Engineered Halohydrin Dehalogenases</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral tetrahydrofurans are prevalent structural motifs in biologically active compounds, approved drugs and natural products, but relevant enantiocomplementary synthesis remains underdeveloped. In this study, wild type halohydrin dehalogenase HheC from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1, was first discovered to enable the intramolecular substitution of &#948;&#8208;halohydrins for the formation of tetrahydrofurans but with unsatisfied activity and stereoselectivity. Through structure&#8208;guided protein engineering, two completely enantiocomplementary variants T134M and P84L/W139A of HheC were obtained for the synthesis of tetrahydrofurans by the kinetic resolution of &#948;&#8208;halohydrins (both giving products with up to 99% e.e., E &gt;200). This research unveiled the halohydrin dehalogenases&#8217; catalytic ability to form chiral cyclic ethers larger ring size than three&#8208;membered epoxides, which has hitherto been unexplored, and provided an enzymatic synthesis access to valuably enantiocomplementary tetrahydrofurans.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Electrochemical Redox/Condensation Reaction between 2&#8208;Amino Nitrobenzenes and Aliphatic Alcohols: An Approach to Benzimidazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tandem reactions via electrocatalytic annulations have emerged as an effective strategy for the construction of heterocycles. Herein, a two&#8208;component electrochemical annulation via sequential reduction, oxidation, and condensation steps to synthesize valuable benzimidazoles motifs is reported.  This reaction, which utilizes electricity as both the oxidants and reductants, tolerates a broad range of functional groups. Detailed mechanistic studies including control experiments, cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis, and key reaction intermediate characterization, reveals an intermolecular electrochemical redox/cyclization pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Difluoroalkoxylation of Imidazopyridines using N&#8208;Fluorobenzenesulfonimide as Fluorinating Agent</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted site&#8208;selective difluoroalkoxylation of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines has been achieved using N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) as a fluorinating agent. This practical reaction has a wide range of substrate scope for both imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines and alcohols to give 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;arylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines in 65&#8208;93% yields. The reaction proceeded at room temperature, showed high functional group tolerance, and was amenable to scale&#8208;up. Based on mechanistic investigation, a radical pathway is proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Substrate Scope and Catalytic Promiscuity of Nitroreductase&#8208;like Enzymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavin&#8208;dependent nitroreductases are gaining attention as biocatalysts for the synthesis of pharmaceutically active compounds and their precursors. Here, we examined a panel of nitroreductase&#8208;like flavoenzymes for their reductase activity towards a wide variety of aromatic and aliphatic nitro compounds, nitroolefins, and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Several of these flavoenzymes displayed high reductase activity and achieved excellent conversion of diverse nitroarenes, nitroolefins and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds, accomplishing good product yields in semi&#8208;preparative scale reactions (up to 97%). In addition to the catalytic promiscuity of several of these flavoenzymes, being able to perform the reduction of nitro groups (nitroreductase activity) as well as C=C groups (ene&#8208;reductase activity), this study also revealed that some flavoenzymes exhibit high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and/or enantioselectivity, making them attractive enzymes for use in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of N2,C3&#8208;disubstituted 2H&#8208;indazoles from readily available 2&#8208;acylazobenzenes via deoxygenation of C=O and annulation has been described. The non&#8208;noble metal catalytic system has good tolerance of functional groups, and various N2,C3&#8208;disubstituted 2H&#8208;indazoles have been constructed in 24% to 99% yield. This reaction is easy to scale&#8208;up and has shown its applications in deriving valuable fluorescent and bioactive compounds. The plausible mechanism shows the plausible processes of molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenative annulation.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Reactions of Ynones with Isothiocyanates for Accessing 2&#8208;Aminothiophenone and Indole&#8208;Fused/Indole&#8208;Substituted Thiophenone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A copper or silver&#8208;catalyzed cascade addition/5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization/isomerization reaction of isothiocyanate with ynone has been developed. This strategy enables the synthesis of a variety of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene&#8208;5&#8208;aminothiophen&#8208;3&#8208;one derivatives with diverse substitutions in a single vessel. The method is featured with pot&#8208;economy and high regio&#8208; and Z&#8208;selectivity. Several biologically active molecules could be modified using this strategy. Moreover, the relevant indole&#8208;fused and indole&#8208;substituted thiophenone derivatives were also assembled in one pot by merging this strategy with other bond formation methods. Based on the experiments and the related reports, a cascade pathway triggered by the addition of ynone&#8208;derived radical towards the C(sp)&#8208;atom of isothiocyanate was proposed to elucidate the probable process of the transformation.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A copper or silver-catalyzed cascade addition/5-exo-dig cyclization/isomerization reaction of isothiocyanate with ynone has been developed. This strategy enables the synthesis of a variety of (Z)-2-ylidene-5-aminothiophen-3-one derivatives with diverse substitutions in a single vessel. The method is featured with pot-economy and high regio- and Z-selectivity. Several biologically active molecules could be modified using this strategy. Moreover, the relevant indole-fused and indole-substituted thiophenone derivatives were also assembled in one pot by merging this strategy with other bond formation methods. Based on the experiments and the related reports, a cascade pathway triggered by the addition of ynone-derived radical towards the C(sp)-atom of isothiocyanate was proposed to elucidate the probable process of the transformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8208;alkyl glycosides play a crucial role in various bioactive compounds. However, the synthesis of C&#8208;alkyl glycosides poses significant challenges, particularly through C(sp3)&#8208;H glycosylation. Here, we report a set of reactions for constructing C&#8208;alkyl glycosides through directing&#8208;group&#8208;mediated functionalization of unactivated &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds under mild conditions. Those reactions not only achieve high regioselectivity and stereoselectivity in glycosylation, but also exhibit a wide substrate scope. They are compatible with both arene and alkane substrates, as well as natural and unnatural amino acid substrates. Mechanistic studies have shown that the directing&#8208;group 8&#8208;aminoquinoline (AQ) and picolinamide (PA) may affect the chirality of the &#946;&#8208;carbon of L&#8208;valine through a sterically favorable trans&#8208;palladacycle intermediate, resulting in (R) or (S) configuration of glycosylated amino acid, respectively. These reactions are promising to provide a convenient and powerful tool for constructing C&#8208;alkyl glycosides and carbohydrate&#8208;based drugs in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrafluoropyridinyl Thiolate as a Tool for Enabling Photoredox Alkylation of 1,2,4&#8208;Oxadiazoles</title>

Abstract
A method for the radical functionalization of 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazoles using alkyl halides as precursors of radicals is described. The reaction efficiency is determined by potassium tetrafluoropyridinyl thiolate additive, which plays dual role. First, the thiolate converts alkyl halides into more reactive fluorinated aryl sulfides, which undergo photoredox activation of the C&#8722;S bond. Second, the thiolate decreases the unproductive loss of alkyl radicals by converting them back to the sulfides.

Abstract
We report here a mild process to access diversely functionalized enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluorinated (S)&#8208;alcohols by using biocatalytic reduction in &gt;99% yield and enantiomeric excesses ranging from 96% to &gt;99%. This novel approach involves enzymatic reduction of &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluorinated heterocyclic and carbocyclic ketone derivatives as well as an acyclic gem&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;ketosulfone and proceeds under mild conditions at 30&#8201;&#176;C under aqueous conditions to produce a range of high added value enantioenriched difluorinated alcohols including 3,3&#8208;difluorochromanol, 3,3&#8208;difluorothiochromanol, 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;dihydroquinolinol, and &#945;&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfone derivatives. A comparative study between enzymatic reduction and metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation was carried out as well.

Abstract
A silver&#8208;catalyzed regioselective one&#8208;pot cyclization reaction of diazo reagents with fluoronitroalkenes was developed. This transformation presents a method for accessing a series of 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;fluoropyrazoles that are substituted with various groups such as trifluoromethyl, carboxylic ester, nitrile, and phosphonate ester. Further synthetic transformations offered the corresponding fluorinated and trifluoromethylated analogues of two fungicide compounds.

Abstract
We are reporting the preparation and use in cross&#8208;coupling reactions of a newly developed, bench&#8208;stable (1&#8208;fluorocyclopropyl)metalloid reagent. The Stille cross&#8208;coupling reaction described for this &#945;&#8208;fluorinated stannane reagent is amenable to a wide range of aryl and alkenyl (pseudo)halides bearing a variety of functional groups. An enantioenriched cross&#8208;coupled product was also obtained from the corresponding 1&#8208;fluorocyclopropyltin reagent bearing an ester handle. Finally, the chemical stability of the 1&#8208;fluorocyclopropyl moiety was also demonstrated by performing several post&#8208;functionalizations.

Abstract
Thiocarbamoyl fluoride is an understudied fluorinated group, mainly due to the paucity of data on its properties. Herein, an in&#8208;depth study of the stability of thiocarbamoyl fluorides, especially under near&#8208;physiological conditions, is described. Since efficient and easy to implement syntheses of these compounds are still under&#8208;described, a new method, based on the use of a trifluoromethanesulfenamide, a well&#8208;described reagent, has also been developed. This trifluoromethanesulfenamide turned out to be able to generate in&#8197;situ difluorothiophosgene, which was able to react rapidly with amines to provide various thiocarbamoyl fluorides.

         <title>Ambiphilic Reactivity of SF5&#8208;Alkynes Applied to Regioselective and Stereodivergent Halogenation Reactions: An Experimental and Theoretical Case Study</title>

Abstract
We explored the ambiphilic reactivity of SF5&#8208;alkynes, and we proved they can act as both nucleophiles and electrophiles. We selected halogenation reactions as benchmark reactions and developed highly selective stereodivergent hydrohalogenation (I, Br, Cl, F) reactions of SF5&#8208;alkynes. The stereochemistry is finely controlled thanks to the nature of the acids used (strong or soft) in the presence of halide source, while the high regioselectivity is governed by the strong polarization of SF5&#8208;alkynes. Mechanistic studies supported by DFT calculations shed light on two different reaction mechanisms responsible of the excellent stereocontrol. This stereoselectivity was quantitatively rationalized with the ASM and EDA methods. A few dihalogenation reactions are reported and DFT calculations rationalize this cis&#8208;stereoselectivity. Relative configuration of all the SF5&#8208;haloalkenes was unambiguously determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Noteworthy, several post&#8208;functionalization reactions such as cross&#8208;couplings, cyanation and reductions are described to strengthen the synthetic potential.

Abstract
We report herein a general one&#8208;pot perfluoroalkylation/dehydrohalogenation protocol for the selective perfluoroalkenylation of silyl dienol ethers in their &#947; position. Importantly, this methodology is applicable to the synthesis of a wide range of &#947;&#8208;perfluoroalkenylated enals, enones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides. Various perfluoroalkenyl moieties could be efficiently introduced, with an important impact on the E/Z diatereoselectivity of the newly formed fluorinated double bond.

         <title>Photocatalytic &#945;&#8208;Difluoroalkoxyketones Synthesis via Radical Intermolecular Alkoxylation of Difluoroenol Silyl Ethers</title>

Abstract
We present a metal&#8208;free photocatalytic approach for the synthesis of difluoroalkoxylatedketones. This strategy involves the generation of alkoxyl radicals from pyridinium salts upon the activity of a catalytic electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex. This mild process tolerates several functional groups and can be scaled up to gram scale. Diverse products manipulations accounts for the versatility of the obtained fluorinated products, highlighting the synthetic usefulness of this method.

Abstract
The enantioselective introduction of gem&#8208;difluorinated carbonyl (i.&#8201;e. &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro carbonyl) moieties into organic structures is a synthetically valuable but highly challenging approach. During the past decades, continuous efforts have been made for the developments of synthetic strategies for constructing C(sp3)&#8722;CF2COR chiral centers with high levels of enantioselectivities. This review summarizes and discusses the recent advance in the enantioselective construction of gem&#8208;difluorinated carbonyl moieties, which are organized according to the reaction categories.

Abstract
A scalable procedure for the synthesis of 4,6&#8208;difluorotryptophan is reported based on a deaminative coupling of a 4,6&#8208;difluorogramine with 2&#8208;benzylthio&#8208;1,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;imidazolone as glycine equivalent. Thus prepared 4,6&#8208;difluorotryptophan was incorporated into the C&#8208;terminal domain of the HIV&#8208;1 capsid protein (CA&#8208;CTD), and 19F spectra of the 4,6&#8208;difluoro Trp CA CTD were recorded and compared to the singly fluorinated counterparts.

Abstract
The direct diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective Ru(II)&#8208; catalyzed cyclopropanation reaction of alkenes with ((2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoroethyl)sulfinyl)benzene was described. The desired enantioenriched PhSO2CF2&#8208;cyclopropanes were obtained in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities in the presence of a chiral ruthenium complex Ru(II)&#8208;Pheox (17&#8211;94% yields, &gt;20:1 d.r. and 83:17&#8211;98:2 e.r.). The robustness of the approach was showcased and This methodology gave access to chiral 1,2&#8208;trans difluoro&#8208;methylcyclopropanes.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Formation of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes Using Oxime Esters</title>

Abstract
In this manuscript a general photocatalytic approach for the synthesis of alkyl&#8208;substituted gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes using readily available oxime esters and 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoroprop&#8208;2&#8208;ene (BDFP) has been established. This strategy involving a radical bromo elimination provides access to a large variety of value&#8208;added fluorinated molecules. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with many functional groups including complex natural products or drug molecules. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic investigations indicate that the efficiency of the process relies on the crucial role of imine radical, which is formed after photoexcitation via energy transfert (EnT) and decarboxylation of the oxime ester. Indeed, the imine radical would either behave as a bromine radical scavenger or an XAT promoter in this reaction.

Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate an Oxa&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 3&#8208;trifluoroacetyl&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;quinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one with aldehydes in the presence of a base to engineer the functionalized pyrano[3,4&#8208;c]quinolones. This reaction proceeds through an in&#8208;situ generated hetero dendralene intermediate and features perfect stereoselectivity on a wide range of substrates with excellent atom economy. The high electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of CF3&#8208;group is responsible for making the methyl group present in quinolone moiety more acidic to furnish the corresponding hetero dendralene intermediate.

Abstract
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed multi&#8208;component reaction of trifluoromethylated &#946;&#8208;amino ketones and nitriles using tert&#8208;butyl nitrite as a diazotization reagent has been developed. Under the optimized conditions, N&#8208;trifluoroalkyl amides were obtained with yields up to 87%. Control experiments and computational studies reveal that the reaction proceeds through the generation of diazo, in&#8197;situ formation of nitrile ylide, water addition and final enol tautomerism. This approach features mild reaction conditions, wide substrate tolerance, and scale&#8208;up applicability, which provides an efficient and practical strategy for amide synthesis.

Abstract
We report the development of a four&#8208;component electrochemical method for the synthesis of CF3&#8208;oxazoles, utilizing alkynes and NaSO2CF3 in MeCN. The method leverages the simplicity and mildness of the reaction conditions, despite the inherent complexity of utilizing four distinct components through aminotrifluoromethylation of alkyne followed by in&#8208;situ cyclization. Notably, in addition to MeCN solvent, the presence of residual water in the reaction mixture also contributed as a coupling partner. The synthesis involves a sequence of four controlled oxidation steps under constant potential with graphite electrodes, facilitated by the mediator TMEDA, highlighting the precision achievable in electrochemistry.

Abstract
The synthesis of indoles with a trifluoromethyl group has attracted a lot of attention because they are promising structural subunits for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. As part of our project aimed toward the upcycling of hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), we developed a method to construct a CF3&#8208;bearing indole ring system through the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of a brominated HFO&#8208;1234ze(E) (CF3CH=CHF) with N&#8208;tosylated o&#8208;borylanilines, followed by nucleophilic 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization at the vinylic position of the generated fluorostyrenes. We found that the Pd2(dba)3/SPhos catalyst system in the presence of K2CO3 and water in toluene afforded the corresponding 3&#8208;CF3&#8208;indoles in high yields in a one&#8208;pot operation.

Abstract
We report the addition reaction of lithium enol ethers to fluoroalkyl imines. A range of different fluoroalkyls and lithiated reagents are well tolerated. Diastereoselective addition of lithium vinyl ethers to fluoroalkyl N&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsulfinylimines is disclosed, providing enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;fluorinated amines in up to 98% yield. This general approach led to the diastereoselective formation of various amino alcohols and amino ethers, which are difficult to obtain by other methods.

         <title>1&#8208;Alkynylphosphorus Compounds in Organic Synthesis&#65292;2010&#8208;2024</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the review of Yorimitsu and Oshima in 2010, the past 15 years have witnessed significant progresses in the application of 1&#8208;alkynylphosphorus compounds in organic synthesis. Owing to the reactive carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond in association with the electron&#8208;withdrawing phosphoryl group, they easily undergo transition metal&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic addition reactions at the &#946;&#8208;position with carbon&#8208; and heteroatom&#8208;based nucleophiles to afford structurally diverse 1&#8208;alkenyl phosphorus compounds.  Especially, when 1&#8208;alkynylphosphonates or phosphinates are used, intramolecular substitution reactions on P&#8208;atom might occur in some cases, which would result in the formation of P&#8208;based heterocycles. In addition, the existing triple bond makes them prone to go through addition reaction initiated cyclization reactions and [2+2], [2+3], [2+4], [2+5] and [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions with other unsaturated bonds, which provides an efficient access to various P&#8208;based heterocycles and phosphorylated carbon&#8208; and heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Direct Decarboxylative Functionalization of Aromatic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl radicals are important intermediates in organic synthesis. The generation of these reactive species via direct decarboxylation of inexpensive and readily available aromatic carboxylic acids is an attractive goal. However, such a process intrinsically exhibits high energy barriers to overcome, which in consequence usually require precious metal catalysis,   stoichiometric oxidants and harsh conditions, suffering from limitations such as poor functional group tolerance and low atom economy. In recent years, visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photochemical reactions have provided new approaches to address this challenge. Three major strategies have been introduced in this emerging field: 1) one&#8208;pot in&#8208;situ activation of benzoic acids to generate intermediates such as benzoyl hypobromites or hypoiodites; 2) the use of specialized photocatalysts like biphenyl/1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene to promote decarboxylation through photo&#8208;induced electron transfer or charge transfer processes; 3) photo&#8208;induced LMCT (Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer) strategy where copper or iron salts coordinate to the carboxylate anion and generate aromatic radicals upon visible light excitation. 
On the basis of these three strategies, this review will systematically summarize the development of visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced direct decarboxylative functionalization of aromatic carboxylic acids, focusing on the reaction mechanism and substrate scope, and discuss their prospects in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Initiated Uranyl&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation and Hydrosulfonylation of Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study investigates the visible&#8208;light&#8208;initiated uranyl(VI)&#8208;catalyzed activation of Si&#8208;H bonds through direct hydrogen atom transfer, which facilitates the formation of silyl radicals from silanes. The silyl radical can abstract a chlorine atom from the sulfonyl chloride, leading to the generation of sulfonyl radicals. These silyl radicals and sulfonyl radicals could react with alkenes and alkynes, achieving the first example of uranyl&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation and hydrosulfonylation of unsaturated C&#8208;C bonds. This method features mild reaction conditions and a broad substrate scope, and exhibiting exceptional functional&#8208;group tolerance. Consequently, it is suitable for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Multisubstituted Hydroindole Derivatives via [3 + 2] Annulations of p&#8208;Quinamines with Nitroalkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of two stereoisomers of hydroindole derivatives was achieved through [3 + 2] annulations of p&#8208;quinamines with nitroalkenes. Catalyst&#8208;free or in the presence of DMAP, the annulation reactions were employed to produce the target products containing four contiguous stereogenic centers. This method enables efficient assessment of multisubstituted and functionalized hydroindole derivatives using readily accessible building blocks and reagents. Furthermore, the anti&#8208;inflammatory activity of some resulting hydroindoles was evaluated, with three derivative products showing effective inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Spirocyclic Compounds via Electrochemical Intramolecular Dearomatization of Benzene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The spirocyclic framework is found in many natural products, some of which are biologically active. However, It remains a challenge to develop environmentally friendly and atom&#8208;economic synthetic methods. Herein, we report an intramolecular dearomatization reaction of benzene derivatives enabled by electrochemistry&#8208;mediated two successive single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer (SET) processes, providing an alternative method for the rapid construction of spirocyclic skeletons without using sacrificial reagents. A series of cyclohexadiene products were obtained in 25&#8208;81% yields. Furthermore, a proposed mechanism involving a sequential electron transfer event was supported by cyclic voltammetry experiments. This strategy features transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions and easy handling, which will greatly enhance its practical utility.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Borobenzylation of Vinyl Arenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, catalytic difunctionalization of vinyl arenes is reported using iron salt as a catalyst without ligands. A series of substituted alkylboronic acid esters was obtained as a single regioisomer from vinyl arenes at 50 &#176;C. This multicomponent protocol enabled the formation of C&#8211;C and C&#8211;B bonds to produce boroalkylated products in a single process. A non&#8208;radical pathway is proposed for the reaction in contrast to the radical pathways of iron&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation reactions. The organoboron compounds generated from this reaction were further utilized for diverse functional group conversions.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Wavelength&#8208;Dependant Sequential Ring Transformations of Pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazolones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report new sequential wavelength&#8208;selective photochemical transformations of 1&#8208;alkenylpyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazolones to pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a][1,2]diazepines or cyclobuta[c]pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazolones. Irradiation of 1&#8208;alkenylpyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazolones with visible&#8208;light (blue LED, 457 nm) induced selective &#8216;ring switching&#8217; transformation into pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a][1,2]diazepines, which, upon irradiation with UV A light (black LED, 365 nm) underwent electrocyclisation into cyclobuta[c]pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazolones. Due to the very narrow irradiation wavelength now available from OLED sources, the selective formation of either 5,7&#8208;bicyclic or 5,5,4&#8208;tricyclic ring systems from the 5,5&#8208;bicyclic starting material is possible simply by changing the wavelength of the irradiation source. The transformations took place under mild conditions in the absence of additives or photocatalysts. Mechanistic studies indicate that these transformations proceed through the formation of an excited triplet state of the substrate, followed by selective homolytic C(1)&#8211;N(8) bond cleavage, intersystem crossing, and cyclization of the zwitterionic intermediate on the ground potential energy surface. Subsequent photoinduced disrotatory stereospecific 4&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization of the 5,7&#8208;bicyclic systems leads to 3D&#8208;rich 5,5,4&#8208;tricyclic products.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Allylation of Cyclic Ketones with Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric &#945;&#8208;allylation of ketones is a particularly useful tool for constructing stereocenters via C&#8722;C bond formation. However, this type of reaction often necessitated the use of activated ketones or pre&#8208;prepared enol intermediates as substrates. In this study, we developed a nickel&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;allylation of unactivated cycloketones with allylic alcohols to synthesize chiral cycloketones with an &#945;&#8208;quaternary carbon center. The reaction affords the products with 42&#8211;97% yields, 72&#8211;86% ee, and no additive is needed, and the only by&#8208;product is water.

&lt;p&gt;Transition-metal-catalyzed asymmetric &#945;-allylation of ketones is a particularly useful tool for constructing stereocenters via C&#8722;C bond formation. However, this type of reaction often necessitated the use of activated ketones or pre-prepared enol intermediates as substrates. In this study, we developed a nickel-catalyzed &#945;-allylation of unactivated cycloketones with allylic alcohols to synthesize chiral cycloketones with an &#945;-quaternary carbon center. The reaction affords the products with 42&#8211;97% yields, 72&#8211;86% ee, and no additive is needed, and the only by-product is water.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
The development of novel strained spiro heterocycles (SSHs) as bioisosteres for aromatic or non&#8208;strained aliphatic rings is highly sought after for improving drug design. Their high molecular rigidity and predictable vectorization can enhance drug&#8208;likeness, target selectivity and clinical success. Towards this goal, 1&#8208;oxa&#8208;2,6&#8208;diazaspiro[3.3]heptane (ODASE) is reported as a novel potential SSH&#8208;bioisostere. We demonstrate through theoretical studies the potential of this strained spiro heterocycle to act as a bioisostere for piperazine. We have developed its synthesis from the highly strained azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl intermediate through a robust and mild flow technology&#8208;assisted two&#8208;step protocol. Its tolerance and stability towards medicinally relevant N&#8208;functionalisation protocols are studied, as well as its mild reduction to the C3&#8208;aminoalkylazetidinol motif found in the anti&#8208;cancer drug cobimetinib.

Abstract
An enantioselective tandem sequence that comprises a cycloaromatization process followed by an intramolecular desymmetrizing Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of functionalized cyclohexadienones has been accomplished. The process takes place in good yields (65&#8211;95%), with excellent diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1) and enantiomeric ratios up to 90.5:9.5 in the presence of (R)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived N&#8208;triflyl phosphoramides, and it gains access to a family of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives in a simple manner, with the simultaneous generation of two vicinal stereocenters, one of them a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter.

Abstract
A direct visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted radical&#8208;triggered tandem cyclization of 1,7&#8208;diene systems with cyclic sulfonium salts by using copper(I)&#8208;based complexes as photoredox catalyst is developed. With this approach, a variety of sulfur&#8208;containing polycyclic derivatives are prepared through alkylation/6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization/5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization of 1,7&#8208;diene systems under mild conditions. In addition, the photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening of cyclic sulfonium salts provides the alkyl radical intermediates, which prefers addition to the C&#8722;C double bond that connected to the aromatic ring rather than the electron&#8208;deficient vinyl in 1,7&#8208;dienes. Moreover, oxidation of the desired sulfur&#8208;containing polycyclic products provides a strategy for the preparation of remote nitrogen&#8208;fused polycyclic substituted sulfoxide or sulfone&#8208;containing derivatives.

         <title>Manganese Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Hydroxymethylation to 2&#8208;Pyridones and Isoquinolones via C&#8722;H Activation</title>

Abstract
Pyridine&#8208;directed regioselective C&#8722;H hydroxymethylation to pyridones and isoquinolones using para&#8208;formaldehyde has been developed under manganese catalysis, offering a wide variety of hydroxymethylated products in 40&#8211;85% yields. This operationally simple methodology proceeds in one step using an earth&#8208; abundant first&#8208;row transition metal&#8208;catalyst without the generation of unwanted salt wastes. A mechanistic study revealed that the C&#8722;H metalation step is reversible but not the rate&#8208;determining step. The introduction of hydroxymethyl group in the biologically relevant scaffolds could be used as an intermediate for valuable synthetic transformations.

Abstract
2&#8208;(chalcogen)benzothiazoles are frequently used as core structures for the development of pharmaceutical agents. A strategy for the synthesis of 2&#8208;(chalcogen)benzothiazoles under electrooxidative conditions using isocyanides, thiols or diselenides as substrates was developed. This protocol allows access to structurally diverse 2&#8208;(chalcogen)benzothiazoles in good yields and with good functional group tolerance, which does not require heavy metal catalysts and exogenous oxidants. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale synthesis was performed to demonstrate the scale&#8208;up applicability of this reaction.

         <title>Radical Difunctionalization of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons Employing the Same Functional Reagent</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The radical difunctionalization of unsaturated hydrocarbons serves as an efficient means to rapidly construct molecular skeletons and synthesize&#8208;highly valuable compounds. In this transformational process, diverse positions within unsaturated hydrocarbons are sequentially functionalized by a single radical precursor reagent, thereby achieving highly efficient and selective transformations that promote atom economy. Furthermore, this approach minimizes the generation of numerous byproducts stemming from cross&#8208;coupling reactions between reactants, owing to the reduction of the number of participating components. Therefore, this review provides an in&#8208;depth analysis of the radical difunctionalization of unsaturated hydrocarbons utilizing a single functional reagent in recent decades. The discussion is based on eight different radical classes (carbon&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, phosphine&#8208;, oxygen&#8208;, sulfur&#8208;, selenium&#8208;, tellurium&#8208;, and chlorine&#8208;centered radicals), emphasizing the mechanism of specific radical difunctionalization. It also analyzes in detail the regulation of key factors such as regional selectivity, and provides unique insights into reaction transformations.

In this transformational process, diverse positions within unsaturated hydrocarbons are sequentially functionalized by a single radical precursor reagent, thereby achieving highly efficient and selective transformations that promote atom economy. Furthermore, this approach minimizes the generation of numerous byproducts stemming from cross-coupling reactions between reactants, owing to the reduction of the number of participating components. Therefore, this review provides an in-depth analysis of the radical difunctionalization of unsaturated hydrocarbons utilizing a single functional reagent in recent decades. The discussion is based on eight different radical classes (carbon-, nitrogen-, phosphine-, oxygen-, sulfur-, selenium-, tellurium-, and chlorine-centered radicals), emphasizing the mechanism of specific radical difunctionalization. It also analyzes in detail the regulation of key factors such as regional selectivity, and provides unique insights into reaction transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formal Olefinic C&#8722;H Phosphinylation via Alkenyl Sulfonium Salts</title>

Abstract
Formal olefinic C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling between alkenyl sulfonium salts and secondary phosphine oxides and H&#8208;phosphinates has been developed. A base enables construction of alkenyl C&#8722;P bonds as well as aliphatic C&#8722;P bonds at ambient temperature under an air atmosphere. This protocol provides an alternative access to multisubstituted alkenyl phosphine oxides and phosphinates in 40&#8211;99% yield from functionalized alkenes through an interrupted Pummerer activation/base&#8208;promoted olefinic C&#8722;S bond phosphinylation sequence. Gram&#8208;scale preparation and feasible derivatization demonstrated the applicability of the resultant alkenylphosphine oxides.

Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive alkylative cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes with alkyl bromides has been developed. This transformation avoids the use of stoichiometric organometallic reagents and introduces alkyl groups regio&#8208; and stereoselectively into the products. This method provides a platform for the synthesis of carbo&#8208; and heterocycles that are widely found in many natural products and biologically active molecules.

         <title>Cyclization Through Dual C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization methods have been widely employed in many organic transformations such as cyclization reactions, heterocycle synthesis, cross&#8208;coupling protocols, and photochemical transformations. Among these transformations, cyclization reaction through C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization offers a direct route to convert simple linear substrates to complex products. There are three common modes of utilizing C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in cyclization reactions including single, double, and dual C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. As the most challenging mode, dual C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization refers to converting two separate C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in one molecule into desired C&#8722;Z bonds which can be employed in cyclization reactions. Cyclization reaction via dual functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds can be classified based on the C&#8722;H reactivities. Therefore, these reactions can be categorized into three classes based on the types of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds including activated&#8208;activated, activated&#8208;unactivated, and unactivated&#8208;unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. Most published reports for cyclization reactions through dual C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization involve activated&#8208;activated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. However, the number of reported papers on the other two classes has been growing. This review focuses on the dual C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization protocols used for cyclization reactions and categorizes the published papers based on the types of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds.

Abstract
With an in&#8197;situ C&#8722;H iodination tactic, a method for the synthesis of chromone&#8208;3&#8208;phosphonates was developed with trialkyl/triaryl phosphites as the reaction partners of o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl enaminones by palladium catalysis. The product formation consists of cascade C&#8722;H iodination, chromone annulation, and Arbuzov&#8208;type C&#8722;P cross coupling as major transformations. In addition to providing an enaminone&#8208;based synthetic method to chromone&#8208;3&#8208;phosphonates, the work shows the advantage of step economy by skipping the separate operation for preparing the iodo&#8208;functionalized chromone intermediate.

         <title>Electrochemically Induced Desulfurization of Thioureas for the Synthesis of Substituted 5&#8208;Aminotetrazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot method has been developed for synthesizing diverse substituted 5&#8208;aminotetrazoles via the electrochemically induced desulfurizative addition&#8211;cyclization of thioureas with azidotrimethylsilane. This methodology enables the construction of C&#8722;N and N&#8722;N bonds under mild reaction conditions without transition metal catalysts or external oxidizing agents. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated by its broad substrate scope, compatibility with various functional groups, scalability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and practicality evidenced by the synthesis of an antibacterial agent.

This methodology enables the construction of C&#8722;N and N&#8722;N bonds under mild reaction conditions without transition metal catalysts or external oxidizing agents. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated by its broad substrate scope, compatibility with various functional groups, scalability to gram-scale synthesis, and practicality evidenced by the synthesis of an antibacterial agent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted chemodivergent phosphorylation&#8208;peroxidation and oxyphosphorylation of alkenes with phosphine oxides and HOOtBu was realized under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. Using the commercially available Eosin Y as a SET&#8208;photocatalyst, the &#946;&#8208;peroxy&#8208;phosphine oxides were selectively obtained with a catalytic amount of base, while the addition of acid led to the exclusive formation of &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;phosphine oxides control experiments showed that Eosin Y could also act as a HAT&#8208;catalyst to induce the O&#8722;O bond cleavage of peroxides under acidic conditions.

         <title>Synthesis and HHDH&#8208;Catalyzed Kinetic Resolution of Propargylic Epoxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The versatile reactivity of propargylic epoxides and alcohols, due to the presence of a triple bond, is used in the synthesis of various organic compounds and building blocks. However, there are not many known methods for the preparation of optically pure propargylic epoxides and alcohols, and the existing ones often require specific reagents. Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) can be used to obtain enantiomerically pure compounds from racemic epoxides. These important biocatalysts facilitate epoxide ring&#8208;opening reactions with unnatural nucleophiles such as azides. Here we report the first biocatalytic transformation of propargylic epoxides using HHDHs. Six propargylic epoxides with different substituents were synthesized. Kinetic resolution reactions catalyzed by HHDHs in the presence of azide were performed. Two enzymes with opposite stereoselectivities, HheC and HheA2&#8208;N178A were used and yielded azido alcohols (98 &#8208; &gt;99% ee, E&#8208;value &gt;200) and epoxides (up to 88% ee). Best performing p&#8208;tolyl propargylic epoxide derivative was used in a sequence of two enzymatic reactions to obtain both enantiomers of the secondary alcohol and (R)&#8208;primary alcohol in &gt; 99% ee, respectively, through complete conversion of the starting epoxide. The obtained azido alcohols were used in further transformations. Click reactions with terminal acetylenes gave triazolyl propargylic alcohols (&gt;99% ee, up to 98% yield). In the case of primary azido alcohol, the click reaction was followed by intramolecular cyclization to form the dihydrofuranyl triazole motif that is found in biologically active compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling between Alkylidenecyclopropanes and Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of a Pd(0) source and a phosphoramidite ligand promotes a formal allylic cross&#8208;coupling between alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) and boronic acids to yield synthetically appealing 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes. Remarkably, the reaction proceeds both under neutral and basic conditions, and works with both aryl&#8208; and alkenylboronic acids. 
DFT calculations suggest that the reaction entails a C&#8208;C activation/protonation mechanism instead of a hydropalladation pathway, such as has been proposed for other metal&#8208;promoted hydrofunctionalizations of ACPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Approach Toward Mesoionic 1,2,3&#8208;Triazole 1&#8208;Imines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic electrochemistry may establish direct routes to a preparation of a plethora of organic substances, which are hardly accessible by conventional experimental techniques. Herein, we present an electrochemically&#8208;driven method for an assembly of a broad range of rare heterocyclic mesoionic entities &#8211; 1,2,3&#8208;triazole 1&#8208;imines. These nitrogen heterocycles were prepared through a transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and exogenous oxidant&#8208;free strategy using a C/Ni electrode pair. Over 30 examples of thus synthesized 1,2,3&#8208;triazole 1&#8208;imines illustrate selectivity and practical utility of this approach. Key solvent&#8208;controlled reactivity patterns for the formation of the triazole imine scaffold were revealed indicating a modulation ability of the developed approach. These experimental findings were additionally justified based on cyclic voltammetry (CV) data and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover, according to differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data, some of the prepared 1,2,3&#8208;triazole 1&#8208;imines correspond to the thermally stable species with an onset decomposition temperature up to 190 oC.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The transition metal catalyzed cyclization of alkene&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chloride has now emerged as a vital tool to construct oxindoles bearing all carbon quaternary centers. However, most of these reactions proceed via carbometalation&#8208;initiated 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization followed by nucleophilic trapping of the resulting &#963; alkyl&#8208;metal species to achieve diverse functionalized oxindoles. The 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig type cyclization of alkene&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chloride has been rarely reported. Herein, a zinc&#8208;mediated carbamoyl amination of alkylidenecyclopropane&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides with anilines for the synthesis of functionalized 2&#8208;quinolones was developed. A range of different substituted 2&#8208;quinolones were prepared in 65&#8208;89% yields from alkylidenecyclopropane&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides and aniline derivatives using Zn/TMSCl system.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct C&#8211;C Bond Cleavage of CH3CN as a Single&#8208;Carbon Synthon&#65306;Synthesis of Pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxalines via Electrochemical Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A direct electrochemical redox reaction involving radical cross&#8208;coupling cyclization for the synthesis of pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxaline derivatives from 1&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrroles and CH3CN has been developed, which includes the functionalization of C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds as well as the construction of C&#8208;C and C&#8208;N bonds. Notably, the control and deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments suggest that CH3CN in this reaction acts as both a carbon source via C&#8208;C cleavage and solvent. The reaction features metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions, and various substituted pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxaline derivatives were obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>New Synthetic Approaches for the Construction of Enantioenriched Molecules Bearing Quaternary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optically active molecule architectures stand as an important class of organic compounds and occupy a key role in academic and industrial communities. Particularly, the molecules bearing quaternary carbon are of vital importance because of its favorable conformation and valuable three&#8208;dimensional molecules, which frequently play a key role in a broad spectrum of functional materials, pharmaceutical relevant natural molecules, and agrochemicals. Over the past few decades, a large amount of synthetic strategies for the enantioselective construction of compounds with chiral quaternary carbon centers have been the focus of a number of research initiatives. In this review, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art toward the synthesis of enantioenriched molecules bearing quaternary stereocenters are summarized, which could be segmented into four categories: 1) Construction of optically active quaternary carbon centers by addition to prochiral sp2 carbon; 2) Construction of optically active all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via substitution at non&#8208;chiral tetra&#8208;substituted carbon; 3) Construction of optically active all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via kinetic resolution; 4) Construction of optically active all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via desymmetrization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Formate Salts: The Rediscovery of Their Radical Reaction under Light Irradiation Opens New Avenues in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formates are abundantly available and inexpensive commodity chemical, widely used in laboratory and industrial organic synthesis. Formates are promising hydrogen carrier and green C1 source, and have also been a subject of research as SET re&#8208;ductants in recent years. Compared to the toxic and flammable gas carbon monoxide, which also serves as a C1 source, for&#8208;mates are easier to handle, store, and transport, and are more environmentally friendly. Therefore, in recent studies of radical reactions, formate is not only as an ideal source of green carbonyl, 	which is of great significance to synthesize carboxyl compounds with various structures, but also as a SET reductant for editing organic molecules either in scientific research or industrial production. The activation and conversion of formate, as a source of C1 or a SET reductant, is a very challenging and hot research field in organic synthesis.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The replacement of benzene rings with saturated bioisosteric counterparts is a key priority in drug discovery programs, and disubstituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes have been recognized as flexible molecular scaffolds that could act as &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;substituted benzene bioisosteres. In this study, we outline the synthesis of a wide range of 2&#8208;substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexan&#8208;1&#8208;ols, which have the potential to emulate &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenolic derivatives, via SmI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;mediated reductive cyclization reactions.

         <title>Shaking Up the Friedl&#228;nder Reaction: Rapid, Scalable Mechanochemical Synthesis of Polyaryl&#8208;substituted Quinolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quinolines are a ubiquitous heterocyclic aromatic scaffold, which can be found in many natural and synthetic products. They are highly valued for their pharmacological and electrochemical properties, encouraging the discovery of new routes for quinoline synthesis and diversification. Polyaryl&#8208;substituted quinolines have recently surged as useful substrates for a wide variety of applications, yet their synthetic routes remain difficult and inefficient. Herein, we report a rapid and novel mechanochemical Friedl&#228;nder synthesis of polyaryl&#8208;substituted quinolines under basic conditions using ball milling. Optimized reaction conditions result in moderate to excellent yields ranging from 69% to &gt;95% and demonstrates broad functional group tolerance at 1 hour reaction times. We further demonstrate a new route for the synthesis of photocatalyst DPQN2,4&#8208;di&#8208;OMe and photo&#8208;ligand PPQN2,4&#8208;di&#8208;OMe as well as OLED donor&#8208;acceptor pCzPPQ, electron transport material oligoquinoline TQB and organic semiconductor DPA. A gram&#8208;scale reaction was also achieved using Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM), providing an isolated yield of 87% after a simple recrystallization in ethanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Ladderanes by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclodimerization of Allenynes: Scope and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a Ni&#8208;catalyzed cyclodimerization of 1,6&#8208;allenyenes which affords pentacyclic derivatives containing a [3]&#8208;ladderane. Six new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds are formed in a single operation which is fully atom&#8208;economical. The reaction proceeds with an inexpensive catalyst and shows a broad scope in the alkyne, the allene and the tethering group. A computational and experimental study on the reaction mechanism suggests that this process proceeds by oxidative cyclometallation of the allenyne coordinated to Ni(0) followed by reductive elimination leading to cyclobutenes. Then, two of these molecules are coupled following a related cyclometallation&#8208;reductive elimination sequence, the latter being the rate&#8208;limiting step.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium Catalysts Based on Phenyl Substituted Cp Ligands for Indole Synthesis via Oxidative Coupling of Acetanilides and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling of acetanilides and alkynes via C&#8208;H activation is the most powerful synthetic tool for producing the indole motif from commercially available precursors. However, this reaction usually requires large catalyst loadings (5 mol% of rhodium). In this study, a 1,2&#8208;diphenylcyclopentadienyl ligand&#8208;based catalyst was developed that works well at 1 mol% loading of rhodium. DFT calculations of the C&#8208;H activation step provided insight into its high catalytic activity. The catalyst efficiency was also demonstrated in the synthesis of naturally occurring isocoumarins, such as polygonolide, tubakialactone B and penicimarine F. The developed catalytic protocols tolerate a wide range of functional groups, for example, halide, nitro, hydroxy, and alkoxy.</dc:description>

         <title>Contrasting Facial Selectivity of a Squaramide&#8208;Tagged Proline in the Asymmetric Michael Addition of Ketones to Maleimides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A squaramide moiety was introduced at the C&#8208;4 position of proline to afford an organocatalyst that served as a stereocontrol element to promote the asymmetric Michael addition of cyclic ketones to maleimides. A variety of chiral succinimides were obtained by the conjugate addition in 84&#8208;98% yield accompanied by 58&#8208;96% enantioselectivity. The results also include an interesting contrast in the facial selectivity observed with cyclohexanones and cycloheptanones, whereas an asymmetric desymmetrization of 4&#8208;alkyl cyclohexanones was also achieved using the transformation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Trimethyl phosphite promotes the synthesis 2,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted 2H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. The protocol developed affords a two&#8208;step method towards triazoles from available reagents. 3,4&#8208;Disubstituted isoxazolones are initially coupled with diazonium tetrafluoroborates. The subsequent reaction is triggered by a single electron transfer from the phosphite to the diazenylisoxazolone under heating or blue LED irradiation at room temperature. The radical anion cascade proceeds via the &#8220;ring opening/decarboxylation/cyclization&#8221; sequence. The synthesized triazoles show promising fluorescence in the region from 340 nm to 450 nm with a quantum yield up to 81.6%. The emission energy depends slightly on the substituent nature at the triazole carbon atoms.  If an electron&#8208;donor group is introduced into the N2 substituent of the triazole ring, it results in a bathochromic shift of the luminescence energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Photocatalytic Pathways for Reductive Dearomatizations of N&#8208;Arylformylindoles by a Visible&#8208;light Triplet Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light triplet photocatalyst 5&#8208;acetyl&#8208;2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;benzoic acid methyl ester (AcBSH) was developed through introducing acetyl into benzenethiolate to improve the efficiency of intersystem crossing (ISC) and using o&#8208;methoxyformyl to increase the molar extinction coefficient. In the photocatalytic system of AcBSH, the reductive dearomatization of N&#8208;arylformylindoles is achieved to afford the desired indolines in moderate to excellent yields, including both indoles without (1) and with 2&#8208;substituent (2). The 2&#8208;substituent is a steric hindrance for the conjugation between benzoyl and indole moiety, and makes indole 2 and indole 1 exhibit different reduction potentials (Ered) and different triplet energy levels (&#916;ET). Thereby, two kinds of substrates undergo primarily two photocatalytic pathways: i) successive SET/protonation pathway, which merging photosensitization via triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (EnT) and photoinduced SET for substrates 1, and ii) single electron transfer (SET) from the triplet photocatalyst and a concerted hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process for substrates 2.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a diastereoselective Au/Pd relay catalytic tandem cyclization reaction to produce dearomatic 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;7&#8208;azaspiro[4.5]decane derivatives under mild conditions. This process involves generating furan&#8208;derived azadiene from readily available enynamide, followed by a [2 + 4] cycloaddition with Pd&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl dipole decarboxylated from vinyl benzoxazinanone. Our method efficiently constructs the spiro[4.5]decane skeleton, achieving yields ranging from 31&#8208;97% and diastereoselectivities from 6:1 dr to &gt;20:1 dr across 34 examples. This research introduces new cycloaddition sites for azadienes as 1,2&#8208;dipoles and offers a reliable approach for constructing oxa&#8208;azaspiro[4.5]decane frameworks.</dc:description>

Herein, structure&#8208;guided rational design of short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase LfSDR1 was adopted to improve the catalytic performance for enantioselective synthesis of (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;HPA at high substrate loading. The crystal structures of LfSDR1 in its apo form as well as in complex with NADPH were solved, which were used for mutagenesis studies and illustration mechanism. Three residues (G92, E141 and V186) were identified as hotspots by structural analysis, and variants V186A/G92V and V186A/G92V/E141L with remarkably improved activity were obtained. By molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of WT and variants, G92V plays a key role in enzyme&#8208;substrate interaction in the binding pocket. Whole cells expressing the mutant LfSDR1&#8208;V186A/G92V and glucose dehydrogenase BsGDH from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; were used as the catalyst, and up to 200 g L&#8208;1 substrate without cosolvent was completely converted to (R)&#8208;HPA with 99.9% ee and a high space&#8208;time yield (STY) of 800 g L&#8208;1 day&#8208;1.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Formal Addition of Aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds to Alkenes via Phenyl Radical Involved Intermolecular HAT</title>

Abstract
A copper catalyzed aerobic formal addition of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds to alkenes via a phenyl radical mediated intermolecular HAT process is reported herein, in which the phenylhydrazine not only acts as a HAT reagent precursor, but also as a hydrogen atom donor. This reaction affords an alternative method for the direct formal addition of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds to alkenes utilizing air as the radical initiator without additional reductants at ambient temperature. A variety of alkanes and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes are successfully incorporated, furnishing a series of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H formal addition products in 20&#8211;93% yield. Preliminary mechanistic studies show that the 2&#8208;tetrahydrofuranyl and phenyl radical are formed in this reaction.

A palladium&#8208;catalyzed [4+4] cycloaddition of aryl&#8208;substituted &#947;&#8208;methylidene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactones (GMDVs) with divinylketones (DVKs) was developed, providing an approach to access various mono&#8208;cyclic tetrahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;oxocines with diverse substituents in 41% to 95% yield with 81:19 to &gt;20:1 dr. This reaction was facilitated by anchoring olefin (C=C), carbonyl (C=O), and arene (Ar) at the &#945;&#8208;position of carbonyls.

Abstract
A method for synthesizing pyrimido[1,2&#8208;a]indol&#8208;4&#8208;ol heteroarenes via a Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed cascade C&#8722;H activation/annulation strategy employing N&#8208;methoxyindoleamides and isoxazolones is developed. Also, a framework of 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;[1,3,5]triazino[1,2&#8208;a]indole&#8208;4,10&#8208;dione was successfully synthesized via a Cp*Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation/annulation/oxidation reaction between N&#8208;(methyloxy)&#8208;1H&#8208;indole&#8208;1&#8208;carboxamide and isoxazolones. These reactions demonstrated the suitability of several substrates, compatibility with numerous functional groups, and mild reaction conditions.

Abstract
With triethylamine as a synthon, an alternative method for the synthesis of 3&#8208;formyl imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines has been accomplished from aldehydes, and 2&#8208;aminopyridines. The reaction proceeded via iodine&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N bond cleavage of triethylamine, generation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde in&#8197;situ, and oxidative cyclization with air as the oxygen source. This protocol may facilitate the synthesis of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives and provide a reference for the usage of triethylamine as a synthon.

Abstract
It remains a challenge to achieve regioselectivity and stereoselectivity in the synthesis of dihydropyranone derivatives. Herein, an Ir/Pd&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative allylic (amino)ketalization was disclosed to prepare dihydropyranone derivatives in regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities under mild conditions, resulting in O&#8208; and N&#8208;allylative products. It provided a strategy for the post&#8208;modifications of dihydropyranone derivatives.

Abstract
The oxaspiro&#8208;phthalides ([n,5]&#8208;oxaspirobenzalactones) bearing a phthalide spirofused to a cyclic&#8208;ether of various sizes are frameworks found in bioactive natural products. The discovery and development of an alkynyl&#8208;Prins cyclization based, strategy for the construction of structurally interesting, medicinally useful [5,5]&#8208;[6,5]&#8208;, and [7,5]&#8208;oxaspirophthalides is reported in this manuscript. Our strategy represents a report on the construction of oxaspiro&#8208;phthalides using the alkynyl&#8208;Prins cyclization. This approach exhibits broad substrate scope with respect to carbonyl compounds and 2&#8208;(alkynol)benzoates, with yields ranging between 43&#8211;98%. Isolation of intermediate, and further conversion of it to the end&#8208;product supported the proposed mechanistic pathway.

         <dc:description>
The front cover picture, provided by Singh, Park, Kim, and co&#8208;workers, illustrates the synthetic method for the vicarious&#8208;type nucleophilic amination of azine N&#8208;oxides and cyclic iminoamides using iminyl anions, readily generated from organic azides under basic conditions. The formation of iminyl anions and site&#8208;selective nucleophilic aromatic substitution in this process were supported by a series of mechanistic investigations including DFT calculations. The utility of C2&#8208;aminated products was highlighted by the photocatalytic reduction of a N&#8208;oxide group and the formation of a five&#8208;membered iridacycle. More details can be found in Update by Singh, Park, Kim, and co&#8208;workers (J. Min, S. Min, E. Chung, K. Moon, H. S. Kim, T. Jeong, A. Rakshit, P. Singh, J. S. Park, I. S. Kim, Adv. Synth.

         <dc:description>The combination of a gold(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complex and an ene&#8208;reductase (ERED) has made possible the synthesis of enantiopure &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones in a one&#8208;pot concurrent approach. The protocol consists of the Meyer&#8208;Schuster rearrangement of racemic propargylic tertiary alcohols using [1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene]&#8208;[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)&#8208;imide]gold(I) (IPrAuNTf2), followed by asymmetric alkene reduction of the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone intermediate using the Zymomonas mobilis ERED (NCR&#8208;ERED). The chemoenzymatic cascade was optimised with a model substrate, where E/Z&#8208;isomers both generated the (R)&#8208;ketone, which was rationalised using in silico molecular docking experiments. The cascade was then applied towards the production of a series of (R)&#8208;4&#8208;substituted&#8208;alkan&#8208;2&#8208;ones in enantiopure form in a straightforward manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleophilic Cyanation of Enones and Imines with Formamide as the Cyano Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A convenient cyano source for the nucleophilic 1,4&#8208;addition to enones and 1,2&#8208;addition to imines has been developed, by generating the cyano unit in&#8197;situ. via the TCT&#8208;assisted dehydration of formamide. This protocol distinguishes itself by transition&#8208;metal/ligand free conditions, compatibility with 1,4&#8208;/1,2&#8208;addition, readily available substrates and versatile synthetic utilities of the cyanated products.

         <title>Electrochemical &#945;&#8208;Functionalization of N&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Activated Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Numerous appropriately substituted pyridyl or phenyl groups serve as a particularly advantageous activation motif for the electrochemical oxidation of amines. Such groups enable a general, mild method for the electrochemical &#945;&#8208;functionalization of tertiary amines across numerous activating groups and amine scaffolds. Notably, the method accommodates an unprecedented range of nucleophile classes, allowing for the introduction of diverse functional groups to the readily prepared amine substrates. The utility of this method is then demonstrated through applications to unsymmetrical bisfunctionalization, site&#8208;selective functionalization of N&#8208;pyridyl amines vs. other activated amines, a formal synthesis of ivosidenib and the diversification of FDA&#8208;approved drugs or natural product substrates.

         <title>Benchmarking Methanophosphocines as Versatile PIII/PV Redox Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
PIII/PV redox cycling has recently emerged as a valuable strategy to minimized the chemical waste generated by phosphine&#8208;mediated reaction, as well as enabling asymmetric transformation. In this article, we detail our contribution to this field by designing a series of diversely functionalized, electron&#8208;rich bridgehead phosphine oxides with structural features that make them well&#8208;suited as PIII/PV redox organocatalysts. Their catalytic performance has been assessed in various model reactions, including Wittig or Staudinger reactions, along with the reduction of activated alkenes and allenes. For each of these scenarios, we performed a comparative analysis with existing catalysts in order to demonstrate the applicability and limitation of methanophosphocines.

Abstract
Herein, we describe a reaction conditions&#8208;based switchable Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkylation and alkenylation of 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazinones with maleimides, where the triazinone serves as a directing group rather than its traditional role denitrogenative precursor. This strategy enables the selective synthesis of diverse 3&#8208;arylated succinimides and 3&#8208;arylated maleimides in up to 99% yield and a broad substrate scope (48 examples). Furthermore, for the first time, a tandem C&#8722;H alkylation and denitrogenative coupling of 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazinones has been achieved by slightly modifying the reaction conditions. Additionally, gram&#8208;scale reactions and product derivatizations were conducted to demonstrate the synthetic utility.

Abstract
A de novo synthesis of cyclobutene&#8208;fused indoline derivatives via thermally induced intramolecular cyclization was reported. This approach efficiently yields valuable high&#8208;strained cyclobute[b]indolines in moderate to high yields and enables further transformation into other valuable heterocycles, demonstrating its potential in organic synthesis.

         <title>Intramolecular Buchner Reaction: Experimental and Theoretical Comparison of the Effect of the Carbene Substituent on the Chemoselectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The intramolecular Buchner reaction is a powerful transformation able to dearomatize benzenic rings. However, the competitive C&#8722;H insertion of the carbene moiety into benzylic positions still remains a limitation, and the reasons governing this uncomplete chemoselectivity are poorly understood. The carbene substitution, in particular, has been observed to influence the selectivity strongly, though the currently proposed explanation relying on the electrophilicity of the metallocarbene hardly describes some experimental results reported in the literature. In this article, we present our experimental observations of intramolecular rhodium&#8208;catalyzed Buchner reactions, combined with DFT calculations on selected carbene substituents, to propose a complementary explanation for the observed chemoselectivity modification.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a method for the synthesis of thieno[3,2&#8208;b]furans on the basis of a strategy consisting of a formal [3+2] cycloaddition utilizing the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement and a subsequent Br&#248;nsted base&#8208;mediated cyclization. The method streamlines access to a wide range of well&#8208;organized 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted thieno[3,2&#8208;b]furans that are otherwise difficult to synthesize and is also applicable to the syntheses of 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted seleno[3,2&#8208;b]furans.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We here report a catalytic strategy to enable the decarboxylative allylic amination of vinyl cyclic carbonates using various aliphatic and nucleophilic amines. The use of a protic medium and chelating diphosphine ligands is a main driver towards chemo&#8208;selective allylic
amine formation, thereby minimizing undesired ligand&#8208;driven complex speciation and aminolysis of the involved substrate. This improved approach amplifies the repertoire of allylic amine synthons that can be prepared from a variety of substrate combinations.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl alkyl Selenides with Aryl Bromides: Cross Coupling between two electrophile</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction has been developed using two distinct electrophiles: an aryl alkyl selenide and an aryl bromide. The organoselenium compound, due to the lower bond dissociation energy of the C&#8208;Se bond, acts as a pseudohalide. This one&#8208;pot reaction proceeds by cleaving the C&#8208;Se bond, producing the desired biaryls in moderate to good yields. This method has the potential to become a valuable tool in organic synthesis, owing to its substrate scope and scalability. Importantly, the use of commercially available aryl bromides eliminates the handling of pre&#8208;formed organomagnesium reagents, enhancing the practicality and applicability of this approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Free Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of PAHs via Vinyl C&#8722;H Activation/Decarboxylative Cyclization Sequence</title>

Abstract
Herein, we describe a strategy for the synthesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from readily available 2&#8208;iodostyrenes and o&#8208;halobenzoic acids through a ligand&#8208;free palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade vinyl C&#8722;H activation/decarboxylative cyclization. A vinyl&#8208;coordinated five&#8208;membered palladacycle was proposed as the key intermediate for this sequential process. Furthermore, Heptagon&#8208;embedded aromatic compounds can be smoothly synthesized by employing 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;naphthoic acid as decarboxylative insertion unit.

         <title>Organocatalytic Regioselective Aldol Reaction of Hydroxyacetone with Aliphatic Aldehydes for the Synthesis of Linear Products</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we present an organocatalyst that addresses the reactivity issue of aliphatic aldehydes with hydroxyacetone, leading to the formation of a linear product. Previous proline&#8208;based catalysts required a significant excess of hydroxyacetone and could only be applied to aromatic aldehydes. The proposed sulphonamide containing a proline moiety effectively controls the reaction, generating a new stereogenic center dependent on the catalyst&#8216;s configuration and does not require a large excess of the ketone. We demonstrated that this methodology can be effectively utilized in the synthesis of natural compounds, as confirmed by obtaining the 2&#8208;keto&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;gluconic acid (KDG) methyl ester from optically pure glyceraldehyde and protected hydroxyacetone.

         <title>Synthesis of Polyaryl&#8208;Substituted Azafluoranthenes via Co&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition of 1,6&#8208;Diynes with Nitriles</title>

Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of azafluoranthene derivatives under mild conditions via [2+2+2] cycloaddition of 1,6&#8208;diynes and nitriles catalyzed by CoBr2/dppp, exhibiting good atom economy. This procedure uses an inexpensive ligand and an earth&#8208;abundant metal as catalyst to lower the cost of synthesis. Several azafluoranthenes are produced in 28&#8211;95% yields using this approach, featuring mild conditions, wide substrate scope, and good functional group tolerance. The fluorescence spectra of some azafluoranthenes indicate that these scaffolds have good photophysical properties for material science.

         <title>Decarboxylative Aminomethylation of Ferulic Acids via Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Flavin Photocatalysis and its Application in the Synthesis of Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Lead Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we reported a protocol for direct visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated decarboxylative aminomethylation of ferulic acid with N&#8208;aryl tetrahydroisoquinolines in air atmosphere. Current protocol uses naturally available ferulic acid as coupling partner, inexpensive organic photocatalyst riboflavin tetraacetate (RFTA) as photocatalyst and molecular oxygen as oxidant, which is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. This methodology was further demonstrated its utility by the protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free semi&#8208;synthesis of natural alkaloids maclekarpine E and assessing the anti&#8208;inflammatory activity of its analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Dimerization of Fungal Natural Products through Intermolecular Disulfide Bridges</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The biosynthetic pathway for the production of natural products from various species often include a dimerization step which increases the structural variability and range of biological activities. These dimerization reactions are highly interesting for biocatalytic applications. Epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) are an important class of natural products whose potent bioactivities rely on disulfide bridges. ETPs often carry a transannular disulfide bridge and can be linked through C&#8211;C and C&#8211;N bonds to form dimers. In this study, we shed light on the mechanism of disulfide formation in the case of the dimeric vertihemiptellides (vhe) produced by the fungus Verticillium hemipterigenum BCC1449. These compounds feature a unique intermolecular disulfide bridge which links two monomers together. Using comparative genomics, we identified the 12&#8208;membered vhe gene cluster. In vitro assays, kinetic analysis, and protein mutagenesis, enabled us to characterize VheT, the oxidase catalyzing an intermolecular disulfide bond formation resulting in ETP dimers. We showed that the CxxC motif of VheT plays a crucial role in catalyzing this reaction. VheT is an oxidase linking natural product monomers through intermolecular S&#8211;S bridges and could be developed into a biocatalyst for thiol specific dimerization reactions.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A variety of &#945;&#8208;benzotriazinium ketones were prepared in 38%&#8208;89% yields through a copper(II)&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam reaction and [2,3]&#8208;rearrangement in a one pot reaction open to air from N&#8208;hydroxybenzotriazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones and alkenyl boronic acids at room temperature. Experimental results showed that the copper catalyst not only played as cross&#8208;coupling catalyst but also served as Lewis acid catalyst to control the chemoselectivity of [2,3]&#8208;rearrangement. The reaction tolerated various linear and cyclic disubstituted alkenyl boronic acids. Moreover, &#945;&#8208;benzotriazinium ketone could be easily prepared in gram scales. The present method highlights dual roles of copper catalyst and [2,3]&#8208;rearrangement of N,O&#8208;vinyl moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aminopyridine Derivatives via a Tandem CuAAC/Ring&#8208;Cleavage/[4+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition/Rearrangement Reaction Sequence</title>

Abstract
2H&#8208;Azirines are an important class of small&#8208;ring heterocycle that have been employed as versatile synthetic building blocks. Herein, a one&#8208;pot CuAAC/ring&#8208;cleavage/[4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/rearrangement reaction sequence involving terminal ynones, sulfonyl azides and 2H&#8208;azirines is reported that leads to 2&#8208;aminopyridine derivatives. In the first step, highly reactive N&#8208;sulfonyl &#945;&#8208;acylketenimines are generated, via a CuAAC/ring&#8208;cleavage process, from sulfonyl azides and terminal ynones and these undergo inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition reactions with 2H&#8208;azirines to form (isolable) 1,3&#8208;oxazines that themselves undergo base&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;cleavage and rearrangement reactions to afford the title compounds.

Abstract
We report a one&#8208;pot cascade sequence catalyzed by gold starting from 1,5&#8208;diynes and a zwitterion (source of Tf2C=CH2), which allows the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective preparation of cyclobutene&#8208;fused [4&#8208;7&#8208;6] tricycles and displays orthogonal reactivity of the 1,5&#8208;diyne system, zwitterion and metal catalyst. Moreover, the obtained tricyclic bis(triflyl)cyclobutenes [triflyl=(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl] can be easily converted into more complex structures such as bridged ketal and fused 1,3&#8208;oxazine tetracyclic systems, demonstrating the potential of our protocol.

Abstract
Site&#8208;selective amination of N&#8208;heterocycles is an interesting topic in organic synthesis and drug discovery. We herein present a method for the vicarious&#8208;type nucleophilic amination of azine N&#8208;oxides and cyclic iminoamides using iminyl anions, readily generated from organic azides under basic conditions. The plausible reaction mechanism involving nucleophilic aromatic substitution by iminyl anions is elucidated by a series of mechanistic investigations.

The plausible reaction mechanism involving nucleophilic aromatic substitution by iminyl anions is elucidated by a series of mechanistic investigations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A tandem oxidative radical functionalization/annulation of N&#8208;acryloyl amino saccharin is disclosed. This strategy allows the facile construction of diversely functionalized 3,4&#8208;fused tricyclic benzosultams that previously have not been reported. A wide range of functionalities were installed through the formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;S and C&#8722;P bond enabled by the respective radicals.

         <title>Unconventional Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Catalyst Ratio for the Distal C&#8722;C Bond Formation via C&#8722;H Activation and Chain&#8208;Walking</title>

Abstract
A mechanism&#8208;navigated enantioselective alkylation of an indole C2&#8197;C&#8722;H bond with an internal alkene was developed. Under the unconventional ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal catalyst ratio, a moderate enantiomeric ratio (er), ranging from 70:30 to 88:12, was achieved with our original ligand. We propose that chain&#8208;walking and bond formation are mechanistically independent and suggest that hydridoiridium generated from the C&#8722;H source does not play a role in the chain&#8208;walking process.

Abstract
Another class of gold(I) redox&#8208;switchable catalysts, incorporating ferrocenyl phosphane&#8208;imines, enriches the existing library of gold(I) complexes. Our catalyst proves efficacy in gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations of furans and benzamides, exhibiting reversible &#8220;on&#8208;off&#8221; switching. Furthermore, we explored the unconventional role of &#8220;Magic Blue&#8221;, commonly used as an oxidizing agent in various organic transformations, as a potential activator of the Au&#8722;Cl bond, initiating conventional gold(I) catalysis.

Employing PCy3 as the catalyst, the reaction could provide a variety of synthetically useful benzofuro[3,2&#8208;b]azepines in good yields (80&#8208;92%) with excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities via (4 + 3) cycloaddition reactions. Whereas changing the catalyst from PCy3 to DMAP, the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities were switched to construct highly substituted spirotetrahydroquinoline scaffolds with three sequential stereocenters containing all&#8208;carbon spiro&#8208;quaternary stereocenters in excellent efficiency and diastereoselectivities (92&#8208;96% yields with all cases &gt; 25:1 dr) via (4 + 2) annulations. In addition, the synthetic utility of this method was further showcased by gram&#8208;scale reactions and synthetic transformations of the product.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomative Functionalization of Activated Quinolines: Transfer Hydrogenation/Cycloaddition Cascade to Construct &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cascade dearomative functionalization is a robust protocol to convert flat arenes into medicinally relevant three&#8208;dimensional architectures with added new functionality. Herein, a dearomative cycloaddition protocol for synthesizing tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;embedded &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine scaffolds has been developed employing quinolinium salts and sulfonyl azides under metal&#8208;free conditions. An underexplored and mechanistically distinct pathway is unveiled, creating quaternary&#8208;center&#8208;bearing amine skeletons by an amine group migration during the transfer hydrogenation and cycloaddition cascade reaction. This approach provided a broad substrate scope of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine scaffolds from a plethora of C3&#8208;substituted quinolinium and sulfonyl azides. The post&#8208;synthetic modifications have further diversified the &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine core into interesting scaffolds. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested the involvement of aziridine ring formation for the amine migration to the C&#8208;3 position of quinoline to generate the &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine core.

The resultant hydroxyl group has been converted to various functional groups to demonstrate the synthetic utility of this protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Access to Functionalized Indenes via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Homolytic Cleavage of a Furan C&#8722;O Bond</title>

Abstract
A photoinduced palladium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydroarylation of furans to form functionalized indenes was achieved via an intramolecular reductive coupling of aryl bromide with furan using silane as the reductant. Deuterium tracking and DFT analysis revealed a reasonable reaction pathway involving: 1) the homolytic cleavage of the furan C&#8722;O bond induced by the &#945;&#8208;allyl radical; 2) a 1,6&#8208;H atom transfer from carbon to oxygen.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Induced Ag&#8208;Palladacycle&#8208;Complex&#8208;Mediated Regioselective C&#8722;H Arylation</title>

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, external photocatalyst&#8208;free, site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H arylation of 4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones and various 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes has been developed to provide ortho arylated products 41&#8211;95% yield at room temperature. A mechanistic study using control experiments, UV&#8208;visible study, DFT study, and observation of colored aggregates suggest that in&#8197;situ generated Ag&#8208;palladacycle complex of 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes is responsible for absorbing the visible light and generating aryl radicals from aryldiazonium salts. Further, this methodology demonstrates its versatility by transforming various 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes, including 2&#8208;phenylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;one, 3&#8208;phenylquinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one, 2&#8208;phenylpyridines, pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines, 2&#8208;phenylquinolines, 2&#8208;phenylisoquinolines, and 2&#8208;phenylbenzo[d]thiazoles, into their respective regio&#8208;selective C&#8722;H arylated products under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Allylic Alkylation Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Diazo Ketones with Water and Allyl Carbonates for Construction of Homoallylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A three&#8208;component allylic alkylation reaction of &#945;&#8208;diazo ketones, water and allyl carbonate under the cooperative catalysis of Rh2(OAc)4, Pd2(dba)3 and Br&#248;nsted acid was disclosed. This method provides an expeditious access to &#945;&#8208;keto homoallylic alcohols in good to high yields. Controlled experiments support that the transformations proceed through cross&#8208;interception of two active intermediates Pd&#8208;allyl species and enol intermediates derived from oxonium ylides. Moreover, synthetic transformations of the generated products enable the creation of motifs enriched with dense functional groups, underscoring their potential as valuable building blocks.

Abstract
The substrate&#8208;controlled regioselective conjugate addition (1,8&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;addition) of tropones with difluoroenoxysilanes is reported, which offered an approach for the selective synthesis of multifunctional seven&#8208;membered 3,5&#8208;cycloheptadien&#8208;1&#8208;ones and 1,3&#8208;cycloheptadien&#8208;1&#8208;ones featuring a gem&#8208;difluoroketone moiety. Moreover, these fluorinated cyclo&#8208;heptadienones exhibit effective anti&#8208;proliferative activities (IC50&lt;1&#8197;&#956;M) for human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells in&#8197;vitro, thus providing potential lead compounds for developing new anticancer agents.

Abstract
An efficient and regioselective cyclization for construction of pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;b]pyridines and methylene&#8208;bridged bis(pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines) has been established. It involves a [3+2+1] annulation of 3(5)&#8208;aminopyrazole, N,N&#8208;dimethylethanolamine (DMEA), with 1,2&#8208;insertion of aryl methyl ketones or 2,1&#8208;insertion of aryl alkynes. DMEA is oxidized through C(sp3)&#8208;H activation to provide a single or triple carbon source.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;induced annulation&#8208;halocyanomethylation of indole&#8208;linked 1,6&#8208;enynes has been established using haloacetonitrile as radical precursors, enabling the synthesis of 21 cyanomethylated pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles with yields ranging from 42% to 81% and a Z/E ratio up to 19:1. Moreover, by adjusting the reaction temperature, a variation of the annulation&#8208;bromobicyanomethylation process was achieved, resulting in the production of 12 bicyanomethylated pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indole isomers in yields of 41&#8211;68%. The stereoisomeric mixture of bicyanomethylated products could be purified to their pure configurations through recrystallization. The proposed reaction mechanism was formulated through a series of control experiments.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A route for the construction of benzofulvenes derivatives through 4&#8208;Aminobenzotriazole (ABTA) directed Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions of amides with inner alkynes was developed. This method afforded a diverse array of benzofulvene derivatives in yields ranging from 34% to 91%. The control experiments indicated that the substrate reacts with alkynes in tandem to synthesize 1,3&#8208;diene intermediates, and ultimately 1,3&#8208;diene underwent intramolecular cyclization to produce benzofulvene derivatives. Furthermore, the directing group can be removed.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric [3+3] Cycloaddition of N&#8208;Vinyl Oxindole Nitrones with 2&#8208;Indolylmethanols to Prepare Spirooxindole[1,2]oxazines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed asymmetric [3+3] cycloaddition of N&#8208;viny oxindole nitrones with 2&#8208;indolylmethanols to prepare various spirooxindole[1,2]oxazines in 43&#8208;93% yields and 88:12&#8208;97:3 enantiomeric ratios. Experimental results revealed that the addition of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) played important roles to help CPA control the reaction reactivity and enantioselectivity. The present method features the construction of tetrasubstituted chiral carbon stereocenter and the example of N&#8208;vinyl nitrones in asymmetric [3+3] cycloaddition.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Organic electrosynthesis has become a green, efficient and sustainable alternative to traditional organic transformation for the redox reactions. In this connection, indirect electrolysis employing redox mediators is attaining increasing significance as it offers a chance to improve reaction selectivity and avoids the over&#8208;oxidation/reduction issues encountered in direct electrolysis. Triarylamines and triarylimidazoles, as representative organic molecular mediators, have attracted widespread attention in recent years due to the advantages of well&#8208;defined easy structural modification and tunable redox ability. Hence, in this minireview, the recent growth of triarylamine and triarylimidazole derivatives mediated electrochemical oxidation reactions were presented, highlighting the structural optimization, electrochemical performance and reaction mechanism of these organic mediators. Moreover, the photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic cases with these molecular mediators were also highlighted.

         <title>Copper and Photocatalytic Synergistic Strategies for Radical Cyclization Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid development of photo&#8208;synergistic transition metal catalytic systems has provided a green paradigm to complement thermal transition metal catalytic methods. However, the most commonly used iridium or ruthenium complexes involve expensive in nature, in contrast to the abundant copper elements in the earth's crust, which are highly valued for their unique electronic structure and light&#8208;absorbing properties. Recently, the application of copper and photocatalytic synergistic strategies in radical cyclization reactions has progressed considerably, leading to a renaissance in the synthesis of functional natural products, drugs and their analogues, but summary work addressing this aspect has not been reported. In this review, we briefly analyze the effect of ligand choice on copper complexes and some inorganic copper salts and even on light sources. We then summarize the copper and photocatalytic synergistic strategies in radical cyclization reactions and classify them into three categories, C, N and O radicals, according to the class of the central atom of the radical in each work, and in each category will be elaborated in turn from coordination cyclization via Cu catalysts, direct radical cyclization and other cyclization mode. For individual more complex reactions, the mechanisms are explored and briefly discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Emerging Advances of the Radical Pathway Glycosylation Enabled by Bench&#8208;Stable Glycosyl Donors: Glycosyl Sulfoxides, Glycosyl Sulfones, and Glycosyl Sulfinates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. In synthetic carbohydrate chemistry, the modification of glycosyl radicals pathway stands as a central area of focus. The radical&#8208;based reactions often demonstrate remarkable compatibility with various functional groups owing to the mild initiation conditions. In particular, the identification of novel glycosyl radical precursors, combined with advanced reaction techniques, has substantially broadened the scope of glycosyl compound synthesis. Despite the presence of versatile donors, the synthesis of noble donors is still addressed as a synthetic need and challenges associated with sugar chemistry. Currently, a new class of glycosyl radical precursors has been developed which enables the production of C&#8208;, S&#8208;, O&#8208;, and N&#8208;glycosides efficiently. In this light, we highlight strategies towards bench&#8208;stable glycosyl sulfoxides, sulphone, and sulfite donors that can enable the site&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective transformation of protected or naked sugar synthons in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry. Here, this review article covers the recent developments in the selective glycosyl radical diversification such as glycosyl alkylation, arylation, alkenylation, sulfuration, C&#8208;H activation, and DNA conjugation via the bench&#8208;stable donors along with mechanistic aspects, challenges, and future directions.		1.

         <title>Electroreductive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling of Aromatic Carbonyl Compounds and Alkyl Bromides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Classical methods for the synthesis of tertiary alcohols mainly rely on the nucleophilic addition of organometallic reagents to carbonyl compounds. Here, we disclose a strategy for synthesizing tertiary alcohols via electroreductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of aromatic carbonyl compounds and alkyl bromides (allyl, propargyl, benzyl and cyclohexyl bromides). This procedure features good substrate tolerance and friendly conditions (undivided cell, cheap and reusable carbon electrodes, reaction in open air, room temperature, without any external transition metal/activating reagent). Using this method, 32 desired products can be obtained with moderate to good yields, and gram&#8208;scale synthesis is feasible, demonstrating the practicality of this approach.

         <title>Recent Developments in Selenylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkynes are simple yet important organic feedstocks. The selenylation of alkynes is able to produce complex selenium&#8208;containing compounds in a facile way. Although there are some reviews about the selenylation of alkynes, most of them focus on one specific reaction or what types of products that can be obtained. There is a lack of attention given to the various uses of different selenium reagents and their mechanisms. This review mainly focuses on recent advances (2013&#8208;2023) based on diverse selenium reagents. Mechanisms and how the added reagents work will be discussed. Different reaction types, including difunctionalization, Se&#8208;annulation, spiro&#8208;cyclization, C&#8208;Se coupling, click reaction will be recorded in this review. The regioselectivity can be achieved through various mechanisms, including radicals, seleniraniums or electrophilic cyclization. We hope it will do help for future research in this area.</dc:description>

         <title>A High&#8208;Throughput in vitro Assay System for the Detection of the Enzymatic Dihydroxylation of Aliphatic Olefins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rieske dioxygenase enzymes can perform the cis&#8208;dihydroxylation of aliphatic olefins, representing a potential green alternative to established methods of performing this important transformation. However, the activity of the natural enzymes in this context is low relative to their more well&#8208;known activity in the cis&#8208;dihydroxylation of aromatics. To enable the engineering of dioxygenase enzymes for improved activity in the dihydroxylation of aliphatic olefins, we have developed an assay system to detect the relevant diol metabolites produced from whole&#8208;cell fermentation cultures. Optimization studies were carried out to maximize the sensitivity of the assay system, and its utility in the in vitro screening of enzyme variant libraries was demonstrated. The assay system was utilized in screening studies that identified Rieske dioxygenase variants with significantly improved activity in the dihydroxylation of aliphatic olefins relative to the wild&#8208;type enzyme.</dc:description>

         <title>Three Component Cascade Processes Involving Palladium Catalyzed Transformations/Dipolar Cycloadditions for the Synthesis of Angular Heterotriquinane Derivatives</title>

Abstract
Combining chemical reactivities of allenes and oximes created a methodology for the preparation of heterocyclic triquinane&#8208;type skeletons via a cascade process constructing four bonds in a single step. The initial reaction of allene moiety promoted by Pd&#8208;catalysis, affording &#960;&#8208;allyl Pd&#8208;species, was followed by two additional transformations &#8208; nucleophilic displacement and dipolar cycloaddition &#8208; to furnish the product highly stereoselectively in moderate to good yields. For the process to be efficient, it was necessary to use a dipolarophilic component as a solvent. Intriguingly, while the reaction with cyclopentanone derived oxime progressed through the whole cascade, with cyclohexanone analogue it stopped at the nitrone stage, requiring an additional step to yield similar type of products. Some aspects of the studied cascade were examined by DFT.

         <title>Selective Access to Sultams and Spirocyclic Sultams by the Divergent Annulations of (N&#8208;Aryl)&#8208;Alkynyl Sulphonamides</title>

Abstract
Herein, we present the first annulation reaction of (N&#8208;aryl)&#8208;alkynyl sulphonamides leading to sultams or spirocyclic sultams. The selective formation of aforesaid products is based on the variable reactivity, intramolecular ortho&#8208;cyclization or dearomative ipso&#8208;annulation, guided by the substituent on N&#8208;aryl group of the substrate. The ortho&#8208;annulation is mediated by electrophile, while the ipso&#8208;annulation is promoted by the radical, enabling the functionalization (selenyl or iodo) on sultams. The synthetic potential of this method is illustrated by modifications of the functional groups present in the products obtained.

         <title>Synthesis of Fluorinated Spiroindolenines by Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Indole Dearomatizations</title>

Abstract
A strategy to access fluorinated spiroindolenines has been developed, involving a selective functionalization of indoles with fluorinated moieties and subsequent catalytic dearomatization. Trifluomethylthio (SCF3), diethyl phosphono(difluoromethyl)thio (SCF2P(O)(OEt)2) and (phenylsulfonyl)difluoromethyl (CF2SO2Ph) groups were embedded at the C2 position of indole derivatives substituted with alkynes, allenes, and allyl carbonate moieties at the C3 position. A gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization gave access to five spiroindolenines, and an enantioselective palladium catalyzed cyclization provided 10 fluorinated spirocyclic products with up to 77% ee.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Aerobic Dearomatization of Naphthylamines under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The dearomatization of aromatic substrates via photocatalytic methodologies has gained escalating prominence to access molecular complexity. Although much focus has been put on non&#8208;active arenes, naphthols and N&#8208;based heteroaromatics, arylamines have so far remained in the background. Herein, we report a photocatalytic strategy for the aerobic, dearomative hydroxylation of naphthylamines under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Our investigation highlights singlet oxygen generation as a viable mechanism for aromaticity disruption, mitigating selectivity issues deriving from the direct oxidation of targeted arylamines. Finally, we showcased the synthetic value of the obtained dearomatized products in a late&#8208;stage diversification campaign.

Abstract
A three&#8208;component strategy for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl allyl alcohols from 1,3&#8208;dienes is developed. A diverse range of synthetically valuable &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl allyl alcohols are obtained in moderate to high yields. Broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance are observed. This method is also applicable to mono&#8208;olefins and 1,3&#8208;enynes. The control experiment results demonstrate that the hydroxyl group OH in the product comes from TBHP. In addition, the practicality and mild reaction conditions make these synthetic transformations attractive and valuable for organic synthesis.

Abstract
We report herein a palladium&#8208;catalyzed, site&#8208;selective cyclative annulation of o&#8208;alkynyl arylamides with maleimide for the stereoselective construction of succinimide&#8208;fused benzoxazine derivatives. This operationally simple and modular protocol provides access to polycyclic frameworks. The other associated features are high functional group compatibility, gram&#8208;scale synthetic potential, and downstream transformations. Control and labeling experiments were conducted to get insights into the mechanism.

Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric dearomative arylation of 2&#8208;naphthols enabled by the unconventional reactivity of o&#8208;quinone diimides, i.&#8201;e. the 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition on quinone sp2 hybridized carbon, has been established. Under the catalysis of chiral phosphoric acid, various cyclohexaenones bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter have been prepared with excellent yields and enantioselectivities.
