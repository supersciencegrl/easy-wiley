         <title>Functionalized &#945;&#8208;Fluorinated Amines from Imines and Enol Ethers</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the addition reaction of lithium enol ethers to fluoroalkyl imines. A range of different fluoroalkyls and lithiated reagents are well tolerated. Diastereoselective addition of lithium vinyl ethers to fluoroalkyl N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinylimines is disclosed, providing enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;fluorinated amines up to 98%. This general approach led to the diastereoselective formation of various amino&#8208;alcohols and amino&#8208;ethers, which are difficult to achieve with other methods.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Another class of gold(I) redox&#8208;switchable catalysts, incorporating ferrocenyl phosphane&#8208;imines, enriches the existing library of gold(I) complexes. Our catalyst proves efficacy in gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations of furans and benzamides, exhibiting reversible &#8220;on&#8208;off&#8221; switching. Furthermore, we explored the unconventional role of &#8220;Magic Blue&#8221;, commonly used as an oxidizing agent in various organic transformations, as a potential activator of the Au&#8211;Cl bond, initiating conventional gold(I) catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically Induced Desulfurization of Thioureas for the Synthesis of Substituted 5&#8208;Aminotetrazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A one&#8208;pot method has been developed for synthesizing diverse substituted 5&#8208;aminotetrazoles via the electrochemically induced desulfurizative addition&#8208;cyclization of thioureas with azidotrimethylsilane. This methodology enables the construction of C&#8211;N and N&#8211;N bonds under mild reaction conditions without transition metal catalysts or external oxidizing agents. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated by its broad substrate scope, compatibility with various functional groups, scalability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and practicality evidenced by the synthesis of an antibacterial agent</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enantioselective tandem sequence that comprises a cycloaromatization process followed by an intramolecular desymmetrizing Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of functionalized cyclohexadienones has been accomplished. The process takes place in good yields (65&#8208;95%), with excellent diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1) and enantiomeric ratios up to 90.5:9.5 in the presence of (R)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived N&#8208;triflyl phosphoramides, and it gains access to a family of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives in a simple manner, with the simultaneous generation of two vicinal stereocenters, one of them a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter</dc:description>

         <title>1&#8208;Oxa&#8208;2,6&#8208;diazaspiro[3.3]heptane as a New Potential Piperazine Bioisostere &#8211; Flow&#8208;Assisted Preparation and Derivatisation by Strain&#8208;Release of Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel strained spiro heterocycles (SSHs) as bioisosteres for aromatic or non&#8208;strained aliphatic rings is highly sought after for improving drug design. Their high molecular rigidity and predictable vectorization can enhance drug&#8208;likeness, target selectivity and clinical success. Towards this goal, 1&#8208;oxa&#8208;2,6&#8208;diazaspiro[3.3]heptane (ODASE) is reported as a novel potential SSH&#8208;bioisostere. We demonstrate through theoretical studies the potential of this strained spiro heterocycle to act as a bioisostere for piperazine. We have developed its synthesis from the highly strained azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl intermediate through a robust and mild flow technology&#8208;assisted two&#8208;step protocol. Its tolerance and stability towards medicinally relevant N&#8208;functionalisation protocols are studied, as well as its mild reduction to the C3&#8208;aminoalkylazetidinol motif found in anti&#8208;cancer drug cobimetinib.

         <dc:description>A catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free one&#8208;step protocol for synthesizing thiazolines and thiazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, utilizing the annulative coupling between &#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxonium ylides and &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides has been described. The dual functionalization of &#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxonium ylides through S&#8208;alkylation and intramolecular N&#8208;cyclization leads to the generation of both C&#8211;S and C&#8211;N bonds.

         <title>Base&#8208;Catalyzed Domino Isomerization/Oxidant&#8208;Free Dehydrogenative Annulation of Allylic Alcohols: Scope, Mechanism, and Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A domino reaction comprising four consecutive steps based on the strategy of isomerization of allylic alcohols was developed. This base&#8208;catalyzed protocol provided an approach for constructing polysubstituted quinolines without additional additives. A wide range of di&#8208; or trisubstituted &#947;&#8208;aminoaryl allylic alcohols bearing alkyl or (hetero)aryl substituents were transformed to the structurally diverse quinolines. The utility of this transformation was demonstrated by the application in the concise synthesis of several polysubstituted quinoline derivatives, including natural products and pharmacological agents. Preliminary mechanistic experiments suggested that the isomerization of &#947;&#8208;aminoaryl allylic alcohol underwent an intramolecular 1,3&#8208;hydrogen shift and the aromatization of the dihydroquinoline intermediate went through two possible pathways simultaneously exist, acceptorless dehydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation process.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;(chalcogen)benzothiazoles are frequently used as core structures for the development of pharmaceutical agents. A mild strategy for the synthesis of 2&#8208;(chalcogen)benzothiazoles under electrooxidative conditions using isocyanides, thiols or diselenides as substrates was developed. This protocol allows access to structurally diverse 2&#8208;(chalcogen)benzothiazoles in good yields and with good functional group tolerance, which does not require heavy metal catalysts and exogenous oxidants. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale synthesis was performed to demonstrate the scale&#8208;up applicability of this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Difunctionalization of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons Employing the Same Functional Reagent</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The radical difunctionalization of unsaturated hydrocarbons serves as an efficient means to rapidly construct molecular skeletons and synthesize&#8208;highly valuable compounds. In this transformational process, diverse positions within unsaturated hydrocarbons are sequentially functionalized by a single radical precursor reagent, thereby achieving highly efficient and selective transformations that promote atom economy. Furthermore, this approach minimizes the generation of numerous byproducts stemming from cross&#8208;coupling reactions between reactants, owing to the   reduction of the number of participating components. Therefore, this review provides an in&#8208;depth analysis of the radical difunctionalization of unsaturated hydrocarbons utilizing a single functional reagent in recent decades. The discussion is based on eight different radical classes (carbon&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, phosphine&#8208;, oxygen&#8208;, sulfur&#8208;, selenium&#8208;, tellurium&#8208;, and chlorine&#8208;centered radicals), emphasizing the mechanism of specific radical difunctionalization. It also analyzes in detail the regulation of key factors such as regional selectivity, and provides unique insights into reaction transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Hydroxymethylation to 2&#8208;Pyridones and Isoquinolones via C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyridine&#8208;directed regioselective C&#8208;H hydroxymethylation to pyridones and isoquinolones using para&#8208;formaldehyde has been developed under manganese catalysis, offering a wide variety of hydroxymethylated products in 40&#8208;85% yields. This operationally simple methodology proceeds in one step using an earth&#8208;abundant first&#8208;row transition metal&#8208;catalyst without the generation of unwanted salt wastes. A mechanistic study revealed that the C&#8208;H metalation step is reversible but not the rate&#8208;determining step. The introduction of hydroxymethyl group in the biologically relevant scaffolds could be used as an intermediate for valuable synthetic transformations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A copper&#8208;catalyzed annulation of enaminones with maleimides was developed to synthesize various pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;e] isoindoles. In this strategy, 2&#8208;aminopyridine served as a traceless directing group, and target products were obtained in 54&#8208;72% yields. Moreover, a plausible mechanism for this reaction  was proposed based on several control experiments, deuterium exchange experiments, and previous reports.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein describe a method in the synthesis of aryl ether derivatives from a cross&#8208;coupling reaction of vinylidenecyclopropane&#8208;diesters (VDCP&#8208;diesters) with phenolic compounds that can be purchased directly from dealers for the formation of C&#8722;O bond under palladium catalysis and assisted by Sc(OTf)3/Cs2CO3. This developed transformation proceeds through a nucleophilic addition at the 2&#8208;position of allenic moiety at 50 &#176;C for 4.0 h and are compatible with substituents such as bromine, iodine and borate on the phenolic substrates via a zwitterionic &#960;&#8208;propargyl palladium species, affording the desired products in 29% to 95% isolated yields. A plausible reaction mechanism has been also proposed on the basis of control, deuterium labeling experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A mechanism&#8208;navigated enantioselective alkylation of an indole C2 C&#8211;H bond with an internal alkene was developed. Under the inharmonious ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal catalyst ratio, a moderate enantiomeric ratio (er) was achieved with our original ligand. We propose that chain&#8208;walking and bond formation are mechanistically independent, and suggest that hydridoiridium does not play a role in the chain&#8208;walking process.</dc:description>

We propose that chain-walking and bond formation are mechanistically independent, and suggest that hydridoiridium does not play a role in the chain-walking process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>A nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive alkylative cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes with alkyl bromides has been developed. This transformation avoids the use of stoichiometric organometallic reagents and introduces alkyl groups regio&#8208; and stereoselectively into the products. This method provides a platform for the synthesis of carbo&#8208; and heterocycles that are widely found in many natural products and biologically active molecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>With an in situ C&#8208;H iodination tactic, an applicable method for the synthesis of chromone&#8208;3&#8208;phosphonates has been developed with trialkyl/triaryl phosphites as the reaction partners of o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl enaminones by palladium catalysis. The product formation consists of cascade C&#8208;H iodination, chromone annulation, and Arbuzov&#8208;type C&#8208;P cross coupling as major transformations. In addition to providing an enaminone&#8208;based synthetic method to chromone&#8208;3&#8208;phosphonates, the work is of advantage for the step economy by skipping the separate operation for preparing iodo&#8208;functionalized chromone intermediate.</dc:description>

Abstract
Heterocycles are important compounds existed in diverse advanced chemicals, functional materials, bioactive molecules and natural products. Different strategies through transition metal&#8208;catalyzed alkyne cyclization have been developed to synthesize various heterocycles. The merger of alkyne cyclization and metal nanoparticle catalysis has emerged as an important approach to diverse heterocycles. By using different kinds of metal nanoparticle catalysts, such as gold, silver, copper and palladium nanoparticles, a number of heterocycles are prepared with high yield and selectivity in a green, sustainable and highly efficient manner. This review summarizes and discusses recent achievements in metal nanoparticle&#8208;catalyzed alkyne cyclization for the synthesis of heterocycles.

Abstract
A [3+2]/[2+1] domino annulation reaction of cyclohexadienones and &#945;&#8208;aryl vinylsulfonium salts has been reported. A range of cyclopropane fused tricyclic enones bearing four contiguous stereocenters were obtained as a single diastereomer in 44&#8211;93% yields. The synthetic utility was demonstrated with the gram&#8208;scale reactions and further transformations of the products.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction of Trifluoromethylated &#946;&#8208;Keto Diazos and Nitriles Proceeding via H2O Addition to Nitrile Ylides</title>

Abstract
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed multi&#8208;component reaction of trifluoromethylated &#946;&#8208;amino ketones and nitriles using tert&#8208;butyl nitrite as a diazotization reagent has been developed. Under the optimized conditions, N&#8208;trifluoroalkyl amides were obtained with yields up to 87%. Control experiments and computational studies reveal that the reaction proceeds through the generation of diazo, in&#8197;situ formation of nitrile ylide, water addition and final enol tautomerism. This approach features mild reaction conditions, wide substrate tolerance, and scale&#8208;up applicability, which provides an efficient and practical strategy for amide synthesis.

         <title>Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reaction of Glycals with Base&#8208;Labile Protecting Groups as a New Route to Glycoporphyrins</title>

Abstract
Glycoporphyrins are considered promising photosensitisers of new generation. Herein, we describe a metal&#8208;catalysed synthetic method towards porphyrin&#8208;carbohydrate C&#8722;C conjugates. The protocol of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction has been developed and it was compatible with peracetylated 2&#8208;iodoglycals. The utility of the reaction was exemplified on 15 different (C&#8208;2)&#8208;arylated sugar derivatives. Then it was applied on more challenging starting materials, namely, porphyrin boronates in which we addressed the issues of difficult transmetalation step usually observed on palladium&#8208;catalysed processes of porphyrin derivatives. The efficiency of the protocol was finally applied to synthesize the library of glycoporphyrins proving the versatile character of this strategy. Finally, the methodology was transferred onto A4&#8208;type porphyrin to efficiently obtain an interesting example of a multivalent glycoconjugate.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Amino Sulfones from Vinyl Sulfones and Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A method for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;amino sulfones through visible light&#8208;induced oxidative decarboxylation and radical reductive addition is described. Various readily available N&#8208;protected natural amino acids react with aromatic/aliphatic vinyl sulfones to directly produce &#947;&#8208;amino sulfone derivatives. This reaction is also applicable to &#945;&#8208;N(O)&#8208;acids and other aliphatic carboxylic acids, resulting in the corresponding sulfone derivatives. The method operates without the need for sacrificial reducing agents or additional hydrogen atom donors. The sole by&#8208;product is CO2 released from decarboxylation, rendering the process both atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical.

The method operates without the need for sacrificial reducing agents or additional hydrogen atom donors. The sole by-product is CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; released from decarboxylation, rendering the process both atom- and step-economical.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A class of novel chiral&#8208;bridged biphenyl monophosphine ligands with a benzofuran moiety (He&#8208;phos) has been successfully synthesized and reported. These ligands exhibited good performance in the gold&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cycloaddition reaction of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones with nitrones, resulting in the successful preparation of a series of polyaryl&#8208;substituted heterocyclic compounds with high enantioselectivities (up to 99% yield, 98% ee). The wide substrate adaptability (53 examples) and mild reaction conditions demonstrate the practicability of He&#8208;phos in this reaction.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Promoted Domino Processes for the Synthesis of Homoallylic Amines, Quinolines and Tetrahydroquinolines</title>

Abstract
Herein, the synthesis of homoallylic amines, quinolines, and tetrahydroquinolines has been demonstrated. The domino one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component approach has been accomplished using Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed conditions. A useful scaffold construction strategy can be achieved by controlling the electronic effect of aniline rather than relying on reaction conditions. The described method applies to a wide variety of substrates embedded with diverse functional groups and can be extended toward the synthesis of natural products. Suitable control experiments, real&#8208;time NMR studies, and DFT calculations have validated the reported process. The protocol outlines a strategy for synthesizing homoallylic amines and quinolines, controlled by the electronic properties of anilines.

Abstract
Herein, we present a (NH4)2S2O8 mediated difunctionalization reaction of aryl alkenes with quinoxalinones and P(O)SH compounds. This method enables the synthesis of various phosphorothioate&#8208;containing quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives (46 examples) in 37&#8211;79% yields. The reaction is compatible with a range of functional groups and is easily adaptable to large&#8208;scale synthesis. Preliminary studies suggest the involvement of phosphorothioate radicals in these transformations.

Abstract
The synthesis of diverse phthalides containing quaternary carbon centers remains poorly exploited, requiring stepwise reactions with toxic reagents under high temperatures. Herein, we describe a visible&#8208;light promoted, photo&#8208; and metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free protocol for the modular synthesis of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted phthalides with water as the sole by&#8208;product. This process featured an open&#8208;flask operation of a three&#8208;component reaction involving an isocoumarin as the self&#8208;photosensitizer for aerobic ring contracting rearrangements, allowing the convenient preparation of 3&#8208;(1&#8242;&#8208;indolyl)&#8208;phthalides in moderate to good yields. The mechanistic investigations suggested that singlet oxygen (1O2) was generated through an energy&#8208;transfer pathway.

Abstract
A strategy for the synthesis of N,N&#8208;disubstituted hydrazines via the electrocatalytic addition of hydrazine to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds is reported. The reaction was carried out under constant current electrolytic conditions in an undivided cell. Using this methodology, various N,N&#8208;disubstituted hydrazines were prepared in 57&#8211;94% yield in 40&#8197;minutes. By adding cyclohexanone and acetic acid to the reaction mixture of N,N&#8208;disubstituted hydrazines and heating for 2&#8197;hours, a one&#8208;pot synthesis of N&#8208;substituted indoles was also developed. Furthermore, based on cyclic voltammetry and control experiments, a plausible mechanism involving a radical pathway is proposed.

         <title>Regioselective C6&#8208;Arylation of Thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazole Heterocycles with Aryl Iodides</title>

Abstract
Regioselective C6&#8208;arylation of thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazoles with aryl iodides as coupling partners has been developed. This strategy was performed in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 as catalyst in combination with AgOTf as an oxidant and TFA in dimethylacetamide. In all experiments, only the C6&#8208;arylated thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazole was isolated since its C5&#8208;regioisomer was not observed, indicating the high regioselectivity of this approach. The catalytic system used is compatible with a variety of 3&#8208;functionalized thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazoles and iodoaryl electrophiles, providing access to 3,6&#8208;disubstituted thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazoles in yields ranging from 49% to 94%.

Abstract
Decarbonylative and dehydrogenative cascade annulation of aldehydes with N&#8208;(o&#8208;cyanobiaryl)acrylamides was developed for the synthesis of a broad spectrum of alkyl&#8208; and carbonyl&#8208;substituted pyrido[4,3,2&#8208;gh]phenanthridines. Secondary and tertiary aldehydes can undergo the decarbonylative cascade under DTBP/malonic acid conditions, while aryl, primary, and secondary aldehydes can undergo dehydrogenative reaction under TBHP system. Such transformations were triggered by alkyl and acyl radicals, and the annulations were accomplished through intramolecular additions of carbon&#8208;centered radical to nitrile group and iminyl radical to aromatic ring.

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot Pd&#8208;catalyzed tandem process to prepare (2&#8208;arylallyl) aryl sulfones has been developed. This strategy is based on the modular assembly of a boronic acid, a sodium sulfinate and 2&#8208;bromoallyl acetate. The reaction is completely regioselective towards the terminal alkene, yielding (2&#8208;arylallyl) aryl (or alkyl) sulfones with yields ranging from 56 to 93%. Control experiments together with DFT calculations allowed to propose a plausible reaction mechanism of the tandem reaction. The usefulness of this methodology has been demonstrated with the formal synthesis of the marketed drug Apremilast and of several natural products by asymmetric hydrogenation. Using the commercially available UbaPHOX iridium complex, chiral &#946;&#8208;methyl sulfones with up to 98% ee were obtained

Abstract
An iron&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the synthesis of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole heterocyclic structures is disclosed employing isatins and non&#8208;nucleophilic N&#8208;methoxybenzamides. This reaction class is associated with broad scope and tolerates numerous functionalities, such as fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo, trifluoromethyl, nitrile, ester, ether, and alkenyl, including heteroaryl &#8211; thiophene, benzothiophene, carbazolyl, indolyl, eugenol, and polycyclic cholesterol moieties. Detailed mechanistic investigations reveal that the reaction proceeds via iron&#8208;catalyzed N&#8722;O bond cleavage in N&#8208;methoxybenzamides, generating formaldehyde and benzamide, and through the intermediacy of isatin&#8208;ketimines and N&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)benzamides. Overall, this amidation reaction involves one C&#8722;C and two C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming tandem processes, providing a range of &#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;oxindoles (45 examples) in up to 88% yields.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Nitrocyclopropanes Bearing a Thioester Group and Three Stereogenic Centers</title>

Abstract
A two&#8208;stage protocol was developed for accessing nitrocyclopropanes that bear a thioester group and three stereogenic centers. This protocol achieves practical overall yields ranging from 54% to 75%, along with high levels of stereoselectivity (single diastereomer with up to 98% ee). Brominated monothiomalonate (Br&#8208;MTM) is used as an &#945;&#8208;bromo thioacetate equivalent, which reacts efficiently with nitroolefins in the presence of a low catalyst loading (0.5&#8197;mol%) of cinchona alkaloid squaramide under both &#8220;on water&#8221; and organic homogeneous conditions. The obtained &#945;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitrothioesters undergo an anti&#8208;selective decarboxylation and intramolecular SN2 cyclization process, leading to the formation of desired cyclopropanes. Control experiments were conducted alongside computational studies in order to gain insights into the observed stereoselectivities.

Abstract
Ytterbium triflate catalysed domino reaction of (3&#8208;formyl&#8208;4&#8208;indolyl)&#8208;derived donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane with primary amines provides a simple approach to an unprecedented tetracyclic skeleton in which tropane system is peri&#8208;annulated with an indole core. This process involves the formation of an imine and its (3+2)&#8208;cross&#8208;cycloaddition with donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane moiety, yielding tropane&#8208;fused indole core under mild reaction conditions. These products are of significant interest for pharmacology as potential hybrid molecules with a dual mode of action.

Abstract
A synthetic route towards phospholanes via twofold C&#8722;H&#8208;addition of a DMSO molecule to &#946;&#8208;H substituted phospholes is described. The resulting fused phospholane oxothiolane system in case of symmetric &#945;&#8208;substitution possesses four stereogenic centers or rather six in case of asymmetric &#945;&#8208;substitution. The reaction conditions are shown to be applicable for a variety of phospholes with different P&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;substituents always leading to stereoselective formation of the fused heterocyclic ring system. All phospholane derivatives with one exception are sufficiently air stable for purification with column chromatography and are fully characterized by NMR and elemental analysis and mass spectrometry. With the help of X&#8208;ray crystallography, the different configurations of the isomers could be demonstrated. For one model system derivatization reactions are presented. When oxidizing or reducing the sulfoxide group only a single diastereomer is observed.

Abstract
Achieving precise control over regioselectivity and stereoselectivity in the hydroelementation of terminal allenes presents a formidable challenge. Despite the existence of various catalytic methods for their functionalization, this entire class of reactions remains significantly underdeveloped and demands extensive research. Here, we report a method for the hydroelementation of allenes using inexpensive PN5P pincer cobalt complexes built on a triazine backbone. Depending on the substituent at the ring, the method enables the selective synthesis of E&#8208;alkenylsilane or Z&#8208;allylborane derivatives. In the presented approach, silanes and pinacoloboranes play a dualistic role of simultaneous activator and substrate excluding the need for the addition of external bases. Finally, the application potential of the obtained compounds was demonstrated by performing further functionalizations of the obtained compounds.

Abstract
A palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8722;H olefination of chlorobenzene derivatives, which favored the functionalization at the ortho&#8208;to&#8208;chlorine position, was reported. The catalytic system employed a commercially available quinoline ligand to access a wide panel of olefinated aryl chlorides in moderate to high yields from feedstock chemicals (42 examples, 28 to 93% yields). The synthetic utility of the method was further demonstrated by the coupling of various bio&#8208;relevant acrylate partners offering straightforward access to structurally diverse complex molecules. A computational study of the reaction allowed us to confirm that the C&#8722;H activation step, occurring through a Concerted Metalation&#8208;Deprotonation mechanism, determined the site&#8208;selectivity of the transformation. The regioselectivity was controlled by the pKa of the C&#8722;H bond (more acidic position) and the lower distortion of chlorobenzene in the key transition structure.

Abstract
One&#8208;pot access to sulfonyl 2,3&#8208;diarylnaphthalenes was developed via tBuOK&#8208;mediated (4+2) benzannulation of o&#8208;bis&#8208;sulfonylmethyl arenes, employing diverse diarylacetylenes. A plausible mechanism is proposed and discussed. The advantages of the system include the use of inexpensive reagents, wide substrate scope, and mild reaction conditions. The synthetic route allows for the formation of two carbon&#8211;carbon double bonds (C=C).

The front cover image was created and painted by the young and talented artist Helena Bosnar (used with permission). The artwork depicts the asymmetric arylation of ketimines as a metamorphosis from a caterpillar into a butterfly. In this metaphor, the caterpillar symbolizes the planar nature of ketimine. As it progresses to the chrysalis stage (catalyst), the caterpillar utilizes stored food (aryl group) to undergo transformation into a butterfly, symbolizing the optically pure three&#8208;dimensional nature of chiral &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines. Details can be found in Review by Matija Gredi&#269;ak and co&#8208;workers (K. Vlahovi&#269;ek&#8208;Kahlina, M. Marijan, M. Mati&#353;i&#263;, M. Gredi&#269;ak, Adv. Synth.

The inside cover picture illustrates the radical transformations of propargylic alcohols to construct a series of functionalized skeletons. In this review, these reactions can be divided into four parts based on the different mechanisms of radical formation, just like the archer shooting at a range in the picture, firing the same arrow in different ways may produce different results. Details can be found in the review by Xian&#8208;Rong Song and co&#8208;workers (M. Liang, H. Ma, X.&#8208;R. Song, Q. Xiao, Adv. Synth.

Abstract
Arylation of ketimines is the most straightforward strategy for constructing chiral &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines, important structural motifs found in natural products and biologically active compounds. This comprehensive review highlights the achievements in the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed and organocatalyzed asymmetric arylations of ketimines from the seminal report published in 2010 till November 2023. The review is divided into three chapters: (1) Arylation of diaryl ketimines, (2) Arylation of aryl&#8208;alkyl and aryl&#8208;acyl ketimines, and (3) Arylation of acyl&#8208;alkyl and dialkyl ketimines. Each chapter is further divided into transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions (grouped by individual metals) and organocatalyzed reactions. The covered literature includes emphasis on the advantages of the reported methodology, its scope and limitations, and the description of the transition state (where applicable).

Abstract
Propargylic alcohols are regarded as a class of readily available and versatile synthons in organic synthesis. Due to their unique bifunctional character, the transformation of propargylic alcohols has been widely utilized as a powerful strategy for the construction of various functionalized frameworks over the past few decades. Recently, the radical transformation of propargylic alcohols has attracted considerable attention in synthetic chemistry. This review summarizes recent progress in the radical transformation of propargylic alcohols. Based on the different mechanisms of radical formation underlying these transformations, this review has been divided into four parts: (1) transition&#8208;metal catalyzed radical transformation; (2) photo&#8208;induced radical transformation; (3) electro&#8208;induced radical transformation; and (4) metal&#8208;free or oxidant&#8208;mediated radical transformation of propargylic alcohols.

Abstract
In this study, we have developed a metal&#8208;mediated synthetic method for incorporating the 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl (CF2CF2H) motif into unactivated, electron&#8208;rich alkenyl iodides using cross&#8208;coupling reactions. We discovered that the stable Cu(CF2CF2H)(PPh2Me)3 complex, while unreactive with these substrates, serves as a P&#8208;ligated reservoir for the formation of solvent&#8208;stabilized &#8220;ligandless&#8221; and reactive CuCF2CF2H species. This transformation occurs upon addition of CuBr, which partially scavenges the P&#8208;ligand in the form of CuBr(PPh2Me)3. The resulting in&#8197;situ generated solvent stabilized &#8220;ligandless&#8221; system significantly enhances the reactivity of the complex, particularly towards challenging electron&#8208;rich substrates. This advancement enables the synthesis of HCF2CF2&#8208;glycals, as well as nucleosides/nucleobases and arenes.

Abstract
Carbamoyl azide is a pivotal compound used in the transformation into urea and amines, as well as in nitrene insertion reactions. In this study, we present a pioneering method for synthesizing carbamoyl azide directly from acid redox active esters without the use of metals or oxidants. This approach demonstrates tolerance for various functional groups, enhancing its applicability. Furthermore, this technique facilitates late&#8208;stage modifications of natural products and pharmaceuticals, thereby accelerating the development and identification of novel drug candidates.

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Markovnikov Hydroarylation of Arylcyclobutene: A Route to gem&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;Substituted Cyclobutanes</title>

Abstract
A regioselective Markovnikov hydroarylation of arylcyclobutene has been developed using Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis through a protonation/Friedel&#8208;Crafts sequence. The metal&#8208;free catalytic reaction is operationally simple and feasible compared to previous reports that utilized elaborate arylcyclobutene and specific polyfluorinated reagents, affording a variety of gem&#8208;diaryl&#8208; substituted arylcyclobutene in good yields. The possible mechanism of the reaction has been explored through step&#8208;by&#8208;step control experiments. This protocol involving indole in gem&#8208;diaryl&#8208;substituted cyclobutene scaffolds not only enriches the applications of Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed hydroarylation, but also paves the way for a more extensive access to potential bioactive cyclobutanes structures.

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component reaction strategy for the selective synthesis of 5&#8208;trifluoromethyl pyrimidine derivatives has been established. This method avoids the inherent selectivity challenges in direct pyrimidine trifluoromethylation. The reaction demonstrates tolerance to various functional groups, yielding 5&#8208;trifluoromethyl pyrimidine derivatives with up to 80% yields. Moreover, the practicality of this method has been underscored through scale&#8208;up reactions.

Abstract
A catalyst&#8208;free electrochemical alkylacetoxylation reaction of terminal alkynes with (thio)xanthenes and carboxylic acids is developed. Treating the addition products with K2CO3 as a base in methanol affords the ketones in moderate to good yields. Preliminary experimental and computational studies indicate that the benzylic cation generated from the (thio)xanthenes triggers the electrophilic addition to alkynes.

Abstract
Tetrasubstituted 2,3&#8208;trans&#8208;dihydrofuran and furan are important heterocyclic scaffolds in natural product, bioorganic and medicinal chemistry as well as in material science. The synthesis of both of these heterocycles starting from common and readily available starting materials are challenging. We found that in&#8197;situ generated deoxybenzoin&#8208;chalcone Michael adducts underwent oxidative annulation upon heating with molecular iodine in DMSO to provide selectively 2,3&#8208;trans&#8208;dihydrofurans at 80&#8201;&#176;C and furans at 120&#8201;&#176;C.

Abstract
Mono&#8208; and dichloro acetamides were prepared via a hydrodechlorination reaction of trichloroacetamides under controlled electrochemical conditions. The reactions were carried out in an undivided cell with constant current flow using n&#8208;Bu4NI as supporting electrolyte and methanol as solvent and proton source. Deuterodechlorination of trichloroacetamide was also successful when methanol&#8208;d4 was used as solvent under identical electrochemical conditions.

         <dc:description>Numerous appropriately substituted pyridyl or phenyl groups serve as a particularly advantageous activation motif for the electrochemical oxidation of amines. Such groups enable a general, mild method for the electrochemical &#945;&#8208;functionalization of tertiary amines across numerous activating groups and amine scaffolds. Notably, the method accommodates an unprecedented range of nucleophile classes, allowing for the introduction of diverse functional groups to the readily prepared amine substrates. The utility of this method is then demonstrated through applications to unsymmetrical bisfunctionalization, site&#8208;selective functionalization of N&#8208;pyridyl amines vs. other activated amines, a formal synthesis of ivosidenib and the diversification of FDA&#8208;approved drugs or natural product substrates.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract. We present a new metal&#8208;free photocatalytic approach for the synthesis of difluoroalkoxylated ketones. This strategy involves the generation of alkoxyl radicals from pyridinium salts upon the activity of a catalytic electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex. This mild process tolerates several functional groups and can be scaled up to gram scale. Diverse products manipulations accounts for the versatility of the obtained fluorinated products, highlighting the synthetic usefulness of this method.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;free Pd&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of PAHs via vinyl C&#8208;H activation/decarboxylative cyclization sequence</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a strategy for the synthesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from readily available 2&#8208;iodostyrenes and o&#8209;halobenzoic acids through a ligand&#8208;free palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade vinyl C&#8208;H activation/decarboxylative cyclization. A vinyl&#8208;coordinated five&#8208;membered palladacycle was proposed as the key intermediate for this sequential process. Furthermore, Heptagon&#8208;embedded aromatic compounds can be smoothly synthesized by employing 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;naphthoic acid as decarboxylative insertion unit.</dc:description>

A vinyl-coordinated five-membered palladacycle was proposed as the key intermediate for this sequential process. Furthermore, Heptagon-embedded aromatic compounds can be smoothly synthesized by employing 8-bromo-1-naphthoic acid as decarboxylative insertion unit.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intramolecular Buchner reaction: experimental and theoretical comparison of the effect of the carbene substituent on the chemoselectivity.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intramolecular Buchner reaction is a powerful transformation able to dearomatize benzenic rings. However, the competitive C&#8211;H insertion of the carbene moiety into benzylic positions still remains a limitation, and the reasons governing this uncomplete chemoselectivity are poorly understood. The carbene substitution, in particular, have been observed to influence strongly the selectivity, though the currently proposed explanation relying on the electrophilicity of the metallocarbene hardly describes some experimental results reported in the literature. In this article, we present our experimental observations of intramolecular rhodium&#8208;catalyzed Buchner reactions, combined with DFT calculations on selected carbene substituents, to propose a complementary explanation for the observed chemoselectivity modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Rh(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Selective C&#8208;H Alkylation and Alkenylation of 1,2,3&#8208;Benzotriazinones with Maleimides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a condition&#8208;based switchable Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H alkylation and alkenylation of 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazinones with maleimides, where triazinone serves as a directing group rather than its traditional role denitrogenative precursor. This strategy enables the selective synthesis of diverse 3&#8208;arylated succinimides and 3&#8208;arylated maleimides in up to 99% yield with broad substrate scope (48 examples). Furthermore, for the first time, a tandem C&#8208;H alkylation and denitrogenative coupling of 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazinones has been realized by slightly modifying the reaction conditions. Additionally, gram&#8208;scale reactions and product derivatizations were conducted to demonstrate the synthetic utility.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Polyaryl&#8208;Substituted Azafluoranthenes via Co&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition of 1,6&#8208;Diynes with Nitriles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of azafluoranthene derivatives under mild conditions via [2+2+2] cycloaddition of 1,6&#8208;diynes and nitriles catalyzed by CoBr2/dppp, exhibiting good atom economy. This procedure uses an inexpensive ligand and an earth&#8208;abundant metal as catalyst to lower the cost of synthesis. Several azafluoranthenes are produced in 28&#8211;95% yields using this approach, featuring mild conditions, wide substrate scope, and good functional group tolerance. The fluorescence spectra of some azafluoranthenes indicate that these scaffolds have good photophysical properties for material science.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic regioselective aldol reaction of hydroxyacetone with aliphatic aldehydes for the synthesis of linear products</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present an organocatalyst that addresses the reactivity issue of aliphatic aldehydes with hydroxyacetone, leading to the formation of a linear product. Previous proline&#8208;based catalysts required a significant excess of hydroxyacetone and could only be applied to aromatic aldehydes. The proposed sulphonamide containing a proline moiety effectively controls the reaction, generating a new stereogenic center dependent on the catalyst's configuration and does not require a large excess of the ketone. We demonstrated that this methodology can be effectively utilized in the synthesis of natural compounds, as confirmed by obtaining the 2&#8208;keto&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;gluconic acid (KDG) methyl ester from optically pure glyceraldehyde and protected hydroxyacetone.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>2H&#8208;Azirines are an important class of small&#8208;ring heterocycle that have been employed as versatile synthetic building blocks. Herein, a one&#8208;pot CuAAC/ring&#8208;cleavage/[4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/rearrangement reaction sequence involving terminal ynones, sulfonyl azides and 2H&#8208;azirines is reported that leads to 2&#8208;aminopyridine derivatives. In the first step, highly reactive N&#8208;sulfonyl &#945;&#8208;acylketenimines are generated, via a CuAAC/ring&#8208;cleavage process, from sulfonyl azides and terminal ynones and these undergo inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8722;Alder cycloaddition reactions with 2H&#8208;azirines to form (isolable) 1,3&#8208;oxazines that themselves undergo base&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;cleavage and rearrangement reactions to afford the title compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Benchmarking methanophosphocines as versatile PIII/PV redox organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PIII/PV redox cycling has recently emerged as a valuable strategy to minimized the chemical waste generated by phosphine&#8208;mediated reaction, as well as enabling asymetric transformation. In this article, we detail our contribution to this field by designing a series of diversely functionalized, electron&#8208;rich bridgehead phosphine oxides with structural features that make them well&#8208;suited for PIII/PV redox organocatalysis. Their catalytic performance has been assessed in various model reactions, including Wittig or Staudinger reactions, along with the reduction of activated alkenes and allenes. For each of these scenarios, we performed a comparative analysis with existing catalysts in order to demonstrate the applicability and limitation of methanophosphocines.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Aerobic Dearomatization of Naphthylamines under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The dearomatization of aromatic substrates via photocatalytic methodologies has gained escalating prominence to access molecular complexity. Although much focus has been put on non&#8208;active arenes, naphthols and N&#8208;based heteroaromatics, arylamines have so far remained in the background. Herein, we report a photocatalytic strategy for the aerobic, dearomative hydroxylation of naphthylamines under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Our investigation highlights singlet oxygen generation as a viable mechanism for aromaticity disruption, mitigating selectivity issues deriving from the direct oxidation of targeted arylamines. Finally, we showcased the synthetic value of the obtained dearomatized products in a late&#8208;stage diversification campaign.

         <dc:description>We developed a second&#8208;generation of Lewis acid catalyst enabling selective and user&#8208;friendly phosphonylation of diverse alcohols. This one&#8208;pot method utilizes P(III) reagent bis(2,2,2&#8211;trifluoroethyl) phosphite under mild conditions. Exploring the influence of metal selection in Lewis acid catalysts revealed four highly active complexes for alcohol phosphonylation: Zn(II), Al(III), Zr(IV), and Hf(IV). Notably, Hf(IV) displayed superior selectivity compared to the previously developed Zn(II) catalyst.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, external photocatalyst&#8208;free, site&#8208;selective C&#8208;H arylation of 4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones and various 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes has been developed to provide ortho arylated products  41&#8208; 95% yield at room temperature. A mechanistic study using controlled experiments, UV&#8208;visible study, DFT study, and observation of colored aggregates suggest that in situ generated Ag&#8208;palladacycle complex of 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes is responsible for absorbing the visible light and generating aryl radicals from aryldiazonium salts. Further, this methodology demonstrates its versatility by transforming various 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes, including 2&#8208;phenylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;one, 3&#8208;phenylquinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one, 2&#8208;phenylpyridines, pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines, 2&#8208;phenylquinolines, 2&#8208;phenylisoquinolines, and 2&#8208;phenylbenzo[d]thiazoles, into their respective regio&#8208;selective C&#8208;H arylated products under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component allylic alkylation reaction of &#945;&#8208;diazo ketones, water and allyl carbonate under the cooperative catalysis of Rh2(OAc)4, Pd2(dba)3 and Br&#248;nster acid was disclosed. This method provids an expeditious access to &#945;&#8208;keto homoallylic alcohols in good to high yields. Controlled experiments support that the transformations proceed through cross&#8208;interception of two active intermediates Pd&#8208;allyl species and enol intermediates derived from oxonium ylides. Moreover, synthetic transformations of the generated products enable the creation of motifs enriched with dense functional groups, underscoring their potential as valuable building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Functionalized Indenes via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Homolytic Cleavage of a Furan C&#8722;O Bond</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photoinduced palladium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydroarylation of furans to form functionalized indenes was achieved via an intramolecular reductive coupling of aryl bromide with furan using silane as the reductant. Deuterium tracking and DFT analysis revealed a reasonable reaction pathway involving: 1) the homolytic cleavage of the furan C&#8722;O bond induced by the &#945;&#8208;allyl radical; 2) a 1,6&#8208;H atom transfer from carbon to oxygen.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a one&#8208;pot cascade sequence catalyzed by gold starting from 1,5&#8208;diynes and a zwitterion (source of Tf2C=CH2), which allows the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective preparation of cyclobutene&#8208;fused [4&#8208;7&#8208;6] tricycles and displays orthogonal reactivity of the 1,5&#8208;diyne system, zwitterion and metal catalyst. Moreover, the obtained tricyclic bis(triflyl)cyclobutenes [triflyl = (trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl] can be easily converted into more complex structures such as bridged ketal and fused 1,3&#8208;oxazine tetracyclic systems, demonstrating the potential of our protocol.</dc:description>

This fluorinated byproduct is inert in the reaction conditions, and no other is expected because the Ar and X groups are the same in the catalyst, the intermediates and  the products. The application of &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; in catalysis (&lt;i&gt;e.g.&lt;/i&gt; with 1% catalyst ratio) consists of a first step (formation of 1% tailor&#8208;made catalyst) where 100 ArX + 1 &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; (or &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;) + 1 L in THF gives a solution with 99 ArX + 1 [Pd(Ar)(X)(L)] + (Ar&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The only other byproduct is THF or NCMe. In the second step,  addition of the nucleophile, 100 Q(Nu), triggers and completes the catalytic cycle yielding 100 Ar&#8208;Nu + 100 Q(Br) + 1 [Pd0(L)]. The 100% yield is theoretical, but the tested catalysis (Ar&#8211;Me Negishi coupling, C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;alkynyl Stille coupling and Ar&#8208;naphthyl Suzuki coupling) using &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; as precursor, SPhos as ligand, and 1000:1 reagents:catalyst ratio, afford 95&#8208;99% yield. In contrast, aryl&#8208;amination requires 1000:5 ratio to give 96% yield (or 1000:50 for 99% yield) because PhNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; eventually blocks the catalyst. As a bonus, the presence of F in the precursors facilitates stepwise &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR monitoring of formation of the [Pd(Ar)(X)(L)] catalyst with different phosphines, facilitating analysis of weaknesses or strengths of each of them to produce the catalyst, and helps in the choice of the most convenient one for the case. The &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;  catalyst formation is ideal for serial two&#8208;step catalysis with different phosphines or different nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization Using Chlorine Radicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Converting any desired C&#8722;H bond to the intended C&#8722;Z bond in a given organic molecule could be the final peak of the C&#8722;H functionalization methodology. Among the three types of C&#8722;H bonds, the functionalization of the ubiquitous C(sp3)&#8722;H bond has gained particular attention, especially in the last two decades. There are different ways to transform C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds into desired C&#8722;Z bonds. The use of chlorine radicals is one of these methods with a promising future. The literature review shows that different sources have been used for chlorine, including chloride ions (HCl or chloride salts), coordinated chlorides (transition metal complexes), and organic chlorides (organochlorine compounds). However, HCl and FeCl3 have gained the most attention among these sources. There are three major ways to convert chlorine from these sources to chlorine radicals: 1) oxidation of hydrogen chloride or chloride salts, 2) photolysis of metal chloride, and 3) transition metal insertion into C&#8722;Cl bonds. This review summarizes published research papers on the use of chlorine radicals for C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds functionalization. Therefore, chlorination reactions of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and reactions in which chlorine radicals do not play a direct role in C(sp3)&#8722;H bond cleavage are not within the scope of this review.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Converting any desired C&#8722;H bond to the intended C&#8722;Z bond in a given organic molecule could be the final peak of the C&#8722;H functionalization methodology. Among the three types of C&#8722;H bonds, the functionalization of the ubiquitous C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond has gained particular attention, especially in the last two decades. There are different ways to transform C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds into desired C&#8722;Z bonds. The use of chlorine radicals is one of these methods with a promising future. The literature review shows that different sources have been used for chlorine, including chloride ions (HCl or chloride salts), coordinated chlorides (transition metal complexes), and organic chlorides (organochlorine compounds). However, HCl and FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; have gained the most attention among these sources. There are three major ways to convert chlorine from these sources to chlorine radicals: 1) oxidation of hydrogen chloride or chloride salts, 2) photolysis of metal chloride, and 3) transition metal insertion into C&#8722;Cl bonds. This review summarizes published research papers on the use of chlorine radicals for C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds functionalization. Therefore, chlorination reactions of C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds and reactions in which chlorine radicals do not play a direct role in C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond cleavage are not within the scope of this review.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Endogenous Group&#8208;Directed Late&#8208;Stage C&#8722;H Functionalization of Peptides</title>

Abstract
Peptides are diverse in terms of their functional groups and side&#8208;chain functionalities, and late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization plays a crucial role in their design. Approaches for such synthesis require pre&#8208;installation and post&#8208;removal of the directing group (DG). In recent times, chemical methods have been developed, focusing on the external DG&#8208;free C&#8722;H functionalization of peptides. These approaches utilize the inherent native functionality of peptides as DG to simplify synthetic routes, reducing synthetic steps, waste generation, enhancing sustainability, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and operational flexibility. Such approaches facilitate late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization of both natural and unnatural amino acid&#8208;containing peptides.

Abstract
A silver&#8208;catalyzed regioselective one&#8208;pot cyclization reaction of diazo reagents with fluoronitroalkenes was developed. This transformation presents a method for accessing a series of 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;fluoropyrazoles that are substituted with various groups such as trifluoromethyl, carboxylic ester, nitrile, and phosphonate ester. Further synthetic transformations offered the corresponding fluorinated and trifluoromethylated analogues of two fungicide compounds.

Abstract
Pulsed ultrasonic irradiation with on&#8208;off modulation remarkably enhances asymmetric noncovalent organocatalysis &#8220;on water&#8221;, specifically for Michael addition and Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. This approach effectively addresses challenges associated with solid reactant dispersion encountered in &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221; reactions and mitigates overheating issues caused by continuous ultrasound exposure, thereby significantly augmenting reaction rates and stereoselectivities.

Abstract
The cascade reaction of ynamides with propargyl thiols by Au(I) catalysis involving regioselective hydrothiolation, thio&#8208;Claisen rearrangement, and cycloisomerization to generate 2&#8208;aminothiophenes in a one&#8208;pot manner is described. In this reaction, the selection of reaction temperature is crucial, with the initial step, namely hydrothiolation, conducted at a low temperature (40&#8201;&#176;C), followed by the subsequent reaction requiring an increase in temperature (&gt;110&#8201;&#176;C). Furthermore, it was revealed that multi&#8208;substituted anilines could be synthesized from the resulting 2&#8208;aminothiophenes.

         <title>Synthesis of Sulfonyl&#8208;Containing spiro[5,5]trienones from Sodium Metabisulfite</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An efficient three&#8208;component reaction of biaryl ynones, sodium metabisulfite and aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates is developed. The reaction occurs at room temperature without any additives, thus offering a sustainable approach to access sulfonyl&#8208;containing spiro[5,5]trienones. This protocol features mild conditions, broad substrate scope and high functional group compatibility, furnishing the target products in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction undergoes a 6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig dearomative spirocyclization process which is initated by an aryl radical with the insertion of sulfur dioxide.

Abstract
An Iridium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H cyclization of N&#8208;arylphthalazinones with &#945;&#8208;diazotized Meldrum's acid afforded tetracyclic phthalazine derivatives with a carbonyl group in 98% yield in only 30&#8197;min. The initial formation of tetracyclic phthalazine derivatives also provided access to a powerful building block. The utility of this method is emphasized by the synthetic transformation into a series of potentially bioactive derivatives.

Abstract
An intermolecular annulation reaction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;indandions with alkynes was reported using Pd(OAc)2 to access spirobi[indene]&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones. Under palladium catalysis, the substrates form a homocoupling dimer intermediate through a catalytic dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling process. The palladium(II) species could come from dimer or 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;indandion. Notably, this pathway is not typically observed in enol&#8208;directed formal sp3 C&#8722;H functionalization/oxidative annulation palladium chemistry. This transformation provides a route to access a class of functionalized spiro carbocyclic indenes.

         <title>Diradical Polar Reactivity Induced by Electricity&#8208;Mediated Ground State Triplet Nitrenium Species</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
It is extremely rare for reactive intermediates to possess a ground state triplet character. Excited state triplet intermediates are generally accessed by means of photon transfer from a tunable light source or by using any triplet sensitizers. N&#8208;acyl N&#8208;alkoxy nitreniums are an important class of reactive intermediates in the synthetic organic community due to their prolonged lifetime and ground&#8208;state singlet character. Herein, we report an external oxidant and toxic catalyst&#8208;free mild electrochemical protocol to access nitrenium reactive intermediate. Experimental findings of the mechanistic pathway suggested a theoretically predicted triplet reactive intermediate that is energetically favorable compared to the singlet pathway.

Abstract
Thanks to Pd(II)&#8208;catalysis, an efficient synthesis of unsaturated macrocycles is achieved by [3+6+3+6] condensation of cyclic ethers with aryl &#945;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters. The presence of the electron&#8208;rich aryl ester moieties forbids the use of dirhodium complexes as these diazo decomposition catalysts provoke unforeseen intermolecular Csp2&#8722;H insertion reactions that derail the targeted reactivity. However, with Pd(acac)2, using high concentration conditions (1&#8197;M), a variety of 18&#8208;membered macrocycles (16 examples) is afforded with both aryl and alkyl diazo reagents. Catalyst selection for either electrophilic aromatic substitution (Rh) or ylide (Pd) pathways are explained by computational approaches.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Classical methods for the synthesis of tertiary alcohols mainly rely on the nucleophilic addition of organometallic reagents to carbonyl compounds. Here, we disclose a strategy for synthesizing tertiary alcohols via electroreductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of aromatic carbonyl compounds and alkyl bromides (allyl, propargyl, benzyl and cyclohexyl bromides). This procedure features good substrate tolerance and friendly conditions (undivided cell, cheap and reusable carbon electrodes, reaction in open air, room temperature, without any external transition metal/activating reagent). Using this method, 32 desired products can be obtained with moderate to good yields, and gram&#8208;scale synthesis is feasible, demonstrating the practicality of this approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Diastereoselective Cascade Cyclization to Construct Polycyclic Spiroindolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein reported, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced K2S2O8 mediated cascade reaction of 3&#8208;(2&#8208;isocyanoethyl)indoles with &#945;&#8208;oxocarboxylic acids leading to diastereoselective synthesis of polycyclic spiroindolines bearing an N&#8208;formyl unit derivative utilising the alkali metal salt K2S2O8 as a catalyst under mild reaction conditions. This study offers an illustration of &#945;&#8208;oxocarboxylic acids and 3&#8208;(2&#8208;isocyanoethyl)indoles&#8208;based reactions as it shows the involvement of glyoxolate ions without decarboxylation to access polycyclic spiroindoles bearing an N&#8208;formyl unit analogue. The batch process can be extended to a continuous flow system using a glass tube loaded with K2S2O8 placed between the PFA capillary reactor, which can greatly advance the reaction efficiency and can even be promoted to gram&#8208;scale synthesis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted strategy for the decarboxylative C&#8208;3 carbamoylation of quinoxalinone scaffolds is developed. This approach initiates through the formation of an EDA complex between oxamic acid and quinoxalinone. Successive SET and decarboxylative carbamoylation construct the C&#8210;C bond. This method utilizes aerial oxygen as the green oxidant and eradicates the process from the use of external photocatalysts and transition metals. Detailed synthetic and photophysical studies enlighten the reaction pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to &#946;&#8208;Lactam Sulfonamides from Sulfamoyl Chlorides via Photoredox Catalyzed C&#8211;S Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfonyl chlorides are a synthetically attractive source of sulfonyl radicals in photoredox catalysis and are useful precursors in the synthesis of sulfones. Sulfamoyl chlorides, on the other hand, remain poorly represented despite their similar potential. In this study, N&#8209;chlorosulfonylated &#946;&#8208;lactams were prepared from readily available precursors and utilized in an atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction with a variety of olefins, producing &#946;&#8208;lactam sulfonamides in 49&#8211;95% yields. &#946;&#8208;Lactams fused to a dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;thiazine ring which closely resemble carbacephems, a widely used class of antibiotics, were also synthesized by an intra&#8208;molecular ATRA reaction. This methodology enables the preparation of &#946;&#8208;lactam sulfonamides, a class of compounds that are of great interest in pharmacology.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective introduction of gem&#8208;difluorinated carbonyl (i. e. &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro carbonyl) moieties into organic structures is a synthetically valuable but highly challenging approach. During the past decades, continuous efforts have been made for the developments of synthetic strategies for constructing C(sp3)&#8211;CF2R chiral centers with high levels of enantioselectivities. 	This review summarizes and discusses the recent advance in the enantioselective construction of gem&#8208;difluorinated carbonyl moieties, which are organized according to the reaction categories.

         <title>Biocatalytic Recycling Cascades Combining Aldolases and Transaminases for the Stereo&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Recycling cascades combining aldolases and transaminases from biodiversity were designed for the stereoselective synthesis of various isomers of &#947;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids. Aldolases with opposite enantioselectivities were combined with a D&#8208;&#945;&#8208;transaminase to prepare in a single step, D&#8208;syn or D&#8208;anti&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyglutamic acid with high yield and stereoselectivity. Bioactive (2S,3R,4S)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;isoleucine was also efficiently prepared via an aldolase&#8208;transaminase recycling cascade. In that case, the 	unexpected high stereoselectivity was shown to result from the thermodynamically&#8208;driven formation of a stable derivative of the product. This novel approach was applied to the synthesis of l&#8208;syn and d&#8208;syn&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxynorvaline as well as for 3 new &#946;&#8208;branched&#8208;&#947;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids, analogues of 4&#8208;hydroxyisoleucine.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Abstract. Recycling cascades combining aldolases and transaminases from biodiversity were designed for the stereoselective synthesis of various isomers of &#947;-hydroxy-&#945;-amino acids. Aldolases with opposite enantioselectivities were combined with a D-&#945;-transaminase to prepare in a single step, D-syn or D-anti-4-hydroxyglutamic acid with high yield and stereoselectivity. Bioactive (2S,3R,4S)-4-hydroxy-isoleucine was also efficiently prepared via an aldolase-transaminase recycling cascade. In that case, the 	unexpected high stereoselectivity was shown to result from the thermodynamically-driven formation of a stable derivative of the product. This novel approach was applied to the synthesis of l-syn and d-syn-4-hydroxynorvaline as well as for 3 new &#946;-branched-&#947;-hydroxy-&#945;-amino acids, analogues of 4-hydroxyisoleucine.

         <title>Merging Organolithium Chemistry and Stereoselective Biocatalysis: Transformation of Aromatic Nitriles into Chiral Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of RLi&#8208;mediated organic transformations (under air and at room temperature) with a subsequent stereoselective biocatalytic reaction is for the first time presented. Most of the previous asymmetric chemoenzymatic routes have been limited to the concomitant or sequential combination of transition metals/organocatalysts with enzymes. However, the use of polar organometallic reagents (RLi) in the design of these stereoselective hybrid protocols has been totally neglected, as far as we are concerned.
Thus, in this work, the combination of organolithium chemistry and asymmetric biocatalysis is described for the first time in a one&#8208;pot fashion. The chemoenzymatic approach converts a series of nitriles into chiral alcohols consisting of two steps, where the key item was the finding of suitable conditions to adapt the reactivities of organolithiums and alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) in the same recipient. The organolithium addition occurred with total chemoselectivity (no side reactions were observed) under neat conditions and room temperature leading to the corresponding imines, which were hydrolyzed using a buffer, and adjusting the pH for the subsequent ADH action. Commercial and made in house overexpressed ADHs allowed to produce chiral alcohols with excellent selectivities and good overall yields. The different behavior displayed for the reductive enzymes in the presence of diethyl ether clearly influenced in the decision to let the organolithium solvent evaporate under open&#8208;air conditions before developing the bioreduction step.
Our results demonstrate the importance of the fine orchestration of the reaction conditions for the development of efficient hybrid chemoenzymatic cascades without the need of intermediate isolation/purification steps or compartmentalization of the different synthetic systems.

         <title>Construction of Difluorinated Cycloheptadienones via Substrate&#8208;Controlled Regioselective Conjugate Addition of Difluoroenoxysilanes to Tropones and Their Anticancer Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The substrate&#8208;controlled regioselective conjugate addition (1,8&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;addition) of tropones with difluoroenoxysilanes is reported, which offered an approach for the selective synthesis of multifunctional seven&#8208;membered 3,5&#8208;cycloheptadien&#8208;1&#8208;ones and 1,3&#8208;cycloheptadien&#8208;1&#8208;ones featuring a gem&#8208;difluoroketone moiety. Moreover, these fluorinated cyclo&#8208;heptadienones exhibit effective anti&#8208;proliferative activities (IC50 &lt; 1 &#956;M) for human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells in vitro, thus providing potential lead compounds for developing new anticancer agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of Primary Phosphine Oxides in Domino&#8208;Phospha&#8208;Aldol Reactions of Diketones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An approach for the preparation and stabilization of primary phosphine oxides is presented complementing previous methods of in situ generation. Specifically, RP(O)H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; where R = benzyl (Bn), cyclohexyl (Cy), 2&#8208;naphthyl (2&#8208;Naph), phenyl (Ph), &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;butyl (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Bu) was prepared by controlled oxidation of the corresponding primary phosphine in presence of ferrocene as stabilizing reagent. The primary phosphine oxides were characterized using NMR and MS and studied in twofold hydro phosphorylation of diketones. The domino&#8208;phospha&#8208;aldol reaction catalysed with 5 mol% of sodium methoxide yielded five&#8208;, six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered heterocyclic tertiary phosphine oxides with a high degree of stereoselectivity, as confirmed by single X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The decarboxylative oxygenation of readily available carboxylic acids has been accomplished through visible light using g&#8208;C3N4 as a robust and recyclable catalyst. The scalable protocol furnishes an array of precious aldehydes and ketones under mild reaction conditions, requiring only molecular oxygen as an oxidant. Notably, no addition of stochiometric amounts of base is required, and furthermore, the reaction proceeds efficiently open to the air.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Oxaspirocyclohexadienones via Lewis&#8208;acid Catalyzed [2+3]&#8208;Annulations of p&#8208;Quinone Methides and Iodonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Herein, we report a mild and significant method for the synthesis of oxaspirocyclohexadienones by using a combination of Lewis acid&#8208;HFIP mediated [2+3]&#8208;annulation of p&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) and iodonium ylides. The proposed mechanism proceeds through a one&#8208;pot sequence of carbonyl activation/cyclopropyl formation/Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement to provide a broad range of oxaspirocyclohexadienones in moderate to high yields. Interestingly, the spiro&#8208;annulated products were further converted to tetrahydroxanthane derivatives via BF3.OEt2 mediated dienone&#8208;phenol rearrangement pathway. Moreover, the spiro&#8208;annulated derivatives also showed a moderate anti&#8208;tuberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra ATCC25177.</dc:description>

The Stille cross coupling reaction described for this &#945;&#8208;fluorinated stannane reagent is amenable to a wide range of aryl and alkenyl (pseudo)halides bearing a variety of functional groups. An enantioenriched cross&#8208;coupled product was also obtained from the corresponding 1&#8208;fluorocyclopropyltin reagent bearing an ester handle. Finally, the chemical stability of the 1 fluorocyclopropyl moiety was also demonstrated by performing several post&#8208;functionalizations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Synthesis of new polysubstituted furans incorporating reactive phosphorus ylides or &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8209;acyliminophosphoranes was achieved by the heterocyclization of flexible &#945;&#8208;acyl ketene dithioacetals. This one&#8208;pot tandem reaction was initiated by acyl&#8208;directed desulfurative Sonogashira coupling, followed by 1,6&#8208;addition of phosphine to the in situ&#8208;generated enynone and subsequent 5&#8208;&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;dig&lt;/i&gt; cyclization, as well as phosphoranation.

         <title>Visible Light Induced Halogen Bond Assisted Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reaction of Indole and Chalcones</title>

Abstract
The use of halogen bonding interactions as an alternative to acid and metal catalysts for substrate activation has gained popularity in recent years. In this work we demonstrate a halogen bond assisted activation of chalcones under visible light irradiation for the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction with indole to yield &#946;&#8208;indolylketones. The simple and scalable protocol uses the readily available CBr4 as halogen bond catalyst. The targets are produced in 31&#8211;94% of yield with excellent functional group tolerance. The proposed mechanism of the reaction is supported by UV&#8208;vis, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopic studies. Further it is demonstrated that the &#946;&#8208;indolylketones can be oxidised to indole substituted &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones by DDQ or cyclized to thieno[2,3&#8208;b]indoles in the presence of elemental sulfur and base.

         <dc:description>Indan&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones stand as versatile precursors to a plethora of complex molecules with wide applications; however, their direct cross&#8208;coupling methodologies remain largely unexplored. Herein, we unveil an in situ triflation&#8208;tandem cross&#8208;coupling strategy to synthesize a diverse variety of indenones and benzofulvenes from indan&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones. The successful synthesis of a neolignan natural product and the key intermediate of Indatraline (antidepressant) showcased the synthetic utility of the methodology. The strategy enabled tuning the electronic characteristics of indenones and benzofulvenes, modulating the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps. The photophysical properties of these molecules were studied, and the experimental results were compared with the predictions obtained from the DFT studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Cyclic Sulfamides via an Intramolecular Dehydrative Amination of Allylic Alcohols: A Strategy for 1,3&#8208;Diamine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular dehydrative amination method has been developed to synthesize diverse cyclic sulfamides efficiently. Reactions proceed smoothly at room temperature using a combination of (IPr)AuCl (5 mol%) and AgBF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (5 mol%). This method showcases a broad substrate scope, encompassing challenging seven&#8208;membered ring structures, and exhibits functional group compatibility. Moreover, the reaction demonstrates high stereoselectivity, allowing the synthesis of enantiomerically enriched cyclic sulfamides from chiral secondary allylic alcohols. The synthesized cyclic sulfamides serve as valuable intermediates for generating 1,3&#8208;diamines. This approach provides an improved route for cyclic sulfamide synthesis and a strategic entry point for obtaining essential 1,3&#8208;diamine derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Styrene Oxide Isomerase Towards Enhanced Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of (S)&#8208;Flurbiprofen</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The conventional synthesis of (S)&#8208;flurbiprofen, a valuable non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID), involves inefficient chiral resolution with low&#8208;yielding multiple reaction steps, or asymmetric synthesis with low enantioselectivity and/or regioselectivity. Here, we developed high&#8208;yielding, enantioselective, and sustainable synthesis of (S)&#8208;flurbiprofen via two chemoenzymatic approaches from a simple alkene: (A) enzymatic epoxidation&#8208;isomerization&#8208;oxidation cascade and Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation; and (B) chemical epoxidation, enzymatic isomerization&#8208;oxidation cascade, and Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation. Styrene oxide isomerase (SOI)&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;retentive Meinwald rearrangement was the key step in the two pathways, but SOI suffers from low activity. SOI was engineered via two rounds of iterative saturation mutagenesis and screening with a three&#8208;enzyme cascade assay, generating a double&#8208;mutant SOIDM (N99A/D95A) with 5.5&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM). In Pathway A, cascade biotransformation of 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylstyrene with engineered E. coli strain expressing SOIDM, styrene monooxygenase (SMO) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), and subsequent Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation afforded (S)&#8208;flurbiprofen in 98% yield and 91% ee. In Pathway B, chemical epoxidation (Sharpless dihydroxylation and ring&#8208;closing), cascade conversion using an engineered E. coli strain expressing SOIDM, ALDH and NADH oxidase (NOX), and Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation produced (S)&#8208;flurbiprofen in 83% yield and 98% ee. Compared to conventional synthesis, the developed methods reduced reaction steps, minimized waste generation and improved enantioselectivity or overall yield.

         <title>Ambiphilic Reactivity of SF5&#8208;Alkynes Applied to Regioselective and Stereodivergent Halogenation Reactions: An Experimental and Theoretical Case Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We explored the ambiphilic reactivity of SF5&#8208;alkynes, and we proved they can act as both nucleophiles and electrophiles. We selected halogenation reactions as benchmark reactions and developed highly selective stereodivergent hydrohalogenation (I, Br, Cl, F) reactions of SF5&#8208;alkynes. The stereochemistry is finely controlled thanks to the nature of the acids used (strong or soft) in the presence of halide source, while the high regioselectivity is governed by the strong polarization of SF5&#8208;alkynes. Mechanistic studies supported by DFT calculations shed light on two different reaction mechanisms responsible of the excellent stereocontrol. This stereoselectivity was quantitatively rationalized with the ASM and EDA methods. A few dihalogenation reactions are reported and DFT calculations rationalize this cis&#8208;stereoselectivity. Relative configuration of all the SF5&#8208;haloalkenes was unambiguously determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Noteworthy, several post&#8208;functionalization reactions such as cross&#8208;couplings, cyanation and reductions are described to strengthen the synthetic potential.

         <title>Asymmetric Boracarboxylation of Styrenes Using Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The boracarboxylation reaction has potential for the production of natural products and drug candidates, but the development of an asymmetric version of this transformation is challenging. We report an enantioselective boracarboxylation of styrenes, enabled by a copper catalyst containing chiral phosphines. Our experimental conditions provide yields between 31&#8211;76% and enantiomeric ratios from 80:20 up to 98:2 for electron&#8208;rich styrenes. Oxidation of a boracarboxylation product gives (S)&#8208;tropic acid, an intermediate towards several tropane alkaloids. A computational analysis of the mechanistic details shows a complex pattern of competing reaction pathways, highlighting challenges encountered when developing asymmetric reactions using CO2.

         <title>Stereoselective Access to &#946;&#8208;gem&#8208;Difluorinated Alcohols Through Enzymatic Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
We report here a mild process to access diversely functionalized enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluorinated (S)&#8208;alcohols by using biocatalytic reduction in &gt;99% yield and enantiomeric excesses ranging from 96% to &gt;99%. This novel approach involves enzymatic reduction of &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluorinated heterocyclic and carbocyclic ketone derivatives as well as an acyclic gem&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;ketosulfone and proceeds under mild conditions at 30&#8201;&#176;C under aqueous conditions to produce a range of high added value enantioenriched difluorinated alcohols including 3,3&#8208;difluorochromanol, 3,3&#8208;difluorothiochromanol, 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;dihydroquinolinol, and &#945;&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfone derivatives. A comparative study between enzymatic reduction and metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation was carried out as well.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Formation of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes Using Oxime Esters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
In this manuscript a general photocatalytic approach for the synthesis of alkyl&#8208;substituted gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes using readily available oxime esters and 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoroprop&#8208;2&#8208;ene (BDFP) has been established. This strategy involving a radical bromo elimination provides access to a large variety of value&#8208;added fluorinated molecules. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with many functional groups including complex natural products or drug molecules. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic investigations indicate that the efficiency of the process relies on the crucial role of imine radical, which is formed after photoexcitation via energy transfert (EnT) and decarboxylation of the oxime ester. Indeed, the imine radical would either behave as a bromine radical scavenger or an XAT promoter in this reaction.

         <title>TBHP&#8208;Mediated Hydroxyperfluoroalkylation of Alkenes with Perfluoroalkyl Iodides to Construct &#946;&#8208;Perfluoroalkyl Alcohols</title>

Abstract
A three&#8208;component strategy for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl allyl alcohols from 1,3&#8208;dienes is developed. A diverse range of synthetically valuable &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl allyl alcohols are obtained in moderate to high yields. Broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance are observed. This method is also applicable to mono&#8208;olefins and 1,3&#8208;enynes. The control experiment results demonstrate that the hydroxyl group OH in the product comes from TBHP. In addition, the practicality and mild reaction conditions make these synthetic transformations attractive and valuable for organic synthesis.

Abstract
A scalable procedure for the synthesis of 4,6&#8208;difluorotryptophan is reported based on a deaminative coupling of a 4,6&#8208;difluorogramine with 2&#8208;benzylthio&#8208;1,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;imidazolone as glycine equivalent. Thus prepared 4,6&#8208;difluorotryptophan was incorporated into the C&#8208;terminal domain of the HIV&#8208;1 capsid protein (CA&#8208;CTD), and 19F spectra of the 4,6&#8208;difluoro Trp CA CTD were recorded and compared to the singly fluorinated counterparts.

Abstract
We report herein a palladium&#8208;catalyzed, site&#8208;selective cyclative annulation of o&#8208;alkynyl arylamides with maleimide for the stereoselective construction of succinimide&#8208;fused benzoxazine derivatives. This operationally simple and modular protocol provides access to polycyclic frameworks. The other associated features are high functional group compatibility, gram&#8208;scale synthetic potential, and downstream transformations. Control and labeling experiments were conducted to get insights into the mechanism.

Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric dearomative arylation of 2&#8208;naphthols enabled by the unconventional reactivity of o&#8208;quinone diimides, i.&#8201;e. the 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition on quinone sp2 hybridized carbon, has been established. Under the catalysis of chiral phosphoric acid, various cyclohexaenones bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter have been prepared with excellent yields and enantioselectivities.

Abstract
The direct diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective Ru(II)&#8208; catalyzed cyclopropanation reaction of alkenes with ((2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoroethyl)sulfinyl)benzene was described. The desired enantioenriched PhSO2CF2&#8208;cyclopropanes were obtained in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities in the presence of a chiral ruthenium complex Ru(II)&#8208;Pheox (17&#8211;94% yields, &gt;20:1 d.r. and 83:17&#8211;98:2 e.r.). The robustness of the approach was showcased and This methodology gave access to chiral 1,2&#8208;trans difluoro&#8208;methylcyclopropanes.

         <title>Tetrafluoropyridinyl Thiolate as a Tool for Enabling Photoredox Alkylation of 1,2,4&#8208;Oxadiazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A method for the radical functionalization of 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazoles using alkyl halides as precursors of radicals is described. The reaction efficiency is determined by potassium tetrafluoropyridinyl thiolate additive, which plays dual role. First, the thiolate converts alkyl halides into more reactive fluorinated aryl sulfides, which undergo photoredox activation of the C&#8722;S bond. Second, the thiolate decreases the unproductive loss of alkyl radicals by converting them back to the sulfides.

         <title>Electrochemical Trifluoromethylalkoxylation of Endocyclic Enamides in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A regioselective electrochemical oxytrifluoromethylation of endocyclic enamides is reported. The 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization proceeds under mild conditions and employs the inexpensive bench stable Langlois&#8217; reagent. This multicomponent strategy gives access to a wide range of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;substituted amines by means of various alcohols as nucleophiles in high yields and with good functional group tolerance. In addition, an electrochemically induced C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of enamides has been developed. A continuous flow protocol using a commercial microflow electrochemical reactor was also developed with improved reaction performance and efficiency over traditional batch versions without any supporting electrolyte.
