         <title>Z&#8208;Selective Fluoroalkenylation of (Hetero)Aromatic Systems by Iodonium reagents in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Directed C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct and catalytic incorporation of fluorine containing molecular motifs into organic compounds resulting high&#8208;value added chemicals represents a rapidly evolving part of synthetic methodologies, thus this area is in the focus of pharmaceutical and agrochemical research. Herein we report a stereoselective procedure for direct fluorovinylation of aromatic and heteroaromatic scaffolds. This methodology development has been realized by palladium&#8208;catalyzed ortho C&#8208;H activation reaction of aniline derivatives featuring the regioselectivity via directing groups such as secondary of tertiary amides, ureas or ketones. The application of non&#8208;symmetrical aryl(fluoroalkenyl)&#8208;iodonium salts as fluoroalkenylating agents allowed mild reaction conditions in general for this transformation. The scope and limitations have been thoroughly investigated and the feasibility has been demonstrated by more than 50 examples.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis Acid Regulated Divergent Catalytic Reaction between Quinone Imine Ketals (QIKs) and 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds: Switchable Access to Multiple Products Including 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds, Indoles, and Benzofurans</title>

Abstract
A catalytic Lewis acid regulated reaction between quinone imine ketals (QIKs) and 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds provides a divergent and tunable approach to a variety of skeletons, including a series of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds, indoles, and benzofurans. The use of lithium chloride and ferrous bromide gives C3&#8208; or C2&#8208;alkylation products of the QIKs. The combination of ferrous bromide and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid delivers indole derivatives. Sequential hydrolysis and C3&#8208;alkylation occur in the presence of ytterbium (III) trifluoromethanesulfonate and stoichiometric amounts of water. When the reaction is performed with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and stoichiometric amounts of water, benzofuran is obtained. This protocol utilizes mild conditions, exhibits regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity, and has broad functional group tolerance.

         <title>Electrochemical Functionalization of Imidazopyridine and Indazole: An Overview</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Electrochemical method offers a mild, simple and efficient tool for the synthesis of interesting and useful molecules, thus eluding severe chemical oxidising and reducing agents used in conventional synthetic methods. In particular, electrochemical C&#8722;H activation is expected to play an important role in the direct functionalization of heterocyclic compounds. Over the past few decades, the research interest on imidazopyridine and indazole is enhanced significantly due to their multipurpose uses in medicinal and industrial chemistry. Therefore, structural modification of these heterocycles using electro&#8208;oxidation 	method is one of the important research topics among synthetic organic chemistry in recent days. This perspective outlines a comprehensive discussion on electrochemical functionalization of indazole and imidazopyridine published so far. A summary of the current challenges and a future direction for the development of efficient and green electrochemical methods for functionalization of these heterocycles is also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Domino Cyclization/Phosphorylation of gem&#8208;Dibromoolefins with P(O)H Compounds: Synthesis of Phosphorylated Heteroaromatics</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We presented a palladium&#8208;catalyzed domino cyclization/phosphorylation of gem&#8208;dibromoolefins, which utilize H&#8208;phosphinates and secondary phosphine oxides as the phosphine sources, respectively. A vareity of phosphorylated heteroaromatics were obtained in moderate to good yields with wide functional group compatibility. This one&#8208;pot reaction enables multiple bond&#8208;forming events including C&#8211;X (X = O, N, S) and C&#8211;P bonds using easily available starting materials.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We presented a palladium-catalyzed domino cyclization/phosphorylation of gem-dibromoolefins, which utilize H-phosphinates and secondary phosphine oxides as the phosphine sources, respectively. A vareity of phosphorylated heteroaromatics were obtained in moderate to good yields with wide functional group compatibility. This one-pot reaction enables multiple bond-forming events including C&#8211;X (X = O, N, S) and C&#8211;P bonds using easily available starting materials. Moreover, this protocol can be easily applied to large-scale preparation and late-stage functionalization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;catalyzed routes have been achieved for the synthesis of 3&#8208;nitroquinolines from readily available nitroolefins and anthranils. This reaction proceeds via the [4 + 2] cycloaddition between anthranils and nitro&#8208;styrenes under mild reaction conditions to obtain biologically important heterocycles. A wide range of diversely substituted nitro&#8208;olefins and anthranils are successfully employed in this reaction to access a series of 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;quinolines in 81&#8208;93% yields.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Enzyme Cascade Catalyzed Asymmetrization of Primary Alcohols: Synthesis of Enantiocomplementary Chiral &#946;&#8208;Nitroalcohols</title>

Abstract
Biocatalytic asymmetrization of inexpensive and stable primary alcohols to prepare enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols is an important development in green chemistry for the production of chiral pharmaceutical intermediates. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step cascade reaction sequence in which first benzylic alcohols were oxidized to produce corresponding benzaldehydes using horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH). The in&#8197;situ generated aldehydes were then reacted in a biphasic medium with nitromethane by Arabidopsis thaliana hydroxynitrile lyase (AtHNL) or Baliospermum montanum HNL (BmHNL) catalyzed Henry reaction to produce stereoselective &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols with (R) or (S) configuration, respectively. Using HLADH&#8208;AtHNL, (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols were obtained in up to 64% conversion, and HLADH&#8208;BmHNL, (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols in up to 70% conversion, while in both cases excellent stereoselectivity (up to &gt;99% ee) was achieved. The concept was proven by functionalization of sp3 C&#8722;H bond of ten simple achiral benzylic alcohols to enantiocomplementary chiral &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted electron&#8208;deficient alkenes is often accomplished via cross&#8208;coupling of diazo compounds in the presence of a metal catalyst. Herein, we report an organocatalytic protocol that enables the direct coupling of aliphatic aldehydes with sulfonium ylides. A key carbene mimetic, &#945;&#8208;iodoenamine/enol, is believed to engage in direct cross&#8208;coupling with a sulfonium ylide, delivering &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds with a formyl substituent. The reaction demonstrated remarkably mild conditions, convergence, and control of olefin geometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free, PhI(OAc)2&#8208;Promoted Oxidative C(sp2)&#8722;H Difunctionalization: Synthesis of Thioaminated Naphthoquinones</title>

Abstract
A three&#8208;component thioamination reaction has been developed in the presence of phenyliodonium(III) diacetate (PIDA) leading to the formation of a thioaminated products. This catalytic approach represents a method for the metal&#8208;free thioamination of 1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone. It was observed that maleimides also work smoothly under this metal&#8208;free reaction condition. This present method implies the oxidative coupling reaction through a one&#8208;step process with the generation of C&#8722;N and C&#8722;S bonds. Various aromatic and aliphatic thiols and amines provided the corresponding thioaminated compounds in 62&#8211;88% yields. A plausible reaction pathway has been predicted according to few control experiments.

         <dc:description>








Abstract
Due to the versatile reactivity and molecular complexity, as well as diversity, electron&#8208;rich alkenes bearing nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atoms have been regarded as versatile reagents in organic synthesis. This review mainly focuses on the recent advances in the reaction development of electron&#8208;rich alkenes since 2000, including mono&#8208;/difunctionalization reactions, cyclization reactions, and cross&#8208;metathesis reactions. Numerous protocols enabling facile and efficient transformations of electron&#8208;rich alkenes to valuable compounds have been developed, which are discussed with special emphasis placed on the mechanistic aspects and the synthetic utilities. We hope that this review will help inspire future studies and promote developments in this area.

         <title>Selective &#945;&#8208;Deuteration of Cinnamonitriles using D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O as Deuterium Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective &#945;&#8208;deuteration of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitriles using the strong base tBuOK or a metal&#8208;ligand cooperative Ru pincer catalyst is described. With D2O as deuterium source and glyme as solvent at 70 &#176;C, tBuOK is an efficient catalyst for deuteration at the &#945;&#8208;C(sp2) position of cinnamonitriles, providing access to a broad range of deuterated derivatives in good to excellent yields and with very high levels of deuterium incorporation. While the tBuOK&#8208;catalysed protocol does not tolerate base&#8208;sensitive functional groups, cinnamonitrile derivatives containing a benzylic bromide or ester moiety were deuterated in excellent yields using Milstein&#8217;s ruthenium PNN pincer catalyst. Moreover, the activity for H/D exchange of the metal&#8208;ligand cooperative Ru catalyst is found to be significantly higher than that of tBuOK, allowing reactions to proceed well even at room temperature. A mechanistic proposal is put forward that involves deprotonation of the cinnamonitrile &#945;&#8208;CH position when using tBuOK as catalyst, whereas H/D exchange catalysis with the Ru PNN pincer likely proceeds via (reversible) oxa&#8208;Michael addition of D2O.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic trans Semireduction of Primary and Secondary Propiolamides: Substrate Scope and Mechanistic Studies</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. We report a chemoselective, phosphine&#8208;catalyzed semireduction of primary and secondary propiolamides. In the presence of stoichiometric pinacolborane and catalytic n&#8208;tributylphosphine, a variety of propiolamides were successfully converted to the corresponding acrylamides in excellent yield with (E)&#8208;stereoselectivity. The reaction condition is tolerant of various functional groups including alkene, alkyne, ketone, or ester. Deuterium labeling studies	established that the hydride from activated pinacolborane is added to the &#945;&#8208;carbon and the proton on the amide nitrogen is abstracted by the &#223;&#8208;carbon to furnish the (E)&#8208;acrylamides. DFT calculations revealed a clear energetic driving force for the (E)&#8208; over the (Z)&#8208;isomer.</dc:description>

Deuterium labeling studies	established that the hydride from activated pinacolborane is added to the &#945;-carbon and the proton on the amide nitrogen is abstracted by the &#223;-carbon to furnish the (E)-acrylamides. DFT calculations revealed a clear energetic driving force for the (E)- over the (Z)-isomer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Overview of Regioselective and Stereoselective Catalytic Hydroboration of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Hydroboration of alkynes is of special interest to researchers since it is the most straightforward process for the synthesis of highly important vinylborane synthetic intermediate compounds. It is significant in terms of both regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, since several positional isomers are formed during the process of hydroboration. Given the importance of this class of compounds, an extensive study has been carried out regarding catalytic condition development and detailed mechanistic studies for selectively obtaining a single isomer. This review comprehensively summarizes both the regioselective and stereoselective catalytic hydroboration of alkynes. It is aimed at giving readers accurate knowledge of the catalytic systems available for the hydroboration of certain alkynes. We anticipate that this inclusive review will encourage researchers to explore more new types of catalytic systems to achieve the remarkable process of hydroboration of alkynes.

         <title>Application of Mutualism in Organic Synthetic Chemistry: Mutually Promoted C&#8722;H Functionalization of Indole and Reduction of Quinoline</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Here we reported a one&#8208;pot, metal&#8208;free B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed strategy for simultaneous synthesis of C3&#8208;regioselective functionalization of indoles and complete reduction of quinolines. It turned out that by sharing a quinolinium hydridoborate intermediate, the original determining steps with high energy barrier in both the convergent disproportionation of indole and reduction of quinoline could be realized at room temperature, thus furnishing both the C3&#8208;borylated (or silylated) indoles and N&#8208;borylated tetrahydroquinolines in up to 98% yields at room temperature. Mechanistic studies suggested that both reactions would consume a product generated from the other reaction such that they can mutually promote each other, thus producing desirable products in a high atom&#8208;economy and low energy&#8208;cost manner. This strategy opened the gate to introducing mutualism to the field of chemistry.

         <title>Isocyanide&#8208;Induced Esterification of Sulfinic Acids to Access Sulfinates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The isocyanide&#8208;induced esterification of sulfinic acids with alcohols or thiophenols access to sulfinates has been developed. Various primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols could be compatible with the established protocols. Notably, such an isocyanide&#8208;induced synthetic strategy presented the advantages of simple operation, good functional group tolerance, and more than 40 examples up to 99% yields.

Abstract
Here we report a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed and atom&#8208;economical ortho&#8208;N&#8208;indolyl&#8208;N&#8208;pyrazolylbenzene synthesis from 1,2,3&#8208;triazapentalenes and ynamides. The reaction occurs through the cleavage of the triazole ring and formation of a &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene intermediate. An aza&#8208;Nazarov&#8208;type cyclization with participation of an arene ring is involved. The reaction consists in a formal [4+1] heterocycloaddition where the four&#8208;carbon synthon is provided by the ynamide. Finally, indole synthesis could also be performed in a one&#8208;pot procedure from their 1&#8208;propargyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzotrizaole precursors.

         <title>Bu4NHSO4&#8208;Catalyzed Direct N&#8208;Allylation of Pyrazole and its Derivatives with Allylic Alcohols in Water: A Metal&#8208;Free, Recyclable and Sustainable System</title>

         <dc:description>









Abstract
Allylic amines are valuable and functional building blocks. Direct N&#8208;allylation of pyrazole and its derivatives as an atom economic strategy to provide allylic amines has been achieved only using commercial Bu4NHSO4 as the metal&#8208;free catalyst and water as the solvent without any additives. 11&#8211;93% isolated yields were obtained for the N&#8208;allylation of pyrazole and its derivatives with allylic alcohols. Bu4NHSO4 could be reused for six times by simple extraction nearly without loss of catalytic activity and was also suitable for a gram&#8208;scale production. The reaction of allylic ether and pyrazole did not occur to give the desired product indicated that allylic ether was not the active intermediate in the pathway. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that there are hydrogen bonding effects among substrates, solvent and catalyst, especially the one formed between allylic alcohol and H2O. Control experiments in different protic solvents further demonstrate the intermolecular hydrogen bonding of allylic alcohol and water.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that there are hydrogen bonding effects among substrates, solvent and catalyst, especially the one formed between allylic alcohol and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Control experiments in different protic solvents further demonstrate the intermolecular hydrogen bonding of allylic alcohol and water.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
The rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed aryl borrowing amination of various diaryl methanols with sulfonamides have been developed. The amination of alcohols via C&#8722;C bond activation is less developed and remains a challenge. These aryl borrowing reactions feature mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance, and compatibility with a wide range of alcohols, overall comprising an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic procedure. Mechanistic studies indicate that a rhodacycle complex exist during the aryl borrowing amination reaction.

         <title>Tailoring the Reactivity of the Langlois Reagent and Styrenes With Cyanoarenes Organophotocatalysts under Visible&#8208;Light.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective one&#8208;step access to fluoroalkylated hexestrol derivatives, nonsteroidal estrogens, is achieved in good to excellent isolated yields under organophotoredox conditions by using the stable and easy to handle Langlois reagent. Furthermore, the challenging selective hydrotrifluoromethylation of styrenes proceeds under mild reaction conditions without the requirement for any additive. We assume that the solvent drives the reaction pathway towards either the reduction or the dimerization of the radical intermediate generated after initial addition of the fluoroalkyl radical to the styrene. The versatility of the developed system is also extended to encompass radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling as exemplified here using cyanopyridine. Mechanistic investigations including luminescence and EPR spectroscopy allow to shed the light on the different mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A phosphine&#8208;mediated reaction for the construction of spirocyclopenta[c]chromene&#8208;indolinones is reported via a Rauhut&#8208;Currier (RC)&#8208;type/acyl transfer/Wittig sequence. This methodology attributes the chemoselective phosphine addition to the alkynoate which generates the phosphorus zwitterion via RC&#8208;type reaction, and that further undergoes O&#8208;acylation to form the seven&#8208;membered betaine intermediate with acyl chloride in the presence of base. Extensive investigations reveal that the exceptional &#948;&#8208;acylation occurs through the C&#8208;O bond cleavage upon the seven&#8208;membered betaine, and the subsequent Wittig reaction preferentially results in the aforementioned spiro compound. Furthermore, our protocol could also be applicable to different alkynoates to provide a series of spirocyclopenta[&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]chromenones bearing privileged skeletons.</dc:description>

         <title>ortho&#8208;Allylation of 2&#8208;Arylindazoles with Vinyl Cyclic Carbonate and Diallyl Carbonate via Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>

Abstract
A manganese&#8208;catalyzed directed C&#8722;H allylation of 2&#8208;arylindazole has been developed. Both vinyl cyclic carbonate and diallyl carbonate are effectively used for ortho&#8208;allylation via decarboxylation. The mechanism was investigated and possibly Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation is not involved in the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Synthesis of Poly&#8208;Functionalized Indolizines via [5+1] Annulative Access to Pyridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Multi&#8208;functionalization of the pyridine motif of indolizine was achieved through [5+1] annulative construction of pyridine from 2&#8208;hydroxyacetophenone and pyrrole derivative in the presence of Cs2CO3. The reaction is proposed to take place via domino aldol&#8208;oxa Michael&#8208;Michael&#8208;elimination&#8208;oxidation procedure, leading to installation of three different functional groups at the C5, C6, and C7 positions of indolizines. Solvent (2&#8208;MeTHF) and the hydroxyl of 2&#8208;hydroxyacetophenones seemed to play crucial roles for this successful cyclization event. Further elaboration of the resulting scaffold and expansion of this protocol using other methyl ketones were demonstrated as well.

     alt="Synthesis of Poly-Functionalized Indolizines via [5+1] Annulative Access to Pyridines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-functionalization of the pyridine motif of indolizine was achieved through [5+1] annulative construction of pyridine from 2-hydroxyacetophenone and pyrrole derivative in the presence of Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The reaction is proposed to take place via domino aldol-oxa Michael-Michael-elimination-oxidation procedure, leading to installation of three different functional groups at the C5, C6, and C7 positions of indolizines. Solvent (2-MeTHF) and the hydroxyl of 2-hydroxyacetophenones seemed to play crucial roles for this successful cyclization event. Further elaboration of the resulting scaffold and expansion of this protocol using other methyl ketones were demonstrated as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Investigating the Structure&#8208;Reactivity Relationships Between Nicotinamide Coenzyme Biomimetics and Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate Reductase</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ene reductases (ERs) are attractive biocatalysts in terms of their high enantioselectivity and expanded substrate scope. Recent works have proved that synthetic nicotinamide coenzyme biomimetics (NCBs) can be used as easily accessible alternatives to natural cofactors in ER&#8208;catalyzed reactions. However, the structure&#8208;reactivity relationships between NCBs and ERs and influence factors are still poorly understood. In this study, a series of C&#8208;5 methyl modified NCBs were synthesized and tested in the PETNR&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reductions. The physicochemical properties of these NCBs including electrochemical properties, stability, and kinetic behavior were studied in detail. The results showed that hydrophobic interaction caused by the introduced methyl group contributes to the stabilization of binding conformation in enzyme active site, resulting in comparable catalytic activity with that of NADPH. Molecular dynamics and steered molecular dynamics simulations were further performed to explain the binding mechanism between PETNR and NCBs, which revealed that stable catalytic conformation, appropriate donor&#8208;acceptor distance and angle, as well as free dissociation energy are important factors affecting the activity of NCBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;enzymatic Cascade Reactions for the Synthesis of &lt;i&gt;cis,cis&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Muconic acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lignin valorization allows the generation of a number of value&#8208;added products such as &lt;i&gt;cis,cis&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;muconic acid (ccMA), which is widely used for the synthesis of chemicals for the production of biodegradable plastic materials. In the present work, we reported the first multi&#8208;enzymatic, one&#8208;pot bioconversion process of vanillin into ccMA. In details, we used four sequential reactions catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;demethylase LigM (and the tetrahydrofolate&#8208;regeneration enzyme methyl transferase MetE), decarboxylase AroY (based on the use of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; transformed cells) and catechol 1,2&#8208;dioxygenase CatA. The optimized lab&#8208;scale procedure allowed to reach, for the first time, the conversion of 5 mM vanillin into ccMA in ~ 30 h with a 90% yield: this achievement represents an improvement in terms of yields and time when compared to the use of a whole&#8208;cell system. This multi&#8208;enzymatic system represents a sustainable alternative for the production of a high value added product from a renewable resource.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract. A synthetically useful Z&#8208;selective cascade formal thiyl radical addition, 1,3&#8208;double bond isomerization, oxygen trapping reaction, can be promoted by Eosin B under visible light, leading to the construction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208; and alkylthio enone derivatives in good yields. An accurate study on the reactivity of different thiols and the screening of the reaction conditions, allowed us to extend this reaction to a large number of substrates, showing a good functional groups tolerance while highlighting the limitations of this procedure. Background experiments and mechanistic studies were also. performed to rationalize this cascade process. The usefulness of this methodology was finally demonstrated via the transformation of a series of &#945;&#8208;sulfanyl&#8208;enone adducts through selected oxidation reactions, stereoselective synthesis of cyclopropyl ketones, indanones, and pyrazole compounds.</dc:description>

Abstract
Herein we report a site&#8208;selective and thiol&#8208;free thiofunctionalization of electron&#8208;rich heteroarenes. After a selective ortho&#8208;magnesiation, the use of S8 followed by an electrophile allows direct access to S&#8208;alkyl or &#8208;aryl derivatives. In situ oxidation provides the corresponding sulfoxide and sulfone derivatives. Applying this protocol, Cerlapirdine was prepared in 4 steps with 28% overall yield.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Fused Indolin&#8208;3&#8208;Ones via a [3+3] Cycloaddition Reaction</title>

Abstract
A formal [3+3] cycloaddition reaction of azaoxyallyl cations and isatogens generated in&#8197;situ from &#945;&#8208;halo hydroxamates and o&#8208;nitroalkynes, respectively, was developed. The cycloisomerization of the o&#8208;nitroalkynes, followed by base&#8208;mediated elimination of hydrogen halide and 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of the azaoxyallyl cations with the isatogen intermediates, were hallmarks of this one&#8208;pot tandem reaction. A series of tricyclic fused indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones were obtained under very mild reaction conditions with high atom economy, and the reaction exhibited excellent functional group tolerance. In addition, the reaction was highly scalable to multigram quantities. The obtained indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones exhibited robust DNA staining patterns in agarose gel electrophoresis. Coupled with the fluorescence properties of the products, these results highlight the potential utility of tricyclic fused indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones in various fluorescence and cell&#8208;staining applications.

&lt;p&gt;A formal [3+3] cycloaddition reaction of azaoxyallyl cations and isatogens generated in&#8197;situ from &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-halo hydroxamates and &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-nitroalkynes, respectively, was developed. The cycloisomerization of the &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-nitroalkynes, followed by base-mediated elimination of hydrogen halide and 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of the azaoxyallyl cations with the isatogen intermediates, were hallmarks of this one-pot tandem reaction. A series of tricyclic fused indolin-3-ones were obtained under very mild reaction conditions with high atom economy, and the reaction exhibited excellent functional group tolerance. In addition, the reaction was highly scalable to multigram quantities. The obtained indolin-3-ones exhibited robust DNA staining patterns in agarose gel electrophoresis. Coupled with the fluorescence properties of the products, these results highlight the potential utility of tricyclic fused indolin-3-ones in various fluorescence and cell-staining applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
Aryl enol acetates and DMF could promote radical difluoroalkylation of aryl enol acetates to generate &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;ketoacetates without a catalyst, an oxidant, or a base. When using different bases, &#946;&#8208;fluoroenones and &#946;&#8208;enaminones were synthesized by controllable C&#8722;F bond activation. These transformations provide an alternative method for the cascade difluoroalkylation and C&#8722;F bonds activation of aryl enol acetates.

Abstract
A metal&#8208;free multi&#8208;component sulfur dioxide insertion reaction of alkynes, sodium metabisulfite, aryldiazonium, and quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;ones has been developed under visible&#8208;light&#8194;photoredox&#8208;catalysis. This photocatalytic tandem reaction would be conducted at room temperature by using of Rhodamine 6G as organic photocatalyst and sodium metabisulfite as the SO2 surrogate. This protocol provides a synthetic strategy for the construction of various quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;one&#8208;containing vinyl sulfones with favourable functional group tolerance, in which one C&#8722;C bond and two C&#8722;S bonds were constructed in one pot procedure.

         <title>Access to Unsymmetrically Substituted Diaryl Gold N&#8208;Acyclic Carbene (NAC) and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) Complexes via the Isonitrile Route</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A variety of unsymmetric diaryl gold N&#8208;acyclic carbene (NAC) complexes was synthesized via the isonItrile route by three different methods: (a) solvent free in a melt, (b) mechanochemically and (c) in THF at room temperature. The latter method can also be used to synthesize unsaturated gold NHC complexes.
These methods overall offer access to a broad array of new complexes and remove one of the previous limitations of the
isonitrile route to NAC and NHC complexes of gold, namely the inability to react with the less nucleophilic aromatic amines. The new complexes also proved to be successful as pre&#8208;catalysts in the gold&#8208;catalyzed phenol synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Alkynylation of C&#8208;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkynylation reactions are one of the most sought&#8208;after synthetic methodologies due to the versatility of C&#8208;C triple bond diversifications. Sonogashira coupling was widely used for the synthesis of alkynylated molecules; however, this methodology requires the use of previously halogenated substrates, which is a major drawback. To overcome this issue, a complementary method, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H alkynylation, has emerged as an alternative tool in recent years. Although the initial reports required the use of either specific directing groups or strong alkynylating agents for effective functionalization, recent studies indicate that transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective alkynylations can be carried out using mild and readily available alkynylating agents under moderate reaction conditions.  In this review, we explain the functionalization of both sp2&#8208;C&#8211;H and sp3&#8208;C&#8211;H bonds by emphasizing the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8208;methylation is a vitally important reaction applicable in chemical synthesis and structure&#8208;based drug design. Notably, the &#8220;magic methyl&#8221; effect has become decisive in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery for the modulation of bio&#8208;active properties in life science molecules.  In this regard, C&#8208;methylation reaction is widely applied chemical modification in various biomolecules, pharmaceuticals, and natural products. In general, this reaction often relies on activated, hazardous and uneconomical methyl sources such as diazomethane, dimethyl sulfate, and methyl halides. To achieve methylation reactions in a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective manner, the use of &#8216;ideal&#8217; C1 source is crucial. In this regard, methanol constitutes an expedient &#8208;CH3 source because this simple alcohol is less&#8208;hazardous, inexpensive, and abundantly available platform chemical as well as it produces only water as the by&#8208;product in methylation processes. Regarding potential catalysts to perform C&#8208;methylation using methanol by hydrogen borrowing methodology, non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based catalysts are highly preferable due to their unique advantages such as more abundance, inexpensive and low&#8208;toxicity. In recent years, chemists made significant contributions towards catalytic valorization of methanol as C1 source to insert methyl groups via CH activation in a variety of compounds and life science molecules. Consequently, in this minireview we summarize the C&#8208;methylation process using methanol by applying Fe&#8208;, Mn&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Ni&#8208;based catalysts as well as metal free catalysts.</dc:description>

Abstract
A catalytic enantioselective vinylogous domino reaction has been achieved from ketone&#8208;derived benzylidene Meldrum's acid and &#945;&#8208;ketolactones to provide spirolactone dihydropyranones with more than 99%&#8201;ee. An Auto Tandem Catalysis (ATC) process resulting from dual and complementary role of (DHQ)2PHAL organocatalyst resulted in a sequence involving an asymmetric vinylogous formal (4+2) cycloaddition of benzylidene and the subsequent kinetic resolution operating through a 1,3&#8208;prototropic shift leading to good yields (&gt;50%) and the high selectivity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A catalytic enantioselective vinylogous domino reaction has been achieved from ketone-derived benzylidene Meldrum's acid and &#945;-ketolactones to provide spirolactone dihydropyranones with more than 99%&#8201;ee. An Auto Tandem Catalysis (ATC) process resulting from dual and complementary role of (DHQ)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PHAL organocatalyst resulted in a sequence involving an asymmetric vinylogous formal (4+2) cycloaddition of benzylidene and the subsequent kinetic resolution operating through a 1,3-prototropic shift leading to good yields (&amp;gt;50%) and the high selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
A series of N&#8208;unsubstituted/substituted fullerotetrahydroquinolines without a directly attached nitrogen atom were synthesized in moderate to good yields via a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step reaction of [60]fullerene with arylamines and paraformaldehyde in the presence of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate. Aromatic primary amines produce N&#8208;unsubstituted fullereotetrahydroquinolines, while aromatic secondary amines give N&#8208;substituted fullereotetrahydroquinoline derivatives. As precursors, N&#8208;unsubstituted fullerotetrahydroquinolines could be further derivatized by the N&#8208;alkylation/acylation/carboamidation reactions to produce a large variety of N&#8208;substituted fullerotetrahydroquinolines containing Cl, NO2, C(O), and C(O)NH functional groups, which may have applications in the field of perovskite&#8208;based solar cells. Plausible reaction pathways for the formation of N&#8208;unsubstituted/substituted fullerotetrahydroquinolines were suggested to elucidate the above&#8208;mentioned reaction process.

Abstract
We report herein a strategy to afford a multicomponent catalytic enantioselective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;substituted isoxazolidin&#8208;5&#8208;ones via a KMC process promoted by a suited cupreine used as bifunctional organocatalyst. The hydroxamic acid component, with a sterically hindered amide moiety, proved to be key for the successful formation and transformation of the obtained original N&#8208;amide isoxazolidin&#8208;5&#8208;ones.

         <title>Cascade Reaction of &#945;, &#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones and 2&#8208;Aminoaryl Alcohols for the Synthesis of 3&#8208;Acylquinolines by a Copper Nanocatalyst</title>

Abstract
3&#8208;Acylquinolines possess widespread applications in functional chemicals. However, the convenient and selective synthesis of such important substructures has to date remained a challenge. Herein, we report a method to access 3&#8208;acylquinolines from &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones and 2&#8208;aminoaryl alcohols in one pot with a copper nanocatalyst supported on nitrogen&#8208;silica&#8208;doped carbon (Cu/N&#8722;SiO2&#8722;C). Mechanistically, the construction of the product involves a cascade procedure including radical&#8208;type oxidation of 2&#8208;aminoaryl alcohols, aza&#8208;Michael addition and annulation. This developed protocol proceeds with merits of mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance, earth&#8208;abundant and reusable copper catalyst, easily available stocks and O2 as the sole oxidant, which provides an alternative way for the sustainable synthesis of quinoline derivatives.

Abstract
Alkynes generally serve as C2 synthons in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H annulations, herein, exploiting electron&#8208;deficient alkynes as unconventional C1 synthons, the chemo&#8208; and regiospecific synthesis of functionalized 1H&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]indol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones via a redox&#8208;neutral rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed [4+1] annulation of N&#8208;carbamoyl indoles has been achieved. This process is characterized by high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, broad substrate scope, good tolerance of functional groups, moderate to high yields and mild redox&#8208;neutral conditions, thus affording a robust approach to access valuable 1H&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]indol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones.

Abstract
Herein, an air&#8208;stable, molecularly defined NNN&#8722;Mn(II) pincer complex catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols with indoles is reported. A wide variety of symmetrical and unsymmetrical bis(indolyl)methane derivatives as well as some structurally important products such as Vibrindole A, Turbomycin B alkaloid, Antileukemic, and Anticancer agents were synthesized. Mechanistic studies illustrate the importance of the NH moiety in the complex and the crucial role of metal&#8208;ligand cooperation during catalysis.

Abstract
A nitrogen&#8208;centered radical strategy for the preparation of 3&#8208;acylated spiro[4,5]trienones via visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated acylation/ipso&#8208;cyclization of alkynes with acyl oxime esters is reported. The alkyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted acyl radicals, which generate from the cleavage of carbon&#8208;carbon &#963;&#8208;bonds in acyl oxime esters via nitrogen&#8208;centered radical pathway, attack the carbon&#8208;carbon triple bonds in propiolamides and then undergo ipso&#8208;cyclization. This method provides a way for the construction of 3&#8208;acyl&#8208;substituted spiro[4,5]trienones, which can introduce aryl&#8208; or alkyl&#8208;substituted acyl into spiro[4,5]trienone skeletons.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Diazirines and 15N2&#8208;Diazirines from Ketones, Aldehydes and Derivatives: Development and Mechanistic Insight</title>

Abstract
Broad scope one&#8208;pot diazirine synthesis strategies have been developed using two different oxidants depending on the nature of the starting material. In all cases, an inexpensive commercial solution of ammonia (NH3) in methanol (MeOH) was employed, avoiding the difficult use of liquid ammonia. With aliphatic ketones, t&#8208;butyl hypochlorite (t&#8208;BuOCl) was found to be the best oxidant whereas it is preferable to use phenyliodine diacetate (PIDA) with aromatic ketones, aldehydes and imines. The nature of the imine&#8208;protecting group is essential and only t&#8208;butyl imine allowed the synthesis of 15N2&#8208;diazirine with complete 15N incorporation, emphasizing a key trans&#8208;imination step in the reaction mechanism. These methods are operationally simple, and tolerant to most functional groups, providing diazirines with yields ranging from 20 to 99%.

         <title>Robust Photocatalytic Method Using Ethylene&#8208;Bridged Flavinium Salts for the Aerobic Oxidation of Unactivated Benzylic Substrates</title>

Abstract
7,8&#8208;Dimethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;ethylenealloxazinium chloride (1a) was found to be a superior photooxidation catalyst among substituted ethylene&#8208;bridged flavinium salts (R=7,8&#8208;diMeO, 7,8&#8208;OCH2O&#8208;, 7,8&#8208;diMe, H, 7,8&#8208;diCl, 7&#8208;CF3 and 8&#8208;CF3). Selection was carried out based on structure vs catalytic activity and properties relationship investigations. Flavinium salt 1a proved to be robust enough for practical applications in benzylic oxidations/oxygenations, which was demonstrated using a series of substrates with high oxidation potential, i.&#8201;e., 1&#8208;phenylethanol, ethylbenzene, diphenylmethane and diphenylmethanol derivatives substituted with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (Cl or CF3). The unique capabilities of 1a can be attributed to its high photostability and participation via a relatively long&#8208;lived singlet excited state, which was confirmed using spectroscopic studies, electrochemical measurements and TD&#8208;DFT calculations. This allows the maximum use of the oxidation power of 1a, which is given by its singlet excited state reduction potential of +2.4&#8197;V. 7,8&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;ethylenealloxazinium chloride (1&#8197;h) can be used as an alternative photocatalyst for even more difficult substrates.

The front cover picture, prepared by Dr D. Prukala, illustrates ethylene&#8208;bridged 7,8&#8208;dimethoxyflavinium salt excited with blue light. This salt is characterised by relatively long&#8208;lived excited state and high photostability thus making it superior among flavin photocatalysts for aerobic oxidations/oxygenations. The flavinium salt was demonstrated to provide photooxidation of various benzylic substrates, even those with high oxidation potential (X=Cl, CF3). Details can be found in the Research Article by Sikorski, Cibulka and co&#8208;workers. (A. Pokluda, Z. Anwar, V. Boguschov&#225;, I. Anusiewicz, P. Skurski, M. Sikorski, R. Cibulka, Adv. Synth.

Abstract
Functionalized oxindoles are privileged heterocyclic scaffolds and common core structural motifs that are broadly present in numerous natural products and serve as key intermediates in the synthesis of biological products, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Oxindoles exhibit a broad pharmacological and physiological activities, and diverse range of applications in medicinal chemistry and biomedical research. Owing to these fascinating biological and physiological activities of oxindoles, several methodologies have been developed for the construction of oxindoles. In the past decade, the visible light mediated methodologies have attracted substantial attention and emerged as a promising approach for the construction of oxindoles. In this review, the visible light mediated synthesis of oxindoles have been described.

Abstract
C&#8722;N bond formation reactions have garnered a lot of interest in recent years due to the predominance of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds in most pharmacological medications. Since traditional approaches have several limitations, the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H amidation/amination process has arisen as a more atom&#8208;friendly option. Because there are so many distinct kinds of C&#8722;H bonds in organic molecules, selective amidation of C&#8722;H bonds has always been a challenge. In this scenario, the directing&#8208;group&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H amidation has received considerable attention, especially with inexpensive metal cobalt, due to its unique properties and efficiency. We summarize recent developments in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed directing&#8208;group&#8208;aided C&#8722;H bond amidation reactions in this review. We briefly discuss the evolution of directing group preferences and their function in the site selection.

Abstract
Herein, we report on the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of triazoles with acyl selenides. Under thermal reaction conditions and in the presence of a rhodium catalyst, a rapid 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization reaction occurs to provide valuable &#945;&#8208;seleno enamides with high stereoselectivity and broad functional group tolerance, which was demonstrated in 35 examples with up to 95% yield. Computational calculations suggest a reaction pathway that gives a direct access to the 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization without intermittent formation of ylide intermediates.

Abstract
Cooperative amino&#8208; and palladium catalysis utilizing heterocyclic systems containing strongly coordinating and adsorptive sulfur atom remains an underdeveloped area. Herein, we describe an enantioselective cyclization of enals with thiazole derivatives catalyzed with the combination of achiral Pd(0) complexes and chiral secondary amines. Chiral spirocyclic thiazolones were produced in yields ranging from 41% to 98% with stereoselectivities (from 5:1 to 12:1 dr, and 95&#8211;99%&#8197;ee). Moreover, the developed strategy allows access to highly substituted chiral cyclopentane derivatives by additional transformations of spirocyclic thiazolones.

Abstract
A tandem Ir(III)&#8208;catalyzed and Ag2O&#8208;promoted cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC)/ intramolecular cyclization of ketene dithioacetals with benzothiophene derivatives was developed, affording a series of sulfur&#8208;containing cyclization compounds. Mechanistic investigation demonstrated a radical process may be involving intramolecular cyclization. This tandem reaction described herein could be carried out with a broad range of substrates and wide functional group tolerance.

Abstract
Chiral oxazolidinones are of significance in both medicinal and synthetic chemistry, while preparing these compounds usually involves using expensive starting materials and harsh reaction conditions. Herein, a one&#8208;pot biocatalytic cascade process was developed for stereo&#8208; and regioselective aminohydroxylation of diverse alkenes by combining styrene monooxygenase and halohydrin dehalogenase, providing an approach to enantiopure oxazolidinones.

Abstract
A chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed enantioselective aza&#8208;addition of arylamines to ketimines has been developed for the construction of chiral acyclic N,N&#8208;acetal motifs. Under the standard conditions, arylamines reacted smoothly with ketimines from isoquinoline&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione to afford a series of acyclic N,N&#8208;acetals in 82&#8211;99% yield with 80&#8211;96% ee.

Abstract
Copper(II)&#8208;mediated unprecedented intermolecular radical [3+2] annulation of N,N&#8208;dimethyl enaminones has been developed. The protocol is promoted simply by copper(II) chloride to access 5&#8208;acyl&#8208;3&#8208;furancarboxaldehydes with acceptable to good yields and broad substrate scope. This reaction allows the formation of multiple new bonds, including C(sp2)&#8722;O bond between two nucleophilic sites, C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) bond and C=O bond, through a radical cyclization process. Moreover, gram&#8208;synthesis and application research show the potential application value of this transformation in industry.

Abstract
An isochromene synthesis is developed utilizing a cascade reaction involving a CuI catalyzed coupling reaction between an alkyne and diazoacetate followed by allenoate isomerization and subsequent oxa&#8208;Michael addition. The cascade sequence was also demonstrated for the synthesis of naphthalenes. Furthermore, the methodology developed herein was applied toward a stereoselective synthesis of pyranonaphthoquinone kalafungin.

         <dc:description>
The front cover picture, designed by Anastasiia Afanasenko, illustrates the methodology for the synthesis of enantioenriched amines by the direct Fe&#8208;catalysed coupling of amines with alcohols through the borrowing hydrogen strategy, while at least one of these substrates is achiral. As in the well&#8208;known &#8220;The Tortoise and the Hare&#8221; fable by Aesop, tortoise &#8208; stands for chiral amine &#8211; won the race retaining the stereochemical integrity in the final product, whereas beta&#8208;branched enantioenriched primary alcohol &#8211; depicts by the hare &#8211; lost the competition due to its racemization that led to the partial loss of the chirality in the target amine.

Abstract
The synthesis of complex C&#8208;glycoconjugates is presented here using a key directed nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkynylation step. Thanks to a bidentate amidoquinoline&#8208;type directing group, the insertion of diverse alkynyl moieties onto the pseudo&#8208;anomeric position of glycal substrates was performed on ten examples in moderate to good yields. These platforms were used as starting substrates in a click reaction with complex azides to form original C&#8208;glycoconjugates. By this route, a C&#8208;glycosylated amino acid, a C&#8208;linked disaccharide and a C&#8208;glycosylated biotin derivative were synthesized. Preliminary conditions to remove the directing group are also proposed.

Abstract
An organocatalytic 1,6&#8208;addition using 4&#8208;(alk&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;3&#8208;cyanocoumarins as acceptors has been developed. Dienolates derived from 5&#8208;substituted&#8208;furan&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;ones have been employed as pronucleophiles, therefore, enabling the synthesis of hybrid molecules bearing two biologically relevant units. Appropriate design of substrates and the application of quinine&#8208;derived catalyst resulted in very good site&#8208;selectivity as well as chemical and stereochemical efficiency of the process.

         <title>A Tetraarylpyrrole&#8208;Based Phosphine Ligand for the Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Amination of Aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new tetraarylpyrrole&#8208;based phosphine ligand L1 in combination with Pd(dba)2 provided a catalyst for the Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination reaction. A variety of amines were rapidly coupled with aryl chlorides at a Pd loading of 0.5 mol%. The selective monoarylation of aliphatic primary amines was achieved in the presence of 0.8 equiv. water. Comparison experiments were also conducted, which revealed that the catalytic activity of L1 is superior to representative phosphine ligands in the Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;N coupling of various amines.</dc:description>

         <title>Indene Derived Phosphorus&#8208;Thioether Ligands for the Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Olefins with Diverse Substitution Patterns and Different Functional Groups</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture, designed by J&#232;ssica Margalef, illustrates the usefulness of a modular and easy&#8208;to&#8208;assemble catalyst design for asymmetric hydrogenation. By choosing the appropriate sulfur and phosphorus substituents on new Ir&#8208;P,S&#8208;catalysts, it is possible to hydrogenate substrates of very different nature (50 olefins in total). Improving on most catalysts reported so far, di&#8208; and E/Z&#8208;trisubstituted olefins with a variety of functional groups and coordination ability can be reduced with excellent enantioselectivities. Details can be found in the Research Article by Di&#233;guez and co&#8208;authors (J. Margalef, M. Biosca, P. de la Cruz&#8208;S&#225;nchez, X. Caldentey, C. Rodr&#237;guez&#8208;Escrich, O.

Abstract
This study has developed a method to prepare diastereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective indoline&#8208;fused 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine scaffolds. The synthetic process involved an Ugi four&#8208;component reaction in which readily available starting materials were used and a metal&#8208;free intramolecular post&#8208;Ugi tandem consecutive 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig/6&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization under basic conditions. The plausible mechanism and substrate structures were elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and supported by density functional theory calculations.

Abstract
Substrate&#8208;controlled cascade reactions between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes or their analogues and 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzyl chloride in the presence of a chiral secondary amine as the catalyst and base were developed, to obtain a broad spectrum of &#945;&#8208;benzylated enals and enantioenriched cyclopropane&#8208;fused chroman&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives. The cyclopropane&#8208;tethered iminium ion clearly served as a key intermediate in these reactions to trigger stereochemical outcomes, one of which was supported by a control experiment.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy for the immobilization of chiral 2,3&#8208;bisaminocyclopropenium salt (pre&#8208;catalyst) onto polystyrene and silica supports is presented together with a suitable procedure for the conversion into the corresponding cyclopropenimine superbase catalysts. The activity and recyclability of polystyrene&#8208; and silica&#8208;supported cyclopropenimines were initially tested under batch conditions in a model Michael addition detecting comparable efficiencies but a superior stability of the latter heterogeneous catalyst (5 cycles, accumulated TON of 27.1). The preferred silica&#8208;supported cyclopropenimine behaved very similarly to the soluble counterpart in the reaction of glycine imine with different Michael acceptors (48&#8208;92% yield; 60&#8208;98% ee) and it could be utilized as packing material for the fabrication of fixed&#8208;bed mesoreactors (pressure&#8208;resistant stainless&#8208;steel columns). Continuous&#8208;flow experiments were performed with satisfactory long&#8208;term stability (24 h on stream) with unaltered conversion efficiency and enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
An approach to the vicinal oxyazidation of alkenes has been achieved under mild and transition metal&#8208;free conditions. This method utilizes NaN3 as the azidation agent and 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxoammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEMPO+BF4&#8722;) as the single&#8208;electron oxidant as well as the oxygen source. By using this protocol, various &#946;&#8208;aminooxy azides were synthesized and several complex bioactive molecules were functionalized.

         <title>Organocatalytic Synthesis of Substituted Vinylene Carbonates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The organocatalytic synthesis of substituted vinylene carbonates from benzoins and acyloins was studied using diphenyl carbonate as a carbonyl source. A range of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) precursors were screened and it was found that imidazolium salts were the most active for this transformation. The reaction occurs at 90&#8201;&#176;C under solvent&#8208;free conditions. A wide range of substituted vinylene carbonates (symmetrical and unsymmetrical, aromatic or aliphatic), including some derived from natural products, were prepared with 20&#8211;99% isolated yields (24 examples). The reaction was also developed using thermomorphic polyethylene&#8208;supported organocatalysts as recoverable and recyclable species. The use of such species facilitates the workup and allows the synthesis of vinylene carbonates on the preparative scale (&gt;30&#8197;g after 5 runs).

         <dc:description>Direct and selective transformation of ArCF3 into other relevant functional groups is one of the unmet challenges in contemporary synthetic organic chemistry due to the inherent properties of C&#8208;F bonds. In this context, herein we communicate two mild, solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical coupling transformations of CF3 group with nitro compounds into amides or Schiff bases employing Ytterbia. This process proceeds via C&#8208;F bond activation along with utilizing Si&#8208;based reductants/oxygen scavengers &#8208; reductants of the nitro group. The scope and limitations of the disclosed methodologies are thoroughly studied. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first example of mechanical energy promoted transformation of the inert CF3 group into other functionalities.</dc:description>

Abstract
Radical cascade cyclization of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazones/oximes has recently emerged as an efficient and powerful protocol for the construction of diverse and valuable functionalized pyrazolines and isoxazolines. In this review, three catalytic ways of radical cascade cyclization of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazones/oximes are summarized and classified; these are transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed systems, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free systems, and photo&#8208;/electrocatalytic systems, respectively. Through these methods, various functional groups are installed on the pyrazoline and isoxazoline skeletons to enrich the small organic molecule library.

         <title>Umpolung Strategy for Arene C&#8722;H Etherification Leading to Functionalized Chromanes Enabled by I(III) N&#8208;Ligated Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>

Abstract
The direct formation of aryl C&#8722;O bonds via the intramolecular dehydrogenative coupling of a C&#8722;H bond and a pendant alcohol represents a powerful synthetic transformation. Herein, we report a method for intramolecular arene C&#8722;H etherification via an umpoled alcohol cyclization mediated by an I(III) N&#8208;HVI reagent. This approach provides access to functionalized chromane scaffolds from primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols via a cascade cyclization&#8208;iodonium salt formation, the latter providing a versatile functional handle for downstream derivatization. Computational studies support initial formation of an umpoled O&#8208;intermediate via I(III) ligand exchange, followed by competitive direct and spirocyclization/1,2&#8208;shift pathways.

         <title>Divergent Access to Benzocycles through Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylative Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed chemodivergent approach to five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered benzocycles from dienyl arenes tethered with a ketone has been developed. Through proper choice of coordinating ligands and catalytic conditions, copper&#8208;catalyzed borylative cyclization of a single dienyl arene can be diverted to two different pathways, leading to indanols and dihydronaphthalenols with high stereoselectivity. The chiral bidentate bisphosphine ligand (S,S)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE was optimal for asymmetric copper&#8208;allyl addition to a tethered ketone via a boat&#8208;like transition state, whereas NHC ligands led to boro&#8208;allyl addition producing indanols with high diastereoselectivity.

Notably, cyclopropenones, acting as multi-functional building blocks, could be assembled to construct up to 10&#8197;distinct heterocyclic scaffolds in a one-pot manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
The reactivity of N&#8208;tosyl vinylaziridines toward arynes has been demonstrated under mild and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions to yield 2&#8208;(phenanthren&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;sulfamides in moderate to good yields. The selective synthesis of N&#8208;H and N&#8208;aryl products was accomplished using CsF in MeCN and KF/18&#8208;C&#8208;6 in 1,4&#8208;dioxane, respectively. This cascade process involves a sequential Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, ring&#8208;opening aromatization, ene&#8208;reaction, and selective N&#8208;arylation reaction.

         <title>Indium Catalyzed Sequential Regioselective Remote C&#8722;H Indolylation and Rearrangement Reaction of Peroxyoxindole</title>

Abstract
Indium&#8208;catalyzed sequential remote C&#8722;H functionalization (C&#8208;6 position) and C3&#8208;indolylation of peroxyoxindole using indole is described for the synthesis of terindolinone derivatives. Whereas, N&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;phenyl peroxyoxindole derivatives undergoes consecutive skeletal rearrangement to generate transient carbocation, which has been trapped with indole nucleophile to generate 2&#8208;(1H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazin&#8208;3(4H)&#8208;one derivatives. In contrast with Indium (III) Chloride, FeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O facilitates oxidative cleavage of the peroxyoxindole (Hock cleavage) and further reaction with indole to afford biologically important trisindoline derivatives. A plausible mechanism has been proposed for these reactions with experimental evidences.

Abstract
A synthesis of spiroindolinone&#8208;isoindolinone skeletons is presented. The protocol is through a Ugi four&#8208;component reaction followed by highly efficient and mild copper&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular tandem C&#8722;N/C&#8722;C coupling process. Control experiments demonstrated that the formation of C&#8722;C bond is a copper catalyzed coupling process rather than base promoted nucleophilic aromatic substitution pathway which proposed in Prof. Van der Eycken's palladium catalyst system previously.

Abstract
2&#8208;Imino&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;selenadiazole derivatives can be synthesized from hydrazides and isoselenocyanates by sequential oxidation and a tributylphosphine (PBu3)&#8208;promoted annulation reaction at room temperature. In this synthetic process, crude less stable N&#8208;aroyldiazene intermediates generated by I2&#8208;mediated oxidation of hydrazides were used directly in a subsequent annulation reaction to afford the selenadiazole products. The merits of the present synthetic strategy also include absence of transition metals and gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

Abstract
The construction of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides has gradually become a hotspot of carbohydrate chemistry in recent years. In this work, we present an efficient, regioselective, stereoselective and widely applicable strategy for the synthesis of 2&#8208;indolyl&#8208;C&#8208;deoxyglycosides via Ir(I)&#8208;catalyzed, pyridine&#8208;group&#8208;directed C&#8722;H functionalization. This method exhibits high tolerance for the functional groups of indoles and the protecting groups of carbohydrates. Moreover, this protocol has good stereoselectivity and mainly produces &#946;&#8208;configuration products.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidative Azo&#8208;Ene Cyclization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidative azo&#8208;ene cyclization has been developed. The developed CuI/DMAP/O2 system efficiently facilitates the aerobic oxidation of ene&#8208;containing hydrazides to azo compounds, which undergo azo&#8208;ene cyclizations for the synthesis of oxazolidinones. In addition, the present approach enables the synthesis of lactams, as well as a nitroso&#8208;ene cyclization. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that two carbonyl groups were essential for the successful azo&#8208;ene cyclization and that a concerted mechanism might be plausible for this azo&#8208;ene cyclization.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copper-catalyzed aerobic oxidative azo-ene cyclization has been developed. The developed CuI/DMAP/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system efficiently facilitates the aerobic oxidation of ene-containing hydrazides to azo compounds, which undergo azo-ene cyclizations for the synthesis of oxazolidinones. In addition, the present approach enables the synthesis of lactams, as well as a nitroso-ene cyclization. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that two carbonyl groups were essential for the successful azo-ene cyclization and that a concerted mechanism might be plausible for this azo-ene cyclization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
Indole&#8208;based heterocycles containing sulfur or nitrogen atoms are important frameworks that occur widely in biological active natural products and drugs. Consequently, several novel chemical transformations and new catalytic strategies have been developed for the preparation of these skeletons in a highly efficient and selective manner. This review focuses on recent advancements in the construction of indole&#8208;fused heterocyclic compounds by using iminoindolines, 3&#8208;diazoindol&#8208;2&#8208;imines, 2&#8208;thioxoindolines, and their derivatives as starting materials.

Abstract
As an important branch of the Michael addition reaction, the aza&#8208;Michael addition cascade reaction has been developed rapidly in recent years. This is because the reaction serves as an important method for effectively constructing functionalized C&#8722;N bonds, which can be widely used in the synthesis of chiral drugs and their intermediates and natural products. Given the importance of this topic, this review highlights the recent developments of aza&#8208;Michael addition triggered cascade reactions in asymmetric synthesis, including aza&#8208;Michael/Michael, aza&#8208;Michael/Aldol, aza&#8208;Michael/Henry, aza&#8208;Michael/hemiacetal, aza&#8208;Michael/Mannich, aza&#8208;Michael/alkylation, aza&#8208;Michael/cyclization, aza&#8208;Michael/ring&#8208;opening, aza&#8208;Michael&#8208;IED/HAD, aza&#8208;Michael/INCR, and aza&#8208;Michael/1,6&#8208;conjugate addition reactions. In this paper, the reaction mechanism and derivatization experiments of different reactions are timely introduced to provide a more comprehensive theoretical basis for subsequent studies.

Abstract
We describe herein that the cross&#8208;coupling of bromodifluoroacetamides with (iodoethynyl)arenes proceeds without recourse to any photocatalyst when exposed to visible light at room temperature to afford alkynyldifluoroacetamides in 62&#8211;83% yields (27 examples). Several control experiments suggest that the reaction involves the homolysis of bromodifluoroacetamides and the coupling of the resultant difluoromethyl radical species with the 1&#8208;iodoalkynes via a radical chain process. Divergent transformations of the coupling products led to various organofluorine compounds, demonstrating the synthetic utility of the developed photo&#8208;coupling method.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of Alkynyl Norbornene Derivatives for the Synthesis of Benzofused Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Modular approaches, which allow a systematic variation of heteroaromatic cores and substituents, are crucial for the development of heteroaromatic drug candidates and organic functional materials. A new strategy involving the cyclization of heteroarenes tethered with alkynes through a norbornene bridge was developed. The precursors were readily prepared by a three&#8208;component coupling process of heteroaryl halides, norbornadiene, and terminal alkynes. The Pd catalytic system derived from Pd(OAc)2 and 2&#8208;(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine transformed a variety of five&#8208;membered heteroarenes to the corresponding benzofused products, including (di)benzothiophene, indazole, carbazole, indole, and benzofuran, with aryl and alkyl substituents at the C4(C7) position. During the cyclization process, the norbornene ring underwent a retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, serving as an acetylene synthon. This approach was used to synthesize naphthalene derivatives from electron&#8208;rich arenes, demonstrating its versatility in the annulation of (hetero)aromatic rings.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A radical alkylarylation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;methacryloyl indoles via autoxidation of alkylboronic acids was developed under metal&#8208;free conditions for the construction of indolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolinone derivatives. Primary and secondary alkyl boronic acids were utilized as suitable alkyl sources with O2 as the clean and green oxidant in a simple operate mode. Moreover, this protocol can also be applied to the construction of benzimidazo&#8208;[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolinone derivatives.

         <title>Carbene Catalyzed Access to 3,6&#8208;Disubstituted &#945;&#8208;Pyrones via Michael Addition/Lactonization/Elimination Cascade</title>

Abstract
The first direct transition metal&#8208;free access to 3,6&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;pyrones from &#945;&#8208;chloro aldehydes and &#946;&#8208;tosyl enones is reported. The reactions proceed via the Michael addition/lactonization/elimination cascade. The regioselective addition of NHC&#8208;bound enolates/homoenolates to the enones bearing a bulkier functionality such as tosyl group at the &#946;&#8208;position has remained challenging. The 3,6&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;pyrones could be converted to valuable products such as 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenes, 1,4&#8208;disubstituted naphthalenes as well as anthracenes and 6,13&#8208;disubstituted dihydro&#8208;ethenopentacenes in a simple operation.

&lt;p&gt;The first direct transition metal-free access to 3,6-disubstituted &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-pyrones from &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-chloro aldehydes and &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-tosyl enones is reported. The reactions proceed &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; the Michael addition/lactonization/elimination cascade. The regioselective addition of NHC-bound enolates/homoenolates to the enones bearing a bulkier functionality such as tosyl group at the &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-position has remained challenging. The 3,6-disubstituted &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-pyrones could be converted to valuable products such as 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted benzenes, 1,4-disubstituted naphthalenes as well as anthracenes and 6,13-disubstituted dihydro-ethenopentacenes in a simple operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot strategy for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;bromo enaminones is reported. The reactions proceed via the p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (TsOH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O) catalyzed reactions of 3&#8208;bromopropenals with anilines in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and does not require an external brominating agent. The chemoselective 1,2&#8208;addition was accomplished by employing aniline with a sterically hindered electron&#8208;withdrawing group attached at the ortho&#8208;position. In addition, the reactions involving other aniline derivatives as nucleophiles have resulted in minor yields of 1,4&#8208;addition product. The 3&#8208;bromopropenals showed a diverse range of reactivities with aniline derivatives.

         <title>Time&#8208;Dependent Diastereodivergent Michael Addition Enabled by Phosphazenes Acting as Catalysts and Reactants</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A switching of the step order within cascade process enabled design of a diastereodivergent approach to phosphazenopyrrolines with a 1,3&#8208;relationship of stereocenters. The approach is based on a cascade transformation of readily accessible &#947;&#8208;azidobutyronitriles that includes Staudinger, aza&#8208;Wittig and Michael steps. Stereodivergence is achieved at the Michael step that is self&#8208;catalyzed by phosphazene intermediates and provides construction of quaternary stereocenter. Depending on the type of phosphazene intermediates, generating either via Staudinger reaction or via subsequent intramolecular aza&#8208;Wittig reaction with nitrile and then reacting with a Michael acceptor, either trans&#8208; or cis&#8208;isomers of the target product can be produced. Thus, diastereoselectivity can be achieved by varying the time of addition for the Michael acceptor. Therefore, three distinct roles were revealed for phosphazenes in this process: catalysts, reactants and stereoselectivity controllers. This stereodivergent strategy was applied for the synthesis of all stereoisomers of the biorelevant tetrahydro&#8208;7&#8208;aza&#8208;indoles.

         <title>Mechanochemistry Enabled Construction of Isoxazole Skeleton via CuO Nanoparticles Catalyzed Intermolecular Dehydrohalogenative Annulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A dehydrohalogenative approach for isoxazole annulation by partnering &#946;&#8208;vinyl halides and &#945;&#8208;nitrocarbonyls under mechanochemical setting was accomplished. This chemistry is operative under the cooperative catalysis of cupric oxide nanoparticles (&lt;50&#8197;nm) and DABCO. The key beneficial aspects of this protocol include: (i) broad substrate scope, (ii) no vigorous work&#8208;up, (iii) short reaction time, (iv) solvent&#8208;free condition, (v) commercial viability of substrates/reagents (vi) good chemical yields and selectivity. The other merit of this chemistry is the ease with which CuO can be recuperated and reused after the reaction with not much drop in catalytic activity for six runs. With no confinement to &#946;&#8208;vinyl halides, the validated condition is also open to alkynes for isoxazole preparation, thereby establishing the broader utility of the current methodology.

         <title>Insight into the Modes of Activation of Pyridinium and Bipyridinium Salts in Non&#8208;Covalent Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A series of pyridinium and bipyridinium salts were prepared and their catalytic properties were evaluated in the aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between imines and Danishefsky diene. Depending on the substituents of the pyridinium/bipyridinium rings and on the nature of the counterion, two mechanisms of activation were demonstrated. In case of non&#8208;substituted rings, the substrate is activated through charge transfer involving the aryl ring on the C&#8208;side of the imine. When halogen atoms were introduced on the catalysts, the activation mode switched to halogen bond involving the imine nitrogen lone pair. Moreover, alternative activation modes based on hydrogen bonding and radical cation were ruled out. This work allowed us to develop two families of catalysts whose potential was demonstrated in the cycloaddition of various imines with Danishefsky diene. The first family is composed of the simple methyl pyridinium triflate and dioctyl bipyridinium triflate. The former is active only with imines bearing a p&#8208;methoxyphenyl group on the C&#8208;side and the latter was found to be efficient with imines bearing different substituents on both the N&#8208; and C&#8208;sides of the imines. The second family is based on halogenated pyridinium salts which proved active with almost all considered imines.

         <title>Non&#8208;Chelate&#8208;Assisted Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidative Heck Reaction of Fluorobenzenes and Other Arenes: When Does the C&#8722;H Activation Need Help?</title>

Abstract
The pyridone fragment in the ligand [2, 2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridin]&#8208;6(1H)&#8208;one (bipy&#8208;6&#8208;OH) enables the oxidative Heck reaction of simple arenes with oxygen as the sole oxidant and no redox mediator. Arenes with either electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing groups can be functionalized in this way. Experimental data on the reaction with toluene as the model arene shows that the C&#8722;H activation step is turnover limiting and that the ligand structure is crucial to facilitate the reaction, which supports the involvement of the pyridone fragment in the C&#8722;H activation step. In the case of fluoroarenes, the alkenylation of mono and 1,2&#8208;difluoro benzenes requires the presence of bipy&#8208;6&#8208;OH. In contrast, this ligand is detrimental for the alkenylation of 1,3&#8208;difluoro, tri, tetra and pentafluoro benzenes which can be carried out using just [Pd(OAc)2]. This correlates with the acidity of the fluoroarenes, the most acidic undergoing easier C&#8722;H activation so other steps of the reaction such as the coordination&#8208;insertion of the olefin become kinetically important for polyfluorinated arenes. The use of just a catalytic amount of sodium molybdate as a base proved to be optimal in all these reactions.

         <title>Enantioselective 1,6&#8208;Conjugate Addition of Dialkyl &#945;&#8208;Diazo Methylphosphonate to para&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An asymmetric 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition reaction of dialkyl diazomethylphosphonates to para&#8208;quinone methides promoted by phase&#8208;transfer catalysis has been developed. A series of chiral diarylmethylated diazomethylphosphonates were accessed with up to 85% yields and 99% ee enantioselectivities. The resulting products were further transformed into bioactive compounds, namely, a chiral dihydrocinnoline phosphonate and a chiral &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonate, bearing diarylmethine stereogenic centers.

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Cyclobutenes and Spirocycles via Asymmetric P(III)/P(V) Redox Catalysis</title>

Abstract
An enantioselective phosphine&#8208;catalyzed transformation has been developed for the synthesis of chiral cyclobutene triesters and fluorinated spirocyclic compounds. The strategy involved a P(III)/P(V) redox cycling process, via in&#8197;situ reduction of phosphine oxide with phenylsilane. This catalytic methodology has enabled the enantioselective synthesis of functionalized cyclobutenes (24 examples, up to 94% ee). On the occasion of the extension of this study to &#945;&#8208;ketoester indenone substrates, a surprising reactivity has been discovered for the synthesis of spiro&#8208;indenone products.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Oxidative Homocoupling of 2&#8208;Acyl Imidazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A diastereoselective and enantioselective construction of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds is reported. Nishiyama's RuPhebox complex (2.0&#8197;mol% catalyst loading) serves as a chiral Lewis acid catalyst in conjunction with BrCCl3 and a base for the oxidative homocoupling of 2&#8208;acyl imidazoles via the stereocontrolled reaction of intermediate Ru enolates with in&#8197;situ brominated 2&#8208;acyl imidazoles. Cleavage of the achiral imidazole auxiliary provides optically active 2,3&#8208;disubstituted succinic acids which are useful intermediates in the synthesis of chiral compounds like the natural product class of lignans.

         <title>Synthesis of Terminal N&#8208;Vinylazoles from Aromatic Aldehydes, DMSO, and Azoles Based DMSO as Terminal Carbon Synthon</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A protocol for the synthesis of terminal N&#8208;vinylazoles from aromatic aldehydes, DMSO, and azoles has been reported. In this strategy, DMSO was involved in the construction of the C=C bond as a terminal carbon synthon. Both aromatic aldehydes and azoles could be well tolerated and give the corresponding terminal N&#8208;vinylazoles in 52&#8211;91% yields. Based on preliminary experiments, a plausible mechanism is proposed.

         <title>A Unified Approach for Divergent Synthesis of Heterocycles via TMSOTf&#8208;Catalyzed Formal [3+2] Cycloaddition of Electron&#8208;Rich Alkynes</title>

Abstract
We present a synthetic protocol for the construction of polysubstituted five&#8208;membered heterocycles via TMSOTf&#8208;catalyzed formal [3+2] cycloaddition of electron&#8208;rich alkynes, which features free from any metal, atom economy and water as the main by&#8208;product. Furthermore, alkenyl ether adduct has been verified as the key intermediate. Notably, by utilizing this approach, we can synthesize a broad range of polysubstituted furans, thiophenes and pyrroles, and extend this transformation to deliver fused&#8208;polyheterocycles. This reaction can be achieved on a gram scale and the corresponding products are intermediates for producing diverse potentially useful scaffolds.

         <title>Optimizing the Iodide/Iodonium/O2 Oxidation Cycle Enhances the Scope, Selectivity, and Yields of Hydroiodic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Multicomponent Cyclocondensation Reactions</title>

Abstract
Catalytic iodine in the presence of water acts indirectly as a source of Br&#248;nsted acid and, concurrently, generates iodonium ion and hydrogen peroxide, which mediate the final oxidative aromatization step in the multicomponent cyclocondensation of an aromatic amine and two aliphatic aldehyde compounds. The oxidative cycle in this and related iodine&#8208;catalyzed reactions is seldom discussed, generally unoptimized, and rarely investigated in detail. This work establishes that two independent catalytic cycles (H+ and I&#8722;/I+) drive such multicomponent cyclocondensation/ oxidation reactions, provided that the oxidant is generated in sufficient concentration to inhibit oxidation of the dihydroquinoline by the intermediate iminium cation. The complementary dual catalytic cycles, when optimized, act in concert to suppress side product formation, which simplifies isolation and purification of the self&#8208;aggregating products, and increases the efficiency and scope of the Wang&#8208;Kozlov multicomponent reaction.

Abstract
Over the past few decades, organophosphorus catalysis has emerged as a robust platform for the preparation of highly functionalized molecules with excellent control of reactivity and selectivity. Organophosphorus catalysis has the advantages of mild and metal&#8208;free reaction conditions. The easy&#8208;to&#8208;tune electronic and steric properties of phosphorus provide an easy handle for developing efficient synthetic methodologies with high stereochemical fidelity. This review describes the efforts to introduce boron and silicon functionalities into organic substrates catalyzed by organophosphorus compounds. These catalysts are categorized into nucleophilic, electrophilic, and biphilic phosphorus catalysts. Phosphorus compounds efficiently catalyze hydroboration of various unsaturated systems, carbonyl compounds, imines, etc.; hydro&#8208;/cyano&#8208;silylation of carbonyls; and silylation of alcohols. The present review emphasizes the scope of nucleophilic, electrophilic, and biphilic phosphorus&#8208;based catalysis to introduce boron and silicon functionalities into organic compounds, mainly from the recent decade.

Abstract
An iridium/f&#8208;diaphos catalytic system for the enantioselective hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;ketoesters via dynamic kinetic resolution is reported. The desired anti &#946;&#8217;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino esters were obtained in moderate to good yields (60&#8211;95%) with 72&#8211;99% ees and 91:9 to 99:1 drs. This protocol tolerates various functional groups and could be easily conducted on gram scale with lower catalyst loading (TON up to 9100).

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Continuous&#8208;Flow Synthesis of Fungicide Metalaxyl through Catalytic C&#8722;N Bond&#8208;Formation Processes</title>

Abstract
Metalaxyl, an acylalanine fungicide, was synthesized through catalytic continuous sequential&#8208;flow reactions. Commonly used syntheses of this compound use batch systems and suffer from problems such as coproduction of halogen&#8208;containing by&#8208;products derived from acyl and alkyl halides in the substitution reactions of 2,6&#8208;dimethylaniline. To minimize waste and enhance efficiency, a halide&#8208;free approach including two continuous&#8208;flow catalytic processes, heterogeneous Pt&#8208;catalyzed reductive alkylation and homogeneous acid&#8208;catalyzed amidation with an acid anhydride, was developed. Systematic examination of the two reactions in flow mode enabled a high&#8208;yielding, two&#8208;step sequential continuous&#8208;flow process to be achieved.

         <title>Protein Engineering of d&#8208;Succinylase from Cupriavidus sp. for d&#8208;Amino Acid Synthesis and the Structural Implications</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
d&#8208;Amino acids are important chiral building blocks for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Previously, we have used d&#8208;Succinylase (DSA) from Cupriavidus sp. P4&#8208;10&#8208;C and N&#8208;succinyl amino acid racemase (NSAR, EC.4.2.1.113) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus NCA1503 to produce d&#8208;amino acids via the dynamic kinetic resolution of N&#8208;succinyl&#8208;dl&#8208;amino acids. However, the use of this bioconversion system remains challenging for industrial application due to the insufficient enantioselectivity of DSA toward N&#8208;succinyl&#8208;d&#8208;amino acids. Therefore, we screened DSA mutants for improved enantioselectivity by directed evolution. Several mutants showed improved enantioseletivity compared to wild&#8208;type DSA. L182E mutant had superior enantioselectivity, and the thermal stability was also remarkably improved by this single mutation. We solved the crystal structure of the L182E mutant in complex with succinic acids at a resolution 2.0&#8197;&#197;. The mutated residues in all generated mutants that showed improved enantioselectivity (including the substituted Glu182 in the L182E mutant) are found very close to the active site. The solved crystal structure also provides some rationale to explain the higher thermostability of the L182E mutant compared to wild&#8208;type DSA. d&#8208;phenylalanine and d&#8208;tryptophan were produced in high conversion (approximately 90%) with 98.8% ee and 99.6% ee, respectively, using coupled L182E DSA and NSAR with the one&#8208;pot enzymatic method. These data suggested that L182E DSA may be a useful biocatalyst for industrial d&#8208;amino acids production.

The mutated residues in all generated mutants that showed improved enantioselectivity (including the substituted Glu182 in the L182E mutant) are found very close to the active site. The solved crystal structure also provides some rationale to explain the higher thermostability of the L182E mutant compared to wild-type DSA. &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-phenylalanine and &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-tryptophan were produced in high conversion (approximately 90%) with 98.8% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; and 99.6% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;, respectively, using coupled L182E DSA and NSAR with the one-pot enzymatic method. These data suggested that L182E DSA may be a useful biocatalyst for industrial &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-amino acids production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A catalytic carbonylative approach to the multicomponent synthesis of benzothiophene derivatives from simple building blocks [1&#8208;(2&#8208;(methylthio)phenyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ols, carbon monoxide, and an alcohol)] is presented. It is based on an S&#8208;cyclization&#8208;demethylation&#8208;alkoxycarbonylation&#8208;reduction sequence promoted by the PdI2/KI catalytic system, occurring under relatively mild conditions (40&#8197;atm, 80&#8201;&#176;C, 15&#8197;h). Benzothiophene&#8208;2&#8208;acetic esters are obtained in moderate to good yields (35&#8211;70%) starting from variously substituted substrates in combination with different alcohols as external nucleophiles (17&#8197;examples).

&lt;p&gt;A catalytic carbonylative approach to the multicomponent synthesis of benzothiophene derivatives from simple building blocks [1-(2-(methylthio)phenyl)prop-2-yn-1-ols, carbon monoxide, and an alcohol)] is presented. It is based on an &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-cyclization-demethylation-alkoxycarbonylation-reduction sequence promoted by the PdI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/KI catalytic system, occurring under relatively mild conditions (40&#8197;atm, 80&#8201;&#176;C, 15&#8197;h). Benzothiophene-2-acetic esters are obtained in moderate to good yields (35&#8211;70%) starting from variously substituted substrates in combination with different alcohols as external nucleophiles (17&#8197;examples).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
