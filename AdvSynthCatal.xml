         <title>Synthesis of Organoselenium Compounds with Elemental Selenium</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
In the recent decade, growing efforts have been devoted to employing elemental selenium as a selenium source in organic synthesis. In contrast to unstable, smelly, and toxic previous selenium reagents, elemental selenium is readily available, cheap, bench&#8208;stable, and easy to handle. This review will mainly focus on the strategies for the activation of elemental selenium and the synthesis of organoselenium compounds including monoselenides, diselenides, selenium&#8208;containing heterocycles and so on.

Abstract
The synthesis and the study of organoselenium compounds have received much attention over the past decades. Selenium&#8208;containing organic molecules are widely used in organic synthesis, materials science, and medicinal chemistry. Selenium&#8197;&#8211; and more specifically the amino acid selenocysteine, bearing a selenol (SeH) moiety &#8211; is present in at least 25 human protein families, whose biological functions have not been completely identified. Amongst the variety of organoselenium compounds, selenols are a versatile class of molecules easily undergoing a broad array of useful transformations. Because of the unique properties of the SeH group, selenol chemistry has important applications in chemical sciences, spanning from organic synthesis to materials chemistry and biology. This review summarises currently available methodologies for the synthesis of selenols and highlights applications of selenols in chemical sciences and biology.

         <title>Auxiliary&#8208;Free Remote Dearomatizative Nitrenoid Transfer for Enantioselective Construction of Spirolactams</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An Ir&#8208;catalyzed remote dearomatizative amidation for the enantioselective construction of chiral spirolactams in 70&#8211;93% yield with 81&#8211;96% ee was developed. This protocol represented a more atom&#8208;economical approach to chiral spirolactams via Ir&#8208;catalyzed nitrenoid transfer without the introduction of a traceless O&#8208;silyl achiral auxiliary.

Abstract
Visible&#8208;light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed metal&#8208;free tandem one&#8208;pot synthesis of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted 3,4&#8208;dihydroquinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones from easily accessible 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes, &#945;&#8208;ketoesters and 4&#8208;alkyl Hantzsch esters has been described. This mild transformation affords the desired products in 47&#8211;93% yields for diversely decorated substrates, and can proceed on a gram&#8208;scale. The efficacy of the current catalysis arises from the use of organic 1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) as the photocatalyst and CF3CO2H as the additive.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Carboxylation of Aryl C&#8211;H Bonds in Benzamides with CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct carboxylation of inert aryl C&#8211;H bond catalyzed by abundant and cheap nickel is still facing challenge. Herein, we report the Ni&#8208;catalyzed direct carboxylation of aryl C&#8211;H bonds in benzamides under 1 atm of CO2 to afford various methyl carboxylates or phthalimides, dealing with different post&#8208;processing. The reaction displays excellent functional group tolerance and affords moderate to high carboxylation yields under mild conditions. Detail mechanistic studies suggest that a Ni(0)&#8208;Ni(II)&#8208;Ni(I) catalytic cycle may be involved in this reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A route for the construction of all&#8208;carbon tetra&#8208;substituted olefins through visible&#8208;light promoted coupling of diazo compounds with iodonium ylides was developed. A wide range of all&#8208;carbon tetra&#8208;substituted olefins was obtained in moderate to good yields. The synthetic values of the current method were further approved by the synthesis of natural isolates modified alkenes and the successful transformation of final olefins into important heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiodivergent Reaction of Ketimines with Malononitriles Using Single Cinchona Alkaloid Sulfonamide Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the enantiodivergent reaction of ketimines derived from &#945;&#8208;ketoesters with malononitriles using a single chiral source.  The reactions using an 8&#8208;quinolinesulfonyl cinchona alkaloid catalyst in the presence and absence of Et2Zn gave both enantiomers in high yields with high enantioselectivities (53~99% yield, 99:1~3:97 er).  The obtained malononitrile&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;amino acids were converted into various optically active compounds.  A reaction mechanism is proposed to explain the observed enantiodivergency.</dc:description>

         <title>A Diastereoselective Catalytic Approach to Pentasubstituted Pyrrolidines by Tandem Anionic&#8208;Radical Cross&#8208;over Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pentasubstituted pyrrolidines are ubiquitous constituents of natural products and drugs, however the access options to them especially with respect to absolute and relative stereochemistry are not well developed. We report an asymmetric synthesis of N,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentasubstituted pyrrolidines by oxidative single&#8208;electron transfer&#8208;catalyzed tandem aza&#8208;Michael addition/radical 5&#8208;exo cyclization/oxygenation reactions. The absolute stereochemistry is set by applying readily accessible chiral allylamines in asymmetric conjugate additions to various &#946;&#8208;substituted&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, which dependent on the substituent R2 sets the configuration of the two stereocenters next to the amine function, whereas two more are diastereoselectively generated by the radical 5&#8208;exo cyclization step. This allows the diastereodivergent single&#8208;step synthesis of pyrrolidines with four contiguous stereogenic centers. The stereoselectivity is rationalized by a predictive model.</dc:description>

         <title>Borane Catalyzed Selective Diazo Cross&#8208;Coupling Towards Pyrazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decomposition of donor&#8208;acceptor diazo compounds leads to the formation of reactive carbene intermediates. These can undergo a wide variety of carbene transfer reactions to yield synthetically useful products. Herein, we report a highly selective borane catalyzed cyclization reaction from the combination of two different diazo compounds to afford N&#8208;substituted pyrazoles. The selective decomposition of the more reactive &#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;diazoester and subsequent reaction with a vinyl diazoacetate produces &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;alkylated pyrazoles in a highly regioselective manner. Catalytic amounts of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (10 mol%) were employed to afford the pyrazole products (36 examples) in good to excellent yields (up to 80%). Extensive DFT studies have been undertaken to interpret the mechanism for this reaction which was found to go through two tandem catalytic cycles, both catalyzed by B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.</dc:description>

Abstract
The synthesis of complex C&#8208;glycoconjugates is presented here using a key directed nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkynylation step. Thanks to a bidentate amidoquinoline&#8208;type directing group, the insertion of diverse alkynyl moieties onto the pseudo&#8208;anomeric position of glycal substrates was performed on ten examples in moderate to good yields. These platforms were used as starting substrates in a click reaction with complex azides to form original C&#8208;glycoconjugates. By this route, a C&#8208;glycosylated amino acid, a C&#8208;linked disaccharide and a C&#8208;glycosylated biotin derivative were synthesized. Preliminary conditions to remove the directing group are also proposed.

Abstract
An approach for the synthesis of selenaheterocycles starting from aryl diazonium salts was developed. The one&#8208;pot process and subsequent visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated silver&#8208;catalyzed cyclization enabled the synthesis of selenaheterocycles in the absence of a photocatalyst. The reactions were carried out under mild conditions without the use of toxic or sensitive reagents.

Abstract
A gold&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular tandem cyclization of alkynol&#8208;tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes was reported in this paper, providing a synthetic route to access naphthalene&#8208;fused eight&#8208; to eleven&#8208;membered cyclic ether derivatives in moderate to good yields. On the basis of control experiments and DFT calculations, a reasonable reaction mechanism involving a gold carbene intermediate was proposed, which was formed via the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig enyne cyclization process.

         <title>Time&#8208;Dependent Diastereodivergent Michael Addition Enabled by Phosphazenes Acting as Catalysts and Reactants</title>

Abstract
A switching of the step order within cascade process enabled design of a diastereodivergent approach to phosphazenopyrrolines with a 1,3&#8208;relationship of stereocenters. The approach is based on a cascade transformation of readily accessible &#947;&#8208;azidobutyronitriles that includes Staudinger, aza&#8208;Wittig and Michael steps. Stereodivergence is achieved at the Michael step that is self&#8208;catalyzed by phosphazene intermediates and provides construction of quaternary stereocenter. Depending on the type of phosphazene intermediates, generating either via Staudinger reaction or via subsequent intramolecular aza&#8208;Wittig reaction with nitrile and then reacting with a Michael acceptor, either trans&#8208; or cis&#8208;isomers of the target product can be produced. Thus, diastereoselectivity can be achieved by varying the time of addition for the Michael acceptor. Therefore, three distinct roles were revealed for phosphazenes in this process: catalysts, reactants and stereoselectivity controllers. This stereodivergent strategy was applied for the synthesis of all stereoisomers of the biorelevant tetrahydro&#8208;7&#8208;aza&#8208;indoles.

Abstract
An organocatalytic 1,6&#8208;addition using 4&#8208;(alk&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;3&#8208;cyanocoumarins as acceptors has been developed. Dienolates derived from 5&#8208;substituted&#8208;furan&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;ones have been employed as pronucleophiles, therefore, enabling the synthesis of hybrid molecules bearing two biologically relevant units. Appropriate design of substrates and the application of quinine&#8208;derived catalyst resulted in very good site&#8208;selectivity as well as chemical and stereochemical efficiency of the process.

Abstract
The organocatalytic synthesis of substituted vinylene carbonates from benzoins and acyloins was studied using diphenyl carbonate as a carbonyl source. A range of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) precursors were screened and it was found that imidazolium salts were the most active for this transformation. The reaction occurs at 90&#8201;&#176;C under solvent&#8208;free conditions. A wide range of substituted vinylene carbonates (symmetrical and unsymmetrical, aromatic or aliphatic), including some derived from natural products, were prepared with 20&#8211;99% isolated yields (24 examples). The reaction was also developed using thermomorphic polyethylene&#8208;supported organocatalysts as recoverable and recyclable species. The use of such species facilitates the workup and allows the synthesis of vinylene carbonates on the preparative scale (&gt;30&#8197;g after 5 runs).

Abstract
An asymmetric addition of arylboronic acids to pyrazolinone ketimines is reported using palladium/chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;disulfonyl bisimidazoline (Bim) catalytic system, producing 25&#8197;examples of enantioenriched 4&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;pyrazolones bearing one quaternary carbon stereocenter with 60&#8211;91% yields and 81&#8211;98%&#8201;ee. The reaction demonstrates remarkable compatibility regarding pyrazolinone ketimines and arylboronic acids, rendering an enantioselective access to chiral aza&#8208;heterocycles bearing &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines.

Abstract
A metal&#8208;free multi&#8208;component sulfur dioxide insertion reaction of alkynes, sodium metabisulfite, aryldiazonium, and quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;ones has been developed under visible&#8208;light&#8194;photoredox&#8208;catalysis. This photocatalytic tandem reaction would be conducted at room temperature by using of Rhodamine 6G as organic photocatalyst and sodium metabisulfite as the SO2 surrogate. This protocol provides a synthetic strategy for the construction of various quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;one&#8208;containing vinyl sulfones with favourable functional group tolerance, in which one C&#8722;C bond and two C&#8722;S bonds were constructed in one pot procedure.

Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis offers a mild, simple, and efficient tool for the preparation of interesting and useful molecules, thus eluding severe chemical oxidizing and reducing agents used in conventional synthetic methods. In particular, electrochemical C&#8722;H activation is expected to play an important role in the direct functionalization of heterocyclic compounds. Over the past few decades, the research interest in imidazopyridine and indazole has increased significantly due to their multipurpose uses in medicinal and industrial chemistry. Therefore, structural modification of these heterocycles using electro&#8208;oxidation has become one of the important research topics among synthetic organic chemistry in recent time. This review provides a comprehensive discussion of electrochemical functionalization of indazoles and imidazopyridines published so far. A summary of the current challenges and the future direction for the development of efficient and green electrochemical methods for functionalization of these heterocycles is also presented.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Alkynylation of C&#8722;H Bonds</title>

Abstract
Alkynylation reactions are one of the most sought&#8208;after synthetic methodologies due to the versatility of C&#8722;C triple bond diversifications. Sonogashira coupling was widely used for the synthesis of alkynylated molecules; however, this methodology requires the use of previously halogenated substrates, which is a major drawback. To overcome this issue, a complimentary method, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkynylation, was emerged as an alternative tool in the recent years. Though the initial reports required the use of either specific directing groups or strong alkynylating agents for effective functionalization, recent studies indicate that transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed site selective alkynylations can be carried out using mild and readily available alkynylating agents under moderate reaction conditions. In this review, we explain the transition metal cataluyzed site selective alkynylation both C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds by emphasizing to the reaction mechanism.

Abstract
C&#8208;methylation is a vitally important reaction applicable in chemical synthesis and structure&#8208;based drug design. Notably, the &#8220;magic methyl&#8221; effect has become decisive in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery for the modulation of bio&#8208;active properties in life science molecules. In this regard, C&#8208;methylation reaction is widely applied chemical modification in various biomolecules, pharmaceuticals, and natural products. In general, this reaction often relies on activated, hazardous and uneconomical methyl sources such as diazomethane, dimethyl sulfate, and methyl halides. To achieve methylation reactions in a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective manner, the use of &#8216;ideal&#8217; C1 source is crucial. In this regard, methanol constitutes an expedient &#8722;CH3 source because this simple alcohol is less&#8208;hazardous, inexpensive, and abundantly available platform chemical as well as it produces only water as the by&#8208;product in methylation processes. Regarding potential catalysts to perform C&#8208;methylation using methanol by hydrogen borrowing methodology, non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based catalysts are highly preferable due to their unique advantages such as more abundance, inexpensive and low&#8208;toxicity. In recent years, chemists made significant contributions towards catalytic valorization of methanol as C1 source to insert methyl groups via C&#8722;H activation in a variety of compounds and life science molecules. Consequently, in this minireview we summarize the C&#8208;methylation process using methanol by applying Fe&#8208;, Mn&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Ni&#8208;based catalysts as well as metal free catalysts.

Abstract
Herein we report a site&#8208;selective and thiol&#8208;free thiofunctionalization of electron&#8208;rich heteroarenes. After a selective ortho&#8208;magnesiation, the use of S8 followed by an electrophile allows direct access to S&#8208;alkyl or &#8208;aryl derivatives. In situ oxidation provides the corresponding sulfoxide and sulfone derivatives. Applying this protocol, Cerlapirdine was prepared in 4 steps with 28% overall yield.

         <title>Biocatalytic Application of a Membrane&#8208;Bound Coumarin C&#8208;Glucosyltransferase in the Synthesis of Coumarin and Benzofuran C&#8208;Glucosides</title>

Abstract
A number of plant C&#8208;glycosyltransferases (CGTs) have been recently identified, whereas the coumarin CGTs have not been found. Here we reported the first identification of a coumarin C&#8208;glucosyltransferase MaCGT from Morus alba. The whole&#8208;cell biocatalyst harboring MaCGT was exploited and exhibited strictly and efficiently regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;specific C&#8208;glucosylation capacity toward structurally different coumarins. The whole&#8208;cell of MaCGT was further applied to chemo&#8208;enzymatically synthesize benzofuran C&#8208;glucosides. Moreover, MaCGT is reported as the first characterized membrane&#8208;bound CGT from plants, although sequence homology search has shown other potentially membrane&#8208;bound CGTs from M. notabilis; and the presence of the transmembrane domain is critical for its catalytic activity and stability as demonstrated by the C&#8208;glucosylation activity of truncated MaCGT proteins. In addition, the key residues involved in the C&#8208;glucosylation of MaCGT were explored. These findings suggest the diversity of CGTs in the plant kingdom and demonstrate the significant potential of biocatalytic approach to produce structurally diverse C&#8208;glycosides for drug discovery.

Abstract
An approach to the vicinal oxyazidation of alkenes has been achieved under mild and transition metal&#8208;free conditions. This method utilizes NaN3 as the azidation agent and 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxoammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEMPO+BF4&#8722;) as the single&#8208;electron oxidant as well as the oxygen source. By using this protocol, various &#946;&#8208;aminooxy azides were synthesized and several complex bioactive molecules were functionalized.

Abstract
A formal [3+3] cycloaddition reaction of azaoxyallyl cations and isatogens generated in&#8197;situ from &#945;&#8208;halo hydroxamates and o&#8208;nitroalkynes, respectively, was developed. The cycloisomerization of the o&#8208;nitroalkynes, followed by base&#8208;mediated elimination of hydrogen halide and 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of the azaoxyallyl cations with the isatogen intermediates, were hallmarks of this one&#8208;pot tandem reaction. A series of tricyclic fused indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones were obtained under very mild reaction conditions with high atom economy, and the reaction exhibited excellent functional group tolerance. In addition, the reaction was highly scalable to multigram quantities. The obtained indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones exhibited robust DNA staining patterns in agarose gel electrophoresis. Coupled with the fluorescence properties of the products, these results highlight the potential utility of tricyclic fused indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones in various fluorescence and cell&#8208;staining applications.

Abstract
Substrate&#8208;controlled cascade reactions between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes or their analogues and 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzyl chloride in the presence of a chiral secondary amine as the catalyst and base were developed, to obtain a broad spectrum of &#945;&#8208;benzylated enals and enantioenriched cyclopropane&#8208;fused chroman&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives. The cyclopropane&#8208;tethered iminium ion clearly served as a key intermediate in these reactions to trigger stereochemical outcomes, one of which was supported by a control experiment.

Abstract
The commercially available and bench&#8208;stable Co(acac)2 ligated with bis[(2&#8208;diphenylphosphino)phenyl] ether (dpephos) was employed for selective room temperature hydroboration of nitro compounds with HBPin (TOF up to 4615&#8197;h&#8722;1), tolerating halide, hydroxy, amino, ether, ester, lactone, amide and heteroaromatic functionalities. These reactions offered a direct access to a variety of N&#8208;borylamines RN(H)BPin, which were in&#8197;situ treated with aldehydes and carboxylic acids to produce a series of aldimines and secondary carboxamides without the need for dehydrating and/or coupling reagents. Combination of these transformations in a sequential one&#8208;pot manner allowed for direct and selective synthesis of aldimines and secondary carboxamides from readily available and inexpensive nitro compounds.

Abstract
Chiral imidodiphosphoric acid&#8208;catalysed asymmetric functionalization of 3&#8208;hydroxy bisindoles was established. Sulfur&#8208;containing groups could be successfully introduced into isatin frameworks using commercially available thiols. The transformation was compatible with substrates bearing distinct substituents, both aromatic and aliphatic thiols were amenable to afford the desired products. A total of 41 reactions furnished various chiral 3&#8208;thiooxindoles in 23%&#8211;99% yield, with 72%&#8211;99% enantioselectivity.

         <dc:description>Highly regioselective alkylation of sugar hydroxyl groups has always been an important challenge in carbohydrate chemistry, especially for the selective alkylation of trans diols&#65292;there is no direct and efficient catalytic method so far. A chiral copper catalyzed universal highly site&#8208;selective alkylation of trans&#8208;diols method is realized. This reaction is performed under mild conditions and has broad substrate scope.

         <title>Acridine Orange Hemi(Zinc Chloride) Salt as a Lewis Acid&#8208;Photoredox Hybrid Catalyst for the Generation of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Carbonyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A readily accessible organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid catalyst is reported for the reductive fragmentation of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;halocarbonyl compounds. The robust hybrid catalyst is a self&#8208;stabilizing combination of ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Lewis acid and acridine orange as the photoactive organic dye. Mechanistic specifics of this hybrid catalyst have been studied in detail using both photophysical and electrochemical experiments. A systematic study enabled the discovery of the appropriate Lewis acid for the effective LUMO stabilization of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;halocarbonyl compounds and thereby lowering of reduction potential within the range of a standard organic dye. This strategy resolves the issues like dehalogenative hydrogenation or homo&#8208;coupling of alkyl radicals by guiding the photoredox cycle through an oxidative quenching pathway. The cooperativity between the photoactive organic dye and the Lewis acid counterparts empowers functionalization with a wide range of coupling partners through efficient and controlled generation of alkyl radicals and serves as an appropriate alternative to the expensive late transition metal&#8208;based photocatalysts. To demonstrate the application potential of this cooperative catalytic system, four different synthetic transformations of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;carbonyl bromides were explored with broad substrate scopes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of azides with isocyanides, as a new type of nitrene transformation, has become an expeditious method to prepare carbodiimides. Considering the compatibility of this coupling process with other systems, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed sequential reactions have lifted a new upsurge in recent years. These remarkable advances not only involve many interesting reaction processes, but also provide useful strategies for the construction of nitrogen&#8208;containing structures, such as guanidines, amidines, isoureas and heterocyclic compounds.
This review will present a comprehensive picture of the development of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling process of azides with isocyanides and their applications in the preparation of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds. In these contents, the directly catalytic coupling reaction and sequential nucleophilic addition will be briefly introduced. Most recent advances in catalytic cascade reactions involving coupling process will be highlighted and occupy most of the space.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed interrupted click&#8208;sulfenylation of O&#8208;/N&#8208;propargyl benzyl thiosulfonates with organic azides has been disclosed. The unified CuAAC&#8208;thiolation provides a wide range of triazole&#8208;fused eight&#8208;membered heterocycles in good to high (51&#8208;94%) yields under mild reaction conditions. Moreover, a three&#8208;component reaction is also achieved involving O&#8208;/N&#8208;propargyl benzyl thiosulfonates, benzyl bromide, and sodium azide to deliver fused&#8208;triazoles in 61&#8208;74% yields. From a synthetic point of view, the present protocol has been demonstrated at gram&#8208;scale reactions. A plausible mechanism is also proposed based on experimental results and control experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Direct C7&#8208;Selective Alkenylation and Alkylation of Indoles with Maleimides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A versatile and efficient method for the coupling of maleimides and indoles at the C7&#8208;position has been established under Rh(III) catalysis. The present protocol was compatible with various functional groups, diverse 3&#8208;(indol&#8208;7&#8208;yl)maleimides and 3&#8208;(indol&#8208;7&#8208;yl)succinimides were obtained in moderate to excellent yields by switching reaction conditions. Moreover, this method further highlights the unique practical application for the conjugation with pharmaceutically useful compounds and amino acid derivatives. To explore the mechanism of this transformation, deuteration studies and control experiments have been carried out.

         <dc:description>
The front cover picture, depicts Metalaxyl, an acylalanine fungicide, which was synthesized through catalytic continuous sequential&#8208;flow reactions. A halide&#8208;free approach including two continuous&#8208;flow catalytic processes, heterogeneous Pt&#8208;catalyzed reductive alkylation and homogeneous acid&#8208;catalyzed amidation with an acid anhydride, was developed to minimize waste and enhance efficiency. Systematic examination of the two reactions in flow mode enabled a high&#8208;yielding, two&#8208;step sequential continuous&#8208;flow process, achieving continuous synthesis of an agrochemical. Details can be found in the Communication by Shu Kobayashi and co&#8208;workers (H. Ishitani, Z. Yu, T. Ichitsuka, N. Koumura, S.&#8208;y. Onozawa, K. Sato, S. Kobayashi, Adv. Synth.

         <title>Pyrrolidine&#8208;Catalyzed Annulations of Quinone Monoacetals with Naphthols: Synthesis of 2&#8208;Oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane Skeletons, Transformations and Reaction Mechanism</title>

         <dc:description>









Abstract
Herein, we report the pyrrolidine&#8208;catalyzed annulation reaction of p&#8208;quinone monoacetals with naphthols at room temperature. The reaction is also extended to including 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin, 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;methylcarbostyril, 4&#8208;hydroxycarbostyril, and several &#946;&#8208;ketoesters as the nucleophiles, thereby providing a collection of bridged cyclic compounds bearing 2&#8208;oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeletons in 41&#8211;96% yields. The reaction can be adapted to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and several transformations of the obtained bridged cyclic products are demonstrated for the preparation of polycyclic compounds that may find utility in related fields. Mechanism studies indicate the engagement of iminium intermediate in the reaction, and a bridged ring enamine intermediate can be observed by NMR.

Abstract
An asymmetric Dieckmann condensation towards spirocyclic oxindoles and aza&#8208;oxindoles catalyzed by amino acid&#8208;derived phosphonium salt has been developed, which expanded the applicability of asymmetric phosphonium salt catalysis in the production of 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. This reaction is distinguished by its mild conditions (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C), low catalyst loading (3&#8211;5&#8197;mol%), and broad substrate scope (25 examples). Control experiments revealed that both the catalyst&#8216;s phosphonium skeleton and H&#8208;bonding site were required. Product transformations and a gram scale experiment were also carried out.

         <title>Update on the Synthesis of N&#8208;Heterocycles via Cyclization of Hydrazones (2017&#8211;2021)</title>

Abstract
Hydrazones, as universal structural units, are useful synthons for the formation of carbon&#8211;nitrogen and nitrogen&#8722;heteroatom bonds. Thus, they provide new methods of constructing nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. In recent years, especially between 2017 and 2021, many efforts have been made to exploit hydrazone&#8208;based reactions in efforts to develop more powerful and effective pathways towards the synthesis of various multifunctional heterocyclic compounds. However, despite the tremendous amount of work that has been published over the past five years, no review has been published that summarizes the significant progress in the preparation of nitrogen heterocycles via intramolecular cyclization of hydrazones with adjacent unsaturated bonds or intermolecular cyclization of hydrazones with unsaturated systems. Therefore, this review summarizes the hydrazone&#8208;based cyclization strategies used to synthesize nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles over the past five years. It discusses the corresponding reaction scopes, limitations, mechanisms, and problems.

         <title>Chiral Iron Complexes in Asymmetric Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Transition metal chiral catalysts can feature metal stereocenters in different coordination geometries. In the case of iron, both octahedral and tetrahedral geometries possessing a chirotopic iron atom have been synthesized and tested in stereoselective organic transformations. The configurational stability of these complexes, which in some cases is hampered by decomplexation and recomplexation of labile ligands, is achieved by the use of multidentate ligands in octahedral complexes, and of cyclopentadienyl anions (half sandwich complexes) in the case of tetrahedral structures. The use of octahedral iron complexes featuring configurationally stable iron stereocenters is reviewed in highly enantioselective reductions (hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation of ketones) and oxidations (cis&#8208;dihydroxylation of alkenes, epoxidation, sulfoxidation), while the use tetradentate iron complexes is described in C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions and reductions.

         <title>Advances in Electrochemical Hydrogenation Since 2010</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A commitment to developing a convenient, efficient, and safe hydrogenation strategy is one of the main focuses of industry and academia. Electrochemical hydrogenation brings greener and gentler opportunities for the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds and the incorporation of deuterium atoms to desired products with traceless electrons as redox reagents in the absence of high&#8208;pressure hydrogen. In this account, recent advances in electrochemical hydrogenation or transfer hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds since 2010 are summarized. The reaction features, limitations, substrates scopes, mechanism of these hydrogenation reactions are discussed in this review. We hope this account will contribute to future developments to broaden the scope of electrochemical hydrogenation or transfer hydrogenation.

         <title>Synthesis of Isoquinolylselenocyanates and Quinolylselenocyanates via Electrophilic Selenocyanogen Cyclization Induced by Pseudohalogen (SeCN)2 Generated in situ</title>

Abstract
A strategy for the synthesis of isoquinolylselenocyanates and quinolylselenocyanates through electrophilic selenocyanogen cyclization has been developed. The feature of this reaction is that the sequential process was induced directly by generated in&#8197;situ pseudohalogen (SeCN)2 generated in&#8197;situ. Additionally, the obtained selenocyanates allowed functional group diversification, which could be potential intermediates for valuable compounds.

Abstract
Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative arylation of alkynyl cyclic carbonates using commercially available and low&#8208;toxic aryl boronic acids has been disclosed. Depending on the nature of the cyclic carbonates, the methodology provides a straightforward platform to access either substituted 2,3&#8208;allenols or 1,3&#8208;butadiene derivatives. Internal alkynyl cyclic carbonates undergo monoarylation to conveniently afford 2,3&#8208;allenols with high syn&#8208;selectivity for the aryl and hydroxy groups. Whereas, terminal alkynyl carbonates led to the formation of diarylated 1,3&#8208;butadiene derivatives having cis&#8208;configuration for the two aryl groups via allenyl rhodium(I)alkoxide intermediate. The compatibility of various functional groups allowed to develop a library of diversely functionalized scaffolds with excellent regioselectivity in good yields. Late&#8208;stage transformation of a series of natural products highlights the wide applicability of the arylation process. Additionally, scale&#8208;up experiments and downstream transformations of &#945;&#8208;allenol derivatives into other valuable heterocycles illustrate the efficacy of the protocol.

         <title>A Rh(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Cyclization of 1,5&#8208;Bisallenes and Alkynes for the Formation of cis&#8208;3,4&#8208;Arylvinyl Pyrrolidines and Cyclopentanes</title>

Abstract
The cascade cyclization reactions of 1,5&#8208;bisallenes grant access to a great variety of products by precisely tuning the catalyst system and/or the reagents involved. Herein, we present our findings that 1,5&#8208;bisallenes react with two molecules of dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate to afford, in a completely diastereoselective manner, cis&#8208;3,4&#8208;arylvinyl pyrrolidines and cyclopentanes. DFT calculations have been used to postulate a mechanism for the developed reaction which encompasses a [2+2+2] cycloaddition reaction of the two alkynes and the external double bond of one allene, followed by a cycloisomerization involving the internal double bond of the second allene.

         <title>Asymmetric Epoxidation of Olefins Catalyzed by Substituted Aminobenzimidazole Manganese Complexes Derived from L&#8208;Proline</title>

Abstract
A family of manganese complexes [Mn(Rpeb)(OTf)2] (peb=1&#8208;(1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;N&#8208;((1&#8208;((1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl) pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)&#8208;N&#8208;methylmethanamine)) derived from L&#8208;proline has been synthesized and characterized, where R refers to the group at the diamine backbone. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses indicate that all the manganese complexes [Mn(Rpeb)(OTf)2] exhibit cis&#8208;&#945; topology. These types of complexes are shown to catalyze the asymmetric epoxidation of olefins employing H2O2 as a terminal oxidant with up to 96% ee. Obviously, the R group of the diamine backbone can influence the catalytic activity and enantioselectivity in the asymmetric epoxidation of olefins. In particular, Mn(i&#8208;Prpeb)(OTf)2 bearing an isopropyl arm, cannot catalyze the epoxidation reaction with H2O2 as the oxidant. However, when PhI(OAc)2 is used as the oxidant instead, all the manganese complexes including Mn(i&#8208;Prpeb)(OTf)2 can promote the epoxidation reactions efficiently. Taken together, these results indicate that isopropyl substitution on the Rpeb ligand inhibits the formation of active Mn(V)&#8208;oxo species in the H2O2/carboxylic acid system via an acid&#8208;assisted pathway.

         <title>Electrooxidative Dearomatization to Spiroisoxazolines: Application to Total Synthesis of Xanthoisoxazoline B</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The synthesis of spiroisoxazoline molecules has been developed via anodic oxidative dearomatization of 4&#8208;methoxybenzyl oximes. The reaction is thought to proceed through 5&#8208;exo C&#8722;O bond&#8208;forming cyclization of oxime radicals with arenes on the basis of cyclic voltammetry studies. Moreover, spiroisoxazolines can be built directly from readily available carbonyl tethered phenolics via an oximation/dearomatization cascade. Using this spiroisoxazolization as the key step, the first total synthesis of xanthoisoxazoline B has been achieved in three steps.

Abstract
We developed a cascade reaction of o&#8208;haloaryl ynone and 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;methylchromene under transition metal&#8208;free conditions. This strategy proceeds through double Michael addition and oxygen&#8208;migration, thus providing a straight way for the synthesis of chromone derivatives.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced dioxygenation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated oximes for the synthesis of diverse useful isoxazolines bearing a hydroxyl moiety was developed by employing graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) as a heterogeneous photocatalyst under an air atmosphere. Noted that, the eminent advantages of this metal&#8208;free protocol include step economy, easy operation, a recyclable photocatalyst, external reductant&#8208;/oxidant&#8208;free and mild reaction conditions. Additionally, mechanistic studies indicated hydroxyl radical was generated under the photocatalysis of g&#8208;C3N4.

Abstract
The [4+3] annulation of aza&#8208;o&#8208;quinone methides and pyridinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates has been developed for the one&#8208;step synthesis of functionalized 2,3&#8208;unsaturated 4,1&#8208;benzothiazepines under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions. The produced 4,1&#8208;benzothiazepines can easily be converted into biologically interesting sulfoxides and sulfones via selective oxidization with m&#8208;CPBA.

The produced 4,1-benzothiazepines can easily be converted into biologically interesting sulfoxides and sulfones via selective oxidization with &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-CPBA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Directed Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;H Arylation of 1&#8208;Pyrenylphosphines Selective at the K&#8208;Region</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8211;H arylation of 1&#8208;pyrenylphosphine derivatives catalyzed by rhodium and directed by a diphenylphosphino group is selectively achieved at the K&#8208;region, i.e. 4&#8208;, 5&#8208;, 9&#8208;, or 10&#8208;position of the pyrene moiety. The functionalization at the K&#8208;region of topical pyrene substrates is hardly accessible by conventional organic synthetic methods. This peri C&#8211;H activation/arylation of pyrenes using (hetero)aryl bromide coupling partners tolerates both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the arene, and in general straightforwardly provides good to high isolated yields of products, up to 96%, including from bulky polyaromatic bromoarene substrates. We achieved investigations directed at the formation and reactivity of pertinent intermediate species in this C&#8211;H arylation reaction. The P&#8208;ligand coordination at rhodium was established using 31P NMR and XRD analysis, and we isolated five&#8208;membered rhodacycles as intermediates to the directed C&#8211;H functionalization. The data obtained overall supported the occurrence of a Rh(I)/Rh(III) catalytic process. We further described the access to a large class of pyrenylphosphine ligands and their selenated derivatives. Phosphine selenation allows to rapidly estimate from 1JP=Se values the basic character of the ligand in the perspective of their use as for coordination. Accordingly, linear P&#8208;coordinated Au(I) gold complexes were isolated, in addition to the variously coordinated Rh(III) complexes. The present methodology significantly extends the scope of polyaromatics that are functionalizable at the K&#8208;Region by direct C&#8211;H functionalization, beyond smaller&#8208;sized naphtalenes and aminopyrenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bio&#8208;Based Silane Coupling Agents by the Modification of Eugenol</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A simple method for the synthesis of new bio&#8208;based silane coupling agents (SCAs) with a terpene aromatic core by the functionalization of cheap, natural eugenol and its sulfur derivatives using the hydrosilylation of the C=C bonds with HSi(OEt)3, followed by nucleophilic substitution reactions of OH/SH groups is presented. The obtained alkoxysilanes possess different polymer&#8208;reactive functionalities (alkenyl, epoxide, thiirane, thiocarbamoyl, thioester, thioether moieties). This new group of biogenic SCAs was fully characterized using 1H, 13C, 29Si NMR, FT&#8208;IR, GC&#8208;MS, and HRMS or elemental analysis. Examples of their application as additives to tire rubbers and their influence on several factors are also discussed.

         <title>Enzyme Access Tunnel Engineering in Baeyer&#8208;Villiger Monooxygenases to Improve Oxidative Stability and Biocatalyst Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide is involved in a variety of enzyme catalysis as an oxidant or toxic by&#8208;product. Thereby, attenuation of the H2O2&#8208;driven oxidative stress is one of the key issues for preparative biocatalysis. Here, a rational approach to improve the robustness of enzymes, in particular, Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) against H2O2 was investigated. The enzyme access tunnels, which may serve as exit paths for H2O2 from the active site to the bulk, were predicted by using the CAVER and/or protein energy landscape exploration (PELE) software for the phenylacetone monooxygenase variant (PAMO_C65D) from Thermobifida fusca and the BVMO from Pseudomonas putida KT2440. The amino acid residues, which are susceptible to oxidation by H2O2 (e.&#8201;g., methionine and tyrosine) and located in vicinity of the predicted H2O2 migration paths, were substituted with less reactive or inert amino acids (e.&#8201;g., leucine and isoleucine). This led to design of the H2O2&#8208;resistant enzyme variants, which became robust biocatalysts for synthetic applications. For instance, the H2O2&#8208;resistant P. putida BVMO reached turnover numbers of 4,100 for the BV oxygenation of 4&#8208;decanone, which is 2.8&#8208;fold greater than the parent enzyme. Moreover, the H2O2&#8208;resistant P. putida BVMO allowed 2&#8208;fold enhancement in titer of 9&#8208;(nonanoyloxy)nonanoic acid (8) formation in a cascade fatty acid biotransformation. Therefore, it was assumed that the CAVER/PELE&#8208;based H2O2 migration path engineering represents an efficient rational design approach to improve not only oxidative stability but also biotransformation performance of the H2O2&#8208;forming or utilizing enzymes (e.&#8201;g., BVMOs, oxidases, and peroxidases).

         <title>Transketolase catalyzed synthesis of N&#8208;aryl hydroxamic acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroxamic acids are metal&#8208;chelating compounds that show important biological activity including anti&#8208;tumor effects. We have recently engineered the transketolase from Geobacillus stearothermopilus (TKgst) to convert benzaldehyde as a non&#8208;natural acceptor substrate. Realizing the structural and electronic similarity to nitrosobenzene, we studied the TK&#8208;catalyzed conversion of nitrosoarenes to yield N&#8208;arylated hydroxamic acids. Here we demonstrate that wild&#8208;type and variants of this versatile TKgst enzyme indeed induce the rapid biocatalytic conversion of variously p&#8208;, m&#8208; and o&#8208;substituted nitrosoarenes to produce a variety of corresponding N&#8208;aryl hydroxamic acids via creation of a carbon&#8208;nitrogen instead of a carbon&#8208;carbon bond. Further structural modifications can be introduced by varying the donor component, such as hydroxypyruvate or pyruvate.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Cyclic Acetals with Spirooxindole Skeleton</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An organocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of cyclic acetal with spirooxindole skeleton has been developed via a domino reaction between isatin and &#947;&#8208;hydroxy enones. Bifunctional squaramide catalyst with adamantyl motif was found to be the most effective for the cascade reaction. With 10&#8197;mol% of the catalyst, the desired products were obtained in 1.8:1 to 9:1 diastereo&#8208; and 86% to &gt;99% enantioselectivities from a range of substituted isatins and &#947;&#8208;hydroxy enones.

         <title>Fabrication of &#969;&#8208;Transaminase@Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Biocomposites for Efficiently Synthesizing Benzylamines and Pyridylmethylamines</title>

Abstract
In this study, ten &#969;&#8208;transaminases (&#969;&#8208;TAs) have been investigated to efficiently catalyze the synthesis of twenty&#8208;four functionalized benzylamines and pyridylmethylamines. We optimized the reactions, screened suitable amino donors and compared &#969;&#8208;transaminases activities for all aromatic aldehyde substrates. Under the optimized conditions, eighteen aromatic amines have been obtained with 60.4%&#8211;96.6% conversions and isolated only via simple extraction and recrystallization with 18.5%&#8211;81% yields on a preparative scale. Furthermore, we first immobilized the Bm&#8208;STA onto the MOFs via the physical adsorption to overcome the limitation of free enzyme and improve their industrial applications. The obtained Bm&#8208;STA/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 composites exhibited not only high enzymes loading (80.4&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) and enzyme activity recovery (95.8%), but also the better reusability, storage stability, pH stability and the tolerance to acetone and DMF.

         <title>Synthesis of Indole&#8208; and Pyrrole&#8208;Fused Seven&#8208;Membered Nitrogen Heterocycles via Acid&#8208;Base Switchable Cyclization Involving Cleavage of Amide C&#8722;N Bonds</title>

Abstract
We report the method for synthesis of indole&#8208; and pyrrole&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered nitrogen heterocycles by means of acid&#8208;base switchable cyclization reactions. The reactions involved cleavage of amide C&#8722;N bonds, chemoselective N&#8208;1 or C&#8208;3 acylation, and 1,4&#8208;Michael addition. This method could be used to construct two different kinds of seven&#8208;membered rings in one step from the same starting material without the need for a transition&#8208;metal catalyst.

         <title>Z&#8208;Selective Fluoroalkenylation of (Hetero)Aromatic Systems by Iodonium Reagents in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Directed C&#8722;H Activation</title>

Abstract
The direct and catalytic incorporation of fluorine containing molecular motifs into organic compounds resulting high&#8208;value added chemicals represents a rapidly evolving part of synthetic methodologies, thus this area is in the focus of pharmaceutical and agrochemical research. Herein we report a stereoselective procedure for direct fluorovinylation of aromatic and heteroaromatic scaffolds. This methodology development has been realized by palladium&#8208;catalyzed ortho C&#8722;H activation reaction of aniline derivatives featuring the regioselectivity via directing groups such as secondary of tertiary amides, ureas or ketones. The application of non&#8208;symmetrical aryl(fluoroalkenyl)&#8208;iodonium salts as fluoroalkenylating agents allowed mild reaction conditions in general for this transformation. The scope and limitations have been thoroughly investigated and the feasibility has been demonstrated by more than 50 examples.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation of Arylbenzamides with Diaryliodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
By using diaryliodonium salts, a cylization has been accomplished in the synthesis of N&#8208;aryl phenanthridinone derivatives via a cascade of ortho&#8208;arylation and Csp2&#8208;N bond formation in the presence of palladium catalyst. The reaction exhibits a broad compatibility of readily available N&#8208;arylnaphthamides.

         <title>A Radical Chain: Mononuclear &#8220;Gold Only&#8221; Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report an unprecedented reactivity of mononuclear gold catalysts acting as classical catalysts and at the same time as active partners in a radical chain mechanism, whereby gold is the only catalyst. The mechanism of the photo&#8208;induced photosensitizer&#8208;free &#8220;gold only&#8221;&#8208;catalyzed cross coupling was studied in detail &#8208; experimentally and theoretically &#8208; based on the reaction between arylboronic acids and aryldiazonium salts. With a systematic set of stoichiometric experiments under various conditions and analytic methods, we could show that this mechanism is initiated by an aryl radical formed in the presence of blue LEDs and MeOH. This enters the catalytic cycle to oxidize gold(I) to gold(II). Single electron transfer from gold(II) to the aryldiazonium salt then gives the cationic gold(III) complex by formation of an chain&#8208;supporting aryl radical which then is enabled to start a new cycle by oxidation of gold(I) without the need for irradiation. At least every 432 cycles of the radical chain, a new chain&#8208;initiating radical has to restart the radical chain. Eventually, the boronic acid is activated by the BF4&#8208; anion to transmetalate to gold(III), and reductive elimination delivers the desired product.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Gold&#8208;(I) catalysis was used for the intramolecular cyclization of tertiary alcohols with terminal alkynes to form diverse aza&#8208;spirocycles. The reaction was carried out with low catalyst loading under microwave irradiation to give both sulfonylated and acylated spirocyclic nitrogen derivatives. Gram scale spirocyclization was carried out to demonstrate the robustness of the reaction. An intramolecular Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reaction was performed to give several tetracyclic spirocycles. Double bond reduction and selective protecting group manipulation gave spiropiperazine and spiromorpholine derivatives.  These compounds were incorporated into biologically relevant scaffolds to give the first selective spirocyclic inhibitors of LIMK1.</dc:description>

Abstract
An enantioselective synthesis of unnatural pyrazole&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;chiral amino acid derivatives from the asymmetric reaction of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;5&#8208;aminopyrazoles with &#946;,&#947;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;imino esters using a chiral spirocyclic phosphoric acid catalyst was developed. Using the established methodology, various pyrazole&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives with tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenters were obtained in 67&#8211;98% yields and with 73&#8211;99% enantioselectivities. The NH2 functionality in the corresponding products enables further transformations to a chiral thiourea and a lactam.

Abstract
The readily scalable asymmetric synthesis of the chiral chromone derivatives functionalized at position 2 via electrophilic enantioselective olefination of the chromone core with nitroolefins and &#223;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;ketoesters in the presence of simple C2&#8208;symmetric tertiary amine&#8208;squaramide catalyst was developed. The reaction products were obtained in 80&#8211;99% yield with 89&#8211;99%&#8201;ee in 95% EtOH. The absolute configurations of the synthesized chromone derivatives were unambiguously established by transformation of compound (R)&#8208;3&#8201;aa to known methyl (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;phenylpropionate and by the single crystal XRD analysis of compounds (R,S)&#8208;5&#8201;aa and (R,S)&#8208;5&#8201;ab. Catalyst V poorly soluble in common organic solvents could be easily separated from the reaction mixture and reused up to 10 catalytic cycles. Catalytic hydrogenation and esterification reactions of the synthesized compounds were carried out to demonstrate synthetic potential of the developed procedure.

         <title>Recyclable, Immobilized Transition&#8208;Metal Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The use of transition&#8208;metal complexes as photocatalysts have allowed the performance of diverse organic transformations in an outstanding manner, characterized not only by high yields, TOF, and selectivity values, but also by modulating and providing access to novel molecular structures that, without them, would be difficult if not impossible. However, one of the biggest concerns regarding the use of these photocatalysts relies on the difficulties associated with their isolation from reaction media and reutilization once the chemical process ends. The above, besides contaminating reaction products and requiring out tedious purification processes, prompts the inevitable loss of the catalyst, directly affecting its recyclability. In addition, this situation results in negative outcomes from an economic and environmental perspective, since transition&#8208;metal complexes are usually expensive materials, and their unsuccessful recovery could result in leakage into the environment. These drawbacks served as inspiration for the elaboration of the present review focused on the development of novel strategies developed during the last decade for the successful recovery of these species. The strategies summarized herein, whether for homogeneous or heterogeneous systems, are based on the use of thermotropic solvents, changes in the hydrophilic balance of the catalyst, the employment of polymers, copolymers, porous macromolecular structures, and inorganic nanostructures as support of these entities. Moreover, the use of organized and confining media, such as micelles and gels in this context, is also discussed. We hope that this review will motivate the search for new strategies to develop novel catalytic systems, understanding that high performance is based not only on yields but also on recyclability, sustainability, and responsibility to the environment.

Abstract
Herein, Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C4&#8208;selective C&#8722;H allylation and prenylation of indoles by using a weak carbonyl coordination directing group have been reported. By employing 5&#8208;methylene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxan&#8208;2&#8208;ones, 4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolan&#8208;2&#8208;ones and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;butadiene as scalable cross&#8208;coupling partners, these divergent synthesis protocols proceed smoothly under redox&#8208;neutral reaction conditions, delivering various allylated and prenylated indoles in moderate to satisfied yields. This transformation exhibits high functional&#8208;groups compatibility and broad substrate scope. Scale&#8208;up experiment and mechanistic studies were also accomplished.

         <title>From Stoichiometric Reagents to Catalytic Partners: Selenonium Salts as Alkylating Agents for Nucleophilic Displacement Reactions in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The ability of chalcogenium salts to transfer an electrophilic moiety to a given nucleophile is well known. However, up to date, these reagents have been used in stoichiometric quantities, producing a substantial amount of waste as byproducts of the reaction. In this report, we disclose further investigation of selenonium salts as S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) surrogates for the alkylation of nucleophiles in aqueous solutions. Most importantly, we were able to convert the stoichiometric process to a catalytic system employing as little as 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% of selenides to accelerate the reaction between benzyl bromide and other alkylating agents with sodium cyanide in water. Probe experiments including 77Se NMR and HRMS of the reaction mixture have unequivocally shown the presence of the selenonium salt in the reaction mixture.

Abstract
Herein, we report a Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed approach to access the yet unknown heterocyclic motif of thiazolo[3,4&#8208;a]indoles in a one&#8208;pot reaction under very mild conditions. A broad range of thiazolo[3,4&#8208;a]indoles was generated from indole&#8208;2&#8208;methanols and thioketones with 45&#8211;99% yield and good functional group tolerance. The practicality of the process and the synthetic potential of the products were demonstrated with an upscaling experiment and further transformations. Additional control experiments provided mechanistic insights into this cycloaddition.

         <title>Single Electron Transfer&#8208;Induced Selective &#945;&#8208;Oxygenation of Glycine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Modification of amino acids is an important strategy in organic and bioorganic chemistry. In contrast to common side&#8208;chain functionalization, backbone modification is much less explored. Especially glycine units seem to be attractive and versatile since a wide range of functionality can be potentially introduced. We report here oxidative modification of glycinates that are stable and enable further functionalization. Selective glycinate enolate oxidation by TEMPO or a FeCp2PF6/TEMPO reagent combination provides stable alkoxyamines in good to excellent yields. The methodology is expanded to glycine&#8208;containing dipeptides demonstrating selective oxygenation at the glycine unit. The orthogonal reactivity potential of oxygenated glycines for transformation to other amino acid derivatives is explored.

Abstract
A microwave&#8208;assisted, base&#8208;promoted, tandem cyclization reaction strategy has been developed for the synthesis of cyclohepta[b]chromones and spiro cyclohepta[b]chromones. Readily accessible &#947;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;diketones undergo intramolecular cyclization and 7&#8208;endo&#8208;trig carbocyclization to afford various cycloheptane&#8208;annelated chromones in one&#8208;pot reactions. This metal&#8208;free protocol also led to the generation of polycyclic ring with a new C&#8722;C bond and a new C&#8722;O bond.

Abstract
Enantioselective Michael addition of &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds toward nitroalkenes were realized by using an immobilized, N&#8208;terminal&#8208;guanidinylated peptide, H2N&#8722;C(=NH)&#8722;Trp&#8722;Trp&#8722;(Leu&#8722;Leu&#8722;Aib)3&#8722;PEG&#8722;PS&#8208;resin (Aib=2&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid), as catalyst. Viable nucleophiles were acetylacetone, dimethyl malonate, and &#946;&#8208;ketoesters. The electrophiles include the &#946;&#8208;nitrostryrenes with various substituents on the benzene ring and the aliphatic nitroalkenes. Sterically congested &#945;&#8208;ethoxycarbonyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostryrene also successfully reacted. The resin&#8208;supported catalyst could be recycled for five times.

         <title>Asymmetric Addition and Cycloaddition Reactions with Ylidene&#8208;Five&#8208;Membered Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Five&#8208;membered heterocycles bearing an exocyclic double bond have been successfully used as substrates in asymmetric addition and cycloaddition reactions. Ylidene&#8208;heterocycles are attractive substrates due to their high functionalization and the presence of an electrophilic conjugated exocyclic double bound that can participate in nucleophilic addition reactions as well as cycloaddition reactions, which may be triggered by the formation of aromatic intermediates or products in many cases. During the last decades, catalytic methodologies have been developed using ylidene&#8208;heterocycles as substrates in order to synthesize useful optically active heterocyclic derivatives. 4&#8208;Ylidene&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones, isoxazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ones, 2,3&#8208;dioxopyrrolidines, rhodanines, oxazolidindiones, Erlenmeyer&#8208;Ploch azlactones and 5&#8208;ylidene&#8208;thiazolones have been successfully used as substrates in asymmetric reactions. This review collects the powerful research in asymmetric addition and cycloaddition reactions where ylidene&#8208;five&#8208;membered heterocycles have been used.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Methyl Ketones from Allylic Alcohols and Methanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
One&#8208;pot synthesis of &#945;&#8208;methyl ketones starting from 1,3&#8208;diaryl propenols or 1&#8208;aryl propenols and methanol as a C1 source is demonstrated. This one&#8208;pot isomerization&#8208;methylation is catalyzed by commercially available Pd(OAc)2 with H2O as the only by&#8208;product. Mechanistic studies and deuterium labelling experiments indicate the involvement of isomerization of allyl alcohol followed by methylation through a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing pathway in these isomerization&#8208;methylation reactions.

Abstract
Oxazolidinone represents a class of most important five&#8208;membered cyclic carbamates. They are of great significance for modern organic synthesis and are widespread as pharmacologically active compounds. This review summarizes recent advances in the chemistry of 2&#8208;oxazolidinones, with an emphasis on their synthesis, employing different catalytic systems or catalyst&#8208;free conditions, as well as on their ring&#8208;opening transformations through decarboxylative coupling, covering the period from 2010 to early 2021. Detailed mechanistic aspects are highlighted, hoping to help researchers to explore the hidden opportunities for reaction discoveries.

         <title>Dimsyl Anion Enables Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Charge Transfer in Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of Aryl Halides</title>

Abstract
A methodology is reported for visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted synthesis of unsymmetrical chalcogenides enabled by dimsyl anion in the absence of transition&#8208;metals or photoredox catalysts. The cross&#8208;coupling reaction between aryl halides and diaryl dichalcogenides proceeds with electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;poor, and heteroaromatic moieties. Mechanistic investigations using UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations, and control reactions suggest that dimsyl anion forms an electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex capable of absorbing blue light, leading to a charge transfer responsible for generation of aryl radicals from aryl halides. This previously unreported mechanistic pathway may be applied to other light&#8208;induced transformations performed in DMSO in the presence of bases and aryl halides.

         <title>Photocatalytic Atom&#8208;Transfer Radical Addition of Activated Chlorides to Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A protocol for performing atom transfer radical addition of activated alkyl chlorides to alkenes is described. The reaction is promoted by blue light in the presence of an organic photocatalyst (3DPA2FBN), serving to generate free radicals, and a copper complex (IMesCuCl), which facilitates the chlorine transfer step. The reaction works efficiently with fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated &#945;&#8208;chloroesters.

         <title>Regioselective Hydroperoxylation of Aziridines and Epoxides Only with Aqueous Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A catalyst and organic solvent&#8208;free regioselective hydroperoxylation of aziridines and epoxides, including spiroaziridine&#8208; and spiroepoxy oxindoles have been explored with commercially available 50% aq. H2O2. This method provides an access to secondary benzylic &#946;&#8208;hydroperoxy amines and &#8208;alcohols and tertiary 3&#8208;hydroperoxy oxindoles. The protocol is also applicable to the less reactive alkyl aziridines. Furthermore, an acid&#8208;catalyzed Kornblum&#8208;DeLaMare type rearrangement of secondary benzylic hydroperoxide has also been revealed to afford amino&#8208; and hydroxyl ketones.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Domino Cyclization/Phosphorylation of gem&#8208;Dibromoolefins with P(O)H Compounds: Synthesis of Phosphorylated Heteroaromatics</title>

Abstract
We presented a palladium&#8208;catalyzed domino cyclization/phosphorylation of gem&#8208;dibromoolefins, which utilize H&#8208;phosphinates and secondary phosphine oxides as the phosphine sources, respectively. A variety of phosphorylated heteroaromatics were obtained in moderate to good yields with wide functional group compatibility. This one&#8208;pot reaction enables multiple bond&#8208;forming events including C&#8722;X (X=O, N, S) and C&#8722;P bonds using easily available starting materials. Moreover, this protocol can be easily applied to large&#8208;scale preparation and late&#8208;stage functionalization.

Abstract
Ruthenium catalysed denitrogenative transannulation of pyridotriazoles with naphthoquinones provided the transannulated benzo[f]pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indoles derivatives in good to excellent yields. While pyridotriazoles with indoles in presence of PivOH and oxone yield indolizino[3,2&#8208;b]indoles under metal&#8208;free conditions. Quinone annulation proceeds through ruthenium&#8208;carbenoid intermediate while indole annulation may proceed via a diazo&#8208;pyridinium intermediate. Control experiments suggest that both the transformations follow the ionic mechanism.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled, Tunable Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Divergent Trifluoromethylation of Unactivated Cycloalkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract

Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Amino esters and &#947;&#8208;lactams containing &#945;,&#947;&#8208;stereogenic centers are widely used as chiral intermediates in various bioactive compounds, while their efficient synthesis remains a challenge. Herein, an enzymatic cascade reaction involving an ene reductase (ERED) and an imine reductase (IRED) for accessing to &#945;,&#947;&#8208;stereospecific &#947;&#8208;amino esters and &#947;&#8208;lactams from &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;ketoesters has been developed. 21 EREDs and 13 IREDs have been identified with high activity and stereoselectivity toward various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;ketoesters and the corresponding chiral &#947;&#8208;ketoesters, respectively. By employing suitable ERED and IRED, (1S,3S), (1S,3R), (1R,3S), and (1R,3R) stereoisomers of methyl 3&#8208;(cyclopropyl amino) cyclohexane&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylate were obtained as a single stereoisomer in 63&#8211;72% yield, and (3R,5R)&#8208; and (3R,5S)&#8208;1&#8208;cyclopropyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one and 1&#8208;cyclopropyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;dipropylpyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one were also prepared as a single stereoisomer in 60&#8211;65% yields. This study establishes an environmentally friendly enzymatic route for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;amino esters and &#947;&#8208;lactams containing &#945;,&#947;&#8208;stereogenic centers.

         <title>Tailoring the Reactivity of the Langlois Reagent and Styrenes with Cyanoarenes Organophotocatalysts under Visible&#8208;Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The selective one&#8208;step access to fluoroalkylated hexestrol derivatives, nonsteroidal estrogens, is achieved in good to excellent isolated yields under organophotoredox conditions by using the stable and easy to handle Langlois reagent. Furthermore, the challenging selective hydrotrifluoromethylation of styrenes proceeds under mild reaction conditions without the requirement for any additive. We assume that the solvent drives the reaction pathway towards either the reduction or the dimerization of the radical intermediate generated after initial addition of the fluoroalkyl radical to the styrene. The versatility of the developed system is also extended to encompass radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling as exemplified here using cyanopyridine. Mechanistic investigations including luminescence and EPR spectroscopy allow to shed light on the different mechanisms.

Abstract
This report discloses an electrochemical oxidative C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross coupling method for the synthesis of C&#8208;2/C&#8208;3 azolated halo&#8208;indoles/thiophenes under metal catalyst&#8208;free and external chemical oxidant free condition. Hydrogen gas was the only byproduct of this C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The synthetic utility of this electrochemical approach is highlighted by its easy scalabity and compatibility with highly functional indoles and azoles. The retention of halogen on the heterocycles could serve as a useful functional group for future late&#8208;stage modifications.

         <title>Allenamides Playing Domino: A Redox&#8208;Neutral Photocatalytic Synthesis of Functionalized 2&#8208;Aminofurans</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A photoredox catalytic synthesis of functionalized 2&#8208;aminofurans is proposed starting from &#945;&#8208;halo carbonyl substrates and N&#8208;allenamides. The protocol proves to be efficient and sustainable thanks to: i) the use of visible light as green energy source, ii) the redox&#8208;neutral nature of the transformation, allowing to avoid additives and strong oxidants, iii) the mild reaction conditions and the functional groups tolerance, iv) the low photocatalyst loading and the absence of excess reagents, v) the one&#8208;pot formation of three new bonds in a domino sequence. According to our mechanistic hypothesis, the transformation is configured as a double radical&#8208;polar crossover reaction, in which the photocatalyst is excited, oxidized and reduced twice for each molecule of 2&#8208;aminofuran produced. The novelty of the designed synthetic approach also lies in the use of N&#8208;allenamides as substrates, which, after the addition of the first electrophilic radical, preserve a further reactive &#960;&#8208;system, making possible the addition of a second &#945;&#8208;keto radical and enabling the installation of a keto functionality at a remote position. The good yields, the broad scope, and the possibility to further synthetically elaborate the obtained furans make this protocol particularly promising for the construction of useful products.

Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed (3+3) and (3+4) cycloannulations between vinylcyclopropanes and various (hetero)aromatic aldehydes are reported. The use of phosphonate&#8208;substituted vinylcyclopropanes provides access to a variety of bi&#8208; or tricyclic heteroaromatic scaffolds via an allylation/olefination cascade. The nature of the mechanism was investigated by various control experiments.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palladium-catalyzed (3+3) and (3+4) cycloannulations between vinylcyclopropanes and various (hetero)aromatic aldehydes are reported. The use of phosphonate-substituted vinylcyclopropanes provides access to a variety of bi- or tricyclic heteroaromatic scaffolds via an allylation/olefination cascade. The nature of the mechanism was investigated by various control experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Access to Unsymmetrically Substituted Diaryl Gold N&#8208;Acyclic Carbene (NAC) and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) Complexes via the Isonitrile Route</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A variety of unsymmetric diaryl gold N&#8208;acyclic carbene (NAC) complexes was synthesized via the isonitrile route by three different methods: (a) solvent free in a melt, (b) mechanochemically and (c) in THF at room temperature. The latter method can also be used to synthesize unsaturated gold NHC complexes. These methods overall offer access to a broad array of new complexes and remove one of the previous limitations of the isonitrile route to NAC and NHC complexes of gold, namely the inability to react with the less nucleophilic aromatic amines. The new complexes also proved to be successful as pre&#8208;catalysts in the gold&#8208;catalyzed phenol synthesis.

Abstract
An iodine&#8208;catalyzed double [4+2] oxidative annulation of ketones and diamines is described. A multi&#8208;pathway coupled domino strategy has been developed for the synthesis of substituted dimeric pyrazines under metal&#8208;free conditions. One C&#8722;C and four C&#8722;N bonds are formed during this double [4+2] oxidative annulation process from two ketones and two diamines.

The front cover picture, designed by Pavel G. Sergeev and Daria I. Filina, illustrates the comparison between reactivities of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes and styrylmalonates in the Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed formal cycloadditions with conformationally non&#8208;rigid azadienes. On transition from one synthetic analogue to another, the regioselectivity of the addition can change dramatically from the (3+2)&#8208; to the (4+2)&#8208;pathway. The choice of styrylmalonates has been shown to be preferred in these reactions. The (4+2)&#8208;cycloaddition between styrylmalonates and azadienes was optimized to provide access to the diastereoselective synthesis of substituted tetrahydropyridines in high yields. Details can be found in the Research Article by P. G. Sergeev, R. A. Novikov and Y. V. Tomilov. (P. G. Sergeev, R. A. Novikov, Y. V. Tomilov, Adv. Synth.

         <dc:description>









Abstract
We communicate two mild, solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical coupling transformations of CF3 group with nitro compounds into amides or Schiff bases employing Ytterbia as a catalyst. This process proceeds via C&#8722;F bond activation, accompanied with utilisation of Si&#8208;based reductants/oxygen scavengers &#8208; reductants of the nitro group. The scope and limitations of the disclosed methodologies are thoroughly studied. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first example of mechanical energy promoted transformation of the inert CF3 group into other functionalities.

         <title>Iodine Catalyzed C2&#8208;H Formamidation of Quinoline N&#8208;Oxides using Isocyanides: A Metal&#8208;Free Approach</title>

         <dc:description>









Abstract
A molecular iodine catalyzed regioselective insertion of isocyanide into C2&#8208;H of quinoline N&#8208;oxides has been developed. The reaction proceeds through the nucleophilic addition of isocyanide on quinoline N&#8208;oxides followed by rearrangement in presence of iodine. This metal&#8208;free reaction affords rapid access to quinoline 2&#8208;formamides with exceptional functional group tolerance, broad substrate scope and 100% atom&#8208;economy. A library of 33&#8197;N&#8208;(2&#8208;quinolinyl)formamides are synthesized, which may find applications in pharmaceuticals and synthetic chemistry.

Abstract
3&#8208;Alkylated coumarins have many applications in medicinal chemistry, however, methods access to such structures are still limited. Herein, we report a site&#8208;selective photocatalytic deaminative alkylation of coumarins utilizing pyridinium&#8208;activated aliphatic primary amines as alkylation reagents. The protocol was highlighted by its mild reaction conditions, operational simplicity, and broad functional group compatibility. Moreover, this strategy enables late&#8208;stage modification of some pharmaceuticals and natural products, thus providing an appealing approach to valuable molecules in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Copper Catalyzed Synthesis of 3&#8208;Nitro&#8208;Quinolines from Nitro&#8208;Olefins and Anthranils: Its Application in the Synthesis of Quindoline</title>

Abstract
Copper&#8208;catalyzed routes have been achieved for the synthesis of 3&#8208;nitroquinolines from readily available nitroolefins and anthranils. This reaction proceeds via the [4+2] cycloaddition between anthranils and nitro&#8208;styrenes under mild reaction conditions to obtain biologically important heterocycles. A wide range of diversely substituted nitro&#8208;olefins and anthranils are successfully employed in this reaction to access a series of 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;quinolines in 81&#8211;93% yields. The synthetic utility of the present methodology is also illustrated in this manuscript.
