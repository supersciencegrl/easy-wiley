         <title>&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Succinimides Bearing All&#8208;carbon Quaternary Centers Using a Chiral Phenanthroline&#8208;Pd Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of chiral succinimides bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters at the C3 position is important, but remains challenging. The present work demonstrates conjugate additions with catalysis by a chiral 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;Pd complex (&lt;b&gt;L1&#8208;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;PdCl&lt;/b&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that exhibit complete regioselectivity with a high degree of enantioselectivity. These reactions afford chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted succinimides having all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters with 40%&#8722;99% ee. Importantly, chiral 3,3&#8208;diaryl succinimides could also be obtained with 35%&#8722;98% and 40%&#8722;99% ee. Moreover, the present &lt;b&gt;L1&#8208;PdCl&lt;/b&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition could be performed on the gram scale and was also used to introduce such stereocenters into bioactive molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Formal Insertion of a Metal Carbene Complex into a &#963;&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Carbon bond. Gold&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of 3H&#8208;indoles.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a formal insertion of a metal carbene complex in a single carbon&#8208;carbon bond. This behavior occurs with the participation of an alpha&#8208;imino gold carbene complex, generated from benzofused triazapentalenes or, in a one&#8208;pot procedure, from their 1&#8208;propargyl&#8208;1H&#8208;bentrotriazole precursors, and gold&#8208;catalytically activated ynamides. As the result, 3H&#8208;indole derivatives were obtained, with formation of a quaternary center. A computational analysis carried out on the reaction mechanism indicates that the bulkiness of the gold ligand plays a key role forcing a conformation, which includes aromatic interactions, that favors the approximation of the carbenic carbon to the reactive site. In addition, a negative crossover experiment rules out a cationic arene migration pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Cyanopyridazine Derivatives as Photoredox Catalysts and Evaluation of their Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An array of cyanopyridazine derivatives have been developed through a sequence of (3+3) cycloaddition/oxidative aromatization/derivatization steps. Investigation of the physicochemical properties of these compounds shows that four have interesting fluorescence properties and have the potential to be developed into bimodal photoredox catalysts. One has been confirmed to be an photoredox catalyst in the reactions of N&#8208;aryl&#8208; tetrahydroisoquinolines with phosphite, nitromethane, malonitrile and sodium thiocyanate, led to 22%&#8211;95% yields. The catalyst capabilities remain with recyclable using under the reaction conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of Difluorocyclopropanes via Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated [1+2] Cycloaddition of Diazo Esters with gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes and Evaluation of their Antifungal Activity</title>

Abstract
In this work, we reported a method for construction of difluorocyclopropanes through visible light&#8208;promoted [1+2] cycloaddition reaction of aryl diazo esters with gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, encompasses a wide range of substrates (36 examples), exhibits good tolerance to various substituents, and demonstrates a diastereoselectivity of &gt;20:1. Additionally, antifungal activity evaluation revealed that these derivatives exhibited certain activity, the EC50 values for the products towards Botrytis cinerea and Rhizoctonia solani were measured to be 1.51 and 1.36&#8197;&#956;M, respectively, which are significantly lower than those of commercial fungicides Hymexazol and Azoxystrobin. This work not only provides an efficient method for the synthesis of difluorocyclopropanyl derivatives, but reveals their potential applications in fungicide creation.

Abstract
The transmetalation triggered rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation and tandem annulation of 2&#8208;biphenylboronic acids with sulfoxonium ylides or iodonium ylides has been developed. Various products of phenanthrenes were constructed under redox&#8208;neutral conditions in 34&#8211;86% yields. Several mechanism exploration experiments and derivatization reactions were conducted in sequence to gain a deeper understanding of the process and the potential of this transformation. It offers an alternative approach for the synthesis of phenanthrene derivatives.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Production of Vanillin from Capsaicinoids through a Retrosynthetic Enzyme Cascade</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Vanillin is a key organoleptic component in vanilla, one of the most important natural flavors in the industry. The limited supply of natural vanilla, extracted from cured vanilla beans, elevates the commercial value of &#8216;natural&#8217;&#8208;labeled vanillin, producible by microbial conversion of natural precursors such as ferulic acid, eugenol, isoeugenol, lignin, and glucose. However, cellular toxicity and undesirable overoxidation of vanillin remain challenges to the microbial methods. Here, we developed a one&#8208;pot enzymatic conversion of capsaicinoids to vanillin by retracing the biosynthetic pathway found in Capsicum plants. The enzyme cascade consists of the hydrolysis of capsaicinoids by immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB) and the oxidative deamination of the resulting vanillylamine by &#969;&#8208;transaminase from Paracoccus denitrificans (PDTA). Process optimization of individual enzyme reactions was conducted on an analytical scale, enabling&gt;95% reaction yield of vanillin from capsaicinoids in the one&#8208;pot cascade reaction without undesirable accumulation of the oxidation byproduct and the inhibitory reaction intermediate, i.&#8201;e., vanillic acid and vanillylamine, respectively. To verify practical applicability, we performed a preparative&#8208;scale reaction starting with 1.75&#8197;g capsaicinoids and 2.75&#8197;g sodium pyruvate at 10&#8197;mg/mL CALB and 3&#8197;&#956;M PDTA, leading to an 81% reaction yield and a 57% isolation yield. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of one&#8208;pot production of vanillin from capsaicinoids, which might pave the way for cost&#8208;effective and sustainable access to natural&#8208;labeled vanillin from a renewable feedstock readily available from Capsicum fruits.

The enzyme cascade consists of the hydrolysis of capsaicinoids by immobilized lipase B from &lt;i&gt;Candida antarctica&lt;/i&gt; (CALB) and the oxidative deamination of the resulting vanillylamine by &#969;-transaminase from &lt;i&gt;Paracoccus denitrificans&lt;/i&gt; (PDTA). Process optimization of individual enzyme reactions was conducted on an analytical scale, enabling&amp;gt;95% reaction yield of vanillin from capsaicinoids in the one-pot cascade reaction without undesirable accumulation of the oxidation byproduct and the inhibitory reaction intermediate, i.&#8201;e., vanillic acid and vanillylamine, respectively. To verify practical applicability, we performed a preparative-scale reaction starting with 1.75&#8197;g capsaicinoids and 2.75&#8197;g sodium pyruvate at 10&#8197;mg/mL CALB and 3&#8197;&#956;M PDTA, leading to an 81% reaction yield and a 57% isolation yield. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of one-pot production of vanillin from capsaicinoids, which might pave the way for cost-effective and sustainable access to natural-labeled vanillin from a renewable feedstock readily available from &lt;i&gt;Capsicum&lt;/i&gt; fruits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed and solvent&#8208;switched [3+2]&#8208;spiroannulation and [4+n] (n=1, 2, 3) annulations of 2&#8208;aryl quinazolinone or 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophthalazine&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones with ynones or alkynyl alcohol or 1,3&#8208;diynes under mild reaction conditions have been analyzed. These reactions take place in the presence of the appropriate solvent and features a redox&#8208;neutral pathway. Ynone serves as an &#8216;atypical one&#8208;carbon unit&#8217; in [4+1] annulation and generates a tetrasubstituted carbon center bearing diverse heterocycles through [3+2] and [4+1] annulation strategies. Post transformations of the synthesized spiro&#8208;products augments the potential of the developed methodology.

         <title>An Electrochemically Driven Oxidative Strecker Reaction via the Unique Hydroxymethyl Radical Intermediate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alfa&#8208;aminonitriles are versatile and valuable intermediates in pharmaceutical chemistry. Until now, the Strecker reaction has remained the most efficient tool for synthesizing these compounds. Nevertheless, it is only applicable to aldehyde/imine systems and generally needs metal catalysts and external additives. Herein, an electrochemically driven oxidative Strecker reaction strategy was designed and accomplished for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles with alcohol as the alkylation reagent. The strategy is environmentally friendly, scalable, and compatible with a wide range of functional groups, encompassing aromatic primary amines, secondary amines, and even alkylamine. Utilizing the merits of electro&#8208;organic synthesis, it can be readily magnified from milligram to gram scale by simply adjusting the electrochemical parameters. Emphasized, it testified that a unique intermediate CH2*OH well&#8208;established in fuel cells was involved in the reaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A variety of functionalized 3&#8208;arylazoindoles were prepared in good to excellent yields through an iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H azolation of 2&#8208;substituted indoles with arylhydrazines under mild reaction conditions. The reaction underwent an initial TBN&#8208;mediated nitrosation, 1,5&#8208;hydrogen migration, intramolecular condensation, and 1,5&#8208;hydrogen migration over four steps in one pot. A paracyclophane&#8208;derived 3&#8208;phenylazoindole could be prepared in 25% yield over three steps and some prepared 3&#8208;arylazoindoles showed a different fluorescence emission wavelength and existed obvious pH conditions response. The present method highlights broad substrate scope of easily available starting materials, wide range of functional group compatibility, gram scalable preparations, high atom economy, avoidance of unstable and explosive azolation reagents, and simple purification operations by extraction, washing, and recrystallization without flash column chromatography.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>P&#8208;stereogenic benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles is a privileged skeleton due to their outstanding catalytic properties and bioactivities. However, their enantioselective synthesis is still underdeveloped. Here we demonstrate the use of easily accessible racemic H&#8211;P(O) compounds as starting materials and commercial chiral N1, N2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diphenylethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine ligand in combination with Cu(I) catalysts to enable an attractive dynamic kinetic C(sp2)&#8211;P cross&#8208;coupling reaction.

         <title>Catalytic Orthogonal Glycosylation Enabled by Enynal&#8208;Derived Copper Carbenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Herein, we present an approach for catalytic orthogonal glycosylation utilizing earth&#8208;abundant copper carbenes. This method operates under mild conditions and employs readily accessible starting materials, including benchtop stable enynal&#8208;derived glycosyl donors, synthesized at the gram scale. The reaction accommodates a variety of glycosyl acceptors, including primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols. The enynal&#8208;derived copper carbenes exhibit remarkable reactivity and selectivity, allowing for the formation of glycosidic linkages with different protecting groups and stereochemical patterns. This approach provides access to both 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208; and &#8208;trans&#8208;glycosidic linkages. The product stereoselectivity is independent of the anomeric configuration of the glycosyl donor, which also has orthogonal reactivity to widely used alkynes and thioglycoside donors. An iterative synthesis of a trisaccharide further demonstrates the application of this orthogonal reactivity.

Abstract
An intermolecular addition reaction involving an unconventional combination of a diarylmethyl anion and an electrophile, which is mediated by the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis, was developed. Diarylmethyl anions having a benzofuran moiety were generated through the rearrangement with the aid of a catalytic amount of phosphazene base P2&#8208;tBu. The resulting carbanion intermediates were trapped by various electrophiles, such as &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, aryl aldehydes, &#945;&#8208;ketoesters, and N&#8208;Boc imines, providing the corresponding diarylalkane derivatives in good yields.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for the radical functionalization of 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazoles using alkyl halides as precursors of radicals is described. The reaction efficiency is determined by potassium tetrafluoropyridinyl thiolate additive, which plays dual role. First, the thiolate converts alkyl halides into more reactive fluorinated aryl sulfides, which undergo photoredox activation of the C&#8208;S bond. Second, the thiolate decreases the unproductive loss of alkyl radicals by converting them back to the sulfides.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of quinine&#8208;inspired antimalarials by Ni&#8208;catalysed cross electrophile coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the efficient synthesis of novel dehydroxyquinines by arylation of quincorine bromide using Ni&#8208;catalysed cross electrophile coupling. The method demonstrates robust compatibility with (hetero)aryl bromides bearing diverse functional groups. Oxidation at C&#8208;9 of the dehydroxyquinines expediently provided quinine&#8208;inspired pseudo&#8208;natural products (&#8216;quinalogs&#8217;). Investigation of the compound collection against Plasmodium falciparum revealed a new insight into the structure activity relationship of quinine. Analogs bearing specifically functionalised pyridines, in place of the 6&#8208;methoxyquinoline ring of quinine, retained activity at the same order of magnitude, albeit not exceeding the activity of the natural product. This synthetic strategy conveniently enables iteration of the aromatic component of quinine for the first time, and holds promise for the development of effective new antimalarials.

         <dc:description>2&#8208;Exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones are useful synthetic intermediates with a unique indole scaffold. However, their synthesis has not yet been reported owing to their reactivity and instability. In this study, a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed method for generating 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivatives via the 5&#8208;&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;dig&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;selective cyclization of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;amino)phenyl alkynyl ketones with an alkyne terminus was developed. The subsequent pseudo&#8208;dimerization of the generated 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones and their [4+2] cyclization reactions with 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes afforded spiropseudoindoxyl and pyranoindole derivatives, respectively, in 21% to quantitative yields. Density functional theory calculations of the gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization provided insights into the 5&#8208;&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;dig&lt;/i&gt; selectivity. Furthermore, the reactive 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one was isolated for the first time based on the results from &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopic monitoring. The isolated product was applied to various transformations. Our synthesis method promotes the development of bioactive agents and functional materials with complex cyclic structures.</dc:description>

In this study, a gold(I)-catalyzed method for generating 2-exomethylene indolin-3-one derivatives via the 5-&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;exo&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;dig&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;-selective cyclization of 2-(2-amino)phenyl alkynyl ketones with an alkyne terminus was developed. The subsequent pseudo-dimerization of the generated 2-exomethylene indolin-3-ones and their [4+2] cyclization reactions with 1,1-disubstituted alkenes afforded spiropseudoindoxyl and pyranoindole derivatives, respectively, in 21% to quantitative yields. Density functional theory calculations of the gold-catalyzed cyclization provided insights into the 5-&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;exo&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;dig&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; selectivity. Furthermore, the reactive 2-exomethylene indolin-3-one was isolated for the first time based on the results from &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;H NMR spectroscopic monitoring. The isolated product was applied to various transformations. Our synthesis method promotes the development of bioactive agents and functional materials with complex cyclic structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first site&#8208;selective electrochemical alkylation of tropones is realized by reacting 2&#8208;acetoxytropones and redox&#8208;active&#8208;esters. The electroreductive protocol enables the preparation of a wide range (27 examples) of mono&#8208; and disubstituted tropones in high yields (up to 71%) and very mild conditions. Dedicated voltammetric measurements served for the identification of 2&#8208;acetoxytropones as a class of valuable trapping agents of nucleophilic radical species and shed light on the whole mechanistic profile. Wide tolerance towards conventional functional groups (27 examples) and application to late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive compounds, emphasize the synthetic impact of the present methodology</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroacylation of unsaturated substrates with aldehydes involving the formyl C(sp2)&#8211;H bond activation provides an expedient and efficient access to the carbonyl compounds such as ketones and esters, which are a class of important scaffolds in natural products and in drug development. Recently, extensive attention has been paid to the hydroacylation reactions of the components containing an alkenyl moiety that can trigger a regioselective transformation in the presence of a transition metal catalyst. In this review, we summarize the constructive endeavors in rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed (formal) hydroacylation reactions from 2018, and the plausible pathway is also dissected to offer some insights into the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A regioselective electrochemical oxytrifluoromethylation of endocyclic enamides is reported. The 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization proceeds under mild conditions in an undivided cell and employs the inexpensive bench stable Langlois&#8217; reagent. This novel environmentally friendly multicomponent strategy gives access to a wide range of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;substituted amines by means of various alcohols as nucleophiles in high yield and with good functional group tolerance. In addition, an electrochemically induced C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of enamides has been developed. A practical continuous flow protocol using a commercial flow cell was also developed with improved reaction performance and efficiency over traditional batch versions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds are synthesized from 3&#8208;propargyl indoles, obtained by direct propargylation of indoles, via a gold&#8208;catalyzed tandem oxidation&#8211;1,2&#8208;indole migration reaction in the presence of pyridine N&#8208;oxides. Fine&#8208;tuning of the catalyst and oxidant enables the reaction of 3&#8208;propargyl indoles bearing different substituents. The order of oxidation and indole migration is determined by the terminal or internal nature of the alkyne moiety. In addition, the process can be coupled with additional reactions, allowing a rapid increase in molecular complexity or the design of more elaborated tandem reactions. In this sense, indole derivatives bearing an alkenyl substituent at the alkyne position evolve through a gold&#8208;catalyzed tandem oxidation&#8211;1,2&#8208;indole migration&#8211;Nazarov cyclization producing &#945;&#8208;indolyl cyclopentenones.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruppert&#8208;Prakash Reagent (TMSCF3)&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Esterification of Weinreb Amides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward TMSCF3&#8208;catalyzed conversion of Weinreb amides into esters through the treatment with sodium alkoxides is reported. The procedure documents a genuine selectivity for the esterification of primary alcohols with Weinreb amides featuring diverse substitution pattern. The constitutive N&#8208;methoxy fragment of these acylating agents is responsible for the unique reactivity they display, thus enabling to explore alkoxides as competent nucleophilic elements.  The protocol is compatible with the fully transfer of stereochemical information embodied in the starting material, as well as, guarantees the preparation of pharmaceuticals. Mechanistic investigations revealed that under the adopted reaction conditions (NaOR, R primary) TMSCF3 does not release the trifluoromethyl (CF3&#8208;) anion &#8211; as occurs with tertiary alkoxides &#8208; but rather it catalytically activates the amidic bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Ball&#8208;milling to access dinucleoside polyphosphates and analogues</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dinucleoside 5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;polyphosphates (NpnNs) play essential roles in various biological processes. Access to these high value&#8208;added compounds, while avoiding the many drawbacks of solution phase synthesis, is a challenge that has been overcome thanks to mechanochemistry. A straightforward solid&#8208;state synthesis based on activation of phosphate or pyrophosphate sodium salts to their diimidazolides, followed by coupling with commercially available nucleotides, under air conditions, gave symmetrical NpnNs. The scope ranged from Np3Ns to highly challenging Np6Ns. The methodology has also been implemented using medronic acid and imidodiphosphate to obtain NpnNs analogues, some of which are unprecedented.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox Radical Cascade Cyclization of 2&#8208;Alkynylarylnitriles in Visible Light: Direct Access to 3&#8208;Amino&#8208;1&#8208;indenones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photoinduced direct synthesis of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;indenones via radical cascade cyclization strategy is demonstrated. The methodology involves a domino reaction between 2&#8208;alkynylarylnitrile and N&#8208;aminopyridinium salt and captures the reactivity of in&#8208;situ generated nitrogen&#8208;centered radical (NCR) in visible light. Multiple bond&#8208;forming events including C&#8208;N, C&#8208;C, and C&#8208;O take place sequentially on 2&#8208;alkynylarylnitrile enabling construction of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;indenone core at room temperature in 35&#8208;76% yields. A preliminary biological screening of synthesized compounds is indicative of their potent anti&#8208;cancer property.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to tetrahydrothiopyrano[2,3&#8208;b]indole derivatives via zinc&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3 + 3] annulation of indoline&#8208;2&#8208;thiones with yne&#8208;enones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein an enantioselective [3 + 3] annulation of indoline&#8208;2&#8208;thiones with yne&#8722;enones by chiral dinuclear zinc catalysts via a Br&#248;nsted base and Lewis acid cooperative activation. This transformation proceeded through sequential conjugate addition, allenyl ketone formation and intramolecular sulfa&#8208;Michael 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization. A range of enantioenriched tetrahydrothiopyrano[2,3&#8208;b]indole derivatives bearing an exocyclic double bond were obtained in moderate yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 20 : 1 dr, 20:1 Z/E ratio and 95% ee). Late&#8208;stage functionalization, large&#8208;scale experiment and further derivatizations were also explored.</dc:description>

         <title>A solely&#8208;Fe&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira&#8208;type coupling of non&#8208;activated secondary alkyl iodides with terminal alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An iron&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling of non&#8208;activated secondary alkyl iodides with terminal alkynes is described. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions in N&#8208;MethylPyrrolidone without auxiliary ligand or co&#8208;catalyst. This procedure allowed the obtention of 28 coupling products. Moreover, slow addition of LiHMDS base allows to achieve up to 89% yields. This method enables the conversion of non&#8208;activated alkyl iodides in a Fe&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling, which was so far not achievable with iron catalysts. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest the implication of a key single electron transfer in the catalytic process.</dc:description>

         <title>Recyclable Iridium Catalyst Supported on Porous Organic Polymer for Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Silylation: Synthesis of Ring&#8208;Fused Oxasilacycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct conversion of specific C&#8211;H bonds to C&#8211;Si bonds in alkanes or aromatics via catalytic methods has attracted growing research interest. Herein, we report the preparation of a new iridium catalyst supported on a naphthyridine&#8208;based porous organic polymer and its successful application in the dehydrogenative silylation of 2&#8208;arylphenols or alcohol and hydrosilanes to access ring&#8208;fused oxasilacycles. The synthetic method exhibits broad substrate scope and good functional group compatibility while avoiding the use of hydrogen acceptors. In addition, this organic polymer supported iridium catalyst could be easily recovered from the reaction system and reused for at least seven times without apparent deactivation. This research provides new insights for the further design of heterogeneous nanocatalysts and contributes to the synthesis of silicon&#8208;substituted functional molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Organophotocatalytic Carbamoylation of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Carbonates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and modification of structures containing the amide functionality play a significant role in the development of pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds. While conventional amidation strategies primarily relies on C&#8208;N bond formation, the strategic integration of photoredox catalysis for synthesizing these compounds through C&#8208;C bond formation is in accordance with the principles of green chemistry and sustainability. Herein, we demonstrate that carbamoyl radicals generated through an organophotocatalytic protocol from 4&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;dihydropyridines (carbamoyl&#8208;DHPs) can be incorporated into Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) carbonates, affording a range of polyfunctionalized scaffolds. Reaction monitoring experiments, scale&#8208;up, reuse of the organophotocatalyst, and the hydrogenation of the succinamic ester&#180;s alkene moiety was also conducted, in order to showcase the mechanistic features and the robustiness of this new photochemical protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Synthesis of Atropoisomers via Non&#8208;canonical Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction stands as a powerful synthetic tool for C&#8208;H functionalization of aromatic feedstocks, which is conventionally realized through electrophilic alkylation and acylation. The burgeoning interests in axially chiral compounds across diverse fields have spurred extensive exploration of this classic transformation for catalytic atroposelective synthesis. Consequently, the past decade has witnessed the rapid expansion of various non&#8208;canonical Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions, including electrophilic arylation, alkenylation, halogenation, sulfenylation, and amination of aryl C&#8208;H bonds, thereby delving into new chemical spaces. A range of catalytic atroposelective synthetic methods have been devised for these significant arene C&#8208;H functionalization. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the cutting&#8208;edge catalytic synthesis of atropoisomers through non&#8208;canonical Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions, categorized into three parts based on the type of bond formation on the aromatics: C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8208;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bond formations, C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8208;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) bond formations and C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8208;heteroatom bond formations. The richness of electrophiles and the modulation of atroposelectivity by diverse chiral organocatalysts, particularly chiral Br&#248;nsted acids, are elucidated. We anticipate that the repertoire of asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction will continue to flourish and to be demonstrated in not only scientific researches but also industrial organic synthesis.</dc:description>

S, Se) Bond Formation of Aryl Halides
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl halides are one of the most important chemical feedstocks in pharmaceuticals due to its easy accessibility, inexpensiveness, and widely utilized as aryl radical precursors in organic synthetic chemistry. Conventionally, the stoichiometric reagents such as AIBN/n&#8208;Bu3SnH were used for generation of aryl radical from aryl halides, and suffered from requirement of toxic radical initiators, high temperature and thus, the development of simple, mild strategies for the generation of aryl radical from aryl halides are highly desirable. Recently, visible light 	mediated strategies received considerable attention, allowing the generation of aryl radical from aryl halides under mild reaction conditions. The present review described the recent breakthroughs and advancements in visible light mediated photocatalyst&#8208;free C&#8208;B/C/O/P/Se/S bond formation of aryl halides.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances and Strategies towards Synthesis of Indolyl and Tryptophan&#8208;C&#8208;Glycoside Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, C&#8208;glycosidic bonds have emerged as pivotal elementary units present in many naturally occurring alkaloids as well as in pharmaceutically active molecules. Because of the stability and great utility of C&#8208;glycosides, synthetic approaches en route to the C&#8208;C bond formation have gradually become a center of attraction in carbohydrate chemistry. Towards these researches, C&#8208;glycosylation with heteroaryl moieties like indole, and tryptophan can remarkably expand the functional and structural evolution, which has great value for medicinal chemists and chemical biologists. The indolyl and tryptophan&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides have unique structures and biological activities that have attracted a number of synthetic studies. Therefore, these motifs have possessed an extensive interest in the direction of efficient synthesis. Herein, this review systematically summarizes the classical approaches to C&#8208;heteroaryl glycosides mainly focusing on indole and tryptophan synthesis. Furthermore, highlighted the recently developed metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H functionalization and photoinduced cross&#8208;coupling strategies that aim to control the regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity of the reaction in carbohydrate chemistry. 	In view of reaction type, mechanism, and status, this review will cover the synthesis of indole and tryptophan C&#8208;heteroaryl glycosides with diverse regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity from four perspectives which include a) conventional approach, b) heterocyclization and C&#8208;glycosylation sequence, c) metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H functionalization, and d) photoinduced cross&#8208;coupling.

         <dc:description>We described a base&#8208;promoted O&#8208;arylation of N3&#8208;hydroxyl quinazolinones with diaryliodonium salts and sequential BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and visible light&#8208;controlled [3,3]&#8208; or [1,3]&#8208;rearrangements of quinazolinone N&#8208;O aryl moieties to prepare a variety of 2&#8208;(quinazolin&#8208;4&#8208;yloxy)phenols and atropisomeric 3&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)quinazolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones in 44%&#8208;75% yields and 28%&#8208;70% yields, respectively. Mechanistic studies showed that HBF4 generated in situ from BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and water served as the catalyst in this process and aryloxyquinazolinium salts are vital intermediates promoting the [3,3]&#8208; or [1,3]&#8208;rearrangements. The N&#8208;O aryl moieties of aryloxyquinazolinium salts were found to undergo solely [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement with heating whereas [1,3]&#8208;rearrangement occurred via a radical process under irradiation of visible light.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of 3,4&#8208;Dihydroquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones via Organocatalytic [4+2]&#8208;Cyclization of 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes with Azlactones</title>

         <dc:description>Dihydroquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones, recognized for their significant bioactive properties, feature a unique six&#8208;membered structure with nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. A breakthrough method has been developed to synthesize enantioenriched 3,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives. This innovative approach utilizes an asymmetric [4+2]&#8208;cyclization process, combining 2&#8208;amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes with azlactones, and is facilitated by a bifunctional squaramide&#8208;based organocatalyst. This innovative approach has enabled the creation of novel chiral 3,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones with complex structures, including chiral quaternary centers. The process is remarkably efficient, delivering high yields (up to 91%), excellent enantiomeric excess (up to 97% ee), and superior diastereoselectivity (up to 19:1 dr).</dc:description>

         <title>Selective C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization of Unprotected Indoles by Donor&#8208;Acceptor Carbene Insertion</title>

Abstract
Copper catalysts containing alkoxydiaminophosphine (ADAP) ligand catalyze the selective C3&#8722;H functionalization of unprotected indoles upon carbene transfer from donor&#8208;acceptor diazo compounds, the N&#8722;H bond remaining unaltered during the transformation. Mechanistic studies, including DFT calculations, allows proposing the existence of two competitive pathways, none of them occurring through the formation of cyclopropane intermediates, at variance with previously reported systems.

Abstract
This work describes the palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective C8&#8208;H olefination of 1&#8208;naphthamides. Interestingly, naphthamide fused lactam 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[de]isoquinolin&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives were also synthesized in the case of a particular class of napthamides. This protocol was found well compatible with a diverse range of acrylates and styrenes leading to product formation in good yields along with a wide functional group tolerance. The developed strategy was further applied to the synthesis of different drug derivatives.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Aryliminophosphoranes in Continuous Flow</title>

Abstract
A practical electrochemical method for synthesizing aryliminophosphoranes from widely available nitro(hetero)arenes in a continuous&#8208;flow system is presented. The utilization of flow technology offers several advantages to our approach, including the elimination of the need for a supporting electrolyte and enhanced scalability. Our method demonstrates good tolerance towards various functional groups, with electron&#8208;deficient nitroarenes being particularly suitable for this strategy. In addition, we have demonstrated the versatility of aryliminophosphoranes as intermediates in synthesizing anilines, amines, and amides. To further enhance the utility of our approach, we have developed a telescoped method that utilizes a tube&#8208;in&#8208;tube setup for the in&#8208;situ production of isocyanates.

Abstract
In the present study, for the first time environmentally friendly deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are used as reaction media to perform an efficient, simple and straightforward photocatalytic amide synthesis at room temperature using thioacids and amines. This method features mild conditions, a broad substrate scope, high yields (&#8804;99%) under ambient conditions with air and moisture tolerance. Moreover, the applied operationally mild reaction conditions tolerate the presence of several different functional group substituents on the amine counterpart. Finally, the developed approach allows the recycling of the reaction medium and catalyst for at least three consecutive cycles without a significant decrease in the reaction yield.

Abstract
Chiral 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;arylbut&#8208;3&#8208;enoic acid derivatives are important precursors for the synthesis of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such as enalapril, lisinopril, cilapril or benazepril. In this work, we take advantage of the unexplored promiscuous ketoreductase activity of &#916;1&#8208;piperidine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate/&#916;1&#8208;pyrroline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate reductase from Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DSM 50315 (DpkAPsyrin) for the synthesis of (S,E)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;arylbut&#8208;3&#8208;enoic acids. The strategy was designed as an enzymatic cascade comprising an aldol condensation between pyruvate with aryl aldehydes, catalyzed by the trans&#8208;o&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene pyruvate hydratase&#8208;aldolase from Pseudomonas putida (HBPAPputida), for the construction of carbon scaffold, and an ensuing asymmetric reduction of the carbonyl group catalyzed by DpkAPsyrin. The enzymatic cascade provided quantitative conversions, with global isolated yields between 57&#8211;85%. A total of nine structurally diverse (S,E)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;arylbut&#8208;3&#8208;enoic acids were prepared in ee between 87&#8211;99%.

Abstract
A base&#8208;promoted net&#8208;[3+2] cycloaddition of nitriles and 1&#8208;arylpropynes for the synthesis of pyrroles is described. The developed method provides convenient access to various 2,5&#8208;disubstituted or 2,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted pyrroles in 40% to 96% yields (32 examples). Among methods for the synthesis of pyrroles, the protocol presented here stands out for its convenience and atom&#8208;economy.

Abstract
A dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation, involving the generation of four stereogenic centers with a well&#8208;defined configuration, occurs in the cyclocondensation of diastereomeric mixtures of 2&#8208;oxocyclohexanepropionic acid racemates 6 with (1S,2R)&#8208;cis&#8208;aminoindanol: two major tetracyclic lactams, 7&#8201;a and 7&#8201;b, that differ in the configuration of the four stereocenters on the decahydroquinoline moiety were obtained. From the above lactams, the removal of the chiral auxiliary, the introduction of a 2&#8208;piperidone ring, and the closure of the diazine ring complete the first enantioselective total synthesis of the Myrioneuron alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;schoberine B and its enantiomer (+)&#8208;schoberine B.

Abstract
We report the Ni&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;allenynes. Substrates containing terminal alkynes afford cyclopentene derivatives, whereas internal alkynes lead to the formation of two consecutive C&#8722;C bonds to give fused 5&#8211;5 bicyclic compounds. The reaction shows a wide scope. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies suggest a Ni(0)&#8722;Ni(II) catalytic cycle. The reaction starts with an oxidative cyclometallation followed by a &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination. The trans arrangement of alkenyl and hydride ligands is key to allow formation of the second carbocycle.

Abstract
The BF3&#8901;OEt2&#8208;catalyzed reaction of azulene with N&#8208;protected aziridines represents a general, efficient (up to 91% yield) and regioselective approach to phenethylamine&#8208;azulene conjugates. Stereochemical studies and DFT calculations lend support to a concerted SN2&#8208;type mechanism governing the ring&#8208;opening of the aziridine.

         <title>Domino Reactions with Dicyanoalkenes and Fluorinated Conjugated Sulfinyl Imines. A Convenient Strategy for the Generation of Structural Diversity</title>

Abstract
Dicyanoalkenes are versatile reagents in organic synthesis and they have been extensively used in a wide variety of organic transformations. However, their reactivity towards fluorinated imines remained almost unnoticed. The divergent reactivity of fluorinated conjugated sulfinyl imines with dicyanoalkenes is described herein. On the one hand, when tert&#8208;butyl sulfinyl imines were employed, a cycloaromatization cascade process took place preferentially, rendering valuable trifluoromethyl arenes. On the other hand, the reaction with p&#8208;tolyl sulfinyl imines mainly led to a complex tetracyclic skeleton, involving an azetidinimine rearrangement of a reaction intermediate. Finally, when 1&#8208;indanone&#8208;derived dicyanoalkenes were employed, the aromatization process was interrupted, rendering a new family of diene derivatives. Theoretical calculations were performed in order to shed light on the mechanistic outcome of this transformation.

On the one hand, when &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl sulfinyl imines were employed, a cycloaromatization cascade process took place preferentially, rendering valuable trifluoromethyl arenes. On the other hand, the reaction with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-tolyl sulfinyl imines mainly led to a complex tetracyclic skeleton, involving an azetidinimine rearrangement of a reaction intermediate. Finally, when 1-indanone-derived dicyanoalkenes were employed, the aromatization process was interrupted, rendering a new family of diene derivatives. Theoretical calculations were performed in order to shed light on the mechanistic outcome of this transformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Photoredox Catalysis with Vanadium Complexes in Low Oxidation State: Diastereoselective Pinacol Coupling</title>

Abstract
Dual photoredox catalysis is modifying the approach to sustainable metal catalysis based on metals in low oxidation state, as the use of stoichiometric metal as reductants are avoided. In this study, we showcase the potential use of vanadium in a dual photoredox process, allowing us to effectively control the formation of V(II) and its corresponding chemical reactions. A diastereoselective pinacol coupling with aromatic aldehydes is described. The process shows broad scope, and interestingly, unprotected salicylic aldehydes are compatible with the reaction protocol. Additionally, among all the ligands investigated we found that inexpensive bipyridines control the diastereoselection of the reaction favoring the d,l chiral compound (dr&gt;20:1 for most of the aldehydes investigated). To promote the reaction and avoid an unproductive and not stereoselective radical coupling of the generated ketyl radical, the use of [DMQA]+, a stable organic dye, was found crucial. Furthermore, this dye possesses the remarkable capability of efficiently capturing light in the red segment of the visible spectrum, effectively raising efficiency of the protocol. The utilization of red light carries notable advantages in terms of penetration and safety, making it particularly significant. Moreover, careful photophysical investigations were able to give indications about the mechanism of the reaction.

Abstract
The cyclisation of alkynyl alcohols and carboxylic acids in the presence of a [Cu(NHC)2]X complex is reported. The reactions were carried out in technical grade toluene in the presence of air with a catalyst that is readily accessible. N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes are recognised for stabilising metal centres in a range of oxidation states, and this work further supports that NHCs can also be used as activation sites in air and moisture stable yet active catalysts.

         <title>Regioselective Ring&#8208;Opening of Oxetanes Catalyzed by Lewis Superacid Al(C6F5)3</title>

Abstract
This study details an aluminum&#8208;catalyzed regioselective isomerization of 2,2&#8208;disubstituted oxetanes to yield homoallylic alcohols. The reaction takes place in toluene at 40&#8201;&#176;C, employing 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of Al(C6F5)3 as catalyst. This catalytic system shows a wide substrate scope (12 examples). The optimized conditions are especially useful for electron&#8208;rich aryl oxetanes, completely suppressing the formation of allyl isomers and reducing the amount of the dimer by&#8208;product. The synthetic applicability of the reported methodology is demonstrated by the enantioselective formal synthesis of curcuquinone and the &#963;1 receptor agonist RC&#8208;33.

Abstract
Ortho&#8208;directed electrochemical C&#8722;H functionalization of aromatics with boron&#8208;based coupling partners has been achieved under ruthenium catalysis through an oxidatively induced reductive elimination mechanism. Our method provides a single set of conditions delivering C&#8722;H arylation, alkenylation and methylation, yielding ortho&#8208;functionalized products with good functional group tolerance, including examples of late&#8208;stage functionalization in synthetically useful yields. By harnessing electricity as a &#8216;green&#8217; oxidant, this method circumvents the need for stoichiometric quantities of chemical oxidants, enhancing our sustainability metrics.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights on the Enantioselective (4+3) Cycloaddition Between Oxyallylcations and Furans Catalyzed by BINOL&#8208;Based Phosphoramides</title>

Abstract
The mechanism of the enantioselective (4+3) cycloaddition between furan derivatives and oxyallylcations, which are generated from the corresponding oxiranes through in&#8197;situ oxidation of allenamides, has been studied using DFT methods. The research has revealed that, under acid&#8208;catalysis by a chiral non&#8208;racemic phosphoramide, the epoxide ring&#8208;opening proceeds without any energy barrier, while the rate&#8208;limiting step is the electrophilic attack of the intermediate enaminium ion on the furan ring. The reaction exhibits low energy barriers when dealing with furan derivatives unsubstituted at C2 and C5. Calculations predict the formation of an achiral regioisomer for 2&#8208;substituted furans, a prediction that has been experimentally confirmed. Additionally, the calculations accurately predict the reaction with substituted allenamides.

Abstract
In this study we present a method for functionalizing C60 through a Rh&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction with 1,6&#8208;enynes, resulting in the formation of a fused bicyclic structure. Additionally, fullerene derivatives are further functionalized through regioselective photooxygenation reactions. Our DFT calculations reveal two distinct reaction pathways: one involving rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of the enyne followed by Diels&#8208;Alder with C60, and the other featuring a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of enyne and C60 followed by isomerization. Surprisingly, both pathways exhibit nearly identical energy barriers. However, experimental tests indicate that the predominant pathway varies depending on the substitution motifs of the substrates.

         <title>Electronic and Steric Effects in a Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Activation Reaction of 1&#8208;Bromoalkynes</title>

Abstract
The functional group compatibility of our recently disclosed gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1&#8208;bromoalkynes is studied in detail. Two main features are addressed, the minimum distances at which polar functional groups are tolerated and the influence of both electronic and steric effects on the performance of aryl ether derivatives. Moreover, robustness assessment experiments have been carried out shedding light on the factors dictating functional group tolerance. In addition, the reaction has been applied to the synthesis of a key intermediate in the total synthesis of a natural product and a heterobifunctional molecule. DFT calculations have shed light on the mechanistic features behind the observed reactivity trends. On one hand, the destabilization of the TS by the proximity of the polar group may hamper the reactivity for proximal functional groups. On the other hand, some polar functional groups are not tolerated regardless of their position due to the preferential coordination of gold to the oxygen atom over the alkyne, resulting presumably in competitive catalyst deactivation pathways.

         <title>A Silica&#8208;Supported Yttrium Triflate Packed Bed Reactor for Continuous Flow Michael Addition of Indoles to Benzylidene Malonates</title>

Abstract
The catalytic properties of packed bed reactors filled with Y(OTf)3 immobilised onto functionalised silica have been tested in the Michael addition of indoles to benzylidene malonates under flow conditions, providing improved productivity over the batch conditions, a greater ease of recovery of the final products and a prolonged life of the catalyst. Noteworthy, the same catalytic reactor, after being used for five days, was employed to perform a different reaction, a stereoselective Diels Alder cycloaddition in flow, with a 24&#8197;times higher productivity compared to the in&#8208;batch reaction.

Abstract
The art of tuning functional polymeric materials through the covalent incorporation of organocatalysts lies at the core of creating asymmetric immobilized chiral catalysts that mimic the enzymatic action. Herein, we explore diverse synthetic techniques to immobilize l&#8208;proline&#8208;derived N&#8208;carbonyl amides on functional polymeric matrices, transforming them into chiral Lewis bases for facilitating the asymmetric reduction of ketimines with HSiCl3. A comprehensive examination of the design factors, encompassing linker selection, anions, and polymeric support characteristics, enables precise adjustment of steric and electronic features in these immobilized catalysts. This approach establishes structure&#8208;performance relationships, ultimately enabling the development of an engineered immobilized organocatalytic system that meets the desired criteria for activity, stability, and selectivity.

Abstract
Two Ru(II)&#8208;catalytic systems were developed for anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselective hydroacyloxylations of terminal alkynes to vinylic esters. [Ru(NCCH3)6][(BF4)2] favors (E)&#8208;vinylic ester products with arylacetylenes and select carboxylic acids, whereas a Ru scorpionate complex with two electron&#8208;withdrawing ligands favors (Z)&#8208;vinylic ester isomers.

Abstract
A previously undescribed aryne derived from a &#960;&#8208;extended biphenylene, 2,3&#8208;didehydrobenzo[b]biphenylene, has been developed. The participation of this new aryne building block in [4+2] and palladium&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions has been applied to the synthesis of a variety of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) with appealing structures which combine (aromatic) benzene and (antiaromatic) cyclobutadiene (CBD) rings. Among them, a family of unsubstituted (or barely substituted) CBD&#8208;oligoacenes has been accessed by iterative Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of the new aryne with furans and/or isobenzofurans, followed by deoxygenative aromatization of the resulting epoxy&#8208;derivatives. The experimental and computational studies of the newly synthesized PCHs suggest an important degree of electron delocalization along the polycyclic skeleton, more pronounced in the linearly fused derivatives. The computed ACID plots reveal clockwise current density vectors at the peripheral bonds, originating from the &#963; contributions of the antiaromatic cyclobutadiene rings.

Abstract
We report a process to access a variety of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluorinated alcohols. A Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation method was developed in 85&#8211;98% yields and enantiomeric excesses ranging from 52% to &gt;99%. The reduction proceeds under mild conditions with a range of difluorinated molecules including 3,3&#8208;difluorochromanone, 3,3&#8208;difluorothiochromanone, 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;dihydroquinolinone and &#945;&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;ketosulfone derivatives to provide the desired enantioenriched difluorinated alcohols which are valuable fluorinated building blocks.

Abstract
In this contribution, we describe a straightforward and efficient synthesis of oxazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones through a Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component coupling of amines, aldehydes, terminal alkynes, and CO2 via carboxylative cyclization of propargylamine intermediates. This strategy enables the selective synthesis of a variety of (Z)&#8208;5&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;oxazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones substituted in positions 3, 4 and 5 of the heterocyclic core with a variety of functional groups, well&#8208;tolerated in terms of scope. A mechanistic study was carried out monitoring the process in solution by different techniques (operando FTIR, multi&#8208;nuclear NMR), with the aim of identifying the intermediates, both organic compounds and Cu(I) coordination complexes, which showed the plausible multi&#8208;metallic nature of the catalytic intermediates (identified by X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses on monocrystal).

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of 2&#8208;(Quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzyl Alcohols by Biocatalytic Dynamic Kinetic Resolutions</title>

Abstract
A highly enantioselective biocatalytic dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of 2&#8208;(quinoline&#8208;8&#8208;yl) 3&#8208;methylbenzaldehydes and 1&#8208;naphthaldehydes is described. The reaction proceeds by atroposelective carbonyl reduction catalyzed by commercial ketoreductases (KREDs), generally reaching high conversions and excellent enantiomeric excesses. Both atropoisomers of the final alcohols can be obtained by a proper selection of the biocatalyst. The DKR strategy relies in the racemization of the stereogenic axis that takes place thanks to a transient Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction (LABI) between the nitrogen in the quinoline and the carbonyl group.

Abstract
The regioselective functionalization of heptacyclo[6.6.0.02,6.03,13.04,11.05,9.010,14]tetradecane (HCTD) under photocatalytic conditions is described. The protocols developed share an initial photo&#8208;triggered hydrogen atom abstraction that regioselectively generates the necessary HCTD&#8208;radical preferentially at position 1&#8208;, they employ no excess of the precious cage carbocycle, and enable the straightforward access to a broad variety of 1&#8208;(alkyl, aryl, or sulfinyl) HCTDs in moderate but still synthetically useful yields. The scope and limitations of each transformation are also discussed.

Abstract
Oxidative alkene cleavage of a series of (hetero)aryl alkyl styrenes in aqueous medium has been developed using either 9&#8208;mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methylacridinium perchlorate ([AcrMes]ClO4) and sodium anthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonate (SAS) as photosensitizers under blue LED irradiation. Reaction conditions were studied to find a suitable media for the development of a linear cascade after subsequent stereoselective reduction of the corresponding ketone intermediate. The use of cesium carbonate provided an adequate pH to the reaction medium for the alcohol dehydrogenase action. [AcrMes]ClO4 was found to be the best photocatalyst, allowing the development of concurrent or sequential cascades depending on the ability of the photosensitizer to oxidize back the chiral alcohol to the ketone. Overall, the photobiocatalytic approach has allowed the synthesis of a wide number of alcohol compounds, the formation of (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;enantiomers being attained with excellent stereoselectivity and moderate to good yields.

Polysubstituted carbazoles were efficiently synthesized through direct benzannulation reaction between 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds and indoles with catalytic amount of inexpensive zirconium(IV) chloride. This transformation proved to be regioselective and furnishes 1,4&#8208;disubstituted and 1,2,4&#8208;trisubstituted carbazoles with yields ranging from 26% to 91% and broad substrate scope. Moreover, this protocol benefits from using readily accessible starting materials without the need of their pre&#8208;functionalization. The synthetic utility of the products was exemplified by functionalization of an iodocarbazole by means of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions and by the synthesis of a 3&#8208;deaza&#8208;derivative of the natural product canthin&#8208;6&#8208;one.

         <title>Stereospecific Indium(III)&#8208;Catalysed Tandem Cycloisomerization of Functionalized 1,6&#8208;enynes: Scope and Mechanistic Insights</title>

Abstract
Tandem cycloisomerization reactions of functionalized 1,6&#8208;enynes under indium(III) catalysis are described. This atom&#8208;economic transformation proceeds smoothly with 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig regioselectivity using commercial In(III) halides and 1,6&#8208;enynes furnished with alcohol, carboxylic acid or amine functional groups to give bicyclic structures in good yields and diastereoselectivities. The reaction with enynals involves a three&#8211;step mechanism to give an oxatricycle and a conjugated 1,3&#8208;diene. In the absence of the internal nucleophile the enyne cycloisomerization evolves through a skeletal rearrangement or a cyclopropanation reaction after the regioselective 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization. The 1,6&#8208;enyne cycloisomerization is stereospecific and the stereoselectivity appears to be independent of the internal nucleophile. Experimental data support a common reaction mechanism involving an initial alkyne electrophilic &#960;&#8208;coordination of In(III) followed by Markovnikov electrophilic alkene addition and ring&#8208;closure by nucleophilic attack. DFT studies hold up a stepwise mechanism involving the formation of a chiral non&#8208;classical carbocation intermediate that determines the diastereoselectivity of this tandem cycloisomerization reaction.

&lt;p&gt;Tandem cycloisomerization reactions of functionalized 1,6-enynes under indium(III) catalysis are described. This atom-economic transformation proceeds smoothly with &lt;i&gt;5-exo-dig&lt;/i&gt; regioselectivity using commercial In(III) halides and 1,6-enynes furnished with alcohol, carboxylic acid or amine functional groups to give bicyclic structures in good yields and diastereoselectivities. The reaction with enynals involves a three&#8211;step mechanism to give an oxatricycle and a conjugated 1,3-diene. In the absence of the internal nucleophile the enyne cycloisomerization evolves through a skeletal rearrangement or a cyclopropanation reaction after the regioselective &lt;i&gt;5-exo-dig&lt;/i&gt; cyclization. The 1,6-enyne cycloisomerization is stereospecific and the stereoselectivity appears to be independent of the internal nucleophile. Experimental data support a common reaction mechanism involving an initial alkyne electrophilic &#960;-coordination of In(III) followed by Markovnikov electrophilic alkene addition and ring-closure by nucleophilic attack.

Abstract
Multiphasic reaction of bicarbonate hydrogenation to form formate using homogeneous Ru PNP pincer catalyst in a continuous flow tubular reactor is reported. The reaction system consists of three phases. Catalyst is dissolved in toluene while potassium bicarbonate is dissolved in water. The significance of efficient mixing among the organic phase, aqueous phase and gaseous hydrogen to improve hydrogenation reaction by using different inert packing materials is studied by operando visualization and also quantitatively discussed. The bicarbonate conversion of up to 67% is achieved after optimization of important reaction and reactor parameters. The designed reactor setup comprised of effective recycling system that recycles the catalyst with &gt;99% activity.

         <title>Acceleration of the Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction between 9&#8208;Functionalized Anthracenes and C60/C70 in the Cavity of a Water Soluble Subphthalocyanine Cage</title>

Abstract
Herein we report on the acceleration of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between a series of 9&#8208;functionalized anthracenes and C60/C70 encapsulated in a water&#8208;soluble metallo&#8208;organic Pd(II)&#8208;subphthalocyanine cage (SubPc&#8208;cage), which performs as a catalytic molecular reactor that provides a beneficial hydrophobic environment. Negatively and positively charged anthracenes do not react either with C60 or C70, due to a favored solvation in water medium and/or to detrimental interactions with positively&#8208;charged Pd(II) corners of SubPc&#8208;cage. Experiments with C60 and C70 rendered parallel results, although C70 proved more reactive, leading to anthracene cycloadducts by reaction in the &#945; bonds. All the results have been rationalized by theoretical calculations at the GFN2&#8208;xTB level.

Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of chiral phosphabarrelene&#8208;pyridine ligands. Their synthesis benefit from modified reaction conditions to overcome the low yields normally associated with the [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of phosphinines with hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;butyne, which is a key to install the P&#8208;stereocenter in the phosphabarrelene. Their potential as chelating ligands in asymmetric catalysis was assessed in the Rh&#8208; and Ir&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of cyclic &#946;&#8208;enamides and &#946;&#8208;dehydroamino acid derivatives. The catalytic system containing a tert&#8208;butyl substituent at the ortho position of the phosphabarrelene moiety successfully hydrogenates a range of cyclic &#946;&#8208;enamides (ee's between 92% to 94%) and &#946;&#8208;dehydroamino acid derivatives (ee's between 93% to 95%). Moreover, the reactions can be carried out in the environmentally friendly 1,2&#8208;propylene carbonate as solvent with no loss of enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies with the Rh/P,N catalytic systems agree with the Landis&#8208;Halpern mechanism and explain the influence of the substituent at the phosphabarrelene on enantioselectivity. Finally, the hydrogenation reactions can be carried out at large scale maintaining high enantioselectivities.

         <title>Enantioselective Flow Synthesis of a Tetrahydroquinoline SERM Enabled by Immobilized Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalysis and Diboronic Acid Mediated Selective Nitro Reduction</title>

Abstract
An asymmetric enantioselective flow process is reported for the formal synthesis of a 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline selective estrogen receptor modulator. Starting from an easily available 2&#8208;nitrochalcone, the first part of the process comprised a telescoped nitro reduction/intramolecular cyclocondensation sequence using diboronic acid as a simple reductant. Subsequent enantioselective transfer hydrogenation in the presence of an immobilized phosphoric acid organocatalyst followed by telescoped N&#8208;alkylation furnished the targeted chiral intermediate. The approach ensures flexibility regarding the scale of the synthesis, whilst minimizing the need for intermediate purifications and ensuring environmentally benign metal&#8208;free conditions.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An asymmetric enantioselective flow process is reported for the formal synthesis of a 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline selective estrogen receptor modulator. Starting from an easily available 2-nitrochalcone, the first part of the process comprised a telescoped nitro reduction/intramolecular cyclocondensation sequence using diboronic acid as a simple reductant. Subsequent enantioselective transfer hydrogenation in the presence of an immobilized phosphoric acid organocatalyst followed by telescoped &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkylation furnished the targeted chiral intermediate. The approach ensures flexibility regarding the scale of the synthesis, whilst minimizing the need for intermediate purifications and ensuring environmentally benign metal-free conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
The use of hierarchically structured materials as catalysts has been finding increasing application in the past years. For these catalytic systems, not only the nano&#8208;scale matters: a high degree of order across multiple length scales, along with its control and analytical assessment, is of paramount importance to obtain innovative properties that can find application in catalysis. Most reviews dealing with hierarchically structured materials are concerned with the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; transfer of structural information along the different length scales, with special emphasis on the transmission of chirality. Due to their mesoscale size together with their complex behaviour, these systems are often susceptible to feel the effects of macroscopic forces, that can exert a &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; control of their catalytic properties, so that an external stimulus, acting at the level of the supramolecular architecture of the catalyst, can ultimately determine the outcome of the catalyzed reaction at the molecular level. We review in this paper some recent reports that deal with the experimental implementation of this concept, either by using a mechanical force in a full range direct transmission to the reaction coordinate, or by means of a stepwise relay transmission from the macroscopic level (purely supramolecular chirality) to the nanoscopic one. We focus in this review on these multi&#8208;length scale communication control effects, identifying the different mechanisms that are affecting the catalytic activity.

Abstract
1&#945;,25&#8208;Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3), the hormonally active form of vitamin D3, regulates mineral homeostasis, cell growth, cell differentiation&#8208;proliferation, apoptosis, and immune responses. 1,25D3 activates more than 229 genes associated with several diseases, including arthritis, diabetes and cancer, suggesting its implications in a broader range of biological functions than originally thought. Despite the wide range of biological activities, the clinical applications of 1,25D3 have been limited due to its collateral hypercalcemic effects. This problem has boosted intense synthetic activity in the vitamin D area in the last decades aimed at the development of highly active and non&#8208;calcemic analogs for treatment of hyperproliferative diseases. This review covers the most useful synthetic approaches to 1,25D3 analogs containing the natural vitamin D triene system with emphasis on the Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed transformations involved in the formation of the vitamin D triene system and A&#8208;ring synthons.

Abstract
The chemical and reaction spaces are incredibly vast and special procedures are required to study them. Their complex and multiparametric nature encompass myriads of compounds and interactions and endless modifications involving the distinct impact of relevant variables (temperature, solvent, stoichiometry, etc.). This often calls for the design, collection, and analysis/interpretation of large datasets. Reaction charting, the systematic scanning, description, analysis, and guided modifications of a given process, stands as the most promising approach. It offers fast and accurate solutions as well as expanding the knowledge about the systems. This deeper understanding enables reliable predictions, improvement of the productivity (yields, scope), eventually leading to sustainable, economic, and safe applications. The present review introduces the topic, analyzing selected examples and recent advancements in different organic chemistry&#8208;related fields. The covered methodologies range from classical experimentation modifying one factor at a time, to Design of Experiments and more modern computational approaches involving Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. In this way, the impact of charting in process development, biological and medicinal chemistry, catalysis, reaction discovery and computational methods is accounted. Finally, the conclusion/outlook section gives a general appraisal and a prospect on the future implementation of the methodology.

         <title>The Intermolecular Pauson&#8208;Khand Reaction: Applications, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>

Abstract
The rapid assembly of complex organic molecules from simple and structurally diverse building blocks is a prevalent challenge in organic synthesis. The Pauson&#8208;Khand reaction (PKR) is a method of choice for the construction of five membered rings that has historically been popularized as a late&#8208;stage intramolecular cyclization method. The intermolecular version of the PKR, on the other hand, constitutes a powerful approach for the rapid assembly of densely functionalized cyclopentanic cores at early stages of a synthetic sequence. Despite its potential, the intermolecular PKR is much less prevalent in the organic synthesis literature due to several historical limitations, most importantly a reduced scope with respect to the alkene component of the reaction. The last decade has witnessed important developments in the area including a) experimental and theoretical studies that provide a good mechanistic understanding of the reaction and its selectivity, b) methodological developments that have broadened the scope of potential alkene partners, and c) the development of catalytic enantioselective versions that provide useful levels of enantioselectivity. In parallel, remarkable synthetic applications of the intermolecular PKR have emerged, including (enantioselective) total syntheses of complex natural products (polycyclic terpenes, alkaloids, prostanes) as well as examples of industrial relevance. A fundamental limitation of the PKR that needs to be addressed in the future is the current lack of a ligand&#8208;accelerated version of the reaction, which would be a promising advance towards developing more efficient and general catalytic (enantioselective) reactions.

         <title>Recent Advances in Ni&#8208;Catalyzed 1,1&#8208;Difunctionalization of Unactivated Olefins</title>

Abstract
Unactivated olefins rank amongst the most important feedstocks in organic synthesis. Their availability makes them particularly useful synthons for subsequent functionalization, particularly in a catalytic manner. Driven by the popularity ascribed by nickel catalysis as a new tool to rapidly forge molecular architectures via one&#8208;or two&#8208;electron manifolds, the recent years have witnessed significant advances in Ni&#8208;catalyzed olefin difunctionalization. While 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization or remote functionalization via &#8220;chain&#8208;walk&#8221; have become mature disciplines for repurposing the potential of olefins as building blocks, it was only recently that extensions of this chemistry to 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization have been possible. This review summarizes the recent advances in Ni&#8208;catalyzed olefin 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization, holding considerable promise as a new powerful strategy for our ever&#8208;growing synthetic repertoire.

Their availability makes them particularly useful synthons for subsequent functionalization, particularly in a catalytic manner. Driven by the popularity ascribed by nickel catalysis as a new tool to rapidly forge molecular architectures via one-or two-electron manifolds, the recent years have witnessed significant advances in Ni-catalyzed olefin difunctionalization. While 1,2-difunctionalization or remote functionalization via &#8220;chain-walk&#8221; have become mature disciplines for repurposing the potential of olefins as building blocks, it was only recently that extensions of this chemistry to 1,1-difunctionalization have been possible.

Abstract
A diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of spirocyclopropylpyrazolones has been described through a Michael/alkylation cascade reaction of 4&#8208;arylidenepyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones with diethyl 2&#8208;bromomalonate catalyzed by (DHQ)2AQN. The reaction afforded selectively the corresponding spirocyclic compounds with 30&#8211;83% yield, diastereoselectivities ranging from 60:40 to &gt;95:5 and 26&#8211;93% enantiomeric excess under mild reaction conditions. Moreover, we performed two selective transformations with the corresponding chiral compounds.

Abstract
Flow chemistry has recently opened new chemistry windows thanks to the safer use of hazardous and sensitive reagents. Furthermore, flow procedures usually outperform their batch counterparts due to improved mass and heat transfer, offering a good opportunity for industrial application. Herein, a rapid Simmons&#8208;Smith cyclopropanation flow process is presented. Taking advantage of the in&#8197;situ production of the zinc carbenoid species, several olefins bearing aromatic rings of different electronic nature, aliphatic chains or heterocycles were smoothly cyclopropanated with a residence time of just 15 minutes. In addition, industrial applicability of the protocol is assured thanks to a successful 12&#8208;mmol scale experiment, which represents a 3.59 grams per hour production of a selected example, and to the satisfactory synthesis of pharmaceutical drugs.

Abstract
Enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective dearomative [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction between N,N&#8208;dimethylhydrazone derived from 9&#8208;anthracenecarboxaldehyde and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is reported. The developed strategy utilizes HOMO&#8208;rising activation of diene (via hydrazone formation) and aminocatalytic LUMO&#8208;lowering activation of dienophile (via iminium ion formation). High chemical and stereochemical efficiency have been obtained owing to the application of J&#248;rgensen catalyst. Target cycloadducts were subjected to selected transformations aiming at unmasking the hydrazone moiety that proceeded with preservation of optical purity introduced in the organocatalytic step.

Abstract
An array of enantioenriched vinyl boronates bearing an allylic carbonate moiety have been prepared through selective hydroboration of propargyl carbonates. Treatment of these vinyl boronates with TBAF in THF affords enantioenriched 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allenes through a novel 1,2&#8208;anti elimination in good yields and high enantiospecificities.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction of 2&#8208;azidosulfonamides and isocyanides enables the synthesis of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;substituted 1,2,4&#8208;benzothiadiazine 1,1&#8208;dioxides at room temperature. By applying commercially available Pd(dba)2 in catalyst loadings as low as 1.0&#8197;mol%, a variety of 21 differently substituted 2H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;benzothiadiazine 1,1&#8208;dioxides can be prepared within 2&#8197;h. Moreover, the developed protocol gives access to the related 4H heterocycles.

Abstract
Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of 8&#8208;benzylquinolines with arylboronic acids was developed. In the presence of 5&#8197;mol% BINOL&#8208;derived chiral cyclopentadienyl rhodium complex, asymmetric benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond arylation reaction proceeded smoothly to afford a series of enantioenriched triarylmethanes in moderate to good yields with good to excellent enantioselective control (24&#8211;89% yields, 63&#8211;93% ee). The method displays a broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance under mild conditions.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Cycloadditions of Alkenylidenecyclopropanes with Alkenes and Dienes</title>

Abstract
Low&#8208;valent cobalt complexes equipped with phosphorous type of ligands can promote the intramolecular (3+2) cycloaddition of alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) with alkenes and with allenes. Dienes can also be used as partners, but they afford seven&#8208;membered cycloadducts. The reactions are fully diastereoselective and, in some cases, we also observed moderate enantioselectivities, especially when using chiral phosphite ligands.

Abstract
Herein, the selective ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;C&#8722;H bond borylation of NH&#8208;aryl sulfoximines is reported. Regioselectivity is achieved by the choice of commercially available ligands giving fast excess to valuable borylated aryl sulfoximine building blogs. The utility of the borylated products is demonstrated for the formation of C&#8722;O, C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;D, and C&#8722;I bonds.

Abstract
The combination of organocatalytic activation and photocatalysis for enabling the intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of enone&#8208;ene substrates bearing one Lewis base binding site is reported. While in a variety of solvents a poor conversion or no reaction takes place in the absence of a hydrogen bonding catalyst, the corresponding ring&#8208;fused cyclobutane products could be built in moderate to good yields using a synergistic dual iridium&#8208;urea co&#8208;catalytic system. Control and mechanistic studies supported the postulated interaction between the organocatalyst and the substrate, which proved essential for an efficient energy transfer from the photosensitizer.

Abstract
&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated ketones are highly versatile intermediates in organic synthesis, widely being used as substrates in e.&#8201;g. 1,4&#8208;addition&#8208; and Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. Their synthesis, however, often proceeds via multi&#8208;step pathways. Here we present an alternative methodology for the one&#8208;pot formation of 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ones by the Pd&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;coupling of readily available bromides and lithium 1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes, proceeding in 2.5&#8197;h at 40&#8201;&#176;C. In situ hydrolysis of the intermediate 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes affords the desired 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ones, providing a direct cross&#8208;coupling method to access isomerically pure (E)&#8208;enones.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Asymmetric Hydrogenation for the Synthesis of an (S)&#8208;Metolachlor Intermediate Using Catalysts Immobilized on a Core/Shell&#8208;Type Support</title>

Abstract
Here we show continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of a key inter&#8208;mediate of (S)&#8208;Metolachlor, which is a widely used agrochemical that is in huge demand, with asymmetric hydrogenation using a heterogeneous catalyst immobilized on a core/shell&#8208;type support. We have immobilized a homogeneous catalyst onto a core/shell&#8208;type heterogeneous support that was developed in our laboratory, which showed high turnover frequency and turnover number over a long period (over 120&#8197;h) when used in a solvent&#8208;free continuous&#8208;flow manner. This result demonstrates the feasibility of continuous&#8208;flow production of chiral agrochemicals with packed&#8208;bed heterogeneous catalysts. Moreover, the heterogenization protocol was shown to be applicable to elaborate practical catalysts used in industry, especially the group of phosphine ligands.

Abstract
The synthesis of a difunctional P&#8208;heterocycle combining phosphonate and ester moieties in a six&#8208;membered ring is described. Using trifluoromethane sulfonic acid HOTf as organocatalyst, ring&#8208;opening with neopentyl alcohol readily occurs with complete selectivity for O&#8208;acyl bond cleavage. In turn, ring&#8208;opening polymerization proceeds in a controlled manner when an excess of P&#8208;heterocycle is used. Copolymerization with &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone is also reported and semi&#8208;batch conditions are shown to enable regular incorporation of the phosphonate moieties along the polymer chains.

Abstract
We disclose how an N,C,N&#8208;bismuthinidene is able to promote an intramolecular conjugate amination that affords cyclic carbamates in 91&#8211;97% yields. The reaction proceeds at room temperature in short reaction times, requiring a remarkably low loading of a bismuth(I) complex (0.1&#8197;mol%) without the need of an additional Br&#248;nsted base. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction takes place through a polar pathway involving the conjugate addition of the nucleophilic bismuthinidene, followed by an intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael reaction.

Abstract
A photoredox/copper co&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening cross&#8208;coupling of aryl azides with cyclopropanols has been developed with fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 as the photocatalyst. The reaction involves intermediacy of the anilino radical generated through reduction of the azido group by fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3* and [CuII]&#8208;enabled oxidative ring&#8208;opening of the cyclopropanol. An array of &#946;&#8208;aminoketone compounds were synthesized under redox&#8208;neutral conditions by using this method.

An array of &#946;-aminoketone compounds were synthesized under redox-neutral conditions by using this method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Progress in Functionalization of the Pyridine Ring through C&#8722;S Bond Formation under Transition Metal Catalyst Free Conditions</title>

Abstract
Pyridines and quinolines substituted with sulfur&#8208;containing functional groups are widely used as drugs, drug candidates, organic materials, N,S&#8208;ligands and others. Traditional synthetic routes to produce these compounds are based on nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions of (pseudo)halopyridines. While effective in many cases, both approaches are limited due to using forcing conditions and expensive, specifically designed catalytic systems. In the last decade, a number of innovative methods for the functionalization of the pyridine ring via the formation of a C&#8722;S bond have been developed. Most of these methods proceed through the direct or indirect C&#8722;H functionalization of unfunctionalized pyridines, thus avoiding the use of oftentimes not readily available halopyridines as the starting materials. Deoxygenative C&#8722;H functionalization of pyridine&#8208;N&#8208;oxides and deaminative transformation of aminopyridines have been also employed for the introduction of diverse organosulfur functionality into the pyridine ring. All these processes can be easily performed under mild conditions, typically affording value pyridines and quinolines in good to high yields. Usually being highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective, these methods allow the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules including drugs and natural products. In this Review, we summarize the most recent synthetic methods for functionalization of pyridines and fused pyridines with sulfur&#8208;containing functional groups reported mostly since 2018. For a better understanding of the processes, the mechanisms of the described reactions are briefly discussed.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;Quinolones based on Visible Light&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation of Diazo compounds</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a photocatalytic method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;quinolones under mild conditions by employing &#945;&#8208;diazo acetamide as substrates. The use of Eosin Y as a photocatalyst allows an economical and environmentally benign synthetic method. The process involves the generation of radicals from diazo compounds promoted by a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism. The method demonstrates a broad substrate scope to provide various aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;quinolones. To support the proposed mechanism, a series of mechanistic experiments were conducted.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Free NNN&#8208;Manganese(II) Catalyzed C&#8208;alkylation of Methyl N&#8208;Heteroarenes via Borrowing Hydrogen</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
Mn(II)&#8208;catalyzed alkylations of methyl N&#8208;heteroarenes was reported via borrowing hydrogen strategy with alcohols as the alkylating reagent. The developed geometry&#8208;constrained benzimidazole&#8208;iminopyridyl ligand played a key role in promoting the transformation and stablizing the metal center. A wide range of alcohols (aromatic, heteroaromatic and aliphatic) and methyl N&#8208;Heteroarenes could be able to apply in the current catalytic system, with TON up to 7400.

         <title>Tandem Hydrogen&#8208;Borrowing Dehydrogenative Coupling and Hydrodefluorination</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Dehydrogenative coupling (DC) is an attractive approach to constructing new C&#8722;N bonds using alcohols as electrophiles. In &#8216;hydrogen&#8208;borrowing&#8217; variants of DC, the H2 liberated can be used to re&#8208;hydrogenate unsaturated intermediates to produce saturated products. Here, we show how so&#8208;generated H2 can also be used to replace fluorine atoms with hydrogens in CF3 groups in a tandem dehydrogenative coupling/hydrodefluorination process.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Enabled Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Manganese (Mn) is the third most abundant transition metal on Earth and is known for its exceptional biocompatibility. The development of novel catalytic mode for Mn is of great significance to advancing organic synthesis. In this study, the first manganese (Mn)&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of alkynes is achieved with the aid of visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis. Photoredox catalysis is proposed to promote the transformation by in&#8197;situ reduction of high&#8208;valent Mn(II) complex to Mn(0) species, thereby initiating the reaction. Additionally, a photooxidation&#8208;induced reductive ellimination step is also suggested. This system is further distinguished by its notable tolerance towards both terminal and internal alkynes as counterparts of diynes.

Abstract
Due to amine derivatives widely existing in numerous clinical medicines and bioactive compounds, their synthesis has received considerable attention over the past few decades. Traditional methods for the synthesis of amine derivatives largely relied on the reduction of nitroarenes, amides, hydrazines, nitriles, and azides. Recently, the discovery of 2&#8208;azaallyl anions as super&#8208;electron&#8208;donors (SEDs) has opened up new possibilities for the construction of diverse carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds through radical coupling strategies. This breakthrough highlights the potential of generating 2&#8208;azaallyl radicals as versatile intermediates in organic synthesis. Then, hydrolysis of the coupling product can easily separate the corresponding amine derivatives. Thus, tremendous attention has been paid to the C&#8722;H functionalization of ketimines as an alternative strategy for the synthesis of amine derivatives. Herein, we comprehensively summarize the recent progress in radical coupling strategies enabled by 2&#8208;azaallyl anions as SEDs. Their proposed mechanistic pathways, advantages, and limitations are also discussed in detail. 1. Introduction 2. C&#8722;C Bond Formation 2.1. Vinylation of Ketimines 2.2. Arylation of Ketimines 2.3. Alkylation of Ketimines 2.3.1. Methylation of Ketimines 2.3.2. Other Alkylation of Ketimines 3. C&#8722;X Bond Formation 3.1. C&#8722;P and C&#8722;S Bonds Formation 3.2.

Abstract
A tert&#8208;butyl nitrite (TBN) promoted visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced one&#8208;pot C&#8722;N cross coupling reaction of 3&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles with benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine was explored. Simultaneously, the indoline motif of 3&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles as well as 3&#8208;ylidene oxindoles are regioselectively nitrated at the C&#8208;6 position by in&#8208;situ formed NO2 radical. (E)&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;(aryl)&#8208;2&#8208;oxoethylidene)oxindole and (E)&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene oxindole produce distinct nitrated diastereomeric coupling products, a phenomenon influenced by the steric bulk of the functional group. The experimental findings suggest the potential involvement of a radical pathway in this reaction.

Abstract
Herein, we report a photochemical synthesis of 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl containing quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones through consecutive photoredox catalysed reactions. A wide range of C3&#8208;modified quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones were obtained in 53&#8211;91% yields by this approach. Mechanistic studies including radical trapping, EPR studies, D&#8208;labelling investigations, and many other control experiments well explained the proposed consecutive photoredox mechanism.

Abstract
Herein, we report a chemo&#8208; and regioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed redox C7&#8208;spiroannulation reaction of N&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole indolines with maleimides, resulting in a series of N&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole indoline fused azaspirocycles in up to 92% yield. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by the synthesis of highly functionalized nitrogen&#8208;containing spiropolycyclic skeletons. The annulation reaction could also be performed with maleic esters and acrylates. The products were purified by simple filtration. The Rh catalyst can be recycled, and the reaction could be performed at gram&#8208;scale using 0.5&#8197;mol% of catalyst, which makes this protocol potentially applicable in industry. Moreover, the efficient post&#8208;modification of pharmaceutical molecules demonstrates its practicability.

Abstract
An acylative fluorination of two different alkenes is developed, assisted by the interaction of silver catalyst and Selectflour. Various &#945;&#8208;ketonic acids can be decarboxylated to form acyl radicals at 35&#8201;&#176;C, sequentially add to the electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208; rich alkenes to provide the benzyl fluorinated compounds containing diversified functional groups.

         <title>The Reaction of Aryl Thiols or Thioureas with o&#8208;Diiodoarenes/NaH to Access o&#8208;Iodoaryl Thioethers</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein we report a method for the synthesis of thioethers by forging C(aryl)&#8208;S bond via an aryne mechanism. The active aryne species can be generated from o&#8208;diiodoarenes and NaH in THF at room temperature, then lead to the arylations of a wide range of aryl thiols and thioureas. Different from transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, no disubstituted byproduct is formed in our protocol. The o&#8208;iodoaryl thioether products are intermediates that could be transformed into pharmaceutically interesting molecules.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Sonogashira Couplings: Extending the Reaction Scope to Aryl Bromides and Chlorides</title>

Abstract
The alkyne motif is present in several naturally occurring molecules and specialty chemicals. The Sonogashira reaction is recognized as one of the most exploited methods for the synthesis of substituted alkynes. While palladium catalysts have been traditionally employed, recent efforts have been directed towards developing alternatives based on Earth&#8208;abundant metals such as nickel. However, nickel&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira couplings still present important substrate limitations. While more reactive aryl iodides have been well documented, the coupling of more challenging yet cost&#8208;effective aryl bromides and chlorides lags significantly behind. Herein, we present a method for the nickel&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling of aryl bromides and chlorides, whose discovery was accelerated thanks to high&#8208;throughput experimentation. Fine&#8208;tuning of the bipyridine ligand was essential to activate chemoselectively C(sp2)&#8722;Br or C(sp2)&#8722;Cl bonds. A wide range of functionally diverse alkynes, including examples of active ingredients and their intermediates, were accessed in a single step and with yields up to 98%. The developed methodology is expected to be widely adopted by academia and industry, marking a step forward in the field of base metal catalysis.

Abstract
Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkenylation and arylation of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines with alkenyl and aryl carboxylic acids under microwave assistance have been realized. Using [Rh(CO)2(acac)] as the catalyst and Piv2O as the acid activator, 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines undergo C8&#8208;selective decarbonylative C&#8722;H alkenylation with a wide range of alkenyl and aryl carboxylic acids, affording the C8&#8208;alkenylated or arylated 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines. This method enables the synthesis of C8&#8208;alkenylated 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines that would otherwise be difficult to access by means of conventional C&#8722;H alkenylation protocols. Moreover, this catalytic system also works well in C8&#8208;selective decarbonylative C&#8722;H arylation of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines with aryl carboxylic acids. The catalytic activity strongly depends on the choice of the N&#8208;directing group, with the readily installable and removable N&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrimidyl) group being optimal. The catalytic pathway is elucidated by mechanistic experiments.

         <title>Enabling C7 Methylation and Arylation of the Indolyl Core via P(III)&#8208;Directed C&#8208;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peripheral editing of complex molecules via C&#8208;H functionalization removes the retrosynthetic bias toward pre&#8208;functionalization and taps the innate, often subtle, stereoelectronic differences between C&#8208;H linkages. Using this approach, bioactive molecules and residues can be modified without being beholden to lengthy sequences, thus allowing biochemical hypotheses to be interrogated on accelerated timelines. Herein, the C&#8208;H functionalization paradigm is leveraged to tackle C7 C&#8211;H functionalization of the tryptophan core. The devised process, which was expanded to related systems, utilizes an N&#8208;bound unsymmetrical &#8220;designer&#8221; phosphine to direct C&#8211;H functionalization to C7 while maintaining operational ease and directing group installation/removal. Quantum mechanically calculated steric properties and activation energies suggest that this phosphine is hindered enough for favoring C&#8211;H functionalization over deactivation pathways but is still easily cleaved by nucleophiles. Additionally, the process enables the direct C&#8211;H methylation, cyclopropanation, and arylation of tryptophan to yield unnatural amino acid (UAA) building blocks. As a testament to the versatility of this method, a solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS)ready phosphinated tryptophan was incorporated into a pentapeptide and the C&#8208;H functionalization/dephosphination sequence was executed with ease. The utility of "onpeptide" editing was exhibited through late&#8208;stage functionalization&#160;of several pentapeptides with a diverse set of C7 substituents on&#8208; and off&#8208;resin.</dc:description>

         <title>An Access to Chiral Phthalides: Enantioselective Synthesis of Escitalopram</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A method for the asymmetric synthesis of phthalides containing a stereogenic &#947;&#8208;carbon has been described. The protocol, based on the arylogous Michael addition to chiral alkenoyl oxazolidinones catalyzed by a crown ether under phase&#8208;transfer conditions does not require anhydrous conditions and uses commercially available materials. A complete syn&#8208;stereocontrol is achieved and facial diastereoselectivities are moderate to excellent (62:38 to 99:1 dr). Purification of the major diastereomer by chromatography and selective cleavage of the chiral auxiliary affords enantiopure Michael products. The protocol has been applied to the formal synthesis of escitalopram.

         <title>Oxidative Alkenylation of (Hetero)aromatics with Unactivated Alkenes: Control of the Reaction Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkenylbenzene skeletons represent one of the most widely occurring structural motifs in pharmaceutical drugs, natural products, and advanced materials. The construction of alkenylbenzenes is promising through the use of a straightforward oxidative alkenylation protocol, particularly from unactivated alkenes. This is significant because unactivated alkenes are inexpensive raw materials that can be obtained in bulk quantities from petrochemical feedstocks and renewable resources. However, controlling the reactivity and regioselectivity of olefination with unbiased olefins remains a significant challenge, necessitating continuous efforts and potentially having a substantial impact on both organic synthesis and the industry. This review aims to provide an overview of the latest advances in regiocontrol strategies for oxidative alkenylation reactions with unactivated alkenes, which can be categorized into three types: 1) ligand&#8208;promoted/accelerated reactions; 2) prefunctionalized olefins&#8208;facilitated reactions; 3) directing group&#8208;induced reactions.</dc:description>

Abstract
We conceptualized a radical cyclization approach for the synthesis of SCF3, SAr, SO2Ar and COAr featured spirocyclic [4.5] and [5.5] trienone between biaryls and ArSO2H or ArCOCO2H in presence of RFTA as a photocatalyst whereas the insertion of ArSSAr or AgSCF3 devoid of photocatalyst via an energetically demanding dearomative transformation under visible&#8208;light catalysis. The photo&#8208;excited charge transfer complex with biaryl tethered ynones provides a way to promote S&#8208;centered radical generation followed by its insertion to enable a wide range of biologically important molecules.

Abstract
Herein, we describe a base&#8208;promoted regioselective and chemoselective cascade cyclization, ynamide N&#8722;Csp bond cleavage, selective intramolecular 1,3&#8208;migration, and simultaneous N&#8208;desulfonylation strategy for the synthesis of 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3&#8208;(phenylethynyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indole derivatives.

A gram&#8208;scale experiment as well as postsynthetic transformations of the synthesized 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3&#8208;(phenylethynyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indole were performed to exhibit the advantages of this synthetic methodology.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Vicinal Amino Alcohol Derivatives via Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Ring Opening of Aziridines with Alcohols and Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Under the catalysis of a Cu(I) or Ag(I) salt with a chiral diphosphine ligand, the enantioselective nucleophilic ring opening of racemic 2&#8208;styrenylaziridines via kinetic resolution or dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) and of meso aziridines via desymmetrization with alcohols was realized. The reaction provided a range of chiral vicinal amino ether derivatives in 47%&#8208;98% yields and with 50%&#8211;98% ee. The reaction could be extended to aliphatic carboxylic acids as nucleophiles. The synthetic utility was demonstrated in a four&#8208;step formal synthesis of a diastereomer of the antirythmetic agent vernakalant.

         <title>Synthetic Route to Benzostannoles via Al&#8722;Li&#8208;dimetal Intermediate and Their Application to Dibenzofulvene Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Benzostannoles were synthesized from commercially available and easily accessible substrates. The ring construction proceeds via an Al&#8722;Li&#8208;dimetal intermediate generated in&#8197;situ from 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;(silylethynyl)benzenes. This methodology provided various 2&#8208;silylbenzostannoles in 32% to 97% yields. The benzostannoles obtained were converted into dibenzofulvenes by treatment with 1,2&#8208;dibromobenzenes in the presence of a Pd catalyst. This transformation yielded various types of symmetrical and unsymmetrical dibenzofulvenes, with combination of the benzostannoles and 1,2&#8208;dibromobenzenes.

         <title>Photoinduced C&#8722;O Bond Formation through C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage of Alcohols by Suppressing Alcohol Oxidation</title>

Abstract
Herein, we present a photoinduced deconstructive alkoxyamination of alkyl alcohols catalyzed by iron salts. This transformation involves the initiation of alkoxy radicals through chlorine radical&#8208;induced alkoxy radical formation, followed by &#946;&#8208;scission and trapping of the resulting carbon radicals with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl (TEMPO). This reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope (40 examples), including primary and secondary alcohols that are prone to oxidation by the combination of TEMPO and iron. Mechanistic investigations have revealed that enhanced coordination of the chloride ion with the iron center inhibits the OH oxidation process, thereby enabling the tolerance of primary and secondary alcohols.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Amino Esterification of Cyclic Ketones to Access Distal Amino Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
This study developed a method of synthesizing distal amino acid derivatives by the ring&#8208;opening reaction of cyclic ketones, following the amino esterification functionalization of both terminals. To achieve this goal, we performed the ring&#8208;opening reaction of cyclic ketones with an aminating reagent and alcohol under metal&#8208; and photocatalysis&#8208;free conditions in a single step. The method directly afforded distal amino acid derivatives bearing C4&#8722;C6, C8, and C12 carbon main chains, such as &#947;, &#948;, and &#1013;&#8208;amino esters. The obtained amino esters were simply transformed into amino acids by hydrolysis.

Abstract
An I2&#8208;promoted [3+2] cyclization reaction between thiocarbamates with enaminones has been developed for the synthesis of thiazol&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;one derivatives. This protocol involves C&#8722;S and C&#8722;N bond formation and exhibits good functional group tolerance. The reaction proceeded well at room temperature and provided up to 98% yield of the desired products.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Arylsilanes via Barbier&#8208;Type Reaction between Aryl Halides and Chlorosilanes with Magnesium</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The reaction of chlorosilanes with organometallic reagents is an old and well&#8208;developed approach to organosilicon compounds, however, its application was limited due to the sensitivity of organometallic reagents to air, water. Here we display a mechanochemical access to arylsilanes via Barbier&#8208;type reaction of chlorosilanes with aryl halide with magnesium. By treatment of the two halides with Mg powder under electromagnetic milling, a series of arylsilanes are obtained within 15 minutes. Taking the advantages of the electromagnetic milling, this protocol features transition&#8208;metal free, good functional group tolerance, air stable and mild conditions.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfonaminoformyloxylation of Alkenes with N&#8208;Aminopyridinium Salts and DMF</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component sulfonaminoformyloxylation reaction between alkenes, N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts and DMF has been developed, which avoids the usage of erosive formic acid as the formyloxylation reagent. Besides DMF, alkyl and aryl carboxylic acids proved to be feasible nucleophiles to afford various &#946;&#8208;amino esters. The robustness of this method was further demonstrated by its applicability in the late&#8208;stage modification of biological molecules. Control experiments suggested that a sulfonamidyl radical was involved in this reaction.

         <title>Organocatalytic Atroposelective Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Involving Ring Manipulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Axially chiral architectures exist widely in natural products, biologically relevant molecules, chiral ligands and catalysts as well as functional materials. Therefore, catalytic asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers has become one of the most fast&#8208;growing fields in the community of chemistry and rapid advances have occurred. Among different methods reported, the organocatalytic atroposelective dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) involving ring manipulations stands out as a cutting&#8208;edge technology to construct axial chirality from the point of atom/step economy. In this DKR strategy, the configurational lability of starting materials originates from chirally&#8208;labile ring structure of cyclic substrates/intermediates or transient ring formation through noncovalent interactions from acyclic substrates. The two atropisomers of starting material are in equilibrium in the reaction medium, ensuring the constant transformation of the less reactive atropisomer into the more reactive one, and then to a single enantiopure product in the presence of an appropriate organocatalyst. This review summarizes recent advancements on this topic, including their scopes, limitations, mechanisms, applications and provides some insights into further developments.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Sequential C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H Annulation of Indoles with Propargylic Alcohols to Access Hydrobenzo[b]carbazoles</title>

Abstract
Herein, we describe a copper&#8208;catalyzed sequential C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H annulation of indoles with propargylic alcohols for the synthesis of diversely functionalized hydrobenzo[b]carbazole scaffolds. The reaction involves a Friedel&#8208;Crafts addition, 1,5&#8208;H shift, 6&#960; electrocyclization, and dearomatization&#8208;aromatization cascade. Importantly, this is a report of the use of 2&#8208;(diarylmethyl)indoles as three&#8208;carbon synthons in a (3+3) annulation reaction involving C(sp3)&#8722;H indole functionalization under oxidant&#8208;free conditions.

Abstract
Copper&#8208;catalyzed silylarylation of N&#8208;(arylsulfonyl)acrylamides via a tandem silyl radical addition/1,4&#8208;aryl migration/desulfonylation sequence has been developed. This method employs silanes as the precursor of silyl radical and di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide (DTBP) as the initiator. By using this cascade procedure, a series of &#946;&#8208;silyl amide&#8208;pharmaceutical hybrids which contain an &#945;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter were facilely synthesized.

An asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkylated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated 2&#8208;acyl imidazole with nitrones or N,N&#8217;&#8208;cyclic azomethine imines to construct chiral &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkylated &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols or chiral &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkylated 1,3&#8208;diamino compounds has catalyzed by chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal rhodium complexes is reported. The corresponding products with three contiguous tertiary stereocenters were obtained in 62%&#8211;98% yields with stereoselectivities up to &gt;20:1 dr and 99% ee. Remarkably, as low as 0.06&#8197;mol% of chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal rhodium complex can promote a gram&#8208;scale reaction with nitrones or N,N&#8217;&#8208;cyclic azomethine imines.

         <title>Organocatalytic Activation of Pyruvates Toward Michael Addition to Nitroalkenes: Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) Derivatives</title>

Abstract
Despite the significant role of pyruvic acid in biotransformations, the utilization of pyruvates in the field of catalytic asymmetric synthesis has been unexpectedly limited. This statement also applies to enamine catalysis, in which pyruvates seem to be challenging substrates. Recently, the first illustration of the asymmetric addition of pyruvic acid to &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes, catalyzed by a NahE enzyme using the enamine mechanism, has appeared in the literature. Now, we demonstrate pyrrolidine&#8208;based catalyst can mimick enamine mechanism used by this enzyme to activate pyruvates in the asymmetric addition to structurally diverse nitroalkenes to produce highly enantioenriched Michael adducts without the limitations in substrate structures associated with biocatalysts. In addition to confirming that optically pure pyrrolidines can serve as ultimately small organic catalysts in pyruvate activation, we present an exceedingly simple and versatile method for the synthesis of optically pure &#947;&#8208;nitro acids, which are precursors for well&#8208;known active pharmaceutical ingredients namely GABA derivatives

         <title>Nitrosonium Ion Catalyzed Oxidative Bromination of Arenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A nitrosonium catalyzed bromination of electron&#8208;rich arenes has been developed, using bromide salts as bromine sources, oxygen gas as a terminal oxidant and Br&#248;nsted acids (sulfuric acid, TFA or HBr). This arene bromination process is free of transition metals, proceeding in acetic acid and under mild temperatures (25&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C) to give brominated arenes with good to excellent yields. Our mechanistic studies indicated that this oxidative bromination of arenes reaction is catalyzed by nitrosnium ion (NO+), without the involvement of Br2 or Br+. The kinetic isotope effect of this reaction was measured using pentadeuteriophenyl phenyl ether (kH/kD=1.1).

         <title>Synthesis of Vinyl and 1,3&#8208;Dienyl Sulfones Enabled by Photochemical Excitation of Halogen&#8208;Bonding Complexes</title>

Abstract
The photochemical catalyst&#8208;free radical&#8208;based synthesis of vinyl and 1,3&#8208;dienyl sulfones is disclosed. Mechanistic investigations support that the transformations rely on a visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted activation of a halogen&#8208;bonding complex, which is formed between an alkenyl (or 1,3&#8208;dienyl) bromide and a sodium sulfinate salt. The reactions exhibit a wide functional group tolerance (compatible with heteroatoms, electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating groups), finding application in the structural modification of biologically relevant molecules. Eventually, a continuous flow protocol was developed to upscale these transformations.

Abstract
This study describes the palladium&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective amination of chloro(hetero)aryl triflates in the C&#8722;Cl bond for the first time. A newly designed and synthesized alkyl&#8208;pyrazole&#8208;based phosphine ligand, L26 (BirdPhos), which is featured with the pyrazole ligand core and the cyclohexyl group at the C3 and C5 positions, was key to the success of this reaction. A variety of chloro(hetero)aryl triflates coupled with aromatic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic amines smoothly afforded the corresponding products up to 97% yields with general chemoselectivity (&gt;99%) in the C&#8722;Cl bond. Drug analogs were also synthesized via the chemoselective intermolecular amination. This study attempts to investigate the structure&#8208;activity relationship of this new class of ligand through experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Application of Solid Me3SiZnI for the Synthesis of Aryl and Alkyl Trimethylsilanes</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
Silylzinc reagents are desirable for the synthesis of organosilanes due to their compatibility with functional groups; however, the use of pyrophoric silyllithium and dissolved lithium salts in their production hinders their development. Our solid Me3SiZnI circumvents these limitations, and herein, we demonstrate its significance in the synthesis of aryl and alkyl trimethylsilanes via cross&#8208;coupling of aryl and alkyl bromides. The milder reaction condition tolerates functional groups such as MOM, Boc, Bpin, and aldehydes.

         <title>General Access to Clavine Alkaloids via a Rhodium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereoselective Hayashi&#8208;Miyaura Reaction</title>

Abstract
We report the development of the diastereoselective rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular conjugate addition (Hayashi&#8208;Miyaura reaction) of robust and easily handled 4&#8208;pinacolboronic ester D&#8208;tryptophan derivatives tethering an activated alkene as the acceptor. This methodology provides, access to the functionalized chiral tricyclic core of the ergoline skeleton diastereoselectivity and allows further modification for the cyclization of the fused fourth ring present in several clavine alkaloids.

&lt;p&gt;We report the development of the diastereoselective rhodium(I)-catalyzed intramolecular conjugate addition (Hayashi-Miyaura reaction) of robust and easily handled 4-pinacolboronic ester D-tryptophan derivatives tethering an activated alkene as the acceptor. This methodology provides, access to the functionalized chiral tricyclic core of the ergoline skeleton diastereoselectivity and allows further modification for the cyclization of the fused fourth ring present in several clavine alkaloids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A three&#8208;component phase&#8208;transfer catalytic domino reaction involving cyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione&#8208;derived enaminones, 5&#8208;alkenyl rhodanines, and haloalkanes has been developed. This protocol produces a wide range of 3&#8208;thioquinoline&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones in yields of 52&#8211;81%. The construction of a C&#8722;S bond at the C&#8208;3 position of the quinoline&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione framework expands its structural diversity. Studies into the reaction mechanism revealed that the reaction undergoes a conjugate addition, ammonolysis, elimination, and nucleophilic substitution sequence. The synthetic potential of the reaction was demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale syntheses of representative products. Chloroalkyl chains were installed on the sulfur atoms of most products obtained in this reaction. Diversified product derivatives were obtained by exploiting the favorable leaving nature of the chloride moiety.

&lt;p&gt;A three-component phase-transfer catalytic domino reaction involving cyclohexane-1,3-dione-derived enaminones, 5-alkenyl rhodanines, and haloalkanes has been developed. This protocol produces a wide range of 3-thioquinoline-2,5-diones in yields of 52&#8211;81%. The construction of a C&#8722;S bond at the C-3 position of the quinoline-2,5-dione framework expands its structural diversity. Studies into the reaction mechanism revealed that the reaction undergoes a conjugate addition, ammonolysis, elimination, and nucleophilic substitution sequence. The synthetic potential of the reaction was demonstrated by the gram-scale syntheses of representative products.

Abstract
Herein, we report a modular photocatalytic platform for the site&#8208;selective pyridination of saturated hydrocarbon compounds employing organic photoredox catalysis to forge new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. The site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H pyridination could couple benzylic/allylic C&#8722;H bonds with pyridylphosphonium salts, which installed directly and regioselectively from C&#8722;H heteroarenes through a radical&#8208;radical cross coupling mechanism. This synthetic methodology could tolerate a variety of functional groups, complex heteroarenes, even late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals selectively.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed norbornene&#8208;mediated regioselective direct C&#8722;H glycosylation of free N&#8722;H pyrrole and electron&#8208;deficient pyrrole derivatives has been developed. The reaction involves the use of a PdII catalyst and norbornene as a transpositional co&#8208;catalyst, in which a pyrrole&#8208; and norbornyl&#8208;fused palladaheterocycle forms as the key intermediate. The 2&#8208;substituted pyrroles, and other 2,3&#8208;disubstituted pyrroles underwent the selective C5 glycosylation. This reaction is compatible with various types of glycosyl chlorides including D&#8208;mannose, L&#8208;rhamnose, D&#8208;mannofuranose, and D&#8208;ribofuranose. The viability of this strategy is showed by gram&#8208;scale, various synthetic transformation and functionalization.

Abstract
An exclusive anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamination as well as hydroalkoxylation of allylic alcohols catalyzed by a simple catalyst Y(CH2SiMe3)3(THF)2 has been developed, providing a variety of &#947;&#8208;amino and &#947;&#8208;alkoxy alcohols in good yields under mild conditions. Moreover, this protocol is applied to the synthesis of drug molecules Propipocaine and Proroxan. The rare&#8208;earth metal catalyst features readily available, wide substrate compatability, exclusive anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity, and performs in the absence of a base or an additive.

Abstract
Both furan and 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine (1,4&#8208;DHP) are key structural motifs in pharmaceuticals. Herein, we report the synthesis of 4&#8208;(furan&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines from pyridiniums and furfural derivatives under NHC catalysis. This reaction involves the generation of NHC&#8208;bounded trienolates from furfural derivatives and following addition to the C&#8208;4 position of N&#8208;aryl pyridinium salts. This protocol features good yields (41&#8211;99%), and high levels of regioselectivity (&gt;20:1 for all cases).

The front cover picture visualises the colourful beauty of the synthesised compound class of 11H&#8208;indeno&#8208;[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes. In contrast to their colourless structural isomer naphthalene, azulenes are known for exhibiting vibrant colours, resulting from their non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbon nature. Whereas the unsubstituted azulene is blue, the presented indenoazulenes show a range of dark green emerald&#8208;like shades. The golden highlights depict the elegance and eternity of gold in its elemental state, emphasising the crucial role of the metal as a catalyst in the presented methodology. Details can be found in the Research Article by Hashmi and co&#8208;workers (A. V. Mackenroth, A. Ahrens, J. F. Wunsch, R. Berger, F. Rominger, M. Rudolph, A. S. K. Hashmi, Adv. Synth.

Abstract
The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation of alkynyl sulfides at 40&#8201;&#176;C under 5 bars of syngas is described. The method gives access to &#945;&#8208;sulfenyl acroleins with &#945;/&#946; regioselectivities up to 89/11 and is applicable to alkyl or aryl substituted substrates. It is effective even on more complex substrates, such as cysteine and cholesterol derivatives. To demonstrate the synthetic potential of the obtained products, (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;cyclohexyl&#8208;2&#8208;methylsulfenyl acrolein was selected as an example and its sulfur atom selectively oxidized to the corresponding sulfoxide or sulfone. Acid&#8208;promoted (Z) to (E) isomerization of the double bond occurred during oxidation. The three obtained sulfenyl&#8208;, sulfinyl&#8208;, and sulfonyl&#8208;functionalized acroleins have been then used as dienophiles to access cyclohexene carbaldehydes.

Abstract
Mg&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition reactions between 2&#8208;aminobenzaldehydes and ynones offered an array of 2&#8208;arylquinoline motifs merged with a CF3&#8208;acyl group. Furthermore, with Mg&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation as the key step, DDD107498, DDD102542, and Hit analogues were assembled. Finally, a computational study of the reaction mechanism was conducted.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Reaction of 2&#8208;Styrylbenzaldehydes with Indoles in the Synthesis of 1H&#8208;Indenes via 4&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
A cascade reaction between 2&#8208;styrylbenzaldehydes and indoles has been developed for the synthesis of 1H&#8208;indenes. An iodine&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic addition of indoles to an aldehyde group of 2&#8208;styrylbenzaldehydes leads to the formation of carbocation intermediates that undergo 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization to give indenes with a trisubstituted double bond. These indenes are transformed into thermodynamically more stable products with a fully substituted double bond under the reaction conditions. Minor quantities of indolylbenzo[b]carbazoles are also produced as by&#8208;products.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective (4+2) Annulation of Cyclopropane Carbaldehydes with 2&#8208;Mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;Arylethanones</title>

Abstract
Here, we report the organocatalytic enantioselective synthesis of dihydrothiopyran derivatives from trans racemic donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropane carbaldehydes (DACCs) and 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;arylethanone via formal thio (4+2) cycloaddition involving thia&#8208;Michael aldol condensation and annulation. Mechanistic studies indicate a typical kinetic resolution (KR) is involved in this transformation, which results in moderate yields and enantiomeric ratios. Remarkably, this method is characterized by its one&#8208;pot simplicity, mild reaction conditions, and resilience towards air and moisture interference.

Abstract
The design, inspired by the core&#8208;structure of oxicam has allowed the enantioselective synthesis of benzopyranothiazinone motifs employing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. The NHC&#8208;mediated transformation involves the reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes with suitable substituted benzothiazinone derivatives. This process encompasses the initial formation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acylazoliums from ynals and concurrent generation of enolates from benzothiazinone. The culmination of these reactions results in an efficient annulation, yielding the desired products with reasonable yields and high stereoselectivities. This study underscores the potential of NHC catalysis in the streamlined synthesis of complex heterocyclic structures.

Abstract
A substrate&#8208;induced synthesis of coumarin&#8208;fused quinolinones is achieved from 4&#8208;(phenylamino)&#8208;2H&#8208;chromen&#8208;2&#8208;ones using N&#8208;alkyl amines as the solvent and a carbon source under air conditions without any catalysts in one pot. This protocol highlights the special roles of 4&#8208;(phenylamino)&#8208;2H&#8208;chromen&#8208;2&#8208;ones which were not only used as reactants but also as an internal oxidant selectively activated N&#8208;&#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond. This reaction features catalyst&#8208;free, broad substrate scopes (N&#8208;alkyl amines 27 examples and quinolinones 24 examples), operationally simple for the one&#8208;step synthesis, and recovery and recycling of the solvent.

Abstract
We demonstrate the application of chiral magnesium complexes in an asymmetric carbon&#8208;sulfur bond&#8208;forming reaction. Enantioselective and cost&#8208;effective methodology under mild condition for the thia&#8208;Michael addition, utilizing an in&#8197;situ generated chiral dinuclear magnesium&#8208;ProPhenol complex, has been developed. The versatility of this protocol is demonstrated with a broad range of thiol nucleophiles and a wide selection of enones. Enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;ketosulfides are obtained in good to excellent yields and moderate to excellent enantioselectivity. The presented catalytic system exhibits excellent tolerance for structurally different substrates while maintaining high enantioselectivity. This observation aligns with proposed mechanism, wherein the sulfur atom coordinates to the catalyst in close proximity to the reaction center.

         <title>Application of Bertagnini's Salts in a Mechanochemical Approach Toward Aza&#8208;Heterocycles and Reductive Aminations via Imine Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our research has demonstrated that mechanochemical activation is more effective with solid reagents. We have showcased the 
 practicality of Bertagnini's salts, also called aldehyde&#8208;bisulfite adducts, which are crystalline, simplifying preparation and storage. These salts are stable substitutes for liquid aldehydes and ketones that have been effectively employed in reductive amination, 
synthesizing aza&#8208;heterocycles and hydrazones within mechanochemistry. The technique's effectiveness broadens the substrate scopes, simplifies purification, reduces reaction times, and delivers good product yields. Additionally, the thermal stability of the bisulfite adducts has been confirmed through TGA (Thermogravimetric analysis) analysis.</dc:description>

Abstract
A designed chiral thiourea&#8208;iminophosphorane catalyst was developed to afford &#945;&#8208;acyloxythioesters through enantioselective acyl&#8208;transfer/protonation of &#945;&#8208;acyloxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketosulfides. The desired reaction proceeded in good yields with high enantioselectivities using a chiral thiourea&#8208;iminophosphorane bearing a pyrrolidine scaffold.

Abstract
The prospect of developing methods to control the reactivity of metal(oxo) holds appeal for both synthetic and bioinorganic chemistry. In this study, we observed that carboxylic acids enhance reactivity in C&#8722;H oxidation by forming hydrogen bonds with the oxo ligand, thereby increasing the basicity and electrophilicity of the oxo intermediate. Additionally, we discovered that H&#8208;dicarboxylate ligands, such as oxalate, malonate, and maleate, significantly improve the catalyst turnover frequency (up to 760/h) in unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H oxidation. Furthermore, the addition of maleic acid was also found to activate Fe and Mn(pdp)&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H oxygenation. Notably, Ru(bpga)(H&#8208;maleate)2 3&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization exhibited a broad functional group tolerance, including bromine, hydroxyl, benzoate, nitro, nitryl, sulfonate, imide, sulfonylamide, and carbamate, yielding up to 98% in a site&#8208; and chemoselective manner with only 0.1&#8211;2.0&#8197;mmol% loading.

Abstract
A catalyst system based on palladium 2&#8208;methylnaphthyl complexes bearing ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines (YPhos) was found to enable the selective &#947;&#8208;arylation of 1,3&#8208;dioxinone derivatives with diversely functionalized aryl, heteroaryl, and vinyl chlorides. The products were further converted into 1,3&#8208;diketones and heterocycles, highlighting their function as synthetic hubs. Experimental and computational studies revealed that bulky, electron&#8208;rich YPhos ligands are uniquely effective because they enable the oxidative addition of aryl chlorides at room temperature while at the same time efficiently promoting the rate&#8208;limiting reductive elimination step of the thermally sensitive enolates.

         <title>Shifting Access from Pyrimidine&#8208;Spirofused to Fused Benzoheterocycles by Modifying the Activated Group Position</title>

Abstract
The synthesis of pyrimidine&#8208;spirofused indolines from 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes with 2&#8208;sulfonyliminoindolines has been achieved under catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions, in which five atoms of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes were introduced to the spiro&#8208;annulation products via a (5+1) pathway. Subsequently, this strategy was extended to 3&#8208;aminoindoles and 3&#8208;aminobenzothiophenes, but a different reaction pathway (3+3) was observed. In these cases, three&#8208;atoms of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes were incorporated into pyrimidine&#8208;fused indoles/benzothiophenes. These two transformations demonstrate the potential and versatility of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes to construct nitrogen&#8208;heterocycles.

Abstract
Elaborated molecular architectures, specifically those bearing one or more carbon stereocenters, stand as an important class of carbocyclic and heterocyclic frameworks because they are frequently occurring core structures in numerous natural products and biologically active pharmaceutical molecules. Over the past few decades, the development of versatile synthetic approaches via cascade cyclization reactions of 1,6&#8208;enynes for the construction of a series of fused and spiro compounds has been the focus of a great deal of research initiatives. These synthesis strategies are peculiarly fascinating in the context of the assembly of a wide array of pharmaceutical molecules, natural products, agrochemicals, and functional materials. In this review, recent developments in the transformations of 1,6&#8208;enynes with diverse coupling reagents are summarized since 2018, which could be divided into five categories: 1) Introduction; 2) Transition metal catalyzed cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes; 3) Metal&#8208;free cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes; 4) Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes; 5) Electrocatalytic cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes.

         <dc:description>N&#8208;Heterocyclic compounds, in particular, quinolines and quinazolines are frequently used in medicinal chemistry. Therefore, the direct and clean synthesis of these valuable scaffolds has been a great interest for many years. 2&#8208;Aminobenzyl alcohols as an alternative reactant instead of unstable and expensive 2&#8208;aminobenzaldehydes can be used in the construction of N&#8208;fused heterocycles including quinolines, quinazolines, oxazines, thiazines, selenazines, imidazoles, diazepines, etc. In this review article, we have discussed recent developments in the use of 2&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohols in the synthesis of diverse heterocycles</dc:description>
