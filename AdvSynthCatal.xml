         <title>Illuminating the Path of Rearrangement: Visible Light&#8208;Driven Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Substituted Olefins Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed reactions are among the most straightforward and efficient methods to proficiently build Csp2&#8208;Csp2 bonds. Nevertheless, thermal activation remains mandatory in most cases, which may decrease the compatibility with sensitive functional groups. In this context, improvements of conventional strategies must be an important source of research in order to enhance the applicability of such methods for building complex scaffolds. In this work, we contribute to this aim by implying visible&#8208;light as the sole energy source in a Pd&#8208;catalyzed rearrangement reaction involving N&#8208;tosylhydrazones and aryl halides. These mild reaction conditions efficiently allow oxidative addition, aryl migration and &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination at room temperature, allowing the construction of various 1,1&#8217; disubstituted olefins.

         <title>Pot&#8208;Economical Synthesis of Fluorinated Pyrrolizinone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A new family of fluorinated dihydropyrrolizinones has been synthesized starting from fluorinated enamino amides and aliphatic conjugated ketones. The reaction comprises a cross metathesis reaction followed by a tandem cycloaromatization/ enamine hydrolysis/ intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation sequence. This pot&#8208;economical process takes place in good yields (35&#8208;67%), taking into account that it consists of four consecutive reactions. Aromatic enones are also good partners for this protocol although, in this case, the cross metathesis reaction has to be performed in a separated step.

         <title>Recent Advances in Annulation Reactions of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketoximes for the Synthesis of Structurally Diversified Heterocycles</title>

Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed or metal&#8208;free&#8208;mediated annulation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketoximes with unsaturated coupling partners has emerged as a powerful protocol for the assembly of diverse functionalized heterocycles, which is attributed to the ability of the oxime functionality to serve as a directing group for C&#8722;H activation, to undergo reductive N&#8722;O bond cleavage, and be activated by Lewis acids or reduced by iodide salt. In this review, we summarize the coupling reactions of three types of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketoximes with various organic compounds containing unsaturated bonds such as alkenes, alkynes, carbonyls, nitriles and so on over the past decades. The reaction conditions, selected examples of the reaction scope, limitations, and reasonable mechanisms are critically described. Furthermore, the prospects for future challenges and opportunities are also explored.

Abstract
A practical and highly efficient radical 1,3&#8208;thiosulfonylation of allylboronic esters and allylketones with thiosulfonates via 1,2&#8208;functional group migration is described, affording diverse 1,3&#8208;thiosulfonylated products in good yields. Notably, this method can be performed under photocatalyst&#8208;, base&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions, which features operational simplicity, high atom&#8208;economy, excellent functional group tolerance and versatile transformations of the products.

         <title>Harnessing Nitroarenes in Streamlined Synthesis of 4&#8208;Quinolones via Reductive C&#8722;N Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The synthesis of quinolones is a key technology for the preparation of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Herein we present a step&#8208;economical methodology for streamlined synthesis of 4&#8208;quinolones from a tandem process involving a reduction of nitroarenes, an aza&#8208;Michael addition and an intramolecular Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination. This strategy uses synthetically upstream nitroarenes as viable aniline surrogates and B2(pin)2 as an enabling organic reductant, producing a wide range of 4&#8208;quinolones bearing different functional groups in a step&#8208;economical fashion. The potential value of this protocol is highlighted by late&#8208;stage installation of 4&#8208;quinolone moiety onto bioactive compounds.

Abstract
Due to their versatility and stability, alkylboronic acids and their derivatives have emerged as valuable reagents in organic synthesis, particularly in radical chemistry for constructing diverse carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds. Recent advancements have expanded their applications, enabling the generation of alkyl radicals under milder conditions, safely and cost&#8208;effectively. This mini&#8208;review focuses on recent advances in the methods by which radicals are generated from alkylboronic acids and derivatives, with a special focus on the reaction mechanism and applications of the methodology to different classes of reactions. We hope this review will enrich the knowledge and help further design and development in radical&#8208;based organic transformations using alkyl boronic acid and derivatives.

         <title>Synthesis of Polysubstituted Naphthalenes via Metal&#8208;Free Borylative Cyclization of o&#8208;Alkynylstyrenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A selective, metal&#8208;free method for the synthesis of boron&#8208;functionalized polysubstituted naphthalenes via BCl3&#8208;mediated cyclization of &#945;&#8208;substituted o&#8208;alkynylstyrenes is described. The reaction exhibits broad substrate scope, tolerating various groups such as ethers, sulfides and halogens, and delivers high yields under mild conditions, even at gram scale. The resulting Bpin&#8208;functionalized naphthalenes serve as versatile building blocks, facilitating further transformations of the C&#8722;B bond into C&#8722;H, C&#8722;C, C&#8722;I, C&#8722;O, and C&#8722;N bonds, thereby increasing molecular complexity and enabling the design of more functionalized products. Notably, this sustainable and straightforward protocol selectively introduces the Bpin group at the sterically hindered &#945;&#8208;carbon of the naphthalene framework, complementing C&#8211;H borylations of the naphthalene core, that preferentially occur at the &#946;&#8208;position. As a result, the developed approach significantly broadens the accessibility of B&#8208;functionalized naphthalene derivatives for synthetic and application&#8208;oriented purposes.

         <title>Synthesis of spirolactones from carbonyls via carboborylation of N&#8208;sulfonylhydrazones with alkoxycarbonylalkylboronic acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward synthesis of spirolactones from carbonyls via N&#8208;tosylhydrazones is described. The process consist in the reaction between the N&#8208;tosylhydrazone and ethoxycarbonylethylboronic acid or ethoxycarbonylpropylboronic acid, leading to spiro &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones or &#948;&#8208;valerolactones respectively. The transformation takes place by carboborylation of the N&#8208;tosylhydrazone followed by oxidation of the homologated boronic acid that delivers a hydroxyester, which undergoes further lactonization to yield the spirocyclic lactone. Depending on the structure of the starting N&#8208;tosylhydrazone, thermal or photochemical protocols were applied for the key carboborylation reaction. The usefulness of the process is illustrated by the application on a variety of natural products and biologically relevant carbonyl containing molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Directing Group&#8208;Assisted Site&#8208;Selective Di&#8208;ortho C&#8722;H Functionalizations via Double C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The directing group (DG)&#8208;assisted transition metal (TM)&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H activation and functionalization has become a popular approach in the synthesis of natural products, pharmaceuticals, and late&#8208;stage functionalization. In particular the ortho&#8208;selective C&#8722;H functionalization is frequently addressed. One DG generally directs the mono&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization. However, over the years there are some exceptional reactions have been reported where one DG directs di&#8208;ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization offering extra functionalization in one&#8208;pot. There is no generalization in this type of reactions. In this comprehensive report, we have summarized the di&#8208;ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization reactions reported in the recent two decades (2004&#8208;2024) and provided the current status and future perspective for further modifications. This discussion covers DG&#8208;assisted site&#8208;selective di&#8208;ortho&#8208;Arylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;Alkenylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkynylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;cyanation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;amination, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;thiolation/selenation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;carbonylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;halogenation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;oxygenation, and unsymmetrical di&#8208;ortho C&#8208;H functionalization of inert aryl and heteroaryl C&#8722;H bonds.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel oxidative rearrangement of the diazene moiety in 3&#8208;aryl azo indoles, leading to the formation of C3&#8208;oxo&#8208;C2&#8208;amino indoles with excellent regioselectivity. This transformation, achieved using oxone in water at ambient temperature, proceeds in good yields with broad functional group tolerance including and azaindoles. Mechanistic insights were gained through control experiments, crystal structures, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Experimental and theoretical photophysical studies, along with cellular uptake and colocalization experiments, demonstrate that the resulting compounds selectively bind to lipid droplets (LDs), highlighting their potential as fluoroprobes for LD detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeletal Editing of 6&#8208;(Hetero)arenes via Single&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Atom Insertion</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The skeleton editing strategy has emerged as a transformative approach in drug discovery and agrochemical innovation, enabling precise modifications through the insertion, elimination, or substitution of specific atoms within the core carbon or heterocyclic frameworks of molecules. Recent advancements in carbene chemistry have led to significant breakthroughs in single&#8208;carbon&#8208;atom insertion reactions, particularly in the context of five&#8208;membered carbon and heterocyclic systems. However, the application of this strategy to six&#8208;membered arenes and heteroarenes has faced considerable challenges, largely due to the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers associated with disrupting the inherent aromaticity of these systems and driving their conversion to seven&#8208;membered rings. In recent years, the development of novel catalytic paradigms, including photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;catalytic methods, has catalyzed groundbreaking progress in this area. Notably, the design and implementation of asymmetric skeletal editing systems for arenes have significantly expanded the scope and versatility of this methodology, offering new avenues for the rational manipulation of molecular architectures. This review aims to offer a detailed summary and analysis of recent progress in skeletal editing reactions associated with single&#8208;carbon&#8208;atom insertion and outlining the future potential applications of this technology.</dc:description>

Abstract
Chiral, vicinal diols are of high interest for academic research and industrial applications. For synthesizing chiral diols, enzymes are important catalysts due to their high selectivity and ability to work under tolerable temperature and no pressure. In this study, two consecutive enzyme&#8208;catalyzed steps were used for the asymmetric synthesis of aliphatic, vicinal diols with high product concentrations and chiral purity. The reaction comprised a ligation step employing lyases and a subsequent reduction step using oxidoreductases. Either in an aqueous buffer or an organic solvent, the potentially biobased aldehydes acetaldehyde, propanal, butanal, and pentanal were used as substrates. Here, all possible stereoisomers of 2,3&#8208;butanediol, 3,4&#8208;hexanediol, 4,5&#8208;octanediol, and 5,6&#8208;decanediol were produced with isomeric content values between 72% and &gt;99%, and concentrations between 4.1 and 115&#8197;mM. This work shows how four symmetric, chiral, vicinal diols can be synthesized by combining enzymes in a modular way, including exemplarily scaling.

Abstract
The manuscript describes a formal [10+2] higher&#8208;order cycloaddition between 2&#8208;arylideneindan&#8208;1&#8208;ones and &#945;&#8208;alkylidene azlactones as higherene precursors and higherenofiles respectively. The reaction is realized under Br&#248;nsted&#8208;base catalysis utilizing the phase transfer catalysis approach. The key intermediate is an isobenzofulvene&#8208;derived polyenolate which acts as a 10&#8208;electron component in the higher&#8208;order cycloaddition. By using this strategy, a series of structurally diverse compounds containing a polycyclic hydrocarbon scaffold was prepared in 79&#8211;99% yields. In addition, the potential of the obtained [10+2]&#8208;cycloadducts has been confirmed by transformations, including the synthesis of a highly&#8208;valuable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted N&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;aminoester.

         <title>Controlling Catalyst Speciation to Achieve Room Temperature Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Aminations with Aryl and Heteroaryl Chlorides</title>

Abstract
The amination of aryl halides with palladium catalysts (Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination) is a widely used transformation in synthetic and drug discovery chemistry. In this report, we demonstrate that a monometallic 2&#8208;phosphinoimidazole Pd catalyst exhibits comparable or enhanced reactivity when compared to all ligands screened for room temperature amination of aryl chlorides with secondary amines. The di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine derivative showed extremely high reactivity while the di&#8208;isopropyl variant led to almost complete loss of catalytic activity. Computational and experimental mechanistic and kinetic studies indicate that a monometallic Pd structure rather than a bimetallic Pd structure is key to fast catalysis. The di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine ligand has fast catalysis because it thermodynamically disfavors the formation of a much less active bimetallic Pd complex. A wide substrate scope is demonstrated for the arylation of secondary amines with aryl chlorides using our new catalyst system.

In this report, we demonstrate that a monometallic 2-phosphinoimidazole Pd catalyst exhibits comparable or enhanced reactivity when compared to all ligands screened for room temperature amination of aryl chlorides with secondary amines. The di-tert-butylphosphine derivative showed extremely high reactivity while the di-isopropyl variant led to almost complete loss of catalytic activity. Computational and experimental mechanistic and kinetic studies indicate that a monometallic Pd structure rather than a bimetallic Pd structure is key to fast catalysis.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Engineering of Oleate Hydratase for the Synthesis of Small Chiral Alcohols without Decoy Molecule</title>

Abstract
Small and chiral secondary alcohols are sought&#8208;after compounds that are frequently used in the synthesis of biologically active compounds. However, their stereochemically correct synthesis remains a challenge for the chemical industry. Synthetic routes are restrained by multiple steps and thus low atom efficiency. Here we employ engineered variants from the oleate hydratase from E. meningoseptica to produce chiral C5&#8208;C8 secondary alcohols within a single step. First, we established a two&#8208;phase system (2&#8208;PS) to trap the volatile substrates/products which facilitated semi&#8208;rational mutagenesis in the active site and tunnel of the enzyme. These efforts led to variants with an up to 20&#8208;fold increase in catalytic activity and &gt;99% ee, notably, without the use of a decoy molecule. Computational analysis indicated structural changes in the tunnel radius, ligand transport and energy profiles, which gave us hints to explain the enhanced performance of the variants. Interestingly, scaling up the reaction volume demonstrated significant increases in product concentrations, leading up to a 100&#8208;fold increase in comparison to the current benchmark. This new 2&#8208;PS and the engineered enzyme variants offer a promising approach for a scalable, asymmetric hydration of small unactivated alkenes, which would drastically ease the access to chiral alcohol&#8208;based pheromones or drugs.

Abstract
A functionalized heterogeneous Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Cu&#8208;2D&#8208;MOF) was synthesized through the reaction of Cu(NO3)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O with 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoroterephthalic acid and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine. The synthesized material underwent comprehensive characterization using various techniques, including FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy, N2 physical adsorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Subsequently, the catalytic performance of Cu&#8208;2D&#8208;MOFs was assessed in the hydrophosphorylation and aerobic oxidative dehydrogenative coupling reactions involving alkynes and P&#8722;H bonds. The catalyst demonstrated remarkable catalytic activity in both transformations, effectively yielding a wide variety of (E)&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;phosphoryl and alkynyl&#8208;phosphoryl compounds, respectively. Notably, the incorporation of this MOF material facilitated the phosphorylation reaction to proceed seamlessly, eliminating the necessity for supplementary small molecular organic ligands. Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrated ease of recovery and recyclability through a simple recovery process. Employing a systematic approach of sequential control experiments, we have delineated the potential transformation pathway of the reaction and consequently hypothesized a probable reaction mechanism for the observed transformation.

Abstract
A base&#8208;mediated one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step, four&#8208;component reaction has been developed to synthesize imidazole&#8208;4(2H)&#8208;ones, utilizing commercially available amino acid esters, aldehydes, alkynes, and amino alcohols. Control experiments and isolation of the intermediate revealed the mechanistic details. This four&#8208;component reaction proceeds via imine formation, followed by the nucleophilic addition of alkyne to form a propargylamine precursor. Subsequently, the propargylamine precursor under undergoes base&#8208;mediated conversion into 1&#8208;azadiene, followed by in situ ketene formation to generate (allylideneamino)prop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;one. The nucleophilic addition of amino alcohol and subsequent intramolecular cyclization provides imidazole&#8208;4 (2H)&#8208;ones exclusively.

Abstract
A chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of axially chiral alkenes was developed via an enantioselective and para&#8208;selective Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction between phenols and 1&#8208;alkynylnaphth&#8208;2&#8208;ols. This methodology features an efficient hydroarylation with high functional group tolerance, complete para&#8208;selectivity, excellent yields (up to 99%), and enantioselectivities (up to 94% ee) in the presence of a N&#8208;triflylphosphoramide catalyst. DFT calculations were performed to investigate para&#8208;selectivity and results indicate that both kinetics and thermodynamics parameters are more favorable compared to ortho&#8208;selectivity.

Abstract
This article presents a method for asymmetric formal cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of benzylic alcohols with ketones through combined electrooxidation and organocatalysis. Employing inexpensive and environmentally friendly proline as a chiral organocatalyst, various benzylic alcohols and simple ketones serve as substrates to directly obtain diverse chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxycarbonyl compounds with moderate to good yields (up to 85%) and excellent stereoselectivity (up to 99% ee and 99:1&#8197;dr). The reaction proceeds under mild conditions at room temperature in air, without oxidants or additives, demonstrating robust functional group tolerance and atom efficiency. Hydrogen gas released at the cathode is the sole byproduct. Using L&#8208; or D&#8208;proline allows straightforward access to both chiral configurations of &#946;&#8208;hydroxycarbonyl compounds.

Abstract
Chiral organoboron compounds are essential intermediates in various significant reactions. However, there are still few efficient catalysts for their synthesis. This paper reports a novel catalytic material for chiral asymmetric boron conjugate addition reactions: mesoporous Cu2O nanospheres (M&#8722;Cu2O). M&#8722;Cu2O is approximately 0.55&#8197;&#956;m, exhibiting dense and uniformly distributed worm&#8208;like pores. It features a specific surface area of 15.7&#8197;m2/g and an average pore size of 14.3&#8197;nm. Under the conditions of Toluene:H2O=9:1, with a chiral ligand amount of 3.6&#8197;mol% and no additional base, it achieves a high yield (98% yield) and impressive enantioselectivity (99% ee) for the template substrate chalcone using only 3.0&#8197;mol% of the catalyst. Notably, the catalyst can be easily recovered and maintains robust catalytic performance after seven cycles, yielding 92% and an ee value of 90%. This work presents a mild and effective method for synthesizing chiral boron compounds in an aqueous phase, significantly enhancing the application potential of mesoporous copper oxide nanospheres.

Abstract
Herein, an iron&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the aromatization&#8208;driven deconstruction and decarboxylation of ketone&#8208;derived dihydroquinazolinones in reaction with unsaturated carboxylic acids is reported. A diverse range of fluoroacrylic acids and cinnamic acids reacted effectively with dihydroquinazolinones, yielding essential monofluoroalkenes and alkenes with excellent stereoselectivity. Additionally, spiro&#8208;dihydroquinazolinones served as suitable substrates, facilitating the synthesis of valuable quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones featuring alkene motifs. This protocol is notable for its operational simplicity and versatility, enabling the chemical diversification of active molecules.

Abstract
Functionalized pyridines and 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines are crucial organic entities in natural products, organic materials, drugs and catalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functionalized pyridines and 1,2-dihydropyridines are crucial organic entities in natural products, organic materials, drugs and catalysts. Despite progress, a facile and eco-friendly synthesis remains desirable so far. In this context, we disclose a novel visible light-promoted radical cascade sulfonylation-cyclization-aromatization of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-propargyl enamides with selenosulfonates. This approach avoids the use of metal- or photocatalyst, bases and external oxidants, marking a significant advance in sustainable and green chemistry accords. Utilizing this protocol, we successfully synthesized a diverse range of sulfonated 1,2-dihydropyridines and pyridines, featuring good functional group compatibility, simple operation and mild condition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alkylation of Imines with Alkyl Halides under Electrochemical Conditions</title>

Abstract
An electrochemical protocol for the alkylation of imines was developed by using easily available alkyl halides as the alkyl sources, graphite felt (GF) as anode and zinc plate as cathode. Various substituted imines, alkyl bromides and alkyl iodides were suitable for this reaction and a series of &#945;&#8208;branched amines were obtained in moderate to good yields. This method provides a green way for the addition of imines to avoid the need for metal reagents, chemical oxidants and reductants, which makes it has a good application prospect in drug synthesis.

Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrofunctionalization of alkynes and, more precisely, the intramolecular hydro&#8208;oxycarbonylation (cycloisomerization) of acetylenic acids, has been widely employed as a key step in cascade processes for the construction of valuable and complex molecules. However, in contrast with other aminonucleophiles, no method has been reported for the reaction between primary monoamines and non&#8208;activated alkynoic acids. Hence, a procedure has been devised for the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective preparation of 5&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams via a copper&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction between alkynoic acids and amines. The developed protocol proves to be scalable and demonstrates significant tolerance to a wide range of structurally diverse alkynoic acids and amines bearing various functional groups, as evidenced by 60 high&#8208;yielding examples. An exhaustive experimental and computational analysis of the reaction is also provided to unravel the nature and role of the copper catalyst, the observed regioselectivity and the mechanism of the reaction.

         <title>Au(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Hydroarylation of Allenes for the Synthesis of Tetrahydrodiazepines or Tetrahydrodiazonines</title>

Abstract
Allenes tethered to pyrroles undergo Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation leading to tetrahydrodiazepines or tetrahydrodiazonines. The regioselectivity of the reaction is governed by both the substitution pattern of the allene and the nature of the Au(I) ligand. Hence, alkyl&#8208;gem&#8208;disubstituted allenes preferentially lead to tetrahydrodiazepines via 7&#8208;exo&#8208;cyclizations, while aryl&#8208;substituted allenes preferentially lead to tetrahydrodiazonines via 9&#8208;endo&#8208;cyclization when a phosphite ligand is used. Enantioselective reactions have been developed with the SEGPHOS chiral ligand, leading to chiral heterocycles with high enantioselectivity (up to 96% ee). In addition, DFT calculations have streamlined the regioselectivity (7&#8208;exo vs 9&#8208;endo) of these gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations.

         <title>Photoinduced Catalytic Alkylation of Active Methine Compounds with Nonactivated Alkenes Using Yttrium Triflate as a Lewis Acid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 8, April 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Photoinduced catalytic alkylation reactions of active methine compounds with nonactivated alkenes have been developed using an organophotocatalyst, a metal Lewis acid, an arylthiol, and an amine base catalyst system. The alkylation reactions proceeded smoothly under ambient conditions with blue light irradiation, affording the desired products bearing quaternary carbon centers in high yields. Furthermore, enantioselective alkylation with an nonactivated alkene was achieved using a chiral Lewis acid.

Abstract
Regio&#8208; and stereoselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalizations of saturated nitrogen heterocycles, amines/amides are challenging and have emerged as an important topic of research in the area of C(sp3)&#8722;H activation. Herein, we have summarized various &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H activation/functionalization methods; this review provides an overview of various trending approaches for &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation/functionalization of saturated nitrogen heterocycles, amines/amides. The regio&#8208; and stereoselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation methods are classified based on the reaction pathways. The literature methods including directing group or ligand&#8208;assisted transformations, reactions proceeding through enamine intermediate, redox&#8208;neutral methods and other trending methods including photoredox and transitional metal&#8208;free methods are discussed with recent updates.

         <title>Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis: A Modular In Situ Vicinal Functionalization Strategy for Recent Developments of Carbohydrate Chemistry</title>

Abstract
The palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis, first identified by Catellani in 1997, provides an efficient approach for synthesizing highly functionalized aromatic compounds that are challenging to obtain through conventional methods. The developed synthetic approach integrates selective C&#8722;H bond activation with sequential reactions, allowing for the targeted functionalization of both the ortho and ipso positions of aryl halides via aryl&#8208;norbornadiene&#8208;palladacycle (ANP), which in turn ensures high chemoselectivity and regioselectivity of the products. It is estimated that approximately 20% of all natural products are glycosylated, with the carbohydrates linked to these compounds frequently playing a critical role in their biological activity. Currently, research in carbohydrate chemistry predominantly concentrates on polysubstitutional derivatization or vicinal functionalization strategies. However, the limited availability of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted compounds has been scarcely investigated, and previous studies often relied on directional group assistance to achieve disubstitution. Recently, significant advancements have been achieved with Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis, an area that has gained considerable importance in carbohydrate chemistry, presenting an opportunity to inspire further research interest in Catellani reactions. In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the Pd/NBE strategy within the realm of sugar chemistry, encompass early research and advancement in catalytic reactions, outline synthetic potential, highlight the significant progress made, and emphasize the most recent developments and their applications in&#8197;situ vicinal functionalization of carbohydrate derivatives.

Abstract
A rhodium&#8197;(II)&#8208;catalyzed transannulation reaction between aldehyde&#8208;tethered N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles and indoles was reported, which resulted in the formation of functionalized tetrahydroisoquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones. This reaction is notable for its broad substrate scope, including a variety of N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles and different indoles. The addition of a protonic acid is essential for improving the yield of the desired tetrahydroisoquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;one products.

Abstract
The incorporation of carbon&#8208;fluorine bonds can profoundly influence the chemical and physical properties of drugs, agrochemicals, and materials. Different methods allow the installation of CF3, CF2H units and C&#8722;F bonds including trifluoro&#8208; and difluoromethoxylations, reflecting the limited diversity of reactions available to synthetic chemists. We introduce the 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethoxy group through an electro&#8208;oxidative iodination of alkenes as a versatile substituent for fluorine chemists. An iodoarene serves as an unusual iodine source facilitating the 1,2&#8208;iodoalkoxylation of a broad range of industrially relevant aliphatic alkenes in high yields (31&#8211;98%) showing high Markovnikov regioselectivity.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Oxidative C&#8722;H Esterification of Quinoxalinones with Arylaldehydes under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 8, April 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The first example for photo&#8208;induced oxidative C&#8722;H esterification of quinoxalinones with arylaldehydes under benign conditions has been reported. This method is distinguished by its capacity to accommodate a diverse array of quinoxalinones and arylaldehydes, culminating in the synthesis of the corresponding esters with moderate to good yields. The protocol is lauded for its environmental benignity, eschewing the need for hazardous transition metals and costly photocatalysts, and relies solely on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as the oxidant. Moreover, the scalability of the synthesis and the derivative transformations of the products have been demonstrated, underscoring its practical utility in organic synthesis.

         <title>Synthesis and Applications of 9/9,9&#8208;Substituted Fluorene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorene derivatives have obtained broad interest in organic synthesis, materials chemistry, and pharmaceutical fields due to their unique structure, physical, chemical and photoelectric properties. Moreover, the bare fluorene molecule has a variety of reactive sites that provides the transformations to synthesize various functionalized intermediates, polymers and macrocycles. Recently, C&#8208;C bond formation is one of useful tool in fluorene molecule modifications due to the low toxicity and high efficiency. This review covers the synthesis of various fluorene&#8208;based small molecules, fluorene&#8208;based polymers, fluorene&#8208;based conjugated materials and fluorene&#8208;based nanogrids via the C&#8208;C bond formation at the 9&#8208;position of fluorene derivatives. Transition&#8208;metal catalysis and metal&#8208;free methods to synthesize different fluorene derivatives are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomative, Intramolecular Bromoetherification of Carbohydrate&#8208;derived Glycosyl Furans: Access to Enantiopure 6&#8208;Bromo&#8208;Furo[3,2&#8208;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]furans</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosyl furans represent versatile chiral platform molecules that can be readily accessed via the Garcia Gonzalez reaction. Herein, we report a dearomative, intramolecular bromoetherification of carbohydrate&#8208;derived glycosyl furans to generate enantiopure 6&#8208;bromo&#8208;furo[3,2&#8208;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]furans in up to 69% yield. The method employs &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Br aromatic amides as competent electrophilic halogenating agents that outpace other known reagents. The method works for glycosyl furans derived from the Garcia Gonzalez reactions of various active methylene compounds and unprotected sugars. Further functionalization of the C&#8208;Br bond of the 6&#8208;bromo&#8208;furo[3,2&#8208;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]furans is explored as well.</dc:description>

Abstract
A novel, metal&#8208;free, air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;compatible one&#8208;pot tandem protocol for the regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of Z&#8208;vinyl sulfides (achieving yields up to 99%), is reported. This straightforward and efficient process combines the selective hydroiodination of internal alkynes, promoted by the eutectic mixture choline iodide (ChI)/p&#8208;TsOH (1:1) under mild, bench&#8208;type conditions (without the need for toxic molecular HI), with a subsequent sulfenylation step of the in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated vinyl iodides. This final step is compatible with aromatic, heteroaromatic and aliphatic thiols. Notably, the methodology addresses a longstanding challenge by enabling the selective formation of Markovnikov products with Z&#8208;configuration in the thiolation of secondary propiolamides. It also avoids volatile organic solvents and is easily scalable to gram quantities, offering significant advantages for synthetic applications.

It also avoids volatile organic solvents and is easily scalable to gram quantities, offering significant advantages for synthetic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tunable Preparation of &#946;&#8208;Substituted Alkenoate Esters via Radical Alkenylation of C(sp3)&#8211;H Bonds with Allenoates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A photocatalytic strategy for the radical alkenylation of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds with 2,3&#8208;allenoate esters is described. The protocol takes place upon irradiation of the reaction mixture in the presence of the decatungstate anion, which triggers C&#8722;H cleavage in the chosen aliphatic substrates. The photogenerated C&#8208;centered radicals add regioselectively to the central C(sp)&#8208;atom of the cumulenic structure, delivering an allyl&#8208;type radical adduct that finally leads to the &#946;&#8208;substituted alkenoate ester of interest. When an aliphatic allenoate is adopted, the protocol leads to the selective formation of a &#946;,&#947;&#8208;alkenoate, while the corresponding phenyl ester delivers a mixture of &#946;,&#947;&#8208; and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;alkenoates. Rationalization of the observed regioselectivity is supported by computational work, which highlights how the steric demand of the allenoate ester at the radical adduct level determines the reaction outcome. The versatility of the protocol, which can also take place under (telescoped) flow conditions, is further demonstrated by the possibility to divert the reaction outcome toward the selective formation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208; or &#945;,&#946;&#8208;alkenoate esters by performing the photocatalyzed process alone or in combination with a subsequent base&#8208;promoted C=C double bond migration, respectively.

Abstract
An electrochemical benzylic C(sp3)&#8211;H amination reaction of amino group&#8208;substituted alkylarenes with benzimidazoles was developed. The reaction showed good selectivity, and C&#8722;H cleavage occurred selectively at the benzylic position other than the &#945;&#8208;position of the amino group. Atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic, catalyst&#8208;free, external oxidant&#8208;free, H2 as the only and clean byproduct are the additional characteristics of this electrochemical reaction.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance and Recyclable Multisite Catalytic System for CO2 Fixation Using Crown Ether&#8208;Linked Schiff Base and Alkali Halides</title>

Abstract
The development of efficient and sustainable catalytic systems for CO2 fixation is crucial for carbon&#8208;neutral chemical processes. We now report a&#160;high&#8208;performance and recyclable multisite catalytic system&#160;based on a&#160;crown ether&#8208;linked Schiff base&#160;in combination with&#160;alkali halides&#160;for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and CO2. The designed catalyst features&#160;multiple active sites, including a&#160;Lewis acidic alkali ion center and a nucleophilic iodide source, enabling the efficient activation of epoxides under solvent&#8208;free conditions with atmospheric pressure. Systematic studies on the effects of cations and calcium salts revealed that the&#160;multi&#8208;activation mechanism&#160;plays a critical role in enhancing the catalytic performance. The catalyst exhibited&#160;a high selectivity and activity, achieving up to&#160;a 97% yield&#160;of cyclic carbonates at&#160;atmospheric CO2 pressure and 70&#8201;&#176;C. The simulated post&#8208;combustion exhaust gas (CO2: 7.5%, N2: 92.5%, relative humidity: 90%) was concentrated to 97% and used as the material for the reaction to yield 90% of styrene carbonate from styrene oxide. Furthermore, the catalyst was&#160;easily recovered and reused for multiple cycles&#160;without any significant loss of activity. This study provides a practical and environmentally&#8208;friendly approach for CO2 utilization, contributing to the advancement of sustainable catalytic processes.

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of Quinazolinones Through Boiler Flue Gas CO2 Utilization Via Pd@POP&#8208;1 Catalyst Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A catalyst, Pd@POP&#8208;1, has been successfully synthesized by embedding palladium (Pd) nanoparticles into a nitrogen&#8208;rich porous organic polymer (POP) through the copolymerization of imidazole and triazine ionic salts with divinylbenzene. This catalyst features a unique imine (&#8722;C=N) structure within the triazine ring and multiple coupled imine groups, which significantly enhances CO2 adsorption efficiency and exhibits remarkable catalytic performance. At ambient pressure and mild temperatures, Pd@POP&#8208;1 effectively converts low&#8208;concentration CO2 (less than 15 vol.%) into quinazolinones, even in the presence of SO2 (up to 428&#8197;mg/m3) and NO2 (up to 221&#8197;mg/m3), achieving high yields. Remarkably, Pd@POP&#8208;1 also efficiently transforms CO2 from boiler flue gas, which contains 10 vol.% CO2, into quinazolinones with satisfactory yields. This approach not only provides an eco&#8208;friendly alternative for quinazolinone production by replacing phosgene with actual flue gas as a carbon source but also represents a promising strategy for the resource utilization of CO2 in flue gas.

Abstract
Herein, we report a silver&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cascade reaction of 2&#8208;alkynylaniline tethered heteroenone systems to achieve the synthesis of [6&#8211;5&#8211;7&#8211;6] heterotetracyclic indole fused benzoxepino&#8208; and benzoazepino scaffolds. The reaction proceeded through a silver(I)&#8208;initiation cascade intramolecular 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization followed by 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization to enable the structurally diverse [6&#8211;5&#8211;7&#8211;6] heterotetracyclic adducts in modest to good yields.

         <title>Development of Photo&#8208;Biocatalytic Redox System for Asymmetric Synthesis of Optically Active Amines Using Blue Light and Transaminases. A Case Study Toward Mavacamten</title>

Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Chiral amines are versatile building blocks for the asymmetric synthesis of optically pure high&#8208;added&#8208;value chemicals, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural products. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step sequential deracemization of racemic sec&#8208;alcohols to optically enriched primary amines throught a photo&#8208;biocatalytic oxidation&#8208;reductive amination linear cascade. In the first step, near&#8208;to&#8208;quantitative oxidation of a set of racemic (hetero)benzylic alcohols into prochiral ketones was accomplished using visible light photoredox catalysis relying on 440&#8197;nm blue LEDs irradiation, 9&#8208;fluorenone as a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalyst, and O2&#8208;saturated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the reaction medium and a quencher of the in&#8197;situ generated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The intermediary ketones were further converted into the corresponding non&#8208;racemic amines with up to 99% conversion, high&#8208;to&#8208;excellent optical purity (90&#8211;99.9% ee), and complementary absolute configuration via a stereoselective reductive amination catalyzed by lyophilized E. coli cells containing the respective (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;selective recombinant transaminases (E. coli/TAs) in an aqueous KPi buffer in the presence of pyridoxal&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate (PLP) as cofactor and isopropylamine (iPrNH2) as an amino group donor. The developed photo&#8208;biocatalytic system was scaled up for racemic 1&#8208;phenylethanol (1.0&#8197;mmol), furnishing (S)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethylamine with 91% conv., 82% isolated yield and 99% ee. An exemplary functionalization of the obtained (S)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylamine with 6&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;isopropylpyrimidine&#8208;2,4(1H,3H)&#8208;dione led to afford an enantiomerically enriched newly launched cardiac&#8208;specific myosin inhibitor mavacamten in 76% yield and 99% ee. In addition, a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed, furnishing the first crystal structure for the titled API.

         <title>Synergistic Radical Markovnikov Hydroselenization of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we report a new synergistic radical Markovnikov hydroselenization of alkenes by in&#8208;situ generated selenium cluster that absorbs hydride under mild conditions. In this protocol, a formal &#8220;metal hydride&#8221; mechanism is proposed, in which the hydrogen atom is added into the alkene, then undergoing SH2 radical substitution to give the dialkyl selenides products that previously are inaccessible. This metal&#8208;free double selenium&#8208;ene reaction enables smoothly the installation of the bioactive Se atom into a remarkably wide scope of aliphatic and aromatic alkenes and pharmaceuticals&#8208;derived alkenes along with high functional groups compatibility.

Abstract
The synthesis of 5&#8211;7 membered oxygenated heterocycles by intramolecular aminooxygenation of unsaturated alkenes using commercially available N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide as amination reagent and TpiPr2Cu(NCCH3) as precatalyst is reported. With unsaturated aliphatic carboxylic acids, the corresponding lactones are obtained from moderate to almost quantitative yields employing a catalyst loading of 2.5&#8197;mol% under mild conditions, whereas 2&#8208;vinylbenzoic acids originate lower yields.

Abstract
Organoselenylated chromones, thiochromones, and 4&#8208;quinolones, as an important members of selenyl&#8208;bearing heterocycles, present significant biological activities. A variety of methods for the facile synthesis of selenyl&#8208;substituted chromones, thiochromones, and 4&#8208;quinolones, employ chromones, 2&#8208;hydroxyaryl enaminones, alkynyl aryl ketones, and 4&#8208;quinolones as the starting material via transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed, oxidant&#8208;promoted, electrocatalytic, and photo&#8208;induced selenylation or selenocyanation, and cascade selenylation or selenocyanation/cyclization involving a radical pathway or cationic pathway, which are mainly summarized in this review. The detailed mechanism and the existed limitations of the reported strategies are also discussed here. Additionally, future prospects in the construction of organoselenyl&#8208;substituted chromones, thiochromones, and 4&#8208;quinolones, is showed to encourage chemists to push the development of heterocyclic chemistry and organoselenium chemistry.

Abstract
A general, efficient and economic copper&#8208;catalyzed &#945;, &#946;&#8208;enones allylic oxidation to 1,4&#8208;enedione has been developed. The protocol only requires a small amount of cheap copper catalyst with air as the sole oxidant. The advantages of the approach are mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, good tolerance of functional groups, and easy experimental operation. The approach has been demonstrated to be compatible for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drugs and natural products.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Diboron&#8208;Substrate Cooperatively Facilitate Direct Amidation of Carboxylic Acids and Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we report that an efficient and practical organocatalyzed strategy enables direct amidation of a wide range of carboxylic acids and variety of amines. The organocatalyzed system is proved to be suitable for the synthesis of small molecular peptides from protected amino acids, and the method was successfully applied to the late stage functionalization of drug molecules or pharmaceutical intermediates. Mechanistic studies by control experiments, in&#8197;situ infrared spectroscopy, 11B nuclear magnetic resonance (11B NMR), and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, reveal that N&#8208;propyl&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylamino)phenyl) formamide reacts with B2pin2 to form the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;diboron adduct, and the boron atom of NHC&#8208;diboron adduct is able to coordinate to the carboxyl oxygen atom of the carboxylic acid to generate the true active species of NHC&#8208;diboron&#8208;carboxylic acid for catalyzing the amidation of carboxylic acids and amines. The discovery of in&#8197;situ generation of catalytic system in combination of multi&#8208;catalytic components with substrates may open the door to cooperative catalysis for the synthesis of important organic molecules.

         <title>Synthesis of Unnatural Amino Acids via &#946;&#8208;Aminoaldehyde C&#8211;H Arylation using HAT&#8208;Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>

Abstract
Unnatural amino acids play a crucial role in advancing protein engineering and drug development. In this study, we present the synthesis of a series of &#947;&#8208;aryl&#8208;keto&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids through the direct C&#8722;H arylation of readily accessible &#946;&#8208;aminoaldehydes and aryl bromides, promoted by hydrogen atom transfer combined with metallaphotoredox catalysis. This direct and mild methodology provides access to enantiopure L&#8208; and D&#8208; amino acids, either N&#8208;protected or unprotected, with broad functional group compatibility, including pyridine heterocycles. These features highlight the potential relevance of this strategy for pharmaceutical synthesis and biotechnological research.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cyclization of propargyl alcohol with carbon dioxide (CO2) as a carbonyl source has been reported for the first time, which provides an efficient and straightforward route to a range of valuable butenolides in moderate to high yields. The reaction can be performed in one step and features good functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. The application of the new method was also demonstrated by direct carbonylative cyclization of biologically active molecules.

Abstract
A facile one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component cascade cyclization has been developed for synthesis of 2&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;2&#8208;ol dihydropyrroles and 4&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;4&#8208;ol dihydropyrroles from various substituted amines, 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoropropan&#8208;2&#8208;one, and substituted &#946;&#8208;oxoamides using K2CO3 as an additive. This K2CO3&#8208;promoted method offers a simple and efficient approach for achieving highly regioselective products through cascade bond formation and cyclization. Post functionalization of resulting products into various valuable trifluoromethylated heterocycles including triazoles, isoxazoles, Mannich bases and the products from Sonogashira coupling reactions has also been reported. Additionally, a straightforward and scalable protocol for synthesis of 4&#8208;trifluoromethylpyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxamide derivatives without K2CO3, utilizing diverse 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds has been established.

Abstract
This work presents a detailed mechanistic study of a quininium&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;Michael reaction, providing essential information for advancing chiral proton catalysis (CPC). The use of cinchona derivatives as chiral proton catalysts demonstrates their potential beyond their conventional roles as base&#8208;promoted and phase&#8208;transfer catalysts. Competitive reaction pathways are explored using density functional theory (DFT), wavefunction theory, and microkinetic simulations. Theoretical analyses are complemented with experimental titration and kinetic techniques to verify the intrinsic details of the reaction. This study reveals an intricate hydrogen bond network formed in the rate&#8208; and selectivity&#8208;determining step, involving four noncovalently attached components that favor a stronger substrate&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;catalyst interaction in the R transition state. Significantly, this research emphasizes the pivotal role of carboxylate anions as nucleophile&#8208;activating bases impacting reaction yield and enantioselectivity. Therefore, this work introduces cinchonium derivatives as new options for CPC and provides a thorough mechanistic analysis significant in expanding this underdeveloped catalytic domain.

Abstract
A photoinduced energy transfer strategy has been developed for the direct 1,2&#8208;thiocyanato&#8208;imination of alkenes using N&#8208;SCN reagents. The methodology facilitates the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;aminothiocyanates through N&#8722;S bond cleavage, with over 30 examples exhibiting yields up to 88%. Mechanistic studies reveal a radical pathway involving the generation of thiocyanate and iminyl radical species. The resulting &#946;&#8208;aminothiocyanate serves as valuable building blocks for diverse transformations, particularly in the construction of SCN&#8208;containing bioactive molecules with potential pharmaceutical applications.

Abstract
An efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8211;Lam type N&#8208;arylation of various amides, sulfonamides, urea, azoles, and amines has been demonstrated using a CuF2/DMSO catalytic system with structurally diverse aryl(trimethoxy)silanes under base and ligand&#8208;free conditions. This approach facilitates effective C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling with user&#8208;friendly organosilicon reagents without requiring an external fluoride source. CuF2 serves a dual function as both a catalyst and a desilylating agent, facilitating the cleavage of the aryl&#8208;silane bond. The process is compatible with a broad range of substrates, ensuring high efficiency and excellent functional group compatibility. Moreover, this protocol is proven to be valuable for late&#8208;stage modification of amide and sulfonamide&#8208;containing drug molecules, as well as for synthesizing agrochemicals.

         <title>Lanthanide One&#8208;Dimensional Coordination Polymer Catalyzed [3+2] Annulation Reaction: Synthesis of N,N&#8217;&#8208;Bicyclic Pyrazolidine Scaffolds</title>

Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of the multidendate ligand (H2L) with lanthanide metal salts leads to the formation of one&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers (CP). The structural analysis of the molecule suggests the formation of CP with ladder&#8208;type arrangements of ligands with metal centers. The polymers CP&#8208;1 and CP&#8208;2 with europium and terbium were found to be anionic and coordinatively unsaturated with the existence of solvent molecules in the vacant sites. The CPs were found to be suitable catalysts for the regioselective annulation of aza&#8208;MBH adducts with N,N, cyclic azomethine imines that lead to the formation of N,N&#8217;&#8208;bicyclic pyrazolidine scaffolds via [3+2] cycloaddition. The protocol tolerates a wide substrate scope with different functionalities by producing the bicyclic scaffold with better yield and excellent diastereoselectivity. The X&#8208;ray and NMR analysis suggests the formation of cis diastereomer which is stabilized by N&#8722;H&#8212;O interaction. The synthetic utility of the pyrazolidine scaffolds is attempted for various functional group interconversions.

Abstract
Azo compounds as a class of privileged molecules continue to attract significant attention in many fields including drug discovery, organic synthesis, and materials science. Despite notable progress in their synthesis, the use of visible light to directly construct azo compounds under photocatalytic conditions from amine precursors remains a challenging endeavour. Herein, we report the first instance of photo&#8208;dual catalytic Cu/photosensitizer (PS) synthesis of symmetric and non&#8208;symmetric azo compounds from readily available amines using renewable light energy input, ambient conditions, and ubiquitous air as a stoichiometric oxidant. This reliable and efficient photo&#8208;driven procedure is scalable and tolerates a variety of functional groups with broad substrate scope and allows for the preparation of azo&#8208;based photoswitches, arylazopyrazoles, and diazocines. The origin of this remarkable reactivity is delineated by in&#8208;depth experimental and computational studies.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Free N&#8208;Sulfinyl Ketimine Formation by Transimination</title>

Abstract
Reaction of sulfinamides with in&#8197;situ generated N&#8208;trifluoromethanesulfonyl ketimines occurs rapidly at room temperature in the presence of KOt&#8208;Bu. The precursor N&#8208;H imines are accessible by organolithium addition to nitriles or condensation of HMDS with ketones. This protocol avoids work&#8208;up and reactor cleaning challenges encountered in the traditional Ti(OEt)4 mediated condensation approach. The reaction works well for extremely hindered substrates, some of which were inaccessible with the Ti(OEt)4 procedure.

Abstract
Highly enantioselective transfer hydrogenation of &#947;&#8208;indolyl &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;keto amides and &#945;&#8208;keto esters with Hantzsch ester catalyzed by chiral zinc complex is reported. Using 5&#8197;mol% of Zn(OTf)2&#8208;imidazolidine&#8208;pyrroloimidazolone pyridine as the catalyst, the C=C bond in &#947;&#8208;indolyl &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;keto amides is selectively reduced, affording hydrogenation products in high yields (up to 99% yield) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). Using the same catalyst system, the C=O bond in &#945;&#8208;keto esters is reduced, generating &#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters in good results (up to 99% yield and 98% ee). A retro&#8208;Michael pathway and subsequent transfer hydrogenation reaction are proposed for the explanation of the side products in the transfer hydrogenation of &#947;&#8208;indolyl &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;keto amides.

         <title>Difunctionalization of Glycals and their Derivatives: Strategies and Applications in the Synthesis of Bioactive Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Glycals serve as crucial donor molecules in the synthesis of biologically active compounds. These moieties can undergo functionalization at various positions, such as C&#8208;1, C&#8208;2, and di&#8208;functionalization at multiple sites, including 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization, 2,3&#8208;difunctionalization, and 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization. Among these, 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization can be achieved using diverse methodologies, including metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions, cyclopropane ring opening, epoxide ring opening, and more. Additionally, glycals can be converted into dihalogenated compounds through simple and efficient protocols.Moreover, the 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization process typically involves glycosylation at the anomeric position, followed by the attack of a suitable acceptor. These transformations have proven instrumental in synthesizing various medicinally significant molecules, such as restricticin, SGLT&#8208;2 inhibitors, bergenin, papulacandins A&#8722;D, and tricyclic flavonoids. This review provides an overview of the diverse strategies employed for the difunctionalization of glycals and highlights their application in synthesizing difunctionalized natural products.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the use of electrochemistry has emerged as a powerful yet sustainable means of enabling key transformations. Amidation is one of the most frequently executed transformations in synthetic chemistry, and using an electrochemical approach, the current study has demonstrated the synthesis of amides from aldehydes and amines. Mechanistic work indicates that the reaction proceeds via the oxidation of an intermediate hydrazone to generate an acyl diazene as the acylating species. The protocol developed has enabled the synthesis of a broad range of amides, including access to pharmaceutically relevant products, directly from aldehydes without recourse for hazardous chemical oxidants and activating agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Photocatalytic Synthesis of Multisubstituted Quinazolines and Quinolines by Naphthalene Diimide</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Substituted quinazolines are pharmaceutically important molecules, whose preparation from alcohol substrates are limited by precious metal, high reaction temperature and anaerobic conditions. We report herein an organophotocatalyst, naphthalene diimide (NDI) that fabricates such class of molecule in very high yield, from two different alcohols and ammonium acetate at room temperature and under aerobic atmosphere. Additionally, a three&#8208;component coupling from three different alcohols leads to 2,3&#8208;substituted quinolines in high yield, which attests to the remarkable dehydrogenating ability of the photocatalyst. This is the first use of NDI where the dehydrogenative ability of its one&#8208;electron reduced form has been exploited to execute smooth dehydrogenation reactions. A series of control experiments, Stern&#8208;Volmer analysis, EPR detection of the monoreduced NDI altogether establish the reaction mechanism and rationalizes such a strong dehydrogenation ability that leads to the preparation of heterocycles under mild condition.

Abstract
The use of stable photosensitizers made on a multigram&#8208;scale from cheap and available starting materials offers an extraordinary opportunity to translate small&#8208;scale proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept photoreactions to widespread applications in non&#8208;specialized laboratories, thereby promoting the implementation of light&#8208;driven syntheses. Herein, we report an easy, multigram&#8208;scale preparation of the exceptionally photo&#8208; and redoxstable chromium(III) complex [Cr(tpe)2]3+ (tpe=1,1,1&#8208;tris(pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethane) at room temperature. This photocatalyst was successfully employed in acetonitrile and in the &#8220;green&#8221; solvent water as demonstrated in visible&#8208;light induced Schenck&#8208;Ene reactions, Newman&#8208;Kwart rearrangements, radical cation Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadditions, oxidative decarboxylation and trifluoromethylation reactions with excellent substrate conversions and high turnover numbers. Gram&#8208;scale photocatalytic reactions were conducted using a simple round&#8208;bottom flask as reaction vessel and irradiation with energy&#8208;efficient blue LEDs or even with sunlight. The stable photocatalyst was successfully recycled in up to 90&#8211;92% yields after the photoreactions.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of 2H&#8208;imidazoles from 1,2&#8208;Diketones, Ketones, and Ammonium Acetate</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a multicomponent reaction for the efficient synthesis of polysubstituted 2H&#8208;imidazoles from readily available 1,2&#8208;diketones, ketones, and ammonium acetate under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. Both nitrogen atoms in the resulting 2H&#8208;imidazole products are derived from the cost&#8208;effective inorganic ammonium acetate. This protocol achieves the cleavage of three C&#8722;O bonds and the formation of four C&#8722;N bonds in a single operation. The advantages of this protocol include low cost, broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and high atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy.

         <title>Synthesis of Indolyl&#8208;7&#8208;azanorbornanes by Decomposition of Tetrahydro&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazepines</title>

Abstract
We report a new method for the synthesis of indolyl&#8208;7&#8208;azanorbornanes. The process involves the generation of a meta&#8208;stable tetrahydro&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazepine intermediate that decomposes by extrusion of molecular nitrogen and ultimately leads to the formation of the observed products. The intermediacy of the triazepine intermediate was substantiated by trapping with allyl bromide to give an allylated triazepine compound that was sufficiently stable to be fully characterized in the usual ways.

         <title>Aromatization of 1,3&#8208;Cyclohexanedione: Modular Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Disubstituted Phenols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Multifunctional arenes play a crucial role in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, yet their synthesis remains a significant synthetic challenge. In this study, we introduce a novel one&#8208;step strategy for the efficient synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted phenols containing hydroxy, halogen, and sulfonamido groups, all of which demonstrate notable biological activity. This work represents the first example of an aromatization&#8208;driven approach to 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted benzene derivatives. Remarkably, the resulting 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted benzene scaffold is amenable to multiple late&#8208;stage modifications, facilitating the synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzene derivatives&#8212;compounds that are typically challenging to obtain using conventional synthetic methods. Furthermore, the method offers compatibility with diverse functional groups, it proceeds under mild reaction conditions, and it uses readily available starting materials, positioning it as a highly promising tool for pharmaceutical and materials research.

Abstract
A modular synthesis of 2,3,4,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted thieno[2,3&#8208;c]furans, which employs a formal [3+2] cycloaddition utilizing the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement and a subsequent Br&#248;nsted base&#8208;mediated cyclization, has been established, providing an efficient access to a wide range of densely functionalized thieno[2,3&#8208;c]furans that are otherwise difficult to synthesize. This method is also applicable to the synthesis of 2,3,4,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted selenolo[2,3&#8208;c]furans and can be extended to the synthesis of hexasubstituted benzothiophenes.

Abstract
We report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed cyanation of vinyl triflates using tert&#8208;butyl isonitrile as a nucleophilic CN source. This reaction employs simple Ni(OTf)2 as the catalyst, operating without exogenous ligands or reductants. The method enables selective and efficient access to a broad range of cyclic and acyclic alkenyl nitriles, accommodating diverse functional groups and substrates, including natural products and pharmaceuticals.

Abstract
A novel, synthetically straightforward, selective DMAP&#8208;promoted [4+2]/[3+3] annulation domino reaction of o&#8208;acylamino&#8208;aryl Morita&#8722;Baylis&#8722;Hillman (MBH) carbonates with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines to construct complex fused [2,7]naphthyridine frameworks has been developed. The reaction provides a step&#8208;economic strategy for the direct synthesis of functionalized benzo[c][2,7]naphthyridines containing three stereogenic centers in high yields with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and diastereoselectivity under mild reaction conditions. More importantly, this transformation enables the simultaneous formation of four new bonds and two new six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles in only one step. Additionally, the synthetic utility of this method has been demonstrated through its application in the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceutically active molecules.

Abstract
As bulk and fundamental chemical feedstocks, aromatic compounds play a prominent role in organic synthesis. In this regard, extensive efforts have been made to develop highly efficient synthetic methods for the conversion of planar aromatic compounds to various high&#8208;value molecules. Among these, dearomatization reactions are particularly attractive because they demonstrate unique possibilities for assembling sophisticated polycyclic architectures from readily available aromatic feedstocks. Cyclic molecules are among the most important compounds, and are widely used in fields such as pharmaceuticals, materials, and synthesis. In this review, we summarized recent developments in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed dearomatization processes for the construction of complex cyclic compounds.

Abstract
A novel metal&#8208; and base&#8208;free approach for the synthesis of benzoxazino and benzoxazepino fused isoquinoline derivatives from ortho&#8208;alkynyl aldehydes and amines under mild reaction conditions has been described. The formation of new C&#8722;O and C&#8722;N bonds via metal&#8208;free cyclization with internal alkyne aided by water molecules without using external ligands and bases has been described. In addition, a series of control experiments are performed, and mechanistic studies are discussed elaborately by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale synthesis and photophysical studies of the synthesized compounds and their quantum yield calculation have been demonstrated.

         <title>Synthesis of Furans/Pyrroles through Palladium&#8208;Gold Relay Catalyzed Skeletal Editing of Carbonates or Carbamates via a Decarboxylative&#8208;Aromatization Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A novel Pd(0)/Au(I) relay catalysis strategy for converting propargylic cyclic carbonates into furans is reported. The method capitalizes on the sequential transformation of a palladium&#8208;stabilized alkoxide&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate into a gold&#8208;stabilized dihydrofuran species, enabled by the cooperative action of palladium and gold catalysts. This approach is notable for its simplicity, broad functional group compatibility, and use of readily available substrates. By extending the methodology to five&#8208;membered carbamates substrates, the construction of pyrrole frameworks is also demonstrated. Additionally, the method facilitates the synthesis of polycyclic furans and pyrroles via Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, achieving high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities.

         <title>Titanium Catalyzed the Cross&#8208;Coupling of Nitriles and Alkyl Halides for the Synthesis of Ketones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, a titanium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl halides with nitriles under mild reaction conditions for the synthesis of ketones is reported. This reaction is applicable in benzyl halides, allyl halides, which are inactive substrates in the past reports, as well as non&#8208;activated alkyl halides. Mechanistic studies have suggested that titanium(III) acts both as a carbon radical initiator and a cyanoactivator. The gram&#8208;scale and derivatisation experiments also further demonstrate the potential application of the methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermolecular 1,4&#8208;Difunctionalization of Conjugated Dienes Enabled by Palladium/Copper/Iodide Cooperation: Regioselective Construction of 3&#8208;Pyrrolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3&#8208;Pyrrolines are important nitrogen&#8208;containing five&#8208;membered heterocycles. In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing synthetic methods for 3&#8208;pyrrolines, including direct and efficient strategy for the 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of conjugated dienes. However, most existing approaches typically require pre&#8208;activated nitrogen sources (nitrene precursor or imine) or rely on intramolecular reactions to enhance reactivity, enabling the construction of 3&#8208;pyrrolines. The synthesis of 3&#8208;pyrrolines via intermolecular reactions without using pre&#8208;activated nitrogen sources remains a challenging task. In this study, we present an intermolecular 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of conjugated dienes for the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;disubstituted 3&#8208;pyrrolines, using a tosylamide (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ts) as the nitrogen source. The reaction was facilitated through the cooperation of palladium(II), copper(I) and iodide. The resulting 3&#8208;pyrrolines can be readily converted into various pyrroles and pyrrolidines through simple transformations.</dc:description>

However, most existing approaches typically require pre-activated nitrogen sources (nitrene precursor or imine) or rely on intramolecular reactions to enhance reactivity, enabling the construction of 3-pyrrolines.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Catalyzed Stereospecific Intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type Reaction of Fluoroalkyl Cyclopropyl Carbinols via Non&#8208;classical Carbocation</title>

Abstract
Here we describe a Fe&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type reaction of polysubstituted stereodefined fluoroalkyl cyclopropyl carbinols. This transformation provides access to a series of fluoroalkyl group&#8208;substituted dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;indenols bearing three continuous stereogenic centers including two congested tetra&#8208;substituted stereocenters. The key to the realization of this reaction relies on the electronic destabilizing effect of fluoroalkyl group to tune the stability and reactivity of non&#8208;classical cyclopropyl&#8208;carbinyl cation intermediate. Functional group interconversions of the obtained diastereomerically pure dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;indenols further demonstrated the synthetic utility of this rationally designed reaction.

Abstract
Few methods have been reported for the alkynylhydroxylation of unactivated alkenes, which could synchronously introduce both alkyne and hydroxyl groups into alkene moieties to construct homopropargylic alcohol scaffolds. Herein, we explored an unprecedented Ni(II)&#8208;catalyzed selective Heck&#8208;type 1,2&#8208;alkynylhydroxylation of unactivated alkenes with alkynylsilanes under air. The &#946;, &#947;&#8208; and &#947;, &#948;&#8208;unsaturated amides, including mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted alkenyl amides, were reactive substrates to afford a powerful platform for preparing important homopropargylic alcohols with excellent regio&#8208; and diastereo&#8208;selectivity. This method was suitable for use in late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules.

Abstract
Herein, we provide two nickel complexes and a series of control experiments to study the mechanism of the nickel&#8208;catalyzed transannulation reaction of 1,2,3,4&#8208;benzo&#8208;thiatriazin&#8208;1,1(2H)&#8208;dioxide with aryne and alkyne in detail.

         <title>Photo&#8208; or Electrochemical N&#8208;P Cross&#8208;Hetero&#8208;Dehydrogenative Couplings between Amines and Phosphonothioates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
We present two distinct synthetic approaches for the synthesis of diversely functionalized thiophosphoramidates, employing either photochemical or electrochemical strategies via N&#8722;P cross&#8208;hetero&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling. Both methods provide a practical and efficient route to access this significant class of biologically relevant thiophosphoramidates. Key advantages of the protocol include mild reaction conditions, the use of visible light and electrochemical cells as sustainable tools, and energy efficiency enabled by a low&#8208;energy visible light source and low&#8208;current operation. Furthermore, the process utilizes low&#8208;cost substrates and a nontoxic photosensitizer, delivers high yields, exhibits broad substrate scope with excellent functional group tolerance, and offers operational simplicity with a strong emphasis on eco&#8208;friendliness.

Abstract
Pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indole derivatives are widely present in bioactive alkaloids and pharmaceuticals, with pyrroloindolones, containing a &#947;&#8208;lactam fused to an indole scaffold, forming a significant class of heteroaromatic compounds due, to their presence in numerous natural products and biologically active molecules. In this study, we explored the potential of indole&#8208;derived hydrazones as 1,2&#8208;dinucleophiles in the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed formal [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition with &#945;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. A broad substrate scope was investigated, revealing the versatility of the method with various aldehydes and hydrazones. Subsequent transformations of the cycloaddition products demonstrated the synthetic utility of the developed methodology, preserving the optical purity of the final products.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced and electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex&#8208;initiated hydroxyselenization of &#945;&#8208;CF3 alkenes for the synthesis of valuable &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;selanyl tertiary alcohols was first developed. The reaction uses ethanol as the green solvent, air (O2) as the ideal oxygen source, mild reaction conditions, simple operation and does not require the use of any transition metals and external photocatalysts. The synthetic value and practicality of this method has been demonstrated by the conversion of several substrates derived from drug molecules, efficient transformation under sunlight irradiation and gram&#8208;scale reaction.

Abstract
We report a straightforward and efficient method for the synthesis of spiropyrazoline oxindoles using CuCl2 as the Lewis acid catalyst. This approach involves a one&#8208;pot domino process, consisting of a condensation step between indolin&#8208;2&#8208;one and phenylhydrazine derivatives, followed by a copper&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction. The methodology enabled the synthesis of 34 diversely functionalized spiro compounds with yields ranging from moderate to excellent, achieving up to 98%.

         <title>Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced Difunctionalization of Styrenes with 4&#8208;cyanopyridines and Thioacetates or Thiosulfonates</title>

Abstract
Simultaneous thiolation/pyridinylation of alkenes was achieved in a three&#8208;component reaction under visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced conditions. By employing 4CzIPN as a photocatalyst and DIPEA as a base, a variety of alkenes and cyanopyridines reacted well with thioacetates or thiosulfonates to obtain the difunctionalized products in excellent yields with high regio&#8208;selectivity. The thiolation/pyridinylation products could easily transfer to 4&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)pyridine or dithioperoxoate compounds. Furthermore, the in&#8197;vitro antitumor activities of selected compounds were screened through MTT assay and the results showed that compound 6&#8201;e exhibited similar antitumor activity with 5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU).

         <title>Development of Immobilized Chiral Iridium Catalysts by Strengthening Coordination Bonds for Z&#8208;retentive Asymmetric Allylic Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allyl substitution is pivotal for constructing chiral compounds. However, addressing Ir scarcity and developing sustainable catalysts for industrial applications remains a significant challenge. This study presents a polymer&#8208;supported heterogeneous chiral single&#8208;Ir&#8208;site catalyst, wherein the coordination is optimized through modulation of anions, resulting in a significant reduction in metal leaching. The catalysts exhibit exceptional performance in terms of enhanced enantioselectivity and broad applicability in Z&#8208;retentive asymmetric allylic substitution reactions, even accommodating a wide range of diverse functional groups. Specifically, the catalyst demonstrates minimal metal leaching over 14 cycles, marking a notable improvement compared to previously reported catalysts. The practical optimization of this reaction highlights the potential application value of such catalysts, offering insights for the development of chiral heterogeneous catalysts.

Abstract
An efficient AgNO3&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208;selective bis&#8208;heteroannulation of o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl enaminones with yne&#8208;enones for the synthesis of highly functionalized 3&#8208;(furan&#8208;3&#8208;ylmethyl) chromones has been developed. The protocol enables the simultaneous construction of chromone and furan skeleton in one&#8208;step cascade reaction. Furthermore, high easily accessible starting materials, regioselectivity, room temperature, good to excellent yields, broad substituent tolerance, further gram&#8208;scale synthesis and derivatization make this strategy potential synthetic application value in synthetic and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;covered SiO2 Composite: A New Strategy to Facilitate the Aqueous Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) is an efficient and mild way to obtain chiral compounds. However, the toxic metal ions and the low turnover number (TON) in aqueous ATH limited the further application. We reported a polystyrene&#8208;covered mesoporous SiO2 supported Noyori's Ru&#8208;TsDPEN named Ru&#8208;PCMS, consisting of an inner mesoporous silica core and an outer organic polystyrene layer, which could promote the aqueous ATH of &#946;&#8208;keto esters to afford various chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ester with excellent yields (up to 99%) and ee values (up to 99%). It showed excellent water stability that successfully recycled 8 times without the enantioselectivity reduction and the metal loss.

This one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step process concocts various value&#8208;added poly&#8208;substituted tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]chromenones in reasonable yields with excellent diastereoselectivities. Pleasantly, this newly developed Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed technique also facilitates the strain&#8208;release driven ring&#8208;opening reactions involving highly strained bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes as enamine acceptors, &#160; endowing the quick access to synthetically challenging 2&#8208;aminobicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes and &#945;&#8208;cyclobutyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;arylacrylaldehydes with excellent diastereoselectivities.

         <title>Ligand controlled regio&#8208;divergent [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of alkynes by merging electrochemistry and nickel catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions between three alkynes, a diyne and an alkyne, or a triyne offer a straightforward and typical protocol toward all kinds of polysubstituted benzens. Herein, the synthesis of polysubstituted aromatics through electrochemical nickel catalyzed cyclotrimerization of alkynes is developed. The regio&#8208;divergent cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes was achieved by judicious choice of ligands. And tributylphosphine, sterically hindered bipyridine or &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands delivered 1,2,4&#8208; and 1,3,5&#8208;substituted aromatics with high regioselectivities respectively. Besides, the semi&#8208;intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between	diynes and alkynes are also amenable under this catalytic system. This approach operates without metal reductant, exhibits wide functional groups tolerance, ease of scalability and furnishes 75 examples with moderate to good yields, including some biorelevant compounds. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculation revealed the catalytic pathways of 1,3,5&#8208; and 1,2,4&#8208;cyclotrimerizations, and the origin of the ligand controlled regioselectivity.

         <title>Double&#8208;Sided Control of Product Type Preference in the Visible&#8208;Light Initiated Reaction of 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds with Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The demonstrated light&#8208;initiated addition of radicals formed on an active methylene group to styrene derivatives exhibits a product selectivity influenced by the presence of a protic solvent. Under protic conditions, the predominant products are branched compounds with the alkene moiety attached to the methylene group. In the absence of a proton source, an alkene is incorporated between the carbonyl group and the methylene group, leading to the formation of products known from the De Mayo reaction. The utility of the presented method was confirmed by a broad substrate range of alkenes and compounds bearing active methylene groups. A comprehensive mechanistic study revealed that both types of products can be formed via the radical pathway. This suggests a previously unreported mechanistic pathway as an alternative to the De Mayo reaction, which gives the same type of products.

         <title>A General Catalytic Sulfide&#8208;based Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex Platform for Decarboxylative Transformations of N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide Esters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
This study develops a general platform using a catalytic electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) system, which combines inexpensive and readily available sulfides and N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters. This general platform facilitates various redox&#8208;neutral and net&#8208;reductive reactions, including intramolecular cyclization, hydrodecarboxylation, hydroalkylation, heterocyclic synthesis, and C&#8722;H imidation of arenes, through simple operations. For example, the intramolecular cyclization with the N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) ester derivatives achieves yields of up to 84%, while hydrodecarboxylation and hydroalkylation reactions proceed with yields of 78% and 81%, respectively. Heterocyclic synthesis and C&#8722;H imidation are also accomplished with yields of up to 76% and 74%, respectively. Mechanistic investigations reveal that, in the presence of lithium ions, the distance between the sulfur atom and the closest atom of the NHPI ester 1&#8201;a in the EDA complex decreases from 3.43 to 3.29&#8197;&#197;, whereas the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap decreases from 5.42 to 5.32&#8197;eV. These results confirm that lithium ions serve as Lewis acids, enhancing the interaction within the EDA complex. The robustness of this catalytic EDA platform is demonstrated by its compatibility with water and air, conditions that challenge conventional photoredox platforms. This study highlights sulfides as effective catalytic electron donors.

         <title>Electrochemical Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover Enabled Multi&#8208;ester Functionalized O&#8208;Containing Heterocycles Synthesis</title>

Abstract
We report an electrochemical radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) strategy for the radical cyclization of olefinic amides with C&#8722;H nucleophiles with H2 as the byproduct. Enabled by this strategy, structurally diverse multi&#8208;ester functionalized benzoxazines and iminoisobenzofurans were obtained with good yields. Notably, the resulting triple&#8208;ester functionalized O&#8208;heterocycles are inaccessible by other means. This protocol features catalyst&#8208; and external oxidant&#8208;free conditions, high atom economy, and broad substrate scope. The scalable synthesis as well as product derivatization highlight the synthetic utility of this electrochemical protocol.

         <dc:description>Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;carboalkoxy&#8208;3&#8208;substituted&#8208;cyclohexenones are powerful building blocks for the synthesis of a variety of bioactive target molecules. Their preparations requires multi&#8208;steps sequence involving the use of stoichiometric quantities of various reagents, while the catalytic approaches are limitited to trisubstituted cyclohexenones. We describe here an efficient catalytic approach based on gold(I)&#8208;catalysis starting from unsymmetrical diynyl mono&#8208;ester or symmetrical diynyl di&#8208;ester substrates. The carbon chain linking the two alkyne functions can bear two or one substituent, or even be unsubstituted. Regardless of the nature of the substrates and independently of its substitution, the cyclohexenone derivatives are cleanly produced.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a recyclable catalyst system combining Cu(II)O and 4,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline in a 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid for the hydrohalogenation of alkynes. The reaction efficiently yields alkenyl bromides and chlorides with good functional group tolerance and regioselectivity across a range of functionalized alkynes. Remarkably, the reaction exhibits unprecedented chemoselectivity for alkyne over alkenes in polyenynes and enables late&#8208;stage modifications to rapidly synthesize brominated polyenes. The catalyst system could be recycled for up to six runs without significant reduction of the reaction yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Alkylation/Cyclization of Isocyanides with Organoboron Reagents for Diversified Synthesis of N&#8208;Heteroaromatics</title>

Abstract
The utility of alkyl boronic acids as alkyl radical precursors in photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reactions has been limited due to their low reactivity. A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical alkylation/cyclization of functional arylisocyanides with alkyl boronic acids is reported herein. This strategy allows the formation of alkyl radicals from boronic acids containing primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl groups, which are subsequently transformed into structurally diverse alkylated products, including quinoxalines, phenanthridines, benzothiazoles, benzoselenazoles and quinolines. This transformation features readily available radical precursors and a broad substrate scope. The reaction mechanism is investigated by fluorescence quenching, light on/off, and cyclic voltammograms (CV) experiments. The combination of alkyl boronic acids with DBU may lead to the formation of the alkyl radical via a single electron transfer (SET) process, while the arylisocyanides may undergo an energy transfer (EnT) process with photocatalyst under visible light to generate the carbon radical or act as a radical acceptor to react with the alkyl radical.

         <title>Photochemical Preparation of (Aza&#8208;)Indolines: Diastereoselective Synthesis and Polarity Reversal Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present the first light&#8208;mediated, diastereoselective de novo synthesis for 2,3&#8208;substituted indolines, a privileged scaffold in pharmaceuticals. The protocol was tested with various aryl and alkyl groups, maintaining high yields up to 85% across different substituents. The approach was further extended to enantioselective synthesis, yielding trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;substituted indolines with high enantiomeric excesses (94%&#8208;96% ee). Drawbacks resulting from low efficiencies for nucleophilic radicals in previous studies were addressed by a polarity reversal strategy, incorporating electron&#8208;withdrawing groups to improve the efficiency of the initial radical addition. Finally, the methodology was utilized for the synthesis of azaindolines, a highly valuable target in pharmaceutical research. Our approach now encompasses modifications to the aromatic backbone, the use of both nucleophilic and electrophilic radicals as coupling partners, the synthesis of indolines, azaindolines, and tetrahydroquinolines, variation of protecting groups, and the diastereoselective synthesis of 2,3&#8208;substituted indolines.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unspecific Peroxygenases have been the subject of a lot of research in the recent past as they offer opportunities for green hydroxylation reactions using hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as donor. A striking problem of UPOs is their low stability against their own co&#8208;substrate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In order to prevent the deactivation, we developed an enzyme cascade with an L&#8208;amino acid oxidase (LAAO) to produce hydrogen peroxide &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; at a constant low concentration, aiming for much higher lifespan and therefore longer working time of the enzyme. This way, we are able to convert a variety of substrates with conversion rates up to 95 %.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Click reactions display many of the goals desired for more sustainable chemical
conversions.  Yet, the solvent used is an often overlooked aspect in determining the
environmental impact of reactions. In the current paper we develop the first
mechanochemical method for the efficient and solvent&#8208;free SuFEx reaction of sulfonyl
fluorides with a wide range of phenols.  After outlining the optimization process, which
yields an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use and robust method, we provide indications of the very wide
scope of this approach, and demonstrate this potential via the application to a range of
natural phenols that also display other functionalities, and several gram&#8208;scale

         <dc:description>Over the last decade, carboxylic acids have drawn profound interest in synthetic chemistry, due to its exceptional adaptability as traceless directing groups (TDGs) in the construction of complex organic molecules in the realm of C&#8208;H activation. The chameleonic nature of such privileged functionality startles each time in portraying its diversity by either trace elimination of acid group or by inherent annulation which makes an aura of distinction from other conventional DGs. In this review, the recent developments of carboxylic acid as a directing group (DG) are emphasized from the year 2017 with apparent late&#8208;stage applications. In view of synthetic chemistry context and substrate scope, innovative avenues are addressed along with multiple approaches in utilising carboxylic acids as efficient DGs.</dc:description>

         <title>Electromagnetic mill promoted mechanochemical Sonogashira coupling reaction and mechanism insight into the catalytic complex</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A solid&#8208;state Pd/Cu co&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling facilitated by electromagnetic milling (EMM) was realized without solvent or additional heating. This strategy exhibited excellent substitutions tolerance and widely substrate scope. The physical parameters were investigated, which proved both of magnetic field strength and frequency to be positive correlation to yields. Meanwhile, the suitable size of the grinding medium is key to the transformation. The coordination between copper, palladium and ligands were investigated by mass measurement and 31P NMR, proving that CuI, PPh&#8323;, and DABCO coordinated in a 1:1:1 ratio under EMM, and DABCO could efficiently inhibit the homocoupling by&#8208;product from alkyne. The active catalyst complex for the Sonogashira coupling reaction in EMM is generated in situ. The EMM system offers a straightforward method for Sonogashira coupling and demonstrates significant potential for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric All&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Based Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction of Conjugated Vinyl Azides: Synthesis of Chiral Fused and Spiro Cyclohexenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of conjugated vinyl azides with &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;keto esters and amides was achieved. With C1&#8208;symmetric imidazolidine&#8208;pyrroloimidazolone pyridine as the tridentate ligand and Cu(OTf)2 as the Lewis acid, diverse chiral fused and spiro cyclohexenes with an azido group containing three continuous stereogenic centers were obtained in good yields (up to 92% yield), excellent diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). The developed method was applied to the derivatization of complex molecules including buspirone&#8208;derived ketoamide. The functional group vinyl azide was capable of participating in a subsequent click reaction.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Carbonylation/Coupling Reaction Using Anode to Oxidize the Trasition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyst and Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reported an electrochemical oxidative carbonylation of N&#8208;phenylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amine derivatives under mild condtions without an external oxidant. Our approach demonstrated a novel electrochemical oxidative carbonylation reaction mode in which the simultaneous reaction of catalyst and substrate with the anode has been developed. Furthermore, an electrochemical C&#8208;H activation for the synthesis of cyclized pyridinium ion has also been realized. Mechanistic investigations suggested that the process involved a &#8220;PdII/PdIII/PdI/PdII&#8221; catalytic cycle, and H2 was generated at the cathode.</dc:description>
