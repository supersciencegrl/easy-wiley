         <dc:description>We report herein a general one&#8208;pot perfluoroalkylation/dehydrohalogenation protocol for the selective perfluoroalkenylation of silyl dienol ethers in their &#947; position. Importantly, this methodology is applicable to the synthesis of a wide range of &#947;&#8208;perfluoroalkenylated enals, enones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides. Various perfluoroalkenyl moieties could be efficiently introduced, with an important impact on the E/Z diatereoselectivity of the newly formed fluorinated double bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative rearrangement approach for the ring contraction of N&#8211;H piperidines to pyrrolidines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a method for ring contraction of N&#8211;H piperidines using oxidative rearrangement with PhI(OAc)2. The reaction forms iminium ion intermediates that are effectively trapped by nucleophiles (e.g., NaBH4, H2O) yielding the corresponding pyrrolidine derivatives. Additionally, we propose an ionic mechanism supported by experiments and density&#8208;functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Catalytic Protocols for the Synthesis of CF2&#8208;Containing Quinazolinones via Domino Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;catalyzed and visible&#8208;light catalytic difluoroalkylation reactions of N&#8208;cyanamide alkenes have been developed. Various &#945;&#8208;bromodifluoromethyl substituted esters, amides and heterocycles were employed as the CF2 source. Both protocols are characterized by medium to high yields, good functional group compatibility, and applicable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Comparable studies of copper catalysis and photoredox catalysis demonstrate minimal differences between the two protocols. Preliminary mechanism suggest that both transformations involve tandem radical cyclization process.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of CF3&#8208; Pyrano[3,4&#8208;c]quinolones from Hetero&#8208;Dendralenes and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we demonstrate Oxa&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 3&#8208;trifluoroacetyl&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;quinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one with aldehydes in the presence of a base to engineer the functionalized pyrano[3,4&#8208;c]quinolones. This reaction proceeds through an in&#8208;situ generated hetero dendralene intermediate and features perfect stereoselectivity on a wide range of substrates with excellent atom economy. The high electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of CF3&#8208;group is responsible for making the methyl group present in quinolone moiety more acidic to furnish the corresponding hetero dendralene intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Oxazoles: Aminotrifluoromethylation of Alkynes/in&#8208;situ Cyclization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the development of a four&#8208;component electrochemical method for the synthesis of CF3&#8208;oxazoles, utilizing alkynes and NaSO2CF3 in MeCN. The method leverages the simplicity and mildness of the reaction conditions, despite the inherent complexity of utilizing four distinct components through aminotrifluoromethylation of alkyne followed by in&#8208;situ cyclization. Notably, in addition to MeCN solvent, the presence of residual water in the reaction mixture also contributed as a coupling partner. The synthesis involves a sequence of four controlled oxidation steps under constant potential with graphite electrodes, facilitated by the mediator TMEDA, highlighting the precision achievable in electrochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid catalysts in photoredox arylation of sodium arylsulfinates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Complexes [(bpy)2Ru(BL)](PF6)2 (Ru(BL), BL = N,N&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthrolinamine) have been investigated in the coupling reaction of aryl halides and sodium arylsulfinates under visible light irradiation. The position (3, 4 or 5) of the nickel&#8208;coordinating di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amine fragment in the 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline system has a strong influence on the activity of the catalytic system. The advantage of binding fragments of photocatalyst and metal complex into one molecule in the systems with bridging ligands N,N&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthrolin&#8208;3&#8208;amine (BL1) and N,N&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthrolin&#8208;4&#8208;amine (BL2), in comparison with mixed catalytic systems, is shown. With Ru(BL2) photocatalysts it is possible to reduce the loading to 0.1 mol%, instead of the commonly used 1&#8211;2 mol%, and to eliminate the use of the additional ligand for nickel. Under these conditions, more than 20 diarylsulfones of different structures were synthesized in 25&#8211;95%yields.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An In(III)&#8208;catalyzed [2+3+1] annulation strategy is developed for the diastereoselective construction of diversely functionalized tetrahydroxanthones bearing chromone rings. This protocol is based on a three&#8208;component reaction involving various 3&#8208;formylchromones and &#945;&#8208;methylstyrenes via a carbonyl&#8208;ene and formal [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. Notable features of this reaction include its wide substrate scope, high tolerance towards functional groups, atom economy, and excellent diastereoselectivity. In addition, the synthesized tetrahydroxanthones are readily transformed into 2&#8208;hydroxybenzophenone products.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Hydro&#8208; and Deuterodechlorination of Trichloroacetamides under Controlled Electrochemical Conditions To Prepare Mono&#8208;, Di&#8208;, and Deuterochloroacetamides</title>

Abstract
Mono&#8208; and dichloro acetamides were prepared via a hydrodechlorination reaction of trichloroacetamides under controlled electrochemical conditions. The reactions were carried out in an undivided cell with constant current flow using n&#8208;Bu4NI as supporting electrolyte and methanol as solvent and proton source. Deuterodechlorination of trichloroacetamide was also successful when methanol&#8208;d4 was used as solvent under identical electrochemical conditions.

         <title>Engineering Styrene Oxide Isomerase Towards Enhanced Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of (S)&#8208;Flurbiprofen</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The conventional synthesis of (S)&#8208;flurbiprofen, a valuable non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID), involves inefficient chiral resolution with low&#8208;yielding multiple reaction steps, or asymmetric synthesis with low enantioselectivity and/or regioselectivity. Here, we developed high&#8208;yielding, enantioselective, and sustainable synthesis of (S)&#8208;flurbiprofen via two chemoenzymatic approaches from a simple alkene: (A) enzymatic epoxidation&#8208;isomerization&#8208;oxidation cascade and Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation; and (B) chemical epoxidation, enzymatic isomerization&#8208;oxidation cascade, and Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation. Styrene oxide isomerase (SOI)&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;retentive Meinwald rearrangement was the key step in the two pathways, but SOI suffers from low activity. SOI was engineered via two rounds of iterative saturation mutagenesis and screening with a three&#8208;enzyme cascade assay, generating a double&#8208;mutant SOIDM (N99A/D95A) with 5.5&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM). In Pathway A, cascade biotransformation of 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylstyrene with engineered E. coli strain expressing SOIDM, styrene monooxygenase (SMO) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), and subsequent Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation afforded (S)&#8208;flurbiprofen in 98% yield and 91% ee. In Pathway B, chemical epoxidation (Sharpless dihydroxylation and ring&#8208;closing), cascade conversion using an engineered E. coli strain expressing SOIDM, ALDH and NADH oxidase (NOX), and Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation produced (S)&#8208;flurbiprofen in 83% yield and 98% ee. Compared to conventional synthesis, the developed methods reduced reaction steps, minimized waste generation and improved enantioselectivity or overall yield.

         <title>Ambiphilic Reactivity of SF5&#8208;Alkynes Applied to Regioselective and Stereodivergent Halogenation Reactions: An Experimental and Theoretical Case Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We explored the ambiphilic reactivity of SF5&#8208;alkynes, and we proved they can act as both nucleophiles and electrophiles. We selected halogenation reactions as benchmark reactions and developed highly selective stereodivergent hydrohalogenation (I, Br, Cl, F) reactions of SF5&#8208;alkynes. The stereochemistry is finely controlled thanks to the nature of the acids used (strong or soft) in the presence of halide source, while the high regioselectivity is governed by the strong polarization of SF5&#8208;alkynes. Mechanistic studies supported by DFT calculations shed light on two different reaction mechanisms responsible of the excellent stereocontrol. This stereoselectivity was quantitatively rationalized with the ASM and EDA methods. A few dihalogenation reactions are reported and DFT calculations rationalize this cis&#8208;stereoselectivity. Relative configuration of all the SF5&#8208;haloalkenes was unambiguously determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Noteworthy, several post&#8208;functionalization reactions such as cross&#8208;couplings, cyanation and reductions are described to strengthen the synthetic potential.

         <title>Asymmetric Boracarboxylation of Styrenes Using Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The boracarboxylation reaction has potential for the production of natural products and drug candidates, but the development of an asymmetric version of this transformation is challenging. We report an enantioselective boracarboxylation of styrenes, enabled by a copper catalyst containing chiral phosphines. Our experimental conditions provide yields between 31&#8211;76% and enantiomeric ratios from 80:20 up to 98:2 for electron&#8208;rich styrenes. Oxidation of a boracarboxylation product gives (S)&#8208;tropic acid, an intermediate towards several tropane alkaloids. A computational analysis of the mechanistic details shows a complex pattern of competing reaction pathways, highlighting challenges encountered when developing asymmetric reactions using CO2.

         <title>Imidazolidine&#8208;pyrroloimidazolone Pyridine&#8208;Ni(acac)2 complex Catalyzed Asymmetric Darzens Reaction of Isatins with Phenacyl Chlorides: A Chiral Amplification Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With phenacyl chlorides as simple nucleophilic species, the asymmetric Darzens reaction of isatins using Ni(acac)2 as the Lewis acid and imidazolidine&#8208;pyrroloimidazolone pyridine as the ligand is reported. In the presence of 1 mol% of catalyst, diverse spiro&#8208;epoxyoxindoles with two new contiguous stereocenters were afforded in 82&#8208;99% yields, &gt;20:1 dr, and 91&#8208;99% ee. Chiral spiro&#8208;epoxyoxindoles could undergo ring&#8208;opening reactions in further transformations. The developed method was applied to the derivatization of complex molecules including indomethacin, gemfibrozil, and febuxostat&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;chloroketones. A strong positive nonlinear effect was observed, which was caused by the precipitation of a less&#8208;soluble racemic catalyst complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Access to Sultams and Spirocyclic Sultams by the Divergent Annulations of (N&#8208;Aryl)&#8208;Alkynyl Sulphonamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present the first annulation reaction of (N&#8208;aryl)&#8208;alkynyl sulphonamides leading to sultams or spirocyclic sultams. The selective formation of aforesaid products is based on the variable reactivity, intramolecular ortho&#8208;cyclization or dearomative ipso&#8208;annulation, guided by the substituent on N&#8208;aryl group of the substrate. The ortho&#8208;annulation is mediated by electrophile, while the ipso&#8208;annulation is promoted by the radical, enabling the functionalization (selenyl or iodo) on sultams. The synthetic potential of this method is illustrated by modifications of the functional groups present in the products obtained</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Naphthalenone Spiroindanediones or 4&#8208;Acyl&#8208;1&#8208;naphthols from Aryl Enaminones Featuring Reuse of Dimethylamine</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Presented herein is a switchable synthesis of naphthalenone spiroindanediones or 4&#8208;acyl&#8208;1&#8208;naphthols via condition&#8208;controlled divergent cascade reactions of aryl enaminones with diazoindanediones. When the reaction was carried out in the presence of an oxidative additive, naphthalenone spiroindanedione was formed through C(sp2)&#8211;H alkylation followed by simultaneous spiroannulation and elimination of dimethylamine. When the reaction was carried out in the presence of an acid additive, on the other hand, 4&#8208;acyl&#8208;1&#8208;naphthol was formed through ring opening of the spiroindanedione moiety attacked by the in situ released dimethylamine. In addition, the reactions are suitable for gram&#8208;scale applications and compatible with a variety of substrates. Moreover, the naphthol products allow structural elaborations and hybridization with clinic drug, thus further enhancing the value of this developed method.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;regioselective aroylation of quinoline N&#8208;oxides with aryl &#945;&#8208;ketoacids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrochemical method with high faradaic efficiency was developed for the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;regioselective aroylation of quinoline N&#8208;oxides under oxidant&#8208;free conditions by using aryl &#945;&#8208;ketoacids as the aroylation reagent. A series of 8&#8208;aroylquinoline N&#8208;oxides were effectively synthesized in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. Furthermore, the proposed method was successfully applied to the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a tubulin polymerization inhibitor. Additionally, a plausible reaction mechanism for the decarboxylation radical acylation was proposed on the basis of the results of cyclic voltammetry and control experiments. Overall, this method provides a novel solution for the C8&#8208;regioselective aroylation of quinoline N&#8208;oxides.</dc:description>

Abstract
We report a class of isolable bis&#8208;cyclometallated iridium precatalysts (ImIr) and their use in regioselective ortho&#8722;C&#8722;H borylation of aromatic, heteroaromatic, acrylic, and aliphatic systems. The catalysts consist of two imine ligands and an acetate coordinated to an iridium (III) center. The isolable character of ImIr warrants its compatibility with high&#8208;throughput experimentation, a prerequisite for applications in late&#8208;stage functionalization (LSF) of complex substrates. Initial mechanistic studies point towards an inner&#8208;sphere mechanism involving bis&#8208;cyclometallated species shedding light on the general mechanistic understanding of ortho&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylations.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Five to Eight&#8208;Membered P&#8208;Stereogenic Benzo&#8208;Fused Heterocycles via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>

Abstract
P&#8208;stereogenic benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles is a privileged skeleton due to their outstanding catalytic properties and bioactivities. However, their enantioselective synthesis is still underdeveloped. Here we demonstrate the use of easily accessible racemic H&#8722;P(O) compounds as starting materials and commercial chiral N1, N2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diphenylethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine ligand in combination with Cu(I) catalysts to enable an attractive dynamic kinetic C(sp2)&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reaction. This protocol not only exhibits a broad substrate scope but also provides general access to a diverse range of useful P&#8208;stereogenic five&#8208;, six&#8208;, seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered benzo&#8208;fused O, P&#8208; containing heterocycles with good to high yields and enantioselectivities.

Abstract
A straightforward TMSCF3&#8208;catalyzed conversion of Weinreb amides into esters through the treatment with sodium alkoxides is reported. The procedure documents a genuine selectivity for the esterification of primary alcohols with Weinreb amides featuring diverse substitution pattern. The constitutive N&#8208;methoxy fragment of these acylating agents is responsible for the unique reactivity they display, thus enabling to explore alkoxides as competent nucleophilic elements. The protocol is compatible with the fully transfer of stereochemical information embodied in the starting material, as well as, guarantees the preparation of pharmaceuticals. Mechanistic investigations revealed that under the adopted reaction conditions (NaOR, R primary) TMSCF3 does not release the trifluoromethyl (CF3&#8722;) anion &#8211; as occurs with tertiary alkoxides &#8211; but rather it catalytically activates the amidic bond.

Abstract
2&#8208;Exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones are useful synthetic intermediates with a unique indole scaffold. However, their synthesis has not yet been reported owing to their reactivity and instability. In this study, a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed method for generating 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivatives via the 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#8208;selective cyclization of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;amino)phenyl alkynyl ketones with an alkyne terminus was developed. The subsequent pseudo&#8208;dimerization of the generated 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones and their [4+2] cyclization reactions with 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes afforded spiropseudoindoxyl and pyranoindole derivatives, respectively, in 21% to quantitative yields. Density functional theory calculations of the gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization provided insights into the 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig selectivity. Furthermore, the reactive 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one was isolated for the first time based on the results from 1H NMR spectroscopic monitoring. The isolated product was applied to various transformations. Our synthesis method promotes the development of bioactive agents and functional materials with complex cyclic structures.

Abstract
A range of densely functionalized ullazines have been synthesized by a one&#8208;pot Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed twofold C&#8722;H activation/oxidative annulation of N&#8208;arylpyrroles with alkynes. Electrophilic bromination at 5&#8208; or 5,7&#8208; positions of the EWG&#8208;substituted ullazine core offers an interesting single or double entry for further extended functionalization. Mechanistic considerations suggest two complementary paths, EWG&#8208;assisted and SEAr, for the C&#8722;H activations. All ullazines exhibit strong fluorescence emissions. Ullazines bearing thiophene and triarylamine units at 5&#8208; and 5,7&#8208; positions show a significant bathochromic shift in their emission spectra, attributed to the more extended electronic circuits present.

Abstract
A synthetic protocol was developed to synthesize highly functionalized 3&#8208;furylmethyl chromones from enynones and o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl enaminones via silver&#8208;catalyzed cascade bis&#8208;heteroannulation reaction. This strategy features broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance. Furthermore, the 3&#8208;furylmethyl chromone skeleton shows the potential synthetic application value through further gram&#8208;scale synthesis and derivatization.

Abstract
A new mode of reactivity of N&#8208;sulfonylhydrazones towards alkynes is described: ketone&#8208;derived N&#8208;tosylhydrazones (NTHs) bearing &#945;&#8208;H atoms behave as [NN] synthons in their reactions with alkoxy alkynyl Fischer carbene complexes (FCCs) and only the two N atoms are incorporated into the newly formed pyrazole ring. The scope of the reaction, leading to 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;N&#8208;alkenyl pyrazoles, proved to be wide regarding both partners; thus, a variety of aryl and primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl substituents are tolerated within the FCC, while aryl alkyl NTHs, symmetric and asymmetric dialkyl NTHs and NTHs derived of cyclic ketones can be also employed. In addition, the reaction can be performed at large scale and applied for late&#8208;stage diversification of natural products. A reasonable reaction mechanism is also proposed, which is supported by deuteration experiments and DFT calculations.

Abstract
A process for the synthesis of aryl thioglycosides from the aryl thianthrenium salts and 1&#8208;thiosugars is achieved by copper(I)&#8208;mediated, photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reactions. The desired products could be obtained in 32% to 78% yield after irradiation with 34&#8197;W blue light at room temperature. Various functional groups, especially including halogen groups, were well tolerated under standard reaction conditions. This strategy differs conceptually from all previous S&#8208;glycosylations in that thiosugar functionality could be incorporated into complex natural products or drugs at a late stage site&#8208;selectively, which has not been shown via aryl halides and aryldiazonium salts.

Abstract
An easily scalable and highly diastereoselective synthesis of challenging 1,2,5,6,11,11b&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;3H&#8208;imidazo[1&#8242;,2&#8242;:1,2]pyrido[3,4&#8208;b]indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones is accomplished through divergent transformation of Ugi 4&#8208;CR products. The trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf) mediated intramolecular condensation of a series of Ugi 4&#8208;CR adducts generates a N&#8208;acylimidinium intermediate which undergoes ring closure to selectively afford the target title compounds in good to high yields.

Abstract
While the emergence of electrophotochemistry provides opportunities, such a chemistry at this stage suffers from limited reaction types and high photocatalyst loadings. A self&#8208;catalyzed electrophotosynthesis as well as one with a low photocatalyst loading is presented. These external&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free cyclizations are enabling and applicable to a range of activated alkenes, affording a diverse array of thiocyanato heterocycles including 4&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones, isoquinoline&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones, indolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolin&#8208;6(5H)&#8208;ones, benzoimidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolin&#8208;6(5H)&#8208;ones and indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones, and the protocols are amenable to the late&#8208;stage diversification of complex molecular architectures as well as gram&#8208;scale syntheses. Sunlight could serve as the light source, and the reaction could be conducted in an all&#8208;solar&#8208;driven mode using a commercially available photovoltaic panel to produce electricity.

         <title>Synthesizing Silyl Arylsulfonyl Hydrazones as Silyldiazomethane Precursors and Their Use in Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions</title>

Abstract
A method for synthesizing silyl arylsulfonyl hydrazones as silyldiazomethane precursors has been developed. Although silyldiazomethanes are an important class of diazo compounds, their use in intramolecular cyclization reactions has not been fully explored despite the rich chemistry of diazo compounds, particularly metal carbenoid chemistry. The fundamental challenge underlying the absence of such studies is the lack of a method for synthesizing silyldiazomethanes with functional groups that can react with metal carbenoids. The method reported here provides access to variety of silyl arylsulfonyl hydrazones with functional groups such as ethers, carbamates, and alkynes, which can serve as reaction sites for metal carbenoids. A one&#8208;pot hydrazone formation using unstable formylsilane formed in&#8197;situ is key to a successful synthesis. The use of 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzenesulfonohydrazide contributed toward achieving broad generality in hydrazone formation. The synthetic potential of this method was demonstrated through the generation of silyldiazomethane and its transformation to several silacycles.

Abstract
In this manuscript we report the synthesis of 3&#8208;amido&#8208;benzo[b]silines thanks to a 2&#8208;step strategy involving a 3&#8208;component silylformylation of ynamides followed by a Friedel&#8208;Crafts cyclization/isomerizing dehydration domino sequence. This reaction is tolerant to various structural variations and has allowed us to synthesize a library of diversely substituted silacycles with yields from 33 to 85%. We also studied the fluorescence properties of these compounds which show structural similarities with recognized probes such as Si&#8208;Rhodamine for example.

The front cover illustrates pandas as gold catalysts on trees, with the leaves symbolizing reaction reagents, intermediates, and products. It portrays the 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#8208;selective cyclization of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;ynones. The smiling panda under the tree captures the synthesized 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones, which reflect the isolation of the intermediates. The illustration suggests the synthetic utility of the 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones for syntheses of spiropseudoindoxyl and pyranoindole derivatives, and implies the opening of avenues toward the discovery of new bioactive materials.

Abstract
The chiral P,N,N&#8208;ligands represented a new type of tridentate ligand developed in recent years and displayed wide utilities in asymmetric catalysis. In the past decades, numerous chiral P,N,N&#8208;ligands with ferrocene, phenethylamine and spiro backbones were synthesized by addition of an aminopyridine, imidazole or diamines coordinating group. These chiral tridentate P,N,N&#8208;ligands showed excellent performance in the ruthenium, iridium, manganese, or cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenations. A wide range of substrates, including simple ketones, &#945;&#8208;halogenated ketones, &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones, &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;amino keto&#8208; ones, &#945;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, or &#948;&#8208;keto acids, &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;keto amides, &#946;&#8208; or &#948;&#8208;keto esters, &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;enones, olefins, imines, quinolines and indoles, could be hydrogenated to afford the corresponding chiral products with high yields and enantioselectivities. In this review, progress on the asymmetric hydrogenation of C=O, C=N, C=C bonds with chiral tridentate P,N,N&#8208;ligands was summarized.

Abstract
This review presents an outline of current advancements in the photochemical and electrochemical synthesis of oxazoles and isoxazoles. Oxazole and isoxazole are important building blocks for a variety of medicinally useful compounds. Therefore, the synthesis of these heterocycles via sustainable technologies is worth demanding. Photochemical and electrochemical are two among the few sustainable technologies. This review covers a brief discussion on reaction parameters like catalysts, substrates scope, reaction temperature, solvents, electrodes, electrolytes (in case of electrochemical process), light source (in case of photochemical process) for individual reaction. Detailed discussion on mechanistic insight for each reaction is also presented. Finally, summary, and future direction toward the development of effective electrochemical and photochemical methods for the reaction of oxazoles and isoxazoles is also presented.

Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic compounds, in particular, quinolines and quinazolines are frequently used in medicinal chemistry. Therefore, the direct and clean synthesis of these valuable scaffolds has been a great interest for many years. 2&#8208;Aminobenzyl alcohols as an alternative reactant instead of unstable and expensive 2&#8208;aminobenzaldehydes can be used in the construction of N&#8208;fused heterocycles including quinolines, quinazolines, oxazines, thiazines, selenazines, imidazoles, diazepines, etc. In this review article, we have discussed recent developments in the use of 2&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohols in the synthesis of diverse heterocycles.

Abstract
We report an iron&#8208;catalyzed divergent synthesis of alkylated indoles based on precise control of the activation sites on indoles through the selection of catalysts. Using indoles and styrenes as starting materials, 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;alkylated indoles could be prepared selectively and directly for the first time by treating with a catalytic amount of Fe(OTf)3 and 3&#8208;alkylated indoles were achieved exclusively by adding a catalytic amount of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin as the cocatalyst with Fe(OTf)3. This simple method was demonstrated with 52 examples with high yields and broad functional group compatibilities.

         <title>Access to 3&#8208;Azetidines via Halogenation of Titanacyclobutanes</title>

Abstract
Azetidines are valuable nitrogenous heterocycles. Herein, we disclose a strategy for the modular assembly of 3&#8208;azetidines and related spirocyclic congeners featuring all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers. This approach leverages titanacyclobutanes generated from ketones or alkenes. Halogenation of these organotitanium species gives rise to functionalized alkyl dihalides that can be subsequently captured by amines to afford azetidine building blocks. This strategy facilitated the synthesis of a small molecule anti&#8208;tuberculosis drug. It also enabled access to carbon&#8208;13 isotopologs of diazaspiro[3.3]heptane fragments that are challenging to prepare by any other means.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azetidines are valuable nitrogenous heterocycles. Herein, we disclose a strategy for the modular assembly of 3-azetidines and related spirocyclic congeners featuring all-carbon quaternary centers. This approach leverages titanacyclobutanes generated from ketones or alkenes. Halogenation of these organotitanium species gives rise to functionalized alkyl dihalides that can be subsequently captured by amines to afford azetidine building blocks. This strategy facilitated the synthesis of a small molecule anti-tuberculosis drug. It also enabled access to carbon-13 isotopologs of diazaspiro[3.3]heptane fragments that are challenging to prepare by any other means.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Herein we report the discovery and development of the first example of a cationic [1,5]&#8208;aryl migration reaction, through an unprecedented phenonium ions. This reaction does not require any acid, base, transition metal&#8208;based catalyst or promoter, instead promoted by the water activated NXS reagents. It provides a highly diastereoselective and rapid access to the medicinally and biologically important tetra&#8208;substituted olefins (allyl alcohols). The involvement of an ipso&#8208;carbon, as well as the phenonium ion during this novel, cationic [1,5]&#8208;aryl migration was strongly supported by the isolation of 2&#8208;oxaspiro[5.5]undecane&#8208;9&#8208;ones. This methodology is highly tolerable for a wide range of propargyl&#8208;benzyl ethers, resulting in a selective construction of structurally divergent library of mono&#8208;halo&#8208;tricarbon&#8208;substituted alkenes. Synthetic application has also been demonstrated by converting two isomeric&#8208;iodo&#8208;olefins to respective E&#8208; and Z&#8208;isomers of tamoxifen in a stereospecific manner.

Abstract
Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H oxidation of unprotected aniline derivatives under aerobic conditions, which enables the preparation of phenanthridine compounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the pioneering reaction of dehydrogenative C(sp3)&#8722;N bond formation from unprotected anilines under a Cu/O2 system. Notably, various anilines possessing alkyl, methoxy, halogen (fluoride, chloride, bromide, and iodide), trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, cyano, ester, and acetal groups can also participate in the reaction.

Abstract
Herein, a visible light&#8208;mediated defluorination reaction to access 1,1&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes is described. Compared with previous studies, this protocol employs more readily accessible acids as a radical precursor under redox&#8208;neutral conditions. Moreover, the reaction exhibits high compatibility with diverse primary, secondary and tertiary acids, especially natural amino acids and drug&#8208;derived acids. Preliminary mechanistic investigations reveal that a radical pathway is involved in the catalytic cycle.

Abstract
The domino annulation reactions of o&#8208;aminotrifluoroacetophenone derivatives and MBH carbonates enabled by PPh3 have been reported, which provide a series of tetrahydrofuro[3,2&#8208;b]indolines containing a CF3&#8208;substituted tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenters in yields of 74 to 95% and &gt;20:1 dr. In this process, MBH carbonates were used as C1/C3 synthons. The MTT assay shows that the products exhibit the activity of inhibitory effect on proliferation on Hela cancer cell line.

Abstract
An effective one&#8208;pot approach has been devised for the selective synthesis of alkynyl sulfides through the cleavage of C&#8722;S bonds in alkynyl sulfonium salts. This method involves a base&#8208;promoted nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening and desulfurization pathway, enabling the efficient preparation of diverse alkynyl sulfide compounds. The reaction demonstrates excellent tolerance to various functional groups and proves applicable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules and pharmaceuticals. Moreover, the practicality of this method has been underscored through scale&#8208;up reaction and modification of alkynyl sulfide products.

Abstract
A Mitsunobu process performed under neat grinding conditions, using a mixer mill, is reported. It proceeds in the absence of reaction solvent and in short reactions times (10&#8211;20&#8197;min). A broad substrate scope encompassing primary and secondary alcohols, as well as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon&#8208;centered nucleophiles is demonstrated. Application to the functionalization of a selection of APIs is shown, also. The developed process is amenable to scale up on a planetary ball&#8208;mill, yielding over 2 grams of product. Finally, a representative alcohol is inverted with excellent stereoselectivity.

Abstract
We describe a catalyst, oxidant, and coupling&#8208;reagent free strategy to access 4&#8208;membered heterocycles, representing a unique example of visible&#8208;light triggered intramolecular cyclization of propargylic alcohols and amines to access oxetanones and azetidinones respectively. Despite the direct 4&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization from these starting materials has proven to be unfavorable, the formation of key p&#8208;quinone methide intermediacy allows an efficient bypass for regioselective 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization, resulting in the formation of the desired 4&#8208;membered heterocycles. This mild and operationally simple protocol facilitates the synthesis of products with distinct substitution patterns such as quaternary &#945;&#8208;carbons, and enables late&#8208;stage functionalization.

         <dc:description>A strategy to access fluorinated spiroindolenines has been developed, involving a selective functionalization of indoles with fluorinated moieties and subsequent catalytic dearomatization. Trifluomethylthio (SCF3), diethyl phosphono(difluoromethyl)thio (SCF2P(O)(OEt)2) and (phenylsulfonyl)difluoromethyl (CF2SO2Ph) groups were embedded at the C2 position of indole derivatives substituted with alkynes, allenes, and allyl carbonate moieties at the C3 position. A gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization gave access to six spiroindolenines, and an enantioselective palladium catalyzed cyclization provided 10 fluorinated spirocyclic products with up to 77% ee.</dc:description>

Abstract
In this study, we have developed a metal&#8208;mediated synthetic method for incorporating the 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl (CF2CF2H) motif into unactivated, electron&#8208;rich alkenyl iodides using cross&#8208;coupling reactions. We discovered that the stable Cu(CF2CF2H)(PPh2Me)3 complex, while unreactive with these substrates, serves as a P&#8208;ligated reservoir for the formation of solvent&#8208;stabilized &#8220;ligandless&#8221; and reactive CuCF2CF2H species. This transformation occurs upon addition of CuBr, which partially scavenges the P&#8208;ligand in the form of CuBr(PPh2Me)3. The resulting in&#8197;situ generated solvent stabilized &#8220;ligandless&#8221; system significantly enhances the reactivity of the complex, particularly towards challenging electron&#8208;rich substrates. This advancement enables the synthesis of HCF2CF2&#8208;glycals, as well as nucleosides/nucleobases and arenes.

Abstract
Here in, we describe the photochemical decarboxylative alkylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones using commercially accessible carboxylic acids with oxygen as sole oxidant through energy transfer process. The coupling of diverse array of alkyl carboxylic acids (1&#176; to 3&#176;) and bioactive acids with quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones is successfully accomplished to achieve the desired alkylated products.

Abstract
Herein, we present a (NH4)2S2O8 mediated difunctionalization reaction of aryl alkenes with quinoxalinones and P(O)SH compounds. This method enables the synthesis of various phosphorothioate&#8208;containing quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives (46 examples) in 37&#8211;79% yields. The reaction is compatible with a range of functional groups and is easily adaptable to large&#8208;scale synthesis. Preliminary studies suggest the involvement of phosphorothioate radicals in these transformations.

         <title>A Mild Metal&#8208;Free Approach for the Direct Synthesis of Carbamoyl Azides from Carboxylic Acid Redox Active Esters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Carbamoyl azide is a pivotal compound used in the transformation into urea and amines, as well as in nitrene insertion reactions. In this study, we present a pioneering method for synthesizing carbamoyl azide directly from acid redox active esters without the use of metals or oxidants. This approach demonstrates tolerance for various functional groups, enhancing its applicability. Furthermore, this technique facilitates late&#8208;stage modifications of natural products and pharmaceuticals, thereby accelerating the development and identification of novel drug candidates.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura/Allylic Substitution: A Regioselective Synthesis of (2&#8208;Arylallyl) Aryl Sulfones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A one&#8208;pot Pd&#8208;catalyzed tandem process to prepare (2&#8208;arylallyl) aryl sulfones has been developed. This strategy is based on the modular assembly of a boronic acid, a sodium sulfinate and 2&#8208;bromoallyl acetate. The reaction is completely regioselective towards the terminal alkene, yielding (2&#8208;arylallyl) aryl (or alkyl) sulfones with yields ranging from 56 to 93%. Control experiments together with DFT calculations allowed to propose a plausible reaction mechanism of the tandem reaction. The usefulness of this methodology has been demonstrated with the formal synthesis of the marketed drug Apremilast and of several natural products by asymmetric hydrogenation. Using the commercially available UbaPHOX iridium complex, chiral &#946;&#8208;methyl sulfones with up to 98% ee were obtained

         <title>Regioselective C6&#8208;Arylation of Thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazole Heterocycles with Aryl Iodides</title>

Abstract
Regioselective C6&#8208;arylation of thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazoles with aryl iodides as coupling partners has been developed. This strategy was performed in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 as catalyst in combination with AgOTf as an oxidant and TFA in dimethylacetamide. In all experiments, only the C6&#8208;arylated thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazole was isolated since its C5&#8208;regioisomer was not observed, indicating the high regioselectivity of this approach. The catalytic system used is compatible with a variety of 3&#8208;functionalized thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazoles and iodoaryl electrophiles, providing access to 3,6&#8208;disubstituted thieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyrazoles in yields ranging from 49% to 94%.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Ugi&#8208;Type Reaction for the Synthesis of 3,3&#8208;Disubstituted Phthalides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The synthesis of diverse phthalides containing quaternary carbon centers remains poorly exploited, requiring stepwise reactions with toxic reagents under high temperatures. Herein, we describe a visible&#8208;light promoted, photo&#8208; and metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free protocol for the modular synthesis of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted phthalides with water as the sole by&#8208;product. This process featured an open&#8208;flask operation of a three&#8208;component reaction involving an isocoumarin as the self&#8208;photosensitizer for aerobic ring contracting rearrangements, allowing the convenient preparation of 3&#8208;(1&#8242;&#8208;indolyl)&#8208;phthalides in moderate to good yields. The mechanistic investigations suggested that singlet oxygen (1O2) was generated through an energy&#8208;transfer pathway.

Abstract
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed vinylation method for alkenyl ethers has been developed. In this strategy, both chain and cyclic alkenyl ether substrates were applicable, and the target products were obtained in up to 95% yields and with the E/Z selectivities of &gt;98:2. Furthermore, we have successfully applied this method to directly vinylate the C&#8208;2 position of protected glucals, offering a valuable tool for their functionalization. Moreover, through the utilization of alkenyl alcohols as substrates, we accomplished a 1,2&#8208;alkenyloxylation of alkenyl double bond, enabling the synthesis of functionalized cyclic ether compounds with five or six&#8208;membered rings.

         <title>Synthesis of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Hydrazines by Electrocatalytic Addition of Hydrazines to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyl Compounds</title>

Abstract
A strategy for the synthesis of N,N&#8208;disubstituted hydrazines via the electrocatalytic addition of hydrazine to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds is reported. The reaction was carried out under constant current electrolytic conditions in an undivided cell. Using this methodology, various N,N&#8208;disubstituted hydrazines were prepared in 57&#8211;94% yield in 40&#8197;minutes. By adding cyclohexanone and acetic acid to the reaction mixture of N,N&#8208;disubstituted hydrazines and heating for 2&#8197;hours, a one&#8208;pot synthesis of N&#8208;substituted indoles was also developed. Furthermore, based on cyclic voltammetry and control experiments, a plausible mechanism involving a radical pathway is proposed.

Abstract
An iron&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the synthesis of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole heterocyclic structures is disclosed employing isatins and non&#8208;nucleophilic N&#8208;methoxybenzamides. This reaction class is associated with broad scope and tolerates numerous functionalities, such as fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo, trifluoromethyl, nitrile, ester, ether, and alkenyl, including heteroaryl &#8211; thiophene, benzothiophene, carbazolyl, indolyl, eugenol, and polycyclic cholesterol moieties. Detailed mechanistic investigations reveal that the reaction proceeds via iron&#8208;catalyzed N&#8722;O bond cleavage in N&#8208;methoxybenzamides, generating formaldehyde and benzamide, and through the intermediacy of isatin&#8208;ketimines and N&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)benzamides. Overall, this amidation reaction involves one C&#8722;C and two C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming tandem processes, providing a range of &#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;oxindoles (45 examples) in up to 88% yields.

         <title>An Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Radical Cascade Cyclization to Access Cyanoalkylsulfonyl Quinolino&#8208;Quinazolinones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction, involving cyanoalkylsulfonylation and cyclization, has been devised to enable the synthesis of functionalized sulfonylated quinolino&#8208;quinazolinone alkyl nitriles. This three&#8208;component radical transformation exhibits excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity while functioning without the need for external oxidizing or reducing agents. The cost&#8208;effectiveness of this catalytic system, together with its broad substrate application, which includes drug molecule derivatives, make this approach efficient and adaptable.

Abstract
Tetrasubstituted 2,3&#8208;trans&#8208;dihydrofuran and furan are important heterocyclic scaffolds in natural product, bioorganic and medicinal chemistry as well as in material science. The synthesis of both of these heterocycles starting from common and readily available starting materials are challenging. We found that in&#8197;situ generated deoxybenzoin&#8208;chalcone Michael adducts underwent oxidative annulation upon heating with molecular iodine in DMSO to provide selectively 2,3&#8208;trans&#8208;dihydrofurans at 80&#8201;&#176;C and furans at 120&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Phospholanes via Twofold C&#8208;H&#8208;Addition to Phospholes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A synthetic route towards phospholanes via twofold C&#8722;H&#8208;addition of a DMSO molecule to &#946;&#8208;H substituted phospholes is described. The resulting fused phospholane oxothiolane system in case of symmetric &#945;&#8208;substitution possesses four stereogenic centers or rather six in case of asymmetric &#945;&#8208;substitution. The reaction conditions are shown to be applicable for a variety of phospholes with different P&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;substituents always leading to stereoselective formation of the fused heterocyclic ring system. All phospholane derivatives with one exception are sufficiently air stable for purification with column chromatography and are fully characterized by NMR and elemental analysis and mass spectrometry. With the help of X&#8208;ray crystallography, the different configurations of the isomers could be demonstrated. For one model system derivatization reactions are presented. When oxidizing or reducing the sulfoxide group only a single diastereomer is observed.

Abstract
Ytterbium triflate catalysed domino reaction of (3&#8208;formyl&#8208;4&#8208;indolyl)&#8208;derived donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane with primary amines provides a simple approach to an unprecedented tetracyclic skeleton in which tropane system is peri&#8208;annulated with an indole core. This process involves the formation of an imine and its (3+2)&#8208;cross&#8208;cycloaddition with donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane moiety, yielding tropane&#8208;fused indole core under mild reaction conditions. These products are of significant interest for pharmacology as potential hybrid molecules with a dual mode of action.

         <title>Selective Hydrosilylation and Hydroboration of Allenes Catalyzed by Cobalt&#8208;Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Achieving precise control over regioselectivity and stereoselectivity in the hydroelementation of terminal allenes presents a formidable challenge. Despite the existence of various catalytic methods for their functionalization, this entire class of reactions remains significantly underdeveloped and demands extensive research. Here, we report a method for the hydroelementation of allenes using inexpensive PN5P pincer cobalt complexes built on a triazine backbone. Depending on the substituent at the ring, the method enables the selective synthesis of E&#8208;alkenylsilane or Z&#8208;allylborane derivatives. In the presented approach, silanes and pinacoloboranes play a dualistic role of simultaneous activator and substrate excluding the need for the addition of external bases. Finally, the application potential of the obtained compounds was demonstrated by performing further functionalizations of the obtained compounds.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Nitrocyclopropanes Bearing a Thioester Group and Three Stereogenic Centers</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A two&#8208;stage protocol was developed for accessing nitrocyclopropanes that bear a thioester group and three stereogenic centers. This protocol achieves practical overall yields ranging from 54% to 75%, along with high levels of stereoselectivity (single diastereomer with up to 98% ee). Brominated monothiomalonate (Br&#8208;MTM) is used as an &#945;&#8208;bromo thioacetate equivalent, which reacts efficiently with nitroolefins in the presence of a low catalyst loading (0.5&#8197;mol%) of cinchona alkaloid squaramide under both &#8220;on water&#8221; and organic homogeneous conditions. The obtained &#945;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitrothioesters undergo an anti&#8208;selective decarboxylation and intramolecular SN2 cyclization process, leading to the formation of desired cyclopropanes. Control experiments were conducted alongside computational studies in order to gain insights into the observed stereoselectivities.

         <title>Selectivity Switch in Non&#8208;Directed Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Olefination of Chlorobenzene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8722;H olefination of chlorobenzene derivatives, which favored the functionalization at the ortho&#8208;to&#8208;chlorine position, was reported. The catalytic system employed a commercially available quinoline ligand to access a wide panel of olefinated aryl chlorides in moderate to high yields from feedstock chemicals (42 examples, 28 to 93% yields). The synthetic utility of the method was further demonstrated by the coupling of various bio&#8208;relevant acrylate partners offering straightforward access to structurally diverse complex molecules. A computational study of the reaction allowed us to confirm that the C&#8722;H activation step, occurring through a Concerted Metalation&#8208;Deprotonation mechanism, determined the site&#8208;selectivity of the transformation. The regioselectivity was controlled by the pKa of the C&#8722;H bond (more acidic position) and the lower distortion of chlorobenzene in the key transition structure.

         <title>Improved Palladium Catalysis in Suzuki&#8208;Type Coupling of Benzotriazinones for o&#8208;Aryl/Alkenyl Benzamides</title>

Abstract
A palladium catalyst system based on PdCl2(PPh3)2 or PdCl2(dppf) is reported for Suzuki&#8208;type coupling of both N&#8208;aryl and alkyl benzotriazinones with aryl/alkenyl boronic acids to afford a series of ortho&#8208;aryl/alkenyl benzamides in yields up to 99%, showing improvements on catalytic efficiency, substrate scope and practicality. Scope and limitations of the improved protocol have been demonstrated with more than 40 examples, including a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of activated o&#8208;biphenyl amide. Large electronic and steric effects from the boronic acid counterpart have been observed, implying the transmetallation from boron to palladium should be involved in the rate&#8208;determining step in catalytic cycle.

Abstract
One&#8208;pot access to sulfonyl 2,3&#8208;diarylnaphthalenes was developed via tBuOK&#8208;mediated (4+2) benzannulation of o&#8208;bis&#8208;sulfonylmethyl arenes, employing diverse diarylacetylenes. A plausible mechanism is proposed and discussed. The advantages of the system include the use of inexpensive reagents, wide substrate scope, and mild reaction conditions. The synthetic route allows for the formation of two carbon&#8211;carbon double bonds (C=C).

         <dc:description>Due to the presence of multiple reactive sites, including an alkyne, an alkene, and a ketone, 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)&#8208;2&#8208;alken&#8208;1&#8208;ones (yne&#8208;enones) can successfully participate in the synthesis of various carbo&#8208;, and heterocycles, as well as acyclic  compounds. In this regard, a wide variety of transition metal catalysts and organocatalysts are utilized in cycloaddition and functionalization reactions of yne&#8208;enones with other coupling partners. Considering the versatility of this synthon, in this review, we have described metal&#8208;catalyzed and non&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations of yne&#8208;enones over the last decade.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterocycles are important compounds existed in diverse advanced chemicals, functional materials, bioactive molecules and natural products. Different strategies through transition metal&#8208;catalyzed alkyne cyclization have been developed to synthesize various heterocycles. The merger of alkyne cyclization and metal nanoparticle catalysis has emerged as an important approach to diverse heterocycles. By using different kinds of metal nanoparticle catalysts, such as gold, silver, copper and palladium nanoparticles, a number of heterocycles are prepared with high yield and selectivity in a green, sustainable and highly efficient manner.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction of Trifluoromethylated &#946;&#8208;Keto Diazos and Nitriles Proceeding via H2O Addition to Nitrile Ylides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Cu&#8208;catalyzed multi&#8208;component reaction of trifluoromethylated &#946;&#8208;amino ketones and nitriles using tert&#8208;butyl nitrite as a diazotization reagent has been developed. Under the optimized conditions, N&#8208;trifluoroalkyl amides were obtained with yields up to 87%. Control experiments and computational studies reveal that the reaction proceeds through the generation of diazo, in situ formation of nitrile ylide, water addition and final enol tautomerism. This approach features mild reaction conditions, wide substrate tolerance, and scale&#8208;up applicability, which provides an efficient and practical strategy for amide synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction of glycals with base&#8208;labile protecting groups as a new route to glycoporphyrins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycoporphyrins are considered promising photosensitisers of new generation. Herein, we describe the original, metal&#8208;catalysed method towards porphyrin&#8208;carbohydrate C&#8208;C conjugates. The protocol of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction has been developed and it was compatible with peracetylated 2&#8208;iodoglycals. The utility of the reaction was exemplified on 15 different (C&#8208;2)&#8208;arylated sugar derivatives. Then it was applied on more challenging starting materials, namely, porphyrin boronates in which we addressed the issues of difficult transmetalation step usually observed on palladium&#8208;catalysed processes of porphyrin derivatives. The efficiency of the protocol was finally applied to synthesize the library of glycoporphyrins proving the versatile character of this strategy.

Abstract
We described a base&#8208;promoted O&#8208;arylation of N3&#8208;hydroxyl quinazolinones with diaryliodonium salts and sequential BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 and visible light&#8208;controlled [3,3]&#8208; or [1,3]&#8208;rearrangements of quinazolinone N&#8722;O aryl moieties to prepare a variety of 2&#8208;(quinazolin&#8208;4&#8208;yloxy)phenols and atropisomeric 3&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)quinazolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones in 44%&#8208;75% yields and 28%&#8208;70% yields, respectively. Mechanistic studies showed that HBF4 generated in&#8197;situ from BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O and water served as the catalyst in this process and aryloxyquinazolinium salts are vital intermediates promoting the [3,3]&#8208; or [1,3]&#8208;rearrangements. The N&#8722;O aryl moieties of aryloxyquinazolinium salts were found to undergo solely [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement with heating whereas [1,3]&#8208;rearrangement occurred via a radical process under irradiation of visible light. This method highlights the formation of aryloxyquinazolinium salts based on the use of BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 and visible light to prompt [1,3]&#8208;rearrangement generating atropisomeric quinazolinones.

Abstract
A variety of functionalized 3&#8208;arylazoindoles were prepared in good to excellent yields through an iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H azolation of 2&#8208;substituted indoles with arylhydrazines under mild reaction conditions. The reaction underwent an initial TBN&#8208;mediated nitrosation, 1,5&#8208;hydrogen migration, intramolecular condensation, and 1,5&#8208;hydrogen migration over four steps in one pot. A paracyclophane&#8208;derived 3&#8208;phenylazoindole could be prepared in 25% yield over three steps and some prepared 3&#8208;arylazoindoles showed a different fluorescence emission wavelength and existed obvious pH conditions response. The present method highlights broad substrate scope of easily available starting materials, wide range of functional group compatibility, gram scalable preparations, high atom economy, avoidance of unstable and explosive azolation reagents, and simple purification operations by extraction, washing, and recrystallization without flash column chromatography.

The present method highlights broad substrate scope of easily available starting materials, wide range of functional group compatibility, gram scalable preparations, high atom economy, avoidance of unstable and explosive azolation reagents, and simple purification operations by extraction, washing, and recrystallization without flash column chromatography.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Our research has demonstrated that mechanochemical activation is more effective with solid reagents. We have showcased the practicality of Bertagnini's salts, also called aldehyde&#8208;bisulfite adducts, which are crystalline, simplifying preparation and storage. These salts are stable substitutes for liquid aldehydes and ketones that have been employed in reductive amination, synthesizing aza&#8208;heterocycles and hydrazones within mechanochemistry. The technique&#8216;s effectiveness broadens the substrate scopes, simplifies purification, reduces reaction times, and yields the desired products ranging from 38&#8211;91%. Additionally, the thermal stability of the bisulfite adducts has been confirmed through TGA (Thermogravimetric analysis) analysis.

Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate that carbamoyl radicals generated through an organophotocatalytic protocol from 4&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;dihydropyridines (carbamoyl&#8208;DHPs) can be incorporated into Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) carbonates, affording a range of polyfunctionalized scaffolds with yields ranging from 63&#8211;98%. Reaction monitoring experiments, scale&#8208;up, reuse of the organophotocatalyst, and the hydrogenation of the succinamic ester's alkene moiety was also conducted, in order to showcase the mechanistic features and the robustness of this photochemical protocol.

Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds are synthesized from 3&#8208;propargyl indoles, obtained by direct propargylation of indoles, via a gold&#8208;catalyzed tandem oxidation&#8208;1,2&#8208;indole migration reaction in the presence of pyridine N&#8208;oxides. Fine&#8208;tuning of the catalyst and oxidant enables the reaction of 3&#8208;propargyl indoles bearing different substituents. The order of oxidation and indole migration is determined by the terminal or internal nature of the alkyne moiety. In addition, the process can be coupled with additional reactions, allowing an increase in molecular complexity or the design of more elaborated tandem reactions. In this sense, indole derivatives bearing an alkenyl substituent at the alkyne position evolve through a gold&#8208;catalyzed tandem oxidation&#8208;1,2&#8208;indole migration&#8208;Nazarov cyclization producing &#945;&#8208;indolyl cyclopentenones.

Abstract
We describe the efficient synthesis of novel dehydroxyquinines by arylation of quincorine bromide using Ni&#8208;catalysed cross electrophile coupling. The method demonstrates robust compatibility with (hetero)aryl bromides bearing diverse functional groups. Oxidation at C&#8208;9 of the dehydroxyquinines expediently provided quinine&#8208;inspired pseudo&#8208;natural products (&#8216;quinalogs&#8217;). Investigation of the compound collection against Plasmodium falciparum revealed a new insight into the structure activity relationship of quinine. Analogs bearing specifically functionalised pyridines, in place of the 6&#8208;methoxyquinoline ring of quinine, retained activity at the same order of magnitude, albeit not exceeding the activity of the natural product. This synthetic strategy conveniently enables iteration of the aromatic component of quinine for the first time, and holds promise for the development of effective new antimalarials.

Abstract
When a mixture containing 1&#8208;halo&#8208;1&#8208;alkyne, a dinucleophilic agent, and a base (Cs2CO3 or K3PO4) was heated in DMF, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective nucleophilic addition of the dinucleophilic agent to the acetylenes occurred. This reaction yielded (Z,Z)&#8208;bis(haloalkene), which subsequently underwent Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclization through C&#8722;H bond activation, resulting in the formation of two&#8208;oxygen&#8208; or &#8208;nitrogen&#8208;containing hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds. N&#8208;(5&#8208;Hydroxynaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methanesulfonamide was treated with 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;chloroethyne followed by 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;hexadecyne. After these reactions, Pd&#8208;catalyzed double C&#8722;H cyclization was employed to produce 1H&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;7&#8208;tetradecylbenzofuro[7,6&#8208;g]indole. Notably, this compound transformed into a fan&#8208;shaped structure at 86&#8201;&#176;C and transitioned into a smectic A phase characterized by a layered structure.

Abstract
Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular dual annulation reaction of alkyl nitrile&#8208;containing 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones to synthesize polycyclic quinazolinones. This catalytic reaction can construct the core structure of polycyclic quinazolinone alkaloids; therefore, we also apply this reaction as the critical step to access fifteen relevant alkaloids to demonstrate efficacy.

Abstract
A photoinduced direct synthesis of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;indenones via radical cascade cyclization strategy is demonstrated. The methodology involves a domino reaction between 2&#8208;alkynylarylnitrile and N&#8208;aminopyridinium salt and captures the reactivity of in&#8208;situ generated nitrogen&#8208;centered radical (NCR) in visible light. Multiple bond&#8208;forming events including C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C, and C&#8722;O take place sequentially on 2&#8208;alkynylarylnitrile enabling construction of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;indenone core at room temperature in 35&#8211;76% yield. A preliminary biological screening of synthesized compounds is indicative of their potent anti&#8208;cancer property.

Abstract
A Cp*Ir&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation of 1&#8208;isoquinolinone and 2&#8208;pyridones with N&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl as a directing group to afford 6&#8208;phenylpyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and 3&#8208;phenylisoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones by using arylsilanes is described in this paper. This method tolerates a series of functional groups, such as halide, trifluoromethyl, C=C double bond and offers a synthetic approach to the core structure of protoberberine alkaloids. Several experiments on mechanism studies were conducted to reveal the possible process of this Cp*Ir&#8208;catalytic cycle.

Abstract
We herein successfully demonstrate the use of chiral isochalcogenoureas as Lewis Base catalysts for a variety of (4+2)&#8208;cycloaddition reactions of allenoates and different Michael acceptors. In all cases the same structural key&#8208;motive, a dihydropyran with a (Z)&#8208;configurated exocyclic double bond could be accessed as the major regio&#8208; and diastereoisomer in an enantioselective manner. Furthermore, these chiral dihydropyrans were successfully engaged in different follow&#8208;up transformations.

Abstract
A protocol for the synthesis of trisubstituted furans via phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed regioselective cascade cyclization/amination of para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) with &#946;&#8208;ketodinitriles has been disclosed for the first time. Various kinds of p&#8208;QMs and &#946;&#8208;ketodinitriles can effectively produce the desired polysubstituted furan derivatives in 64&#8211;95% yields, demonstrating high atomic economy and their application in the construction of polysubstituted furan heterocycles. Preliminary biological activity assay suggests that these furans have potential anticancer activities.

         <title>Enabling C7 Methylation and Arylation of the Indolyl Core via P(III)&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Functionalization</title>

Abstract
Peripheral editing of complex molecules via C&#8722;H functionalization removes the pervasive retrosynthetic bias toward pre&#8208;functionalization and taps into the innate, often subtle, stereoelectronic differences between C&#8722;H linkages. Using this approach, bioactive molecules and residues can be modified without being beholden to lengthy sequences, thus allowing biochemical hypotheses to be interrogated on accelerated timelines. Herein, the C&#8722;H functionalization paradigm is leveraged to tackle C7&#8197;C&#8722;H functionalization of the biologically important tryptophan core. The devised process, which was expanded to indolyl (and related) systems, utilizes an N&#8208;bound unsymmetrical &#8220;designer&#8221; phosphine to direct C&#8722;H functionalization to the desired position while maintaining operational ease of directing group installation/removal. Quantum mechanically calculated steric properties and activation free energies suggest that this phosphine is hindered enough for favoring C&#8722;H functionalization over deactivation pathways but is still easily cleaved by nucleophiles. In addition, the process enables the direct C&#8722;H methylation, cyclopropanation, and arylation of tryptophan to yield unnatural amino acid (UAA) building blocks. As a testament to the versatility of this method, a solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS)&#8208;ready phosphinated tryptophan was incorporated into a pentapeptide and the C&#8722;H functionalization/dephosphination sequence was executed with ease. The utility of &#8220;on&#8208;peptide&#8221; editing was exhibited through the late&#8208;stage functionalization of several pentapeptides with a diverse set of C7 substituents on&#8208; and off&#8208;resin.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peripheral editing of complex molecules via C&#8722;H functionalization removes the pervasive retrosynthetic bias toward pre-functionalization and taps into the innate, often subtle, stereoelectronic differences between C&#8722;H linkages. Using this approach, bioactive molecules and residues can be modified without being beholden to lengthy sequences, thus allowing biochemical hypotheses to be interrogated on accelerated timelines. Herein, the C&#8722;H functionalization paradigm is leveraged to tackle C7&#8197;C&#8722;H functionalization of the biologically important tryptophan core. The devised process, which was expanded to indolyl (and related) systems, utilizes an &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-bound unsymmetrical &#8220;designer&#8221; phosphine to direct C&#8722;H functionalization to the desired position while maintaining operational ease of directing group installation/removal. Quantum mechanically calculated steric properties and activation free energies suggest that this phosphine is hindered enough for favoring C&#8722;H functionalization over deactivation pathways but is still easily cleaved by nucleophiles. In addition, the process enables the direct C&#8722;H methylation, cyclopropanation, and arylation of tryptophan to yield unnatural amino acid (UAA) building blocks. As a testament to the versatility of this method, a solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS)-ready phosphinated tryptophan was incorporated into a pentapeptide and the C&#8722;H functionalization/dephosphination sequence was executed with ease. The utility of &#8220;on-peptide&#8221; editing was exhibited through the late-stage functionalization of several pentapeptides with a diverse set of C7 substituents on- and off-resin.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The front cover picture illustrates the cooperative action of carboxylic acids in ruthenium&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H oxygenation. Dicarboxylic acids, such as maleic acid, dramatically increase the basicity and electrophilicity of metal(oxo) intermediates through intramolecular electrostatic interactions. The ruthenium catalyst system, which incorporates the cooperative action of carboxylic acids, has become a powerful C&#8722;H oxidation method that offers both reactivity and site&#8208;selectivity. It progresses with site&#8208; and chemo&#8208;selectivity in the C&#8722;H oxidation using hydrogen peroxide as a terminal oxidant, even in multifunctionalized complex natural products.

Abstract
Hydrohalogenation of alkynes is one of the fundamental reactions in organic chemistry, as described in textbooks that begins from old time as Reppe's chemistry. This method, which directly affords haloalkenes in a single step, is attractive from both industrial and academic viewpoints. Despite the long history of this reaction, novel efficient catalysts and regioselective and/or stereoselective controlled reactions are still a challenging topic. This review addresses the recent (past decade) advances in this field of organic chemistry.

         <title>Solvated Electrons: Dynamic Reductant in Visible Light Photoredox Catalysis</title>

Abstract
Open shell species are alluring significant attention owing to their unique physiochemical properties in redox chemistry for activating remarkably stable bonds. Solvated electrons are one of them that have been extensively investigated due to their high reduction potential (Ered=&#8722;2.9&#8197;V vs SHE in CH3CN), diverse substrate activation, and promising applications. If the activating species have a larger redox potential with a longer lifetime, then the broader range of substrates will be activated. Hence, the solvated electron qualifies as a super&#8208;reductant with these qualities. However, due to safety issues, generating solvated electrons by dissolving alkali metals in an ammoniated solvent limits its use towards complicated organic transformations. Instead photochemically generated solvated electron overcome this limitation and is identified as a user&#8208;friendly, sustainable, and much safer alternative approach for producing solvated electrons. In this minireview, we have comprehensively highlighted the recent key methods to generate the solvated electron photochemically, characterization techniques, and its application in organic transformations with selected examples. The minireview provides new opportunities for chemists to understand the conceptual, physical, and mechanistic chemistry principle of this super reductant for exploiting a new photochemical route for the transformations that are difficult to achieve by other means.

         <title>Oxidative Alkenylation of (Hetero)aromatics with Unactivated Alkenes: Control of the Reaction Selectivity</title>

Abstract
Alkenylbenzene skeletons represent one of the most widely occurring structural motifs in pharmaceutical drugs, natural products, and advanced materials. The construction of alkenylbenzenes is promising through the use of a straightforward oxidative alkenylation protocol, particularly from unactivated alkenes. This is significant because unactivated alkenes are inexpensive raw materials that can be obtained in bulk quantities from petrochemical feedstocks and renewable resources. However, controlling the reactivity and regioselectivity of olefination with unbiased olefins remains a significant challenge, necessitating continuous efforts and potentially having a substantial impact on both organic synthesis and the industry. This review aims to provide an overview of the latest advances in regiocontrol strategies for oxidative alkenylation reactions with unactivated alkenes, which can be categorized into three types: 1) ligand&#8208;promoted/accelerated reactions; 2) prefunctionalized olefins&#8208;facilitated reactions; 3) directing group&#8208;induced reactions.

Abstract
Herein, a new method has been developed for the synthesis of various &#945;&#8208;hydroxyacetophenones via an electro&#8208;oxidation process. It involves electrocatalytic hydroxylation via debromination of C(sp3)&#8722;Br bond. Here, simultaneous breaking of carbon&#8208;bromine (C&#8722;Br) bond and formation of a new carbon&#8208;oxygen (C&#8722;O) bond has been achieved through electrolysis of H2O using binary mixture of water and DMSO. The protocol features easy performance, oxidant and base&#8208;free mild conditions and short reaction time.

Abstract
The prospect of developing methods to control the reactivity of metal(oxo) holds appeal for both synthetic and bioinorganic chemistry. In this study, we observed that carboxylic acids enhance reactivity in C&#8722;H oxidation by forming hydrogen bonds with the oxo ligand, thereby increasing the basicity and electrophilicity of the oxo intermediate. Additionally, we discovered that H&#8208;dicarboxylate ligands, such as oxalate, malonate, and maleate, significantly improve the catalyst turnover frequency (up to 760/h) in unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H oxidation. Furthermore, the addition of maleic acid was also found to activate Fe and Mn(pdp)&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H oxygenation. Notably, Ru(bpga)(H&#8208;maleate)2 3&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization exhibited a broad functional group tolerance, including bromine, hydroxyl, benzoate, nitro, nitryl, sulfonate, imide, sulfonylamide, and carbamate, yielding up to 98% in a site&#8208; and chemoselective manner with only 0.1&#8211;2.0&#8197;mmol% loading.

         <title>An Electrochemically Driven Oxidative Strecker Reaction via the Unique Hydroxymethyl Radical Intermediate</title>

Abstract
Alfa&#8208;aminonitriles are versatile and valuable intermediates in pharmaceutical chemistry. Until now, the Strecker reaction has remained the most efficient tool for synthesizing these compounds. Nevertheless, it is only applicable to aldehyde/imine systems and generally needs metal catalysts and external additives. Herein, an electrochemically driven oxidative Strecker reaction strategy was designed and accomplished for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles with alcohol as the alkylation reagent. The strategy is environmentally friendly, scalable, and compatible with a wide range of functional groups, encompassing aromatic primary amines, secondary amines, and even alkylamine. Utilizing the merits of electro&#8208;organic synthesis, it can be readily magnified from milligram to gram scale by simply adjusting the electrochemical parameters. Emphasized, it testified that a unique intermediate CH2*OH well&#8208;established in fuel cells was involved in the reaction.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Succinimides Bearing All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Centers Using a Chiral Phenanthroline&#8208;Palladium Catalyst</title>

Abstract
The synthesis of chiral succinimides bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters at the C3 position is important, but remains challenging. The present work demonstrates conjugate additions with catalysis by a chiral 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;Pd complex (L1&#8208;PdCl2) that exhibit complete regioselectivity with a high degree of enantioselectivity. These reactions afford chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted succinimides having all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters with 40&#8211;99% ee. Importantly, chiral 3,3&#8208;diaryl succinimides could also be obtained in 35&#8211;98% yields and 40&#8211;99% ee. Moreover, the present L1&#8208;PdCl2&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition could be performed on the gram scale and was also used to introduce such stereocenters into bioactive molecules.

Abstract
A phosphine&#8208;mediated cyclization of benzo[c][1,2]dithiol&#8208;3&#8208;ones and amidines is demonstrated herein. Triphenylphosphine was harnessed as the activating reagent to facilitate the ring&#8208;opening of benzo[c][1,2]dithiol&#8208;3&#8208;ones via S&#8722;S bond cleavage. This PPh3&#8208;Promoted cyclization reaction of benzo[c][1,2]dithiol&#8208;3&#8208;ones enabled to forge a diverse array of 1,3&#8208;benzothiazones in decent yields with wide substrate scope under mild conditions.

Abstract
A base&#8208;and&#8208;additive&#8208;free photo&#8208;induced radical&#8208;mediated cascade cyclization reaction of 1,6&#8208;enyne compounds was presented. In this study, C(sp3)&#8722;H hydrocarbons, including various alkanes and ethers, were activated via Fe&#8208;catalyzed photo&#8208;induced conditions, providing a bunch of &#947;&#8208;lactam products via hydrogen atom transfer and radical addition processes. Control experiments indicated that the reaction proceeded through photo&#8208;induced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) process. Gram scale experiment was also completed by using continuous&#8208;flow&#8208;photocatalytic&#8208;device.

Abstract
A DBU&#8208;promoted [3+2] cyclization/retro&#8208;Mannich cascade reaction of N&#8208;aminoisoquinolinium and N&#8208;aminoquinolinium derivatives with para&#8208;quinone methides has been established, employing a C=C double bond cleavage. A broad range of N&#8208;aminoquinolinium salts, N&#8208;aminoisoquinolinium salts, and para&#8208;quinone methides are well tolerated, providing the corresponding rearrangement products. Moreover, scaled&#8208;up reactions and diverse derivatizations of the products were also investigated and discussed.

         <title>Electrochemical Site&#8208;Selective Alkylation of Tropones via Formal C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) Coupling Reaction</title>

Abstract
The first site&#8208;selective electrochemical alkylation of tropones is realized by reacting 2&#8208;acetoxytropones and redox&#8208;active&#8208;esters (RAEs). The electroreductive protocol enables the preparation of mono&#8208; and disubstituted tropones in high yields (up to 71%) under very mild conditions. Dedicated voltammetric measurements served for the identification of 2&#8208;acetoxytropones as a class of valuable trapping agents of nucleophilic radical species and shed light on the whole mechanistic profile. Wide tolerance towards functional groups (27 examples) and application to late&#8208;stage functionalization of a bioactive compound (i.&#8201;e. Colchicine analogue), emphasize the synthetic impact of the present methodology.

Abstract
A strategy for synthesis of azo&#8208;derived compounds by electrochemical oxidative ring&#8208;opening reactions of 2H&#8208;indazoles with alcohols is reported. The reactions are carried out under galvanostatic electrolysis conditions in an undivided cell without the use of transition metal catalysts. On the basis of cyclic voltammetry and control experiments, a plausible mechanism for this ring&#8208;opening reaction involving the radical pathway is proposed. Furthermore, various 2H&#8208;indazoles and alcohols are suitable in this system, giving the desired ortho&#8208;alkoxycarbonylated azobenzenes in 9&#8211;84% yields.

Abstract
Creating an expedient method for synthesizing biologically significant functionally rich octahydroquinoline is a highly sought&#8208;after yet challenging endeavour. In this report, we document an unprecedented approach to the construction of novel spirooctahydroquinoline oxindole architectures. The reaction proceeds through Pd (II) catalyzed cycloisomerisation and quinine catalyzed [4+2]&#8208;addition sequence to afford the desired adduct in moderate to excellent yield (up to 89%) in a single diastereomer with three contiguous stereocenters including one spirocenter. An overwhelming number of libraries were generated (35 examples) reflecting the synthetic versatility and functional groups/substituents tolerance. Further, the adduct is transformed into medicinally important fluoro&#8208;decahydroepoxyethanoquinoline spirooxindole scaffold with five contiguous stereocenters in excellent yield and selectivity (95% yield and &gt;99:1 dr) through a three steps sequence which signifies the synthetic utility of the developed methodology.

Abstract
We report here a formal insertion of a metal carbene complex in a single carbon&#8208;carbon bond. This behavior occurs with the participation of an &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene complex, generated from benzofused triazapentalenes or, in a one&#8208;pot procedure, from their 1&#8208;propargyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzotriazole precursors, and gold&#8208;catalytically activated ynamides. As the result, 3H&#8208;indole derivatives were obtained, with formation of a quaternary center. A computational analysis carried out on the reaction mechanism indicates that the bulkiness of the gold ligand plays a key role forcing a conformation, which includes aromatic interactions, that favors the approximation of the carbenic carbon to the reactive site. In addition, a negative crossover experiment rules out a cationic arene migration pathway.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;amino sulfones through visible light&#8208;induced oxidative decarboxylation and radical reductive addition is described. Various readily available N&#8208;protected natural amino acids react with aromatic/aliphatic vinyl sulfones to directly produce &#947;&#8208;amino sulfone derivatives. This reaction is also applicable to &#945;&#8208;N(O)&#8208;acids and other aliphatic carboxylic acids, resulting in the corresponding sulfone derivatives. The method operates without the need for sacrificial reducing agents or additional hydrogen atom donors. The sole by&#8208;product is CO2 released from decarboxylation, rendering the process both atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical.</dc:description>

         <title>C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8208;H Functionalization Using Chlorine Radicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Converting any desired C&#8208;H bond to the intended C&#8208;Z bond in a given organic molecule could be the final peak of the C&#8208;H functionalization methodology. Among the three types of C&#8208;H bonds, the functionalization of the ubiquitous C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8208;H bond has gained special attention, especially in the last two decades. There are different ways to transform a C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8208;H bonds to desired C&#8208;Z bonds and using chlorine radicals is one of them with a bright future. The literature review shows different sources have been used for chlorine including chloride anion (from HCl or salts), coordinated chlorine (from transition metal complex), and organic chlorides (from organochlorine compounds), although, HCl and FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; have gained the most attention among them. There are three major ways to convert chlorine from these sources to chlorine radicals: 1) the oxidation of hydrogen chloride or chloride salts, 2) the photolysis of metal chloride, and 3) the transition metal insertion into C&#8208;Cl bonds. This review aims to summarise published research papers about using chlorine radicals for C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8208;H bonds functionalization and do not participate in the products as the substitutions for hydrogens. Therefore, the chlorination reaction of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8208;H bonds and the reactions in which chlorine radicals do not play a direct role in C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8208;H bond breaking are not the subject of this review.</dc:description>

         <title>Endogenous group&#8208;directed late&#8208;stage C&#8208;H functionalization of peptides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptides are diverse in terms of their functional groups and side&#8208;chain functionalities, and late&#8208;stage C&#8208;H functionalization plays a crucial role in their design. Approaches for such synthesis require pre&#8208;installation and post&#8208;removal of the directing group (DG). In recent times, chemical methods have been developed, focusing on the external DG&#8208;free C&#8208;H functionalization of peptides. These approaches utilize the inherent native functionality of peptides as DG to simplify synthetic routes, reducing synthetic steps, waste generation, enhancing sustainability, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and operational flexibility. Such approaches facilitate late&#8208;stage C&#8208;H functionalization of both natural and unnatural amino acid&#8208;containing peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Benzyl Oxindoles via Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex Photoactivation Using Thianthrenium Salts and Potassium Carbonate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A photochemical synthesis of biologically relevant benzyl oxindoles is presented via electron&#8208;donor acceptor (EDA) complex strategy. This exogenous photocatalyst&#8208;free method describes the formation of a new electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex based on potassium carbonate and thianthrenium salts for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation. This transition&#8208;metal free reaction allows a rapid increase in oxindoles molecular complexity chemical space, tolerating different functional groups as well as sophisticated biomolecules. The scalability and sustainability of this method is highlighted by an important waste recovery protocol. Mechanistic investigations support the formation of an EDA complex that induces a radical chain, and the applicability of this method is showcased by straightforward derivatization reactions.

Abstract
This study reports the copper&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;indolmethylation of 2&#8208;pyridylacetates with 3&#8208;indoleacetic acids. This reaction offers an approach to generating alkylideneindolenine electrophiles via the oxidative decarboxylation of 3&#8208;indoleacetic acids. The developed reaction system demonstrates good versatility, extending beyond the indolmethylation of 2&#8208;pyridylacetates to include activated esters and nitroalkanes. Moreover, a biological evaluation revealed that several products exhibited antiproliferative activity against different cancer cell lines.

Abstract
A Mn&#8208;electrocatalytic ring&#8208;opening azidation of tert&#8208;cyclobutanols has been developed. The regioselective method is applicable for the azidation of a diverse array of cyclobutanols to provide practical &#947;&#8208;azido ketones in 23&#8211;91% yields under chemical oxidants&#8208;free reaction conditions. Detailed mechanistic studies suggest the process of Mn&#8208;mediated alkoxy radical generation followed by &#946;&#8208;scission to form carbon&#8208;centered radical species is possibly involved in this transformation.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalysed C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation and Hydrogen Isotope Exchange via Nitrogen&#8208;Based Carbonyl Directing Groups</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Growing interest in improved structural diversity within the pharmaceutical industry has led to a focus on more sp3&#8208;rich drug frameworks. Meanwhile, spiralling pharmaceutical research and development costs continue to require expedited adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity studies, which are heavily reliant on the use of molecules incorporating deuterium and tritium. Herein, we report an iridium catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H activation and hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) methodology capable of utilizing pharmaceutically ubiquitous nitrogen&#8208;based carbonyl directing groups. High levels of deuterium incorporation (&gt;80% in 37 of the examples) are demonstrated across a range of substrates (5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;membered lactams, cyclic carbamates and ureas, acyclic amides), with tolerance of a range of common functional groups (aryl, alkoxy, halogen, ester, alcohol, sulfonamide) and predictable regioselectivity. The applicability of this methodology was demonstrated with up to 98% deuterium incorporation observed in a range of challenging bioactive molecules such as Nefiracetam, Praziquantel, and Unifiram. Density functional theory has provided mechanistic insight into the C&#8722;H activation and HIE at both the expected site of incorporation and an unexpected aryl labelling via a 7&#8208;membered metallocyclic intermediate.

Abstract
A method for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuro[3,2&#8208;c]quinolines via TfOH or TMSOTf mediated condensation of 2&#8208;aminoaryl cyclopropyl ketones with aldehydes has been developed. The reaction proceeds under transition metal or halogen free conditions, giving access to the target molecules in 27&#8211;90% isolated yields. Mechanistic study indicates that the reaction sequence involves imine formation, intramolecular Mannich condensation, Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement, and auto&#8208;oxidation.

         <title>Enantioselective Si&#8722;H Insertion of Arylvinyldiazoesters Promoted by Rhodium(I)/Diene Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An enantioselective Si&#8722;H insertion between &#945;&#8208;arylvinyldiazoesters and silanes has been developed by employing rhodium(I)/chiral diene complex as the catalyst. This protocol offers a catalytic asymmetric approach to various chiral silanes containing &#945;&#8208;arylvinyl functionality at room temperature with good enantiocontrol (89&#8211;99% ee). Transformation of the resulting enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;arylvinyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silyl esters led to a variety of other valuable building blocks. The deuterium kinetic isotope effect experiments revealed a rhodium(I)&#8208;mediated concerted Si&#8722;H insertion mechanism.

         <title>Stereoselective Access to &#946;&#8208;gem&#8208;Difluorinated Alcohols Through Enzymatic Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We report here a mild process to access diversely functionalized enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluorinated (S)&#8208;alcohols by using biocatalytic reduction in &gt;99% yield and enantiomeric excesses ranging from 96% to &gt;99%. This novel approach involves enzymatic reduction of &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluorinated heterocyclic and carbocyclic ketone derivatives as well as an acyclic gem&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;ketosulfone and proceeds under mild conditions at 30&#8201;&#176;C under aqueous conditions to produce a range of high added value enantioenriched difluorinated alcohols including 3,3&#8208;difluorochromanol, 3,3&#8208;difluorothiochromanol, 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;dihydroquinolinol, and &#945;&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfone derivatives. A comparative study between enzymatic reduction and metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation was carried out as well.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed two&#8208;fold annulation reaction of 2,6&#8208;dihalogenobiphenyls with o&#8208;chloroaromatic carboxylic acids has been developed. This method enables the synthesis of various dibenzo[fg,op]tetracenes and azadibenzo[fg,op]tetracenes. Preliminary investigations indicate that the resulting product, dimethyl 5,6,12,13&#8208;tetrakis(hexyloxy)dibenzo[fg,op]tetracene&#8208;2,9&#8208;dicarboxylate, demonstrates favorable liquid&#8208;crystalline properties.

Abstract
Hydrocarboxylation of methyl 2&#8208;octynoate, a chemical commercially available at a low cost, with N&#8208;protected amino acids was developed with a gold&#8208;zinc cooperative catalyst constructed with a 5&#8208;[(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridin)&#8208;5&#8208;yl]imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene to prepare &#945;&#8208;methoxycarbonyl enol esters as acylating reagents. The &#945;&#8208;methoxycarbonyl enol esters were isolable through silica&#8208;gel column chromatography and storable without precautions regarding moisture. Acylation of free amines with the &#945;&#8208;methoxycarbonyl enol esters proceeded without epimerization of the stereogenic center derived from the enol esters, affording analytically pure dipeptide compounds through filtration and hexane&#8208;washing.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An intermolecular annulation reaction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;indandions with alkynes was reported using Pd(OAc)2 to access spirobi[indene]&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones. Under palladium catalysis, the substrates form a homocoupling dimer intermediate through a catalytic dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling process. The palladium(II) species could come from dimer or 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;indandion. Notably, this pathway is not typically observed in enol&#8208;directed formal sp3 C&#8208;H functionalization/oxidative annulation palladium chemistry.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Aerobic Dearomatization of Naphthylamines under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dearomatization of aromatic substrates via photocatalytic methodologies has gained escalating prominence to access molecular complexity. Although much focus has been put on non&#8208;active arenes, naphthols and N&#8208;based heteroaromatics, arylamines have so far remained in the background. Herein, we report a photocatalytic strategy for the aerobic, dearomative hydroxylation of naphthylamines under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Our investigation highlights singlet oxygen generation as a viable mechanism for aromaticity disruption, mitigating selectivity issues deriving from the direct oxidation of targeted arylamines. Finally, we showcased the synthetic value of the obtained dearomatized products in a late&#8208;stage diversification campaign.</dc:description>

Abstract
An iodine/DMSO&#8208;promoted approach has been developed for the synthesis of indoloquinolines via a sequential sp3 C&#8722;H oxidation/intramolecular cyclization using 2&#8208;(1H&#8208;indol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)anilines and aryl methyl ketones. A wide range of aryl methyl ketones, including drugs and complex bioactive molecule&#8208;derived substrates were compatible in the present reaction with yields in the range of 30&#8211;96%. This protocol proceeds through sp3 C&#8722;H oxidation of aryl methyl ketones to phenylglyoxals, subsequent imine formation, and cyclization to furnish the indoloquinolines. Further, the reaction is applicable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis and is operationally simple.

         <dc:description>It is extremely rare for reactive intermediates to possess a ground state triplet character. Excited state triplet intermediates are generally accessed by means of photon transfer from a tunable light source or by using any triplet sensitizers. N&#8208;acyl N&#8208;alkoxy nitreniums are an important class of reactive intermediates in the synthetic organic community due to their prolonged lifetime and ground&#8208;state singlet character. Herein, we report an external oxidant and toxic catalyst&#8208;free mild electrochemical protocol to access nitrenium reactive intermediate. Experimental findings of the mechanistic pathway suggested a theoretically predicted triplet reactive intermediate that is energetically favorable to the singlet pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Regio&#8208; and Enantiocomplementary Synthesis of Chiral Aryloxazolidinones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
We described the protein engineering of the halohydrin dehalogenase HheG to enhance its R enantioselectivity for the synthesis of chiral 4&#8208;aryloxazolidinones via &#945;&#8208;regioselective ring&#8208;opening of aryl epoxides with cyanate. Additionally, we achieved the inversion of its regioselectivity and enantioselectivity, resulting in a HheG variant tailored for the synthesis of chiral 5&#8208;aryloxazolidinones via &#946;&#8208;regioselective and S&#8208;enantioselective ring&#8208;opening of aryl epoxides with cyanate. Leveraging these engineered mutants, we developed a biocatalytic platform capable of synthesis of both chiral 4&#8208;aryloxazolidinones (up to 47% yield, 98% ee, and 99% regioselectivity) and chiral 5&#8208;aryloxazolidinones (up to 46% yield, &gt;99% ee, and 98% regioselectivity). Furthermore, a collaborative approach utilizing two regio&#8208; and enantioselective HheG mutants has been demonstrated to enable the simultaneous synthesis of chiral 4&#8208;aryloxazolidinones and chiral 5&#8208;aryloxazolidinones.

         <title>Organocatalyzed, Three&#8208;Component Construction of Cyanopyrazoles Using Diazoacetonitrile</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An organocatalyzed three&#8208;component protocol using diazoacetonitrile to access a wide range of cyanopyrazole derivatives is reported here. This strategy, which proceeds through a piperidine&#8208;catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation/formal [3+2] cycloaddition/dehydrocyanation sequence, provides an efficient route to construct dicyanopyrazoles from aldehydes, malononitrile, and diazoacetonitrile regioselectively. Interestingly, by engaging cyanoacetate and cyanoacetamide in this protocol, we could achieve cyanopyrazole esters and carboxamides.

         <dc:description>The cascade reaction of ynamides with propargyl thiols by Au(I) catalysis involving regioselective hydrothiolation, thio&#8208;Claisen rearrangement, and cycloisomerization to generate 2&#8208;aminothiophenes in a one&#8208;pot manner is described. In this reaction, the selection of reaction temperature is crucial, with the initial step, namely hydrothiolation, conducted at a low temperature (40&#176;C), followed by the subsequent reaction requiring an increase in temperature (&gt;110&#176;C). Furthermore, it was revealed that multi&#8208;substituted anilines could be synthesized efficiently from the resulting 2&#8208;aminothiophenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing SuFExable Cyclobutane&#8208;Fused Indolines via Photocatalytic Intermolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition of Indoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indoline&#8208;fused polycycles are commonly found as a key structural component in numerous natural products and biologically active compounds. In recent times, the incorporation of sulfonyl fluoride groups has drawn significant attention in research due to their potential to enhance or confer new biological activities to molecules. In this study, we report the development of a novel and modular approach for synthesizing FSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;functionalized cyclobutane&#8208;fused indolines by employing an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between indoles and SuFExable ethenesulfonyl fluoride under triplet energy&#8208;transfer catalysis. This method features mild reaction conditions, metal&#8208;free photocatalysts, and excellent tolerance to various functional groups. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of further modifying the FSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;functionalized indoline products via SuFEx click reactions, enabling their conjugation with other molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible light induced halogen bond assisted Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction of indole and chalcones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. The use of halogen bonding interactions as an alternative to acid and metal catalysts for substrate activation has gained popularity in recent years. In this work we demonstrate a halogen bond assisted activation of chalcones under visible light irradiation for the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction with indole to yield &#946;&#8208;indolylketones. The simple and scalable protocol uses the readily available CBr4 as halogen bond catalyst. The targets are produced in 31&#8208;94% of yield with excellent functional group tolerance. The proposed mechanism of the reaction is supported by UV&#8208;vis, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopic studies. Further it is demonstrated that the &#946;&#8208;indolylketones can be oxidised to indole substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones by DDQ or cyclized to thieno[2,3&#8208;b]indoles in the presence of elemental sulfur and base.</dc:description>

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Markovnikov Hydroarylation of Arylcyclobutene: A Route to gem&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;Substituted Cyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A regioselective Markovnikov hydroarylation of arylcyclobutene has been developed using Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis through a protonation/Friedel&#8208;Crafts sequence. The metal&#8208;free catalytic reaction is operationally simple and feasible compared to previous reports that utilized elaborate arylcyclobutene and specific polyfluorinated reagents, affording a variety of gem&#8208;diaryl&#8208; substituted arylcyclobutene in good to excellent yields. The possible mechanism of the reaction has been explored through step&#8208;by&#8208;step control experiments. This protocol involving indole in gem&#8208;diaryl&#8208;substituted cyclobutene scaffolds not only enriches the applications of Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed hydroarylation, but also paves the way for a more extensive access to potential bioactive cyclobutanes structures.</dc:description>

Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed conditions for diazidation or acetoxy/hydroxylation of N&#8208;allyl sulfonamides by using Pd(OAc)2 as the catalyst combined with Mn(OAc)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O have been developed. The 1,2&#8208;diazidation reaction of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond occurs in mild conditions (i.&#8201;e. NaN3 as azide source in THF at room temperature), whereas the 1,2&#8208;acetoxy/hydroxylation requires an excess of Mn(OAc)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O. The well&#8208;known ability of this reagent to act through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) makes plausible a radical mechanism involving high valent palladium complexes.

Abstract
Complexes of borane with six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes derived from readily accessible 1,3,5&#8208;triazinium salts are described. Similar to the widely used imidazolium&#8208;type borane complex, the obtained complexes behave as agents for the hydrogen atom transfer in the Giese reaction and as sources of the boryl radicals in addition to imines. The amine nitrogen of these complexes does not undergo alkylation, but it can bind with another borane molecule.

         <title>Synthesis of Alkynylsilanes: A Review of the State of the Art</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
This contribution offers a comprehensive overview of methods for forging sp C&#8722;Si bonds. Over time, alkynylsilanes (silylacetylenes), once considered mere byproducts of hydrosilylation processes, have become essential building blocks in organic synthesis. This literature review traces the evolution of their synthesis, from traditional methodologies relying on organolithium and organomagnesium compounds to more advanced cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving hydro&#8208; and carbosilanes. Focused primarily on the past 25&#8197;years (2000&#8211;2024), it also extensively references significant historical breakthroughs. By analyzing synthetic methodologies, the review not only offers a comprehensive survey of the current state of knowledge but also identifies areas for improvement. Furthermore, to emphasize the importance of 1&#8208;alkynylsilanes (1&#8208;silyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkynes), selected applications of these compounds are highlighted, confirming their significant potential in organic synthesis.

Abstract
Inexpensive cobalt&#8208;catalyzed, pivalic acid&#8208;assisted oxidative C&#8722;H functionalization of benzimidates or NH&#8208;benzaldimines with ynamides is presented, providing an access to 3&#8208;aminoisoquinoline derivatives. The procedure is compatible with various substrates featuring alkyl, alkoxy, acyl or halogen as substituents, heteroaryl structures, and diverse ynamides. The reaction has been scaled up, with subsequent transformation of the yielded products. Control experiments and mechanistic investigations corroborate the regioselectivity of this conversion, positioning the amine group proximal to the nitrogen atom in isoquinolines.

Abstract
We have developed an approach for the construction of naphthofuran&#8208;2&#8208;carboxaldehyde derivatives utilizing the synergy of electrochemical oxidation and organo&#8208;selenium catalysis at room temperature. The compatibility of various functional groups and scalability of this protocol demonstrate the practicality of the electrochemical strategy. The synthetic utility of this strategy is furthermore demonstrated by synthesizing diversified molecules through downstream transformations.

Abstract
n&#8208;Bu4NI/K2S2O8 mediated transformylation from p&#8208;anisaldehyde to primary amides is reported. The mechanistic studies suggest the reaction occurs via a single electron transfer pathway. Based on the DFT electronic structure calculations of various reaction pathways, the most plausible mechanism involves the formation of a phenyl radical cation and an arenium ion as the key intermediates. It represents the first example where p&#8208;anisaldehyde is employed as a formyl source via a non&#8208;metal mediated Csp2&#8722;Csp2 bond cleavage.

Abstract
Two N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin&#8208;phosphines (NHOP), and the corresponding ruthenium complexes were synthesized and structurally characterized. One of the cationic complexes [(BzIM)(NHOP)Ru(p&#8208;cymene)Cl2]I was employed as a catalyst in N&#8208;benzylbenzamides/alkyne coupling reactions. With this catalytic protocol a variety of substituted isoquinolones were synthesized through ortho&#8208;selective double C&#8722;H bond functionalization involving oxidative annulation followed by olefination reactions. All these products were achieved in one&#8208;pot manner without the use of additives.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Formation of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes Using Oxime Esters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
In this manuscript a general photocatalytic approach for the synthesis of alkyl&#8208;substituted gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes using readily available oxime esters and 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoroprop&#8208;2&#8208;ene (BDFP) has been established. This strategy involving a radical bromo elimination provides access to a large variety of value&#8208;added fluorinated molecules. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with many functional groups including complex natural products or drug molecules. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic investigations indicate that the efficiency of the process relies on the crucial role of imine radical, which is formed after photoexcitation via energy transfert (EnT) and decarboxylation of the oxime ester. Indeed, the imine radical would either behave as a bromine radical scavenger or an XAT promoter in this reaction.

         <title>Insights into the Enantioselective Au(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions between 2&#8208;Alkynyl Ketones and Naphthols using the TCDC Approach</title>

Abstract
The CPAPhosAuCl bifunctional complexes catalyse the enantioselective tandem cycloisomerization&#8208;nucleophilic addition reactions between 2&#8208;alkynylenones and naphthols, where naphthols behave mainly as O&#8208;nucleophiles. The inherent acidity of the catalysts induces then the isomerization of the O&#8208;addition&#8208; into the C&#8208;addition products with concomitant decrease of their enantiomeric excesses. In depth mechanistic studies have provided insights into these processes. Subsequently, the undesired racemization pathways could be suppressed by using substituted naphthols as nucleophiles, which delivered a large series of chiral bicyclic furanes in high enantioselectivities.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Promoted Domino Processes for the Synthesis of Homoallylic Amines, Quinolines and Tetrahydroquinolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, the synthesis of homoallylic amines, quinolines, and tetrahydroquinolines has been demonstrated. The domino one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component approach has been accomplished using Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed conditions. A useful scaffold construction strategy can be achieved by controlling the electronic effect of aniline rather than relying on reaction conditions. The described method applies to a wide variety of substrates embedded with diverse functional groups and can be extended toward the synthesis of natural products. Suitable control experiments, real&#8208;time NMR studies, and DFT calculations have validated the reported process. The protocol outlines a strategy for synthesizing homoallylic amines and quinolines, controlled by the electronic properties of anilines.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Peptidols via Reductive Cleavage Through a Benzotriazole Linker</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Peptidols were prepared through the reductive cleavage of benzotriazole intermediates obtained from the on&#8208;bead activation of 3,4&#8208;diaminobenzoyl linkers. Remarkably, this method used commercially available amino acid residues and resins without further modification. Pure peptidols were collected with only filtration in 49%&#8211;87% yield. Only the derivatives with aspartic acid as the first C&#8208;terminal residue required sophisticated chromatography purification. Esters and carboxylic acids were identified as side products and were suppressed by additional reduction or reduction in DMF. Remarkably, the reduction of peptides with the first aspartic acid residue at the C&#8208;terminal afforded a C&#8208;terminal lactone, which could be reduced by deprotection at 0&#8201;&#176;C. For the synthesis of branched peptidols, the bulky wedge structures of the branched peptides resulted in low total yields, which were improved to 23%&#8211;28% by using peripheral Boc groups and SPPS on the Tental gel resin. In addition, this method gave two peptaibols, SPF&#8208;5506&#8208;A4 and Ac&#8208;Gramicidin A, in 11% and 46% yields, respectively.

         <title>TBHP&#8208;Mediated Hydroxyperfluoroalkylation of Alkenes with Perfluoroalkyl Iodides to Construct &#946;&#8208;Perfluoroalkyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A three&#8208;component strategy for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl allyl alcohols from 1,3&#8208;dienes is developed. A diverse range of synthetically valuable &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl allyl alcohols are obtained in moderate to high yields. Broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance are observed. This method is also applicable to mono&#8208;olefins and 1,3&#8208;enynes. The control experiment results demonstrate that the hydroxyl group OH in the product comes from TBHP. In addition, the practicality and mild reaction conditions make these synthetic transformations attractive and valuable for organic synthesis.

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of Chiral Heterocycles via Asymmetric Carbon&#8208;Heteroatom Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral heterocyclic compounds play a crucial role in the pharmaceutical science, materials science, and agrochemical industries. The critical step for synthesizing chiral heterocycles is the formation of asymmetric carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds, which can be achieved in a chiral environment under thermal or photochemical conditions. However, photochemical asymmetric transformation has become an area of immense growth in the past 15 years. In the drug discovery and development era, chiral photochemical transformations have drawn the attention of researchers to develop new synthetic strategies for chiral heterocycles via asymmetric carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond formation. Chiral photochemistry in the pathway of asymmetric synthesis requires a chirality source which is transferred to the products. A catalytic chiral metal complexing agent or a chiral photosensitizer that generally follows a single electron transfer (SET) or oxidative and reductive quenching cycle has been widely exploited to achieve this goal. In this review, we have demonstrated the recent development of photochemical synthesis of chiral heterocycles via asymmetric carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond formation by using a chiral metal catalyst, asymmetric organocatalyst, or dual catalytic system based on their plausible mechanism.</dc:description>

Abstract
Under the catalysis of Rh2(OAc)4 (10&#8197;mol%) and (&#177;)&#8208;Me&#8208;Pybox (20&#8197;mol%) in 1,2&#8208;DCE at 80&#8201;&#176;C, the homocoupling/[4+1] cycloaddition cascade of diazobarbiturates with diazopyrazolones proceeded readily and provided spirobarbiturates in 32&#8211;88% chemical yields. The chemical structure of the obtained spirobarbiturates was identified by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <title>Recent Advances in Radical Transformations of Propargylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Propargylic alcohols are regarded as a class of readily available and versatile synthons in organic synthesis. Due to their unique bifunctional character, the transformation of propargylic alcohols has been widely utilized as a powerful strategy for the construction of various functionalized frameworks over the past few decades. Recently, the radical transformation of propargylic alcohols has attracted considerable attention in synthetic chemistry. This review summarizes recent progress in the radical transformation of propargylic alcohols. Based on the different mechanisms of radical formation underlying these transformations, this review has been divided into four parts: (1) transition&#8208;metal catalyzed radical transformation; (2) photo&#8208;induced radical transformation; (3) electro&#8208;induced radical transformation; and (4) metal&#8208;free or oxidant&#8208;mediated radical transformation of propargylic alcohols.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A formal atom transfer radical [3+2] annulation (ATRAn) reaction between different homoallyl radical precursors and 1,1&#8208;diborylethene was developed. It provides a rapid access to polysubstituted cyclopentanes containing a gem&#8208;diboronic ester moiety. The synthetic utility of theses uniquely functionalized 5&#8208;membered rings is highlighted by their easy conversion to attractive borylated building blocks such as 1&#8208;borylated bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes. The ATRAn reaction was extended to homopropagylic radicals giving access to unique allylic gem&#8208;diboronic esters that could be used in allylboration of aldehydes. Furthermore, this work highlights that 1,1&#8208;diborylethene represents a synthetic equivalent to ketene, a so far elusive radical trap due to its daunting reactivity.</dc:description>

The front cover picture, made by painter Monika Tomanov&#225; and reproduced with permission, illustrates that nitrobenzenesulfonamides prepared from 2&#8208;aminobenzyl cyanide and alkylated with various agents can be converted to N&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;nitroarylindoles. The reaction proceeds via base&#8208;catalyzed Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement leading to metal&#8208;free intramolecular C&#947;&#8208;arylation followed by spontaneous cyclization. The process is as simple as developing a black and white photo in a darkroom chamber. Details can be found in Research Article by Miroslav Soural and co&#8208;workers (K. Zakova, P. Kralova, M.

Abstract
A scalable procedure for the synthesis of 4,6&#8208;difluorotryptophan is reported based on a deaminative coupling of a 4,6&#8208;difluorogramine with 2&#8208;benzylthio&#8208;1,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;imidazolone as glycine equivalent. Thus prepared 4,6&#8208;difluorotryptophan was incorporated into the C&#8208;terminal domain of the HIV&#8208;1 capsid protein (CA&#8208;CTD), and 19F spectra of the 4,6&#8208;difluoro Trp CA CTD were recorded and compared to the singly fluorinated counterparts.

Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed difunctionalization of olefins has attracted considerable attention as a method to construct carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;hetero bonds. Herein, the copper&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component radical cross&#8208;coupling of oxime esters, styrenes and AgSCF3 through a visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted iminyl radical&#8208;mediated carbon&#8208;carbon bond cleavage strategy has been described. Utilizing low&#8208;cost copper salt as both photosensitizers and cross&#8208;couplers, this protocol delivers diverse target products, providing a supplementary approach for cyanoalkylation and trifluoromethylthiolation of drug molecules.

Abstract
We report herein a palladium&#8208;catalyzed, site&#8208;selective cyclative annulation of o&#8208;alkynyl arylamides with maleimide for the stereoselective construction of succinimide&#8208;fused benzoxazine derivatives. This operationally simple and modular protocol provides access to polycyclic frameworks. The other associated features are high functional group compatibility, gram&#8208;scale synthetic potential, and downstream transformations. Control and labeling experiments were conducted to get insights into the mechanism.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;arylindoles and their Fused Analogues via Intramolecular C&#8208;Arylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
2&#8208;Aminobenzyl cyanide was reacted with nitrobenzenesulfonyl chlorides and alkylated under Mitsunobu or Fukuyama conditions. The resulting intermediates were exposed to basic conditions, which triggered a Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement, leading to intramolecular C&#8208;arylation. This reaction was followed by spontaneous cycloaddition, which yielded 2&#8208;aminoindole derivatives. The developed synthetic route represents a metal&#8208;free approach for accessing 1&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;arylindoles. Furthermore, pyrimido[1,2&#8208;a]indoles and 7,8dihydrobenzo[6,7][1,3]diazepino[4,5&#8208;b]indoles were synthesized through the use of functionalized alcohols.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Arylations of Ketimines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Arylation of ketimines is the most straightforward strategy for constructing chiral &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines, important structural motifs found in natural products and biologically active compounds. This comprehensive review highlights the achievements in the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed and organocatalyzed asymmetric arylations of ketimines from the seminal report published in 2010 till November 2023. The review is divided into three chapters: (1) Arylation of diaryl ketimines, (2) Arylation of aryl&#8208;alkyl and aryl&#8208;acyl ketimines, and (3) Arylation of acyl&#8208;alkyl and dialkyl ketimines. Each chapter is further divided into transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions (grouped by individual metals) and organocatalyzed reactions. The covered literature includes emphasis on the advantages of the reported methodology, its scope and limitations, and the description of the transition state (where applicable).

Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric dearomative arylation of 2&#8208;naphthols enabled by the unconventional reactivity of o&#8208;quinone diimides, i.&#8201;e. the 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition on quinone sp2 hybridized carbon, has been established. Under the catalysis of chiral phosphoric acid, various cyclohexaenones bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter have been prepared with excellent yields and enantioselectivities.

Abstract
The direct diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective Ru(II)&#8208; catalyzed cyclopropanation reaction of alkenes with ((2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoroethyl)sulfinyl)benzene was described. The desired enantioenriched PhSO2CF2&#8208;cyclopropanes were obtained in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities in the presence of a chiral ruthenium complex Ru(II)&#8208;Pheox (17&#8211;94% yields, &gt;20:1 d.r. and 83:17&#8211;98:2 e.r.). The robustness of the approach was showcased and This methodology gave access to chiral 1,2&#8208;trans difluoro&#8208;methylcyclopropanes.

         <title>Tetrafluoropyridinyl Thiolate as a Tool for Enabling Photoredox Alkylation of 1,2,4&#8208;Oxadiazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A method for the radical functionalization of 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazoles using alkyl halides as precursors of radicals is described. The reaction efficiency is determined by potassium tetrafluoropyridinyl thiolate additive, which plays dual role. First, the thiolate converts alkyl halides into more reactive fluorinated aryl sulfides, which undergo photoredox activation of the C&#8722;S bond. Second, the thiolate decreases the unproductive loss of alkyl radicals by converting them back to the sulfides.

         <title>Electrochemical Trifluoromethylalkoxylation of Endocyclic Enamides in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A regioselective electrochemical oxytrifluoromethylation of endocyclic enamides is reported. The 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization proceeds under mild conditions and employs the inexpensive bench stable Langlois&#8217; reagent. This multicomponent strategy gives access to a wide range of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;substituted amines by means of various alcohols as nucleophiles in high yields and with good functional group tolerance. In addition, an electrochemically induced C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of enamides has been developed. A continuous flow protocol using a commercial microflow electrochemical reactor was also developed with improved reaction performance and efficiency over traditional batch versions without any supporting electrolyte.

         <title>Development of Cyanopyridazine Derivatives as Photoredox Catalysts and Evaluation of their Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An array of cyanopyridazine derivatives have been developed through a sequence of (3+3) cycloaddition/oxidative aromatization/derivatization steps. Investigation of the physicochemical properties of these compounds shows that four have interesting fluorescence properties and have the potential to be developed into bimodal photoredox catalysts. One has been confirmed to be an photoredox catalyst in the reactions of N&#8208;aryl&#8208; tetrahydroisoquinolines with phosphite, nitromethane, malonitrile and sodium thiocyanate, led to 22%&#8211;95% yields. The catalyst capabilities remain with recyclable using under the reaction conditions.
