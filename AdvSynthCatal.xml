         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Arylacetaldehydes from Aryl aldehydes or Diaryl ketones via One&#8208;Carbon Extension by Using the System of DMSO/KOH/Zinc</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. A one&#8208;step protocol is described for the synthesis of arylacetaldehydes from aryl aldehydes or diaryl ketones in the system of DMSO/KOH/zinc. In this transformation, DMSO provides a methine fragment that converts the &#8208;CHO structure in aryl aldehydes or the &#8208;CO&#8208; structure in diaryl ketones to the &#8208;CH2CHO structure in arylacetaldehydes via one&#8208;carbon extension. This protocol could also be used to synthesize arylacetaldehyde acetals from aryl aldehydes or diaryl ketones when zinc was replaced by diols.	In this protocol, 25 examples of arylacetaldehydes and 26 examples of arylacetaldehyde acetals have been synthesized from aryl aldehydes or diaryl ketones. Based on control experiments and literature, a plausible reaction mechanism is proposed in our work.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Abstract. A one-step protocol is described for the synthesis of arylacetaldehydes from aryl aldehydes or diaryl ketones in the system of DMSO/KOH/zinc. In this transformation, DMSO provides a methine fragment that converts the -CHO structure in aryl aldehydes or the -CO- structure in diaryl ketones to the -CH2CHO structure in arylacetaldehydes via one-carbon extension. This protocol could also be used to synthesize arylacetaldehyde acetals from aryl aldehydes or diaryl ketones when zinc was replaced by diols.	In this protocol, 25 examples of arylacetaldehydes and 26 examples of arylacetaldehyde acetals have been synthesized from aryl aldehydes or diaryl ketones.

         <title>Dual Photoredox and Nickel Catalysed Reductive Coupling of Alkynes and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A regioselective vinylation of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes promoted by the merging of photoredox and nickel catalysis is here reported. A comprehensive investigation on the reaction conditions allowed the disclosure of a valid and reproducible protocol based on a nickel&#8208;mediated reductive coupling approach under visible light irradiation. The employment of 3CzClIPN (2,4,6&#8208;tris(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;5&#8208;chloro&#8208;isophthalonitrile) as the photocatalyst and Hantzsch's ester as the sacrificial organic reductant replace the use of boron&#8208;, silicon&#8208; or zinc&#8208;based reducing agents, making this method a worthy alternative to the already known protocols. The developed mild reaction conditions allow the access to a wide range of substituents decorating both the aldehyde and the alkyne. Moreover, careful photophysical investigations shed light on the mechanism of the reaction.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Total Synthesis of Aspidosperma and Kopsia Alkaloids Using Tetracyclic Pyridocarbazoles as Versatile Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Over the past decades, aspidosperma and kopsia alkaloids have attracted significant interest by the organic synthetic community owing to their intricate fused&#8208;ring structures and broad biological activities. Consequently, numerous strategically distinct total syntheses have been accomplished, among which tetracyclic pyridocarbazoles have seen widespread adoption as versatile building blocks. In this review, we elaborate and discuss the synthesis of such tetracyclic pyridocarbazoles according to the different approaches for the establishment of the all&#8208;carbon quaternary center at C5. This includes (1) classic synthetic reactions (cycloaddition, Michael addition, nucleophilic substitution, and Claisen rearrangement), (2) palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric decarboxylative allylation reactions, and (3) thiourea&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Michael addition reactions. Furthermore, we also describe the late&#8208;stage key transformations in the realm of the total syntheses of aspidosperma and kopsia alkaloids.

         <title>Electrochemical [3+2] Cycloaddition of Anilines and 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds: Construction of Multisubstituted Indoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Indoles, especially multisubstituted ones, are privileged scaffolds found widely in natural products, bioactive molecules, fine chemicals, and organic functional materials. Although several intramolecular electrochemical cyclization reactions of vinyl anilines to construct indoles have been reported in recent years, the intermolecular process between simple anilines and other readily available synthons, even though dominant, remains relatively unexplored. Herein, we report the intermolecular electro&#8208;oxidative cycloaddition of anilines and commercially available 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. This method provides an alternative route for the synthesis of a broad range of multisubstituted indoles without a transition&#8208;metal catalyst or external chemical oxidant.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidation&#8208;Induced Oxyphosphorylation of Alkenes and Alkynes with Water via Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A metal&#8208; and exogenous&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free oxidation&#8208;induced oxyphosphorylation of alkenes and alkynes with water for &#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates has been developed through the radical coupling under electrochemical conditions. This protocol is compatible with a wide range of alkenes, alkynes, and diarylphosphorus derivatives, and enables the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of &#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates. The mechanistic study revealed that the P radicals were generated via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) event jointly mediated by tetrabutylammonium acetate and anode oxidation process.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Domino Cyclization/Direct Aminosulfonylation Between Aryl Iodides and Amines via the Insertion of Sulfur Dioxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed domino cyclization/direct aminosulfonylation of aryl iodides with amines via the insertion of SO2 (from SOgen) was presented. This method could produce a series of oxindole&#8208;based sulfonamides in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields. A scale&#8208;up reaction and two synthetic applications demonstrated the robustness and practicality of this transformation.

         <title>Cu(I) Mediated Azidation of Halobenzenes, and Cu Catalysed Selective Azide Reduction to Corresponding Amines</title>

Abstract
Aryl amines are synthesized from halobenzenes via copper mediated reactions employing sodium azide under mild conditions in ethanol/water. The reaction proceeds stepwise via the aryl azide, which is reduced to the corresponding amine in&#8208;situ. The methodology allows syntheses of amines from corresponding para&#8208;, meta&#8208; and ortho&#8208;bromobenzenes bearing electron withdrawing groups. Bifunctional halobenzenes bearing alkanoyl chains with terminal bromides are selectively transformed, generating an aniline and an aliphatic azide, as this azide position is stable to reduction. A one&#8208;pot multistep sequence for preparation of the target amines was designed. The azide formation is mediated by CuI while elemental Cu is generated simultaneously, which is deposited onto the employed PTFE stirring bar used in the reaction. The Cu films were quantified and analysed by SEM/EDS. The Cu, either deposited or in solution, is responsible for the azide reduction, possibly involving nitrene intermediates. An application of the modified stirring bars as a heterogeneous catalyst for a click reaction is demonstrated.

Abstract
This study reports the invention of di&#8208; or trifunctionalization of readily available pyridines (including all the pyridine substrates utilized in this paper, such as 3&#8208;cyanopyridine and 3&#8208;chloropyridine) through dearomative functionalization&#8208;oxidative rearomatization under transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and reductant&#8208;free conditions. Although a two&#8208;step operation is required, the crude product of the first step could be used in the next step directly. Typically, 3&#8208;&#960;&#8208;EWG pyridines undergo difunctionalization, whereas 3&#8208;&#963;&#8208;EWG pyridines participate in trifunctionalization, affording multisubstituted piperidines. Computational studies provide detailed insights for their distinct reactivity in the title reaction.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Carboamination of Maleimides with Amines and &#945;&#8208;Bromo Carboxylates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative carboamination of maleimides with alkyl amines and &#945;&#8208;bromo carboxylates is described. These multicomponent reactions show good functional group compatibility and are suitable for the late&#8208;stage modification of a series of neuroprotective agents, providing a direct path for the library synthesis of 3&#8208;carbo&#8208;4&#8208;amino maleimides. The initial copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative amination of maleimides with amines to form enamines intermediate, followed by copper&#8208;catalyzed radical alkylation with &#945;&#8208;bromo carboxylate compounds, triggers a relayed catalytic reaction to achieve the carboamination process.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Iodohydrins and corresponding ethers were synthesized by an electrochemical process using inexpensive and non&#8208;toxic ammonium iodide. This transformation was applied to a panel of alkenes, giving products without the need of external hazardous oxidants, reductants or metal catalyst. This protocol showed a general efficiency to synthesize valuable iodinated molecules with yields from 19% to 90%.

Abstract
We have disclosed an alkenes dicarbofunctionalization method to introduce alkyl and electron&#8208;rich aryl across the C=C bond of styrenes under copper catalyst and oxidative conditions, leading to construct C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2)/C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds via dual C&#8722;H functionalization. This method realizes the synthesis of 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes, which are very important skeleton in natural products and drug molecules, through the grafting of electron&#8208;rich aromatics, including indoles, pyrroles, trisubstituted aromatic.

It depicts the halohydrin dehalogenase&#8208;catalysed conversion of epoxides. Extensive screening of enzymes from group B revealed several highly enantioselective transformations, with HheB showing higher enantioselectivity and activity toward a larger panel of substrates compared to HheB2. By using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, residues 120 and 125 were found to be responsible for higher enantioselectivity of HheB compared to HheB2. Due to remarkable activity and enantioselectivity, B&#8208;group HHDHs emerged as a catalyst of choice for the synthesis of bulky tertiary alcohols.

         <title>Regioselective Dearomatization of N&#8208;Alkylquinolinium and Pyridinium Salts under Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction employing N&#8208;alkylquinolinium salts as electrophiles has been developed. The reaction is promoted by DBU, which acts both as a catalyst activating the electron&#8208;poor olefin as well as a base. The dearomatization occurs regioselectively at the C&#8208;2 position, delivering a broad range of &#945;&#8208;(1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)vinyl esters, ketones, and sulfones. The scope of the transformation has also been extended to N&#8208;alkylpyridinium salts. For this class of substrates a presence of at least moderately electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent in the ring is necessary to attain good reactivity. In particular, N&#8208;alkylpyridinium salts containing an ester group undergo the dearomatization regioselectively at the C&#8208;4 position, while nitrile and nitro moieties cause the non&#8208;selective formation of products of the C&#8208;2 and C&#8208;6 additions.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbonylative Suzuki Coupling Catalyzed by Pd Complexes Based on [N,P]&#8208;Pyrrole Ligands: Direct Access to 2&#8208;Hydroxybenzophenones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. The Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling is one of the most useful synthetic tools to build C&#8208;C bonds, but the use of hydroxyaryl halides to direct access hydroxy&#8208;byaryls still remains a challenge. For the carbonylative version of the reaction, the synthesis of hydroxybiaryl ketones is commonly solved by protecting group strategies. In this work, we report a protocol of carbonylative Suzuki&#8208; Miyaura coupling catalysed by a [N,P]&#8208;PdCl2 complex using aryl halides, various aryl boronic acids and CO. We were able at first to obtain biphenyls, finding a singular reactivity towards 2&#8208;bromophenol, that later was extended to the carbonylation reaction, resulting in methodology that allows the obtention of 2&#8208;hydroxybiaryl ketones, with a functional group tolerance toward amines, alkoxy, ketones, esters, and halides.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Condensation of Aryl Alkyl Ketones with o&#8208;Phenylenediamines: Access to Quinoxalines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
While elemental sulfur has been largely used as oxidant or sulfurating agent, its role as a catalyst has not been developed. We report here its catalytic activity in the oxidative condensation of o&#8208;phenylenediamines with acetophenones in DMSO to provide quinoxalines. The method was also extended to &#945;&#8208;tetralones, propiophenones (R=Me) as well as higher homologues (R=Et, n&#8208;Pr) in place of acetophenones, leading to a wide range of naphthoquinoxalines and 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;arylquinoxalines.

         <title>Tetrahydroxydiboron&#8208;Mediated Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenative Transfer Hydrogenation of Aryl Ketones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We describe a palladium&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenative transfer hydrogenation of ketones using B2(OH)4 as the sole additive. Deuterium labeling experiments using B2(OD)4 show that the incorporated protons originate exclusively from the diboron reagent. Spectroscopic evidence implicates the intermediacy of a borate ester. A variety of aromatic ketones can be deoxygenated using this approach.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of 1,2,4&#8208;Triazoles via a [3+2] Cycloaddition of Azinium&#8208;N&#8208;imines and Nitriles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a mechanochemical Cu&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition of azinium&#8208;N&#8208;imines with nitriles under solventless grinding conditions. Various 1,2,4&#8208;triazolos derivatives were obtained in 51&#8208;80% yields. The developed protocol offers advantages in functional&#8208;group compatibility, scalability, no use of solvents, shorter reaction time, and without external heating. In addition, heterocyclic N&#8208;imines such as quinolinium and isoquinolinium salts are also suitable substrates, resulting in the production of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]quinoline and 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives under mechanochemical conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkyne&#8208;Based Syntheses of Carbo&#8208; and Heterohelicenes</title>

Abstract
[n]Helicenes are polycyclic aromatic molecules in which n ortho&#8208;condensed benzene or other aromatic rings give rise to helical chiral and highly conjugated structures. The unique screw shape, helically extended &#960;&#8208;system and intriguing electronic and chirooptical properties of these molecules have attracted scientific interest for decades. The applications of helicenes have now expanded into several fields including material science, nanoscience, biochemistry, supramolecular and polymer chemistry. Despite the great theoretical and practical interest in helicenes, their synthesis remains a challenge. Among synthetic approaches to helicenes, alkyne cyclizations have great potential, since carbon&#8208;rich high&#8208;energy alkynes can form aromatic rings via cycloisomerizations. These processes are atom&#8208;economic. In addition, alkyne reactions are highly favorable thermodynamically. This review focuses on alkyne&#8208;based syntheses of carbo&#8208; and heterohelicenes (2000&#8211;2022). These syntheses are obviously multistage. In the review, they are systematized in terms of the key step leading to the formation of a helical shape. The methods are grouped into two categories: (a) metal&#8208;free syntheses and (b) transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed syntheses. This division is very arbitrary, since catalytic Sonogashira and Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions and others are often used to prepare starting materials in the syntheses of the first group. Most of the publications on the topic are related to transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed syntheses of helicenes.

         <title>Photocatalytic Chemodivergent Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;Dihalovinyl Ketones and Chromen&#8208;2&#8208;Ones from Monoalkynes</title>

Abstract
A general photocatalytic substrate&#8208;controlled chemodivergent strategy starting from monoalkynes with polyhalomethanes such as BrCCl3 and CBr4 was develop, enabling Kharasch&#8208;type addition/nucleophilic substitution cascade to selectively produce &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;dihalovinyl ketones and chromen&#8208;2&#8208;ones with moderate to good yields. Use of monoalkynes without additional nucleophilic sites furnished &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;dihalovinyl ketones through a Kharasch&#8208;type addition and intermolecular allylic substitution cascade whereas the latter transformation of 2&#8208;ethynylphenols allowed the full breaking of carbon&#8208;halogen bonds of BrCX3 to access functionalized chromen&#8208;2&#8208;ones. The late&#8208;stage application of these resulting &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;dihalovinyl ketones demonstrates the versatility of their derivatization.

         <title>Diastereoselective and Synergistic Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Bispropargylation of Xanthones and Thioxanthones: An Access to Xanthene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A gold&#8208;catalyzed bispropargylation of xanthone derivatives is described. The use of propargylsilanes permits to achieve a deoxygenative bispropargylation through a double catalytic addition of the corresponding allenylgold intermediate to the synergistically activated carbonyl moiety. This methodology works in a diastereoselective manner either with xanthone or thioxanthone derivatives. Monopropargylated xanthydrol silyl ethers were isolated as reaction intermediates and these species could be transformed into symmetrical and non&#8208;symmetrical bispropargylated xanthenes. The formation of non&#8208;symmetrical bispropargylated xanthenes could also be achieved through an one&#8208;pot procedure. Finally, other interesting structures, such as propargylxanthylidenes, propargylxanthenes and bispropargylated xanthenes replacing the silicon moiety, were accessible following different one&#8208;pot synthetic methodologies. In addition, bispropargylated xanthenes could perform a carbonylative [2+2+1] formal cycloaddition.

Abstract
The previous strategies for oxidative cleavage of 2,3&#8208;double bond of substituted indoles generally suffered from usage of heavy metals, stoichiometric chemical oxidants or hash conditions. Herein, we reported an electrochemistry&#8208;driven aerobic cleavage of C(2)=C(3)/C(2)&#8722;N bonds of indoles. Through an undivided cell, various indoles and its derivatives can be converted into the corresponding ortho&#8208;amino aryl ketones. This method features metal&#8208;free, air&#8208;as&#8208;oxidant and easy scalability.

Abstract
A strategy to synthesize 3&#8208;alkyl quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and other alkyl N&#8208;heteroarenes via a photocatalyzed decarbonylative alkylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and simple N&#8208;heterocycles with commercially available aliphatic aldehyde under ambient conditions using phenanthrenequinone as a photocatalyst was developed. In this transformation, various 3&#8208;alkyl quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and other alkyl N&#8208;heteroarenes were generated in 58&#8211;87% isolated yields with good functional&#8208;group tolerance.

         <title>Synthesis of Bis(&#946;&#8208;Oximinoalkyl)malonates and Their Catalytic Reductive Cyclization to Piperidines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Hitherto unknown bis(&#946;&#8208;oximinoalkyl)malonates were demonstrated to be convenient platforms for the synthesis of saturated N&#8208;heterocycles. Upon heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation, these dioximes undergo reductive cyclization to give substituted piperidine&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxylates, which are valuable building blocks in medicinal chemistry. By using dioximes bearing an additional ester group in the side chain, tandem piperidine/pyrrolidinone ring closure leading to indolizidinone framework was showcased in this work. A modular synthesis of initial bis(&#946;&#8208;oximinoalkyl)malonates (both symmetrically and unsymmetrically substituted) was accomplished via a sequential Michael addition of two nitrosoalkene molecules to malonic ester. The mechanism of the reductive cyclization of dioximes to piperidines was investigated by isotope scrambling experiments and isolation of intermediates.

&lt;p&gt;Hitherto unknown bis(&#946;-oximinoalkyl)malonates were demonstrated to be convenient platforms for the synthesis of saturated &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycles. Upon heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation, these dioximes undergo reductive cyclization to give substituted piperidine-4,4&#8217;-dicarboxylates, which are valuable building blocks in medicinal chemistry. By using dioximes bearing an additional ester group in the side chain, tandem piperidine/pyrrolidinone ring closure leading to indolizidinone framework was showcased in this work.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Saturated carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic building blocks can be readily obtained by the hydrogenation of aromatic carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. Although a variety of methods have been established to accomplish this transformation for simple arenes, the hydrogenation of aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles is less explored. We herein report a diastereoselective arene hydrogenation which was applied to an array of benzo&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocycles. A total of 48 saturated heterocycles was obtained by hydrogenation in the presence of the rhodium complex Cy(CAAC)Rh(cod)Cl in yields of 72&#8208;98% with moderate to high diastereoselectivities exhibiting the hydrogen atoms in an all&#8208;cis arrangement. The high tolerance towards functional groups enables the formation of valuable saturated products, which offer a starting point for further derivatization.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;Supported Tetrahydropyran&#8208;Based Hybrid Dipeptide Catalysts for Michael Addition of Aldehydes to Nitrostyrenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heterogenization of homogeneous catalysts onto a solid support is a step towards a more sustainable chemistry. The recovery and reuse of catalysts is extremely important from a practical, economic and environmental point of view. In this regards, we report a series of polymer&#8208;supported tetrahydropyran&#8208;based hybrid dipeptides that serve as active catalysts for the enantioselective Michael addition of aldehydes to &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes. These supported catalysts have been designed considering the optimal anchor position and orientation between the catalyst and the solid support.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The heterogenization of homogeneous catalysts onto a solid support is a step towards a more sustainable chemistry. The recovery and reuse of catalysts is extremely important from a practical, economic and environmental point of view. In this regards, we report a series of polymer-supported tetrahydropyran-based hybrid dipeptides that serve as active catalysts for the enantioselective Michael addition of aldehydes to &#946;-nitrostyrenes. These supported catalysts have been designed considering the optimal anchor position and orientation between the catalyst and the solid support. Additionally, the influence of the linker length on the catalytic efficiency was studied. The catalysts proved to be efficient and show good stereoselectivities with a wide variety of substrates. Detailed deactivation studies have provided important information, which allows to increase the useful life of these immobilized catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones utilizing a secondary alcohol has been accomplished by an isolable, bench&#8208;stable, inexpensive nickel catalyst affording high yields of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted products. This is the first entry of a nickel catalyst among only a few scarce examples of base metal representative for this purpose. The substrate scope can span a wide range including aliphatic, alicyclic, and cyclic secondary alcohols. Functionalization of a cholesterol molecule is also possible following this methodology. The catalyst can interconvert between azo and hydrazo form in a reversible fashion to enable this chemical transformation.</dc:description>

Abstract
A catalytic asymmetric vinylogous Mannich/annulation/acylation reaction of 2&#8208;ethylidene 1,3&#8208;indandiones with isatin N&#8208;Boc ketimines has been developed, which furnished a series of chiral spiro&#8208;oxindole piperidine derivatives with polyaromatic scaffolds in 30&#8211;67% yield and 93&#8211;98% ee. The DFT computational calculation is used to probe and explain the origin of the enantioselectivity and observed formation of O&#8208;acetylated products.

Abstract
In this article, bismuth triflate (Bi(OTf)3)&#8208;controlled intermolecular multi&#8208;component condensation of oxygenated arylacetic acids with electron&#8208;withdrawing nitroarylaldehydes or electron&#8208;donating trimethoxybenzene provide 1&#8208;aryl isoquinolinones or o&#8208;diaryl pyrimidines in acetonitrile at 60&#8201;&#176;C. The uses of various metal triflates and reaction conditions are investigated in the one&#8208;pot reaction. Only water is generated as the byproduct via (4C+1C+1N) and (2C+1N1C+1N1C) annulation routes. Plausible mechanisms have been proposed.

Abstract
A diastereoselective and enantioselective conjugate addition of &#945;&#8208;substituted acyl imidazole to nitroalkene catalyzed by nickel bisoxazoline complex and B(C6F5)3 has been developed. This reaction tolerated a wide range of acyl imidazoles and nitroalkenes, affording a series of conjugate adducts in yields ranging from 38% to 99% with 4:1 to 99:1 dr and 13% to 98% ee. The use of strong Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 as co&#8208;catalyst proved vital to the success of this process. The potential scalability and utility of the current protocol are demonstrated by a reaction on a 3&#8197;mmol scale and further transformations of the product.

The front cover image illustrates the oxidation of primary aromatic and aliphatic allylic alcohols to valuable aldehydes catalyzed by a recombinant aryl&#8208;alcohol oxidase of Pleurotus eryngii P34. This versatile enzyme demonstrates high stability against the by&#8208;product of the reaction, H2O2, and in the presence of organic solvents. After reaction optimization, a space&#8208;time&#8208;yield of 9.5&#160;g piperonal/l/h was achieved on a preparative scale. The produced aldehydes are of great interest as fragrances or building blocks in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. Further details can be found in the Research Article by Urlacher and co&#8208;workers (N. Jankowski, K. Koschorreck, V. B. Urlacher, Adv. Synth.

         <title>Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenases Catalyse Steroid Nucleus Hydroxylation with Regio&#8208; and Stereo&#8208;selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Steroids are the second largest class of drugs with a wide range of pharmacological properties. Hydroxylation of steroids seriously affects their biological activities and other properties. However, steroids are mostly sp3 hybridized carbons with numerous C&#8208;H bonds far from the functional group that can activate them, and achieving regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective hydroxylation on steroids is a highly challenging task that is almost impossible to achieve using modern organic synthesis techniques. Interestingly, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases possess the ability to catalyse regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective oxidations of nonactivated C&#8208;H bonds in complex organic molecules under mild conditions. This review summarizes the P450s identified and engineered in recent years that can catalyse steroid nucleus hydroxylation stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Diverse Indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl&#8208;Substituted Tetrahydropyridines via Three&#8208;Component Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two classes of indole&#8208;tetrahydropyridine hybrid molecules were synthesized via three&#8208;component reactions of: (i) 1&#8208;amino&#8208;3,3&#8208;diethoxypropane, diethyl acetylenedicarboxylate and indole; and (ii) ethyl 3&#8208;aminocrotonate, acrolein and 2&#8208;methylindoles. These one&#8208;pot reactions provided straightforward ways to access indole&#8208;tetrahydropyridine hybrid molecules with enriched molecular diversity. The reactions were most likely triggered by Michael addition, and the generated adducts were trapped by the indole component, leading to the formation of indol&#8208;3&#8208;ylimine intermediate. The obtained indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl&#8208;substituted tetrahydropyridines can be converted into indole&#8208;pyridine hybrid molecules with the aid of DDQ.</dc:description>

         <title>An Umpolung Route to Amides from &#945;&#8208;Aminonitriles under Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free, base&#8208;mediated decyanation of &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles has been developed to synthesize secondary and tertiary amides using O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or air as an amide oxygen source. Radical scavenging studies disclosed that the cleavage of C&#8208;CN bond may proceed via an anionic pathway. The practicality of the work was also demonstrated through an in situ generated &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles from corresponding aldehydes and amines to afford amides. The important features of this work include broad functional group compatibility, 41% to 89% product yields, gram&#8208;scale synthesis of 2&#176; and 3&#176; amides, broad substrate scope, and an umpolung strategy.</dc:description>

Abstract
Using chiral phosphoric acids as organocatalysts, a formal asymmetric (4+2) cycloaddition of 3&#8208;methylene isoindolinone and in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated ortho&#8208;quinone methide substrates is disclosed. This reaction exhibited a broad substrate scope with various substituted cyclic enamides and ortho&#8208;hydroxybenzyl alcohol derivatives to construct a series of spiro chroman&#8208;isoindolinones containing spiro&#8208;N,O&#8208;heterocycles with 56 to 93% ee. This strategy demonstrates significant potential towards establishing a chiral spiro&#8208;N,O&#8208;aminal systems bearing two chiral carbon centers, including a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter.

         <title>Ring Closure of Nitroalkylmalonates for the Synthesis of Isoxazolines under the Acylation Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Acylation of nitroalkylmalonates was found to yield substituted isoxazoline derivatives. This redox&#8208;neutral transformation has a wide substrate scope and produces target products with yields up to 92%. Various substituents (aryl, alkyl, and ester) at the C3 and C4 positions of the resulting isoxazolines were also tolerated. A quick assembly of the isoxazoline ring starting from nitroalkenes and malonates was successfully developed. Control experiments showed that the intramolecular ring closure is the most likely key mechanistic step. Subsequent transformations into pyrrolidine and furane derivatives demonstrated the synthetic utility of the obtained products.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Pharmaceutically Relevant Bulky Arylbutylamines Using Engineered Transaminases</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ATAs engineered for having an enlarged small binding pocket were applied for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure (R)&#8208;benzo[1,3]dioxol&#8208;5&#8208;yl&#8208;butylamine, a chiral component of human leukocyte elastase inhibitor DMP 777 (L&#8208;694,458). Kinetic resolution of the racemic amine was performed by using the L59A variant of the (S)&#8208;selective ATA from Chromobacterium violaceum (Cv&#8208;ATA), providing the residual (R)&#8208;enantiomer in excellent yield and &gt;99% ee. At moderate enzyme loading and absence of co&#8208;solvent, high volumetric productivity of 0.22 mol L&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 (42.5 g L&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) was achieved. Complementarily, the (S)&#8208;enantiomer was generated via kinetic resolution using the (R)&#8208;selective ATA&#8208;117&#8208;Rd11 from Arthrobacter sp. with acetone as the amino acceptor. 
In an alternative approach, we employed ATA&#8208;117&#8208;Rd11 for the asymmetric amination of the prochiral ketone precursor, which at 86% conversion gave the (R)&#8208;benzo[1,3]dioxol&#8208;5&#8208;yl&#8208;butylamine with excellent &gt;99% ee.  
We further evaluated the utility of Cv&#8208;ATA L59A for the asymmetric synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant (S)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylbutan&#8208;1&#8208;amine, a chiral component of the deubiquitinase inhibitor degrasyn (WP1130). The enzyme showed good tolerance to high concentrations of isopropylamine, producing (S)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylbutan&#8208;1&#8208;amine in enantiomerically pure form (&gt;99% ee).</dc:description>

Abstract
A metal&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free strategy for the preparation of maleimide&#8208;fused carbazoles has been developed. This protocol started from 2&#8208;(indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)cyclohexanones and maleimides, providing various maleimide&#8208;fused carbazoles in 45&#8211;90% yields. The present approach was catalyzed by trimethylsulfoxonium iodide and involved a cascade of oxidation, [4+2] annulation, and dehydrogenative aromatization. Moreover, these maleimide&#8208;fused carbazole products could be further transformed into other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced [2+2+1] Dearomative Cascade Cyclization of Indole/Furan Alkynes to Synthesize Sulfonyl Polycycles</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced [2+2+1] dearomative cascade cyclization of indole/furan alkynes with NaHSO3, providing an array of diverse highly strained sulfonyl polycycles. Compared to our previous work, this method does not require the use of additional sacrificial oxidants and have wider reaction scope. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the indole moiety initiated the reaction, which proceeded via single&#8208;electron oxidation pathway. An alkenyl radical formed by intramolecular addition capture SO2, and the resulting specie is cyclized to furnish the final product. Also, DFT calculations disclosed that the groups on the indole ring or at the side chain probably affect the single electron distribution at the reaction site of IM&#8208;RC&#8208;I, and the distribution may be a decisive factor of spirocyclization.

Abstract
Reported herein is a photocatalytic platform for the vicinal aminopyridylation of indoles. The accurate difunctionalization reaction undergoes a tandem process involving a radical&#8208;mediated 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddtion which generated from the single&#8208;electron oxidation of N&#8208;aminopyridinium ylides, a cleavage of the N&#8722;N bond as well as an oxidation of indoline ring. The electrophilic pyridyl and nucleophilic amino groups can be installed simultaneously into a wide range of indoles under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions. Moreover, the protocol shows high levels of step and atom economy.

Abstract
A copper(I)/phosphine system that homogeneously catalyses the alkynylation of formaldehyde with acetylene or terminal alkynes is reported. Using acetylene at atmospheric pressure, the catalyst consisting of &lt;1&#8197;mol% copper(I) phenylacetylide and a trialkyl bisphosphine ligand shows a high selectivity towards the formation of propargyl alcohol rather than 1,4&#8208;butynediol, which is not reported for common heterogeneous copper acetylide catalysts. The biphasic water/toluene reaction mixture allows the separation of targeted products with the aqueous layer and catalyst recycling via the organic layer.

         <title>Defluorinative Alkylation of Trifluoromethyl Alkenes with Soft Carbon Nucleophiles Enabled by a Catalytic Amount of Base</title>

Abstract
Direct manipulation of readily accessible trifluoromethyl alkenes (TAs) represents an attractive approach to the preparation of diversified fluorine&#8208;containing compounds. In this study, defluorinative alkylation reactions of TAs with a broad array of soft carbon nucleophiles have been documented. Nucleophilic substitutions occur enabled by a catalytic amount of base, providing access to tertiary alkyl substituted gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrans. By extending the nucleophiles to silyl enol ethers, defluorination can be achieved in the absence of base to give gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. This process, which eliminates the requirement of organometallic reagents, transition metals, or strong bases for the C&#8722;F bond cleavage, is applicable to late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules.

&lt;p&gt;Direct manipulation of readily accessible trifluoromethyl alkenes (TAs) represents an attractive approach to the preparation of diversified fluorine-containing compounds. In this study, defluorinative alkylation reactions of TAs with a broad array of soft carbon nucleophiles have been documented. Nucleophilic substitutions occur enabled by a catalytic amount of base, providing access to tertiary alkyl substituted &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoroalkenes and 2-fluoro-4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyrans. By extending the nucleophiles to silyl enol ethers, defluorination can be achieved in the absence of base to give &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoroalkenes. This process, which eliminates the requirement of organometallic reagents, transition metals, or strong bases for the C&#8722;F bond cleavage, is applicable to late-stage modification of complex molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
An atom&#8208;economical approach for the synthesis of 3&#8208;aminofurans/thiophenes via a conjugate addition of alcohols and thiols with electron withdrawing groups (EWGs) at &#945; positions on alkynenitriles followed by a modified Thorpe&#8208;Ziegler cyclization have been reported. This operationally simple protocol offers a rapid access to a library of 3&#8208;aminofurans/thiophenes in moderate to good yields.

Abstract
Difunctionalization of alkenes enables construction of complex compounds in one pot. In this report, we presented an intermolecular, redox&#8208;neutral three&#8208;component dicarbofunctionalization of activated alkenes under mild reaction conditions. The mechanistic studies indicated tertiary alkyl radicals from oxalate salts were first added to alkenes in Giese&#8208;type fashion, followed by nucleophilic addition with aldehydes to produce the desired 1,2&#8208;dialkylation products. The catalyst system does not require any additives, with good functional group compatibility, regioselectivity, and constructs two tertiary carbon centers simultaneously.

Abstract
A synthetic method of o&#8208;sulfanylanilines from cyclohexanones, amines, and thiophenols under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions is disclosed. This is the first report on the direct thioamination of cyclohexanones via N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) promoted oxidative dehydroaromatization. Non&#8208;aromatic cyclohexanones were smoothly dehydrogenated, and acted as an aryl source using oxygen as a green oxidant. The capacity of the resultant o&#8208;sulfanylanilines for synthesis of N&#8208;arylphenothiazines has been further demonstrated.

         <title>Pentafluorophenyl Group as Activating Group: Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Deuterio Carboxylic Acid Derivatives via Et3N Catalyzed H/D Exchange</title>

Abstract
We discovered that highly regioselective H/D exchange can be achieved on the &#945;&#8208;position of the pentafluorophenyl (Pfp) ester using Et3N as the catalyst and D2O as the deuterium source. Our computational and experimental results showed that the Pfp group can significantly increase the acidity of the &#945;&#8208;hydrogen of the ester. This mild reaction condition tolerated a variety of functional groups. 90%&#8764;98% yields and 91%&#8764;98% deuterium incorporations were obtained with all the tested Pfp esters. Taking advantage of the high reactivity of Pfp esters, a series of valuable &#945;&#8208;deuterio carboxylic acid derivatives, including herbicide, drugs and drug intermediates, have been synthesized using &#945;&#8208;deuterio Pfp esters as precursors.

Abstract
Functionalization of white phosphorus with disulfides, amines and KOH to phosphoramidodithioates containing both P&#8722;N, P&#8722;S and P=O bonds via a four&#8208;component reaction is presented. It proceeds with high yields and provides an attractive approach for the construction of valuable N&#8722;P(O)&#8722;S motif using a one&#8208;step strategy. The advantages of this newly developed process include a clean reaction profile, complete conversion of white phosphorus, transition metal&#8208;free and halogen&#8208;free environmentally benign system, and large&#8208;scale synthetic application. Besides, phosphoramidodithioates can also be utilized to construct P&#8722;C, P&#8722;O and P=S bonds with the appropriate reagents.

Arylation of tertiary aryl and alkyl phosphines bearing 2&#8208;cyanoethyl group with aryl(mesityl)iodonium triflates under blue light irradiation followed by retro&#8208;Michael reaction of the in&#8197;situ generated quaternary phosphonium salts initiated by DBU represent a novel efficient and general method for the preparation of distinctly substituted tertiary arylphosphines. An operationally simple, one&#8208;pot protocol features mild, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, high selectivity, broad functional group compatibility, as well as scalability and would be applied to substrates with different electronic and steric nature.

Abstract
Herein we report the asymmetric organocatalyzed method for the Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction between activated phenols and trihaloacetaldehydes. A three&#8208;phase screening including 41 compounds was employed to identify a catalyst structure based on 3,5&#8208;dinitrobenzamide of 9&#8208;amino&#8208;epi&#8208;cinchonidine as the lead catalytic molecule. Under the optimized reaction conditions, the above catalyst offered trihalohydroxyalkylated adducts in yields ranging from 26 to 92% and enantiomeric ratios within 69:31&#8211;99:1. The reaction scope was determined on 29 entries and several follow&#8208;up transformations of the enantioenriched products were accomplished.

Abstract
A method to synthesize benzofurylselenocyanates, benzothienylselenocyanates and indolylselenocyanates via electrophilic selenocyanogen cyclization was established. This sequential process was conducted under mild conditions in a short time. This protocol was successfully applied to late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules. Notablely, the selenocyanate can be converted into other valuable Se&#8208;containing compounds and showed antitumor activity to human hepatoma cells HepG2.

The front cover picture illustrates the Cinchona&#8208;alkaloid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric and ortho&#8208;selective Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction between activated phenols and trihaloacetaldehydes. The reaction scheme, accompanied by portraits of Charles Friedel (upper right) and James Mason Crafts (lower left), contains pictograms and a background image representing our faculty building with its departments. The catalytic process developed by our group features a reasonably general substrate scope and provides the resulting adducts in good yields and enantioselectivities. Moreover, the possible downstream transformations of products were surveyed. Further details can be found in the Research Article by Otevrel and co&#8208;workers (D. Svestka, J. Otevrel, P.

Abstract
The direct asymmetric addition of heteroatom nucleophiles to imines represents one of the most efficient tools for the formation of carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds and has received much interest recently. The review is devoted to the asymmetric addition reactions of non&#8208;carbon nucleophiles to imines. The present review is divided into five main sections: reactions with N&#8208;nucleophiles; reactions with P&#8208;nucleophiles; reactions with O&#8208;nucleophiles; reactions with S&#8208;nucleophiles; reactions with Se&#8208;nucleophiles. It has been seen that chiral catalysts such as quinines, BINOLs, chiral phosphoric acids as well as various Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids are the source of asymmetry of the presented reactions of asymmetric addition of non&#8208;carbon nucleophiles to imines.

Abstract
Olefins are important building blocks and are widely utilized in synthetic organic chemistry. Owing to its omnipresence and unique reactivity, the functionalization of alkenes has become a powerful method for constructing complex organic molecules. In this context, direct chelation&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H olefination at the inert C&#8722;H bonds represents the most straightforward synthetic method for introducing the alkenyl group into organic compounds in a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner. Despite the remarkable advances in chelation&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H olefination reaction, most of the successful transformations are restricted to activated or electronically biased olefins such as acrylates, styrenes, acrylamides, vinyl sulfones, and vinyl phosphonates. Literature reports on chelation&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H olefination with unactivated or electronically unbiased alkenes are limited due to poor intrinsic reactivity and regioselectivity issues. Despite significant challenges, the past few years have witnessed tremendous growth. The present review describes the recent advances in the chelation&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H olefination and allylation of aromatics, alkenes, and heteroaromatics with unactivated alkenes via the concerted&#8208;metallation&#8208; deprotonation pathway.Transition metals such as palladium, rhodium, iridium and cobalt are widely used for these kind of transformations. The scope, mechanistic investigation, and limitation of the alkenylation and allylation reactions are discussed elaborately. The present review includes all the reported C&#8722;H olefination and allylation reactions with unactivated olefins via the base&#8208;assisted deprotonation pathway.

Abstract
A general method is developed to allow de novo construction of quinolines and C2&#8208;functionalized quinolines from ortho&#8208;alkenyl anilines in the presence of a difluorocarbene precursor. This method exploits a crucial reactivity of in&#8208;situ generation of isocyanides from condensation of primary aniline with difluorocarbene. Subsequent &#945;&#8208;addition of isocyanide by neighbouring alkenyl group constructs the quinoline ring. Furthermore, when a combination of difluorocarbene precursor and Se are present, selenoisocyanate intermediates are tentatively generated that upon nucleophilic addition by ortho&#8208;alkenyl produce 2&#8208;SeH quinolines. In the presence of a second nucleophile such as anilines, competing nucleophilic addition of anilines to the selenoisocyanate is preferred, generating selenourea intermediate. Further nucleophilic addition of the ortho&#8208;alkenyl to selenourea followed by elimination of H2Se produces 2&#8208;aminoquinolines. This allows one&#8208;step multi&#8208;component modular preparation of various C2&#8208;functionalized quinolines from readily available starting compounds. This method shows good yields, scope and chemoselectivity. It is operationally convenient and friendly without manipulating unpleasant isocyanides. The difluorocarbene&#8208;enabled primary amine to isocyanide conversion may be exploited to develop other interesting reactions.

&lt;p&gt;A general method is developed to allow &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; construction of quinolines and C2-functionalized quinolines from &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-alkenyl anilines in the presence of a difluorocarbene precursor. This method exploits a crucial reactivity of in-situ generation of isocyanides from condensation of primary aniline with difluorocarbene. Subsequent &#945;-addition of isocyanide by neighbouring alkenyl group constructs the quinoline ring. Furthermore, when a combination of difluorocarbene precursor and Se are present, selenoisocyanate intermediates are tentatively generated that upon nucleophilic addition by &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-alkenyl produce 2-SeH quinolines.

Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free photoinduced radical&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;oxy C&#8722;H cyclobutylation reaction of bicyclo[1.1.0]butane (BCB) compounds was described. In this protocol, &#945;&#8208;oxy C(sp3)&#8722;H motifs including ethers and alcohols were activated via photocatalytic conditions, releasing the ring strain of BCBs and generating 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutanes in 40&#8211;80% yields. Control experiments and Stern&#8208;Volmer quenching experiments indicated that the reaction proceeded through the generation of &#945;&#8208;oxy carbon&#8208;centered radical intermediates by photoinduced hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process.

Abstract
An operationally simple protocol for the synthesis of medium&#8208;sized lactones and macrolactones via an intramolecular ring expansion of cyclic ketones has been developed. Using this method, a series of 10&#8208; and 12&#8208;membered lactones was synthesized under mild conditions. Preliminary mechanistic studies showed that a radical pathway might be involved in this reaction.

The acidic hydrogen&#8208;tethered allylic carbonates were successfully applied in phosphine catalysis. Their (4+2) annulation reaction with sulfamate&#8208;derived cyclic imines under phosphine catalysis worked well to produce tetrahydropyridine&#8208;fused heterocyclic compounds in high yields. A moderate ee was obtained in the initial screening. The zwitterionic intermediate produced through in&#8208;situ deprotonation functioned as a four&#8208;membered synthon.

         <dc:description>Abstract. A one&#8208;pot strategy for the synthesis of 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;furylisoindolinone derivatives is reported. The reaction proceeds via a copper catalyzed oxidative cascade inter&#8208;molecular double cyclization of 2&#8208;iodobenzamide derivatives and propargyl dicarbonyl compounds in the presence of oxygen. The strategy involves several reactions including cyclization/coupling/double C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization in a cascade manner. 	A wide range of 2&#8208;iodobenzamide substrates containing different substituents as well as various propargyldicarbonyl compounds and propargylsulfonyl aryl ketones can be used to access a variety of 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;furylisoindolinone derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Bromide&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Csp3&#8208;H Oxidation of Acetonitrile: Stereoselective Synthesis of Heteroaryl Vinyl Sulfides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
An electrochemical oxidative C&#8722;H/S&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction between acetonitrile and heteroaryl thiols has been developed. Me4NBr is employed as a redox catalyst to oxidize both the Csp3&#8208;H of acetonitrile and S&#8722;H of heteroaryl thiols. Heteroaryl vinyl sulfides were afforded under metal&#8208;free and oxidant&#8208;free reaction conditions in good yields and stereoselectivities with excellent functional group tolerance. The synthetic applicability of the electrochemical method was further highlighted by its easy scalability.

Abstract
We present an efficient method for forming C&#8722;N bonds via intramolecular amidation catalyzed by well&#8208;defined Cp*Co(N,O)I complexes. The reaction has been operate under mild conditions and produced a regioselective amidation product without the use of a bulky counter anion or expensive fluorinated solvents. The Cp*Co(N,O)&#8208;I catalyst is very effective for intramolecular benzylic, tertiary, and internal C(sp3)&#8722;H bond amidation, but ineffective for intramolecular C(sp2)&#8722;H bond amidation.

         <title>Iron(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Difluoroalkylation of Aryl Alkynes with Difluoroenol Silyl Ether in the Presence of Trimethylsilyl Chloride</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The reaction of non&#8208;fluorinated silyl enol ether with alkyne is useful for the synthesis of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds. However, most of the existing methods for realizing such organic transformation usually employ stoichiometric amounts of relatively expensive Lewis acids/metallic salts. Herein, an iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed difluoroalkylation of aryl alkynes with difluoroenol silyl ether was developed. The reactions proceeded smoothly in the presence of a catalytic amount of iron(III) chloride, stoichiometric amounts of trimethylsilyl chloride, and 4&#8197;&#197; molecular sieves in dichloroethane (DCE) to afford the corresponding &#945;&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroketones in modest to good yields. Remarkably, among the various metallic salts screened, cheap and less&#8208;toxic iron(III) salt was found to be the most efficient Lewis acid catalyst for the present reaction. In addition, in the absence of iron(III) chloride or trimethylsilyl chloride, either no reaction occurred or considerably reduced reaction performance was observed. Moreover, the use of Br&#248;nsted acid to replace iron(III) chloride as reaction catalyst failed to promote the reaction. The reaction could be scaled up and the obtained difluoroalkylated carbonyl compound serves as a versatile building block which could be subjected to late&#8208;stage diversification to be converted into useful organic molecules containing CF2H and CF2CF2 moieties. Deuterated experiments showed that the proton in the generated alkene product should originate from trace amounts of water present in the reaction system.

Abstract
A FeCl2&#8208;catalyzed homocoupling of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketoximes in batch and flow is reported. This protocol demonstrates broad substrate scope and functional group tolerance, providing an alternate route toward the synthesis of 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted pyrimidines under mild conditions. Also a gram&#8208;scale reaction has been performed to evaluate the applicability of this method.

Abstract
A cascade C&#8722;H activation, annulation, and etherification of N&#8208;hydroxybenzamides with propargylamines provides a flexible route to N&#8208;alkoxylated 3&#8208;arylisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones. Three new bonds (C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O) are generated to afford a series of isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones bearing a tetrasubstituted carbon in 49&#8211;82% yield. The utility of this method was showcased by gram&#8208;scale synthesis and synthetic transformations of the product to access structurally diverse isoindolinones.

         <title>Imine Azaenolates: Synthesis, Reactivity and Outlook</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azaenolates are, quite simply, the aza variant of enolates. Compared to their oxygen counterparts, additional control of the reactivity of azaenolates can be achieved by altering the substituent on the nitrogen atom as well as the metal counterion. Since the seminal examples reported in the early 1960&#8217;s, azaenolates of various metals have been shown to react with a diverse set of electrophilic partners, including challenging electrophiles such as alkyl fluorides, epoxides and oxetanes. This review describes in detail the current state of the art of the chemistry of azaenolates derived from imines, with a particular focus on the comparison of the reactivity exhibited with different metal counterions.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluoroiodomethane: A CH2F&#8208;Moiety Delivering Agent Suitable for Nucleophilic&#8208;, Electrophilic&#8208; and Radical&#8208;Harnessed Operations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent renewed interest towards mono&#8208;fluoromethylation chemistry &#8211; somehow less developed than analogous well&#8208;established trifluoro&#8208; and difluoro&#8208;methylation tactics &#8211; identified the simple C1&#8208;building block fluoroiodomethane as an effective and versatile CH2F&#8208;delivering agent. The convenient physical state &#8211; liquid with a boiling point of 53 &#176;C &#8211; and the nowadays commercially availability, boosted in the last years the flourishing of protocols where it is used for generating the fluoromethyl group under conceptually distinct logics: electrophilic, nucleophilic and radical. Depending on the reaction conditions adopted, the reagent serves as a pluripotent precursor of variously functionalized CHF&#8208;fragments, thus considerably simplifying the installation of the motif into organic skeletons. A critical analysis of the applications found by the reagent in the literature (mainly) published in the last 5 years, is provided with vistas to its employment in the preparation of drug molecules (and thereof precursors).</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances for Alkylation of Ketones and Secondary Alcohols using Alcohols in Homogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The alkylation of ketones or secondary alcohols using alcohols as alkylating agents via hydrogen borrowing strategy presents a powerful method for the synthesis of &#593;&#8208;alkylated ketones. In this review, we summarize the progress catalyzed by Ir, Pd, Rh, Ru, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu catalysts for the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones with alcohols and cross&#8208;coupling of secondary alcohols with alcohols from 2017 to 2021. A wide range of ketones (aromatic and aliphatic ketones) and alcohols (benzylic and aliphatic primary alcohols, aromatic and aliphatic secondary alcohols, alkenyl alcohols, and diols) are well tolerated. Furthermore, we also discuss current challenges and propose perspectives on the coming development in this filed. The objective of the present review is to give an overview on recent advances for &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones with alcohols and &#946;&#8208;alkylation of secondary alcohols with alcohols. Finally, we hope that this review will give inspirations on alkylation of ketones or secondary alcohols with alcohols.</dc:description>

This mild protocol provides straightforward access to various C4&#8208;difluoroalkylated phthalazin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones, and displays broad substrate scope and wide functional group tolerance. Moreover, this process is also suitable for the synthesis of C4&#8208;trifluoromethylated and perfluorobutylated phthalazin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones. The use of fac&#8208;[Ir(ppy)3] photocatalyst and the introduction of an organic base additive are pivotal to catalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract. C&#8208;Aryl glycoside is a class of structural motifs with important medicinal value. Herein, a remote C&#8208;H glycosylation strategy enabled by Ruthenium(&#8545;)&#8208;catalyzed with mostly &#945;&#8208;stereoselectivity is described. This approach exhibits great functional group compatibility with various glycosides and arylamides.

         <title>One Pot Access to 2'&#8208;Aryl&#8208;2,3'&#8208;Bithiophenes via Twofold Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;X/C&#8208;H Coupling Associated to a Pd&#8208;1,4&#8208;Migration</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of 1,2&#8208;dihalobenzenes in palladium catalyzed polyheteroarylation via C&#8208;H bond functionalization was investigated.  The first catalytic cycle using thiophene as the heteroarene gives the expected 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromophenyl)thiophenes.  In the course of the second catalytic cycle, in the presence of heteroarenes having a free C3&#8208;position, a partial Pd 1,4&#8208;migration occurred giving rise to aryl&#8208;substituted biheteroarenes such as 2'&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3'&#8208;bithiophenes as well as the expected 1,2&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzenes.  The best selectivities in favor of the formation of 2'&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3'&#8208;bithiophenes were obtained with electron&#8208;rich 1,2&#8208;dihalobenzenes. A wide variety of thiophene derivatives bearing useful functions such as formyl, acetyl, cyclopropylmethanone, 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane, ester, nitrile or chloro was tolerated allowing to prepare poly&#8208;functionalized 2'&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3'&#8208;bithiophenes.  Moreover, this one pot preparation of 2'&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3'&#8208;bithiophenes employs a low loading of an air stable commercially available palladium source associated to an inexpensive base.</dc:description>

In the course of the second catalytic cycle, in the presence of heteroarenes having a free C3-position, a partial Pd 1,4-migration occurred giving rise to aryl-substituted biheteroarenes such as 2'-aryl-2,3'-bithiophenes as well as the expected 1,2-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzenes.  The best selectivities in favor of the formation of 2'-aryl-2,3'-bithiophenes were obtained with electron-rich 1,2-dihalobenzenes. A wide variety of thiophene derivatives bearing useful functions such as formyl, acetyl, cyclopropylmethanone, 2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane, ester, nitrile or chloro was tolerated allowing to prepare poly-functionalized 2'-aryl-2,3'-bithiophenes.  Moreover, this one pot preparation of 2'-aryl-2,3'-bithiophenes employs a low loading of an air stable commercially available palladium source associated to an inexpensive base.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Catalysts generated by combinations of Pd(TFA)2 and pyridine&#8208;hydrazone ligands have been applied to 1,2 addition of arylboronic acids to aliphatic N&#8208;carbamoyl (Cbz) hydrazones, affording protected &#945;&#8208;aryl monoalkylhydrazines with high enantioselectivities (37&#8208;99% ee). Subsequent removal of the benzyloxy carbonyl protecting group provides a direct entry to free monosubstituted hydrazines, key building blocks for the synthesis of appealing 1,2&#8208;diaza&#8208;heterocycles, aminoacid derived hydrazides and other pharmacophores thereof.

         <title>Chichibabin&#8208;Type Phosphonylation of 2&#8208;(Hetero)aryl Pyridines: Selective Synthesis of 4&#8208;Phosphinoyl Pyridines via an Activated N&#8208;Benzylpyridinium Salt</title>

Abstract
A direct C&#8722;H phosphonylation of pyridine by N&#8208;benzylating activation is reported, which afforded 4&#8208;pyridylphosphine oxides with high regioselectivity, without the employment of metal catalyst or expensive activator. By increasing the electrophilicity of pyridinium with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the N&#8208;benzyl group, the phosphonylation process could be realized at room temperature. Control experiments and NMR investigation confirmed the interaction between DBU and diphenylphosphine oxide which generated the true phosphorus nucleophile. Moreover, DFT calculations offered enough insight into an intermolecular cooperative dehydrogenation&#8208;debenzylation mechanism, which helped to elucidate the origin of C4&#8208;regioselectivity in this metal&#8208;free Chichibabin&#8208;type phosphonylation.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Asymmetric Allylic Amination with Pyridones</title>

Abstract
We report herein a catalytic synthetic method for enantioenriched N&#8208;substituted pyridones. By employing chiral iridium catalyst generated from the Carreira [P/olefin] ligand, intermolecular asymmetric allylic amination of allyl alcohols with pyridones proceeded smoothly with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities (&gt;19:1 N/O, &gt;19:1 b/l and &#8805;89% ee). The reaction was a kinetic resolution process under mild conditions and displayed a broad substrate scope for both pyridones and allylic alcohols. The potential of this method was demonstrated by a gram&#8208;scale reaction with only 0.6&#8197;mol% catalyst loading and diverse transformations of the amination products to useful skeletons.

Abstract
An electrochemical decarboxylative aminomethylation reaction of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines with various N&#8208;substituted glycines in acetonitrile at room temperature has been described. The reaction could be conducted under light&#8208;free, catalyst&#8208;free, oxidant&#8208;free, and air conditions, affording the C3&#8208;aminomethylated imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines in good to high yields. Remarkably, N&#8208;aryl, N,N&#8208;dialkyl, and N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;aryl glycines are all well&#8208;tolerated in this easily handled protocol, which further expands the chemical space of bioactive imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives.

         <title>4&#8208;(Dimethylamino)Pyridinium Azide in Protic Ionic Liquid Media as a Stable Equivalent of Hydrazoic Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
We report a procedure for the multigram synthesis of 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridinium azide, a stable, non&#8208;explosive, low&#8208;hygroscopic source of azide ion soluble in both protic and aprotic organic solvents. In protic ionic liquid media this reagent was shown to serve as a safer equivalent of toxic and unstable hydrazoic acid. The synthetic utility of this system was demonstrated using donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane ring opening as a model process. General procedures furnishing a variety of dialkyl (2&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;arylethyl)malonates or 4&#8208;azido&#8208;4&#8208;arylbutyrates, depending on the protic ionic liquid applied, were elaborated. The conversion times for studied donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes were established providing the relative reactivity sequence. The application of 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridinium azide for a conventional nucleophilic substitution, oxirane ring opening, (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition to (thio)cyano group as well as their combinations realized as telescopic synthesis was also demonstrated.

Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free aminocyanation of aryl alkynes has been achieved using indium tribromide, InBr3 or B(C6F5)3 as a Lewis acid. This aminocyanation protocol features with non&#8208;toxic cyanide source, a good substrate scope and potentially valuable aminocyanation products. Mechanistic studies reveal the complex formation between Lewis acid and alkyne to produce in&#8197;situ alkyne nitrile as a key intermediate. Further hydroamination of alkyne nitrile with arylamines affords the E&#8208;selective (E:Z=70:30 to 90:10) &#946;&#8208;aminoacrylonitrile derivatives.

         <title>Asymmetric Metal&#8208;Templated Route to Amino Acids with 3&#8208;Spiropyrrolidine Oxindole Core via a 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Addition of Azomethine Ylides to a Chiral Dehydroalanine Ni(II) Complex</title>

Abstract
We herein developed a protocol for the asymmetric synthesis of artificial AAs featuring a 3&#8208;spiropyrrolidine oxindole skeletal with continuous tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenters by a 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction of in&#8197;situ generated azomethine ylides with a chiral dehydroalanine Ni(II) complex. A three&#8208;component reaction of the Ni(II) complex with various isatins and AAs in green solvent (ethanol) provided series of diastereomeric complexes with high dr (&gt;20:1) in 40&#8211;86% yields. The formation of different regioisomers in the case of sarcosine and proline was explained using quantum chemical calculation. The acidic decomposition of the obtained Ni(II) complexes led to the target unnatural complex AAs with a 3&#8208;spiropyrrolidine oxindole core. The chiral auxiliary ligand was recovered after decomposition and reused for the synthesis of the starting dehydroalanine complex&#8208;substrate.

         <title>Insight into the Stereocontrol of DNA Polymerase&#8208;Catalysed Reaction by Chiral Cobalt Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Enantiomers of chiral substances typically have distinct biological activities, thus, the explorations of biochemical processes at the enantiomeric level has very high significance. This study investigated DNA polymerase&#8211;catalyzed reaction modulated by various types of chiral cobalt complexes. The experimental data showed that polymerase reactions were inhibited or accelerated in the presence of K[Co(edta)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O or [Co(en)3]I3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O. More importantly, the stereocontrol of bioreactivity was found to be different for the enantiomers, which was reflected in their ability to bind to the polymerase reaction system. The docking simulation illustrated that the acceleration or inhibition of polymerase reaction could be correlated with diverse electrostatic energy induced by the attached metal chelates, whereas the different stereocontrol of bioreactivity for the enantiomers was attributed to a discrepancy of Van der Waals interactions between the enantiomer and polymerase catalytic sites.

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Enantioselective Halohydrin Dehalogenases &#8211; Group&#8197;B</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) possess an unnatural activity of introducing functionalities such as N3, CN, NO2 etc., into a molecule through the ring&#8208;opening reaction of epoxides. The enantioselectivity of HHDHs is substrate&#8208;dependent and not always high enough for synthetic applications. B&#8208;group of HHDHs has been neglected in the past, due to observed low enantioselectivity based on performance on a relatively limited number of substrates. Extensive screening of substrates on HheB2 from Mycobacterium sp. GP1 and HheB from Corynebacterium sp. N&#8208;1074 was performed. Several highly enantioselective reactions were discovered (E&gt;200), with HheB showing higher enantioselectivity and activity toward larger panel of substrates compared to HheB2. Enzymes HheB and HheB2 are highly homologous; they differ by only 4 residues. By using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, residues 120 and 125 were found to be responsible for higher enantioselectivity of HheB compared to HheB2. Computational analysis supported experiments and provided evidence that kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of reactions within HheB enzymes are crucial in determining the observed enantioselectivities. Due to remarkable activity and enantioselectivity, B&#8208;group HHDHs emerged as a catalyst of choice for the synthesis of bulky tertiary alcohols, as shown in this work.

Abstract
A synthetic strategy for the construction of 2,2&#8208;disubstituted indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones from 2&#8208;alkynylnitroarenes and ketones has been described. The corresponding indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivatives were afforded in moderate to excellent product yields by using mild conditions. After a Wittig&#8208;like process, the key intermediates 3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones were generated from 2&#8208;alkynylnitroarenes, which could be further transformed to the desired products through a Mannich addition.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Carbazoles by Perester</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An intramolecular C&#8722;H amination for the synthesis of carbazoles with a Pd(II)/TBPB system has been developed. This catalytic amination process forms the carbazole products in good to excellent yields. It is noteworthy that this method implied the advantages of the catalytic mode involving perester with transition metal catalyst in the activation of inert C&#8722;H bonds. In addition, the transformation performs well using water as solvent.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated C&#8208;2 Functionalization and Deoxygenative Strategies in Heterocyclic N&#8208;Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Heterocyclic N&#8208;oxides are prevalent in numerous natural products with broad applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, material sciences, and asymmetric synthesis. Owing to their profound biological and physiological activity and unique chemical reactivity, the importance of these compounds has stimulated substantial interest among organic synthetic chemists. More importantly, C&#8208;2 functionalization of heterocyclic N&#8208;oxides, including pyridine&#8208;, isoquinoline&#8208;, pyrazine&#8208;, quinoxaline&#8208;, and quinoline N&#8208;oxides, is among the most important strategies for heterocyclic functionalization. Besides, deoxygenation of heterocyclic N&#8208;oxides has also emerged as a reaction of significance in organic chemistry. In the past decade, visible light photoredox catalyzed C&#8208;2 functionalization and deoxygenation of these heterocyclic N&#8208;oxides have drawn substantial attention owing to their mild reaction conditions. This review has been categorized based on visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated nondeoxygenative C&#8208;2 functionalization (alkylation, fluoroalkylation, arylation, acylation, and amination), deoxygenative C&#8208;2 functionalization (sulfonylation, alkynylation, alkylation, and acylation), and deoxygenation (without C&#8722;H functionalization) of heterocyclic N&#8208;oxides. For most part of the work, the substrate scope, limitation, and mechanism of the reactions have been discussed.

         <title>Synthesis of Saturated N&#8208;Heterocycles via a Catalytic Hydrogenation Cascade</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Saturated N&#8208;heterocycles are prominent motifs found in various natural products and pharmaceuticals. Despite the increasing interest in this class of compounds, the synthesis of saturated bicyclic azacycles requires tedious multi&#8208;step syntheses. Herein, we present a one&#8208;pot protocol for the synthesis of octahydroindoles, decahydroquinolines, and octahydroindolizines through a cascade reaction.

         <title>Synthesis of (Hetero)Aroyl Fluorides via a Mild Amides C&#8722;N Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Amides, such as N&#8208;benzoylsaccharin, N,N&#8208;diBocbenzamide, and N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;N&#8208;tosylbenzamides reacted with Et3N&#8901;3HF to provide the corresponding acyl fluorides in good yields. The reaction was conducted under environmentally friendly conditions using i&#8208;PrOAc as the solvent. Moreover, the reaction was performed at room temperature and did not require a transition&#8208;metal catalyst or additives. The methodology showed functional group tolerance toward amines, alkoxy, halides, ketones, esters, and aldehydes.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Aldol Reaction of Isocyanoacetic Acid Derivatives Enabled by Cooperative Participation of Classical and Nonclassical Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The silver&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric aldol reaction of isocyanoacetic acid derivatives with aldehydes has been developed by employing a chiral prolinol&#8208;phosphine as a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating P,N,O ligand. DFT calculations indicated that the reaction proceeds in a stepwise manner, involving C&#8722;C bond forming carbonyl addition and subsequent enantioselectivity&#8208;determining oxazoline ring formation. An O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O/sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O two&#8208;point hydrogen bond donated by the prolinol moiety of the ligand activates the aldehyde in the C&#8722;C bond formation step and facilitates the subsequent cyclization under stereocontrol by the catalyst. The calculations further suggest that additional nonclassical C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonds as well as London dispersion interactions may also participate synergistically in the stereocontrol.

         <title>Low&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Driven Electrochemical Aerobic Oxygenation with Flavin Catalysis: Chemoselective Synthesis of Sulfoxides from Sulfides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The chemoselective electrochemical oxygenation of sulfides to sulfoxides is performed using a biomimetic flavin catalyst that enables the activation of molecular oxygen under a low cathode potential. Diverse functional groups, including alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, cyclopropane, carboxylic acids, pyridine, alkenes, and alkynes, are well tolerated under low&#8208;voltage electrolytic conditions.

         <title>Aryl&#8208;Alcohol&#8208;Oxidase&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Piperonal and Other Valuable Aldehydes</title>

Abstract
The use of fungal aryl&#8208;alcohol oxidases in biocatalysis is still modest, despite their advantageous capability to produce valuable aldehydes via oxidation of the respective alcohols without the need for costly external cofactors. For biocatalytic application, enzyme stability in the presence of organic solvents used for substrate solubilization has to be investigated, and process limitations due to low oxygen supply and the accumulation of the by&#8208;product H2O2 must be addressed. In this study, we showed that the aryl&#8208;alcohol oxidase PeAAO2 from Pleurotus eryngii P34 remained active and stable in the presence of up to 30% (v/v) various organic solvents and up to 500&#8197;mM H2O2. The potential of this biocatalyst was explored based on conversion of piperonyl alcohol to the fragrance compound piperonal. After reaction optimization, product titers of up to 245&#8197;mM were achieved within 3&#8197;h. Addition of catalase was imperative to re&#8208;introduce O2 as co&#8208;substrate into the reaction, thereby diminishing oxygen limitation. On a preparative scale, space&#8208;time&#8208;yield of 9.5&#8197;g/l/h was achieved and 244.6&#8197;mg piperonal (85% yield) with &gt;99% purity were isolated via simple crystallization from n&#8208;hexane extract. Under optimized reaction conditions four other substrates, cumic alcohol, 2&#8208;thiophenemethanol, trans,trans&#8208;2,4&#8208;heptadienol and trans&#8208;2&#8208;cis&#8208;6&#8208;nonadienol, at concentrations of up to 300&#8197;mM were converted to the corresponding aldehydes within 20&#8197;h. Our results demonstrate that PeAAO2 is a versatile and promising biocatalyst for the production of valuable aldehydes.

         <title>Suzuki Coupling of Activated Aryltriazenes for Practical Synthesis of Biaryls from Anilines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Aryltriazenes can hardly take part in productive organic transformations unless stoichiometric Br&#246;nsted or Lewis acid activators are used. We report here for the first time a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki coupling of aryltriazenes activated by a sulfonyl group at N3 atom under the common basic conditions. Benefiting from elimination of stoichiometric acid activators, activated aryltriazenes could efficiently couple with arylboronic acids to afford diaryls in modest to excellent yields by using a simple catalyst at low loading, 0.3&#8197;mol% Pd(PPh3)2Cl2. Scope and limitation of the coupling are demonstrated with 26 examples.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photoredox Catalyzed Decarboxylative Alkylation of Vinylcyclopropanes</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a visible&#8208;light mediated photoredox catalyzed decarboxylative alkylation of vinylcyclopropanes. The reaction was carried out with an Ir&#8208;based photocatalyst and Cs2CO3 as a base. The desired functionalized long&#8208;chained alkylated derivatives were obtained in 48&#8211;93% yields under mild reaction conditions without any external metal co&#8208;catalysts, oxidants, or additives. Various alkyl carboxylic acids and amino acid derivatives are used as alkylating reagents to synthesize the &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated diesters, and unnatural homo&#8208;allylic amino acid derivatives with excellent functional groups tolerance. The utility of this method was showcased by performing a gram&#8208;scale synthesis. A mechanism is proposed based on control experiments and quenching studies.

Abstract
We have developed a method for constructing tricyclic [1,2&#8208;a]indoles via nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular imine&#8208;alkene coupling reactions. This method enables syntheses of 6&#8208;5&#8208;5 and 6&#8208;5&#8208;6 tricyclic [1,2&#8208;a]indoles. The use of NIXantphos or DPPPent as a ligand and 4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid as a co&#8208;catalyst is crucial for the reaction. The synthetic utility of the method was demonstrated by converting the product into useful indole amines.

         <title>Stereocomplementary Synthesis of a Key Intermediate for Tofacitinib via Enzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution&#8208;Reductive Amination</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Tofacitinib is an oral protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. Its efficient production remains a challenge due to the two consecutive stereogenic centers associated to the piperidine ring. In this study, an enzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;asymmetric reductive amination was developed to prepare enantiomerically complementary cis&#8208;1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;N,4&#8208; dimethylpiperidin&#8208;3&#8208;amine and its analogues. Two enantiocomplementary imine reductases (IREDs) were identified for the synthesis of (3R,4R)&#8208; and (3S,4S)&#8208;1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;N,4&#8208;dimethylpiperidin&#8208;3&#8208;amine in high isolated yields (83% and 91%) with excellent stereoselectivity (97% and &gt;99% ee values) and diastereoselectivity (&gt;99:1 dr), providing a green methodology for the production of the key intermediate of tofacitinib.

Abstract
Dirhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular insertion of aryldiazoacetates into an unactivated primary C&#8722;H bond was described in this study. The insertion reaction of aryldiazoacetates with ortho&#8208;isopropyl or ortho&#8208;ethyl groups in the presence of a catalytic amount of dirhodium(II) tetrakis(triphenylacetate), Rh2(tpa)4, at room temperature proceeded site&#8208;selectively to afford 2&#8208;unsubstituted indane&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylates in 75%&#8211;96% yields. In the case of o&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;substituted aryldiazoacetates, cis&#8208;isomers were obtained as major products. Furthermore, a chemoselective C&#8722;H insertion reaction of aryldiazoacetate bearing 1&#8208;oxyethyl&#8208;substituent at the ortho position was achieved by using a bulky and electron&#8208;deficient pivaloyl group as the protecting group of a highly active oxygen atom. The present reaction provided a direct route to 2&#8208;unsubstituted indanes.

         <title>Ylide&#8208;Functionalized Diisopropyl Phosphine (prYPhos): A Ligand for Selective Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Couplings of Aryl Chlorides</title>

Abstract
The ylide&#8208;functionalized diisopropyl phosphine (prYPhos) promotes Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings of aryl chlorides and bromides with arylboronic acids. Using Pd2(dba)3/prYPhos as the catalyst and K2CO3 as the base, various (hetero)biaryls were synthesized in 45&#8211;98% yields at mild reaction conditions, tolerating sensitive functional groups and steric hindrance. The electron rich, sterically demanding ligand induces a high selectivity for halides versus triflate. Chloroaryl triflates were selectively coupled at the chloride, leaving inherently more reactive triflate groups in place.

Abstract
A ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of allenoates with arylamines has been developed. This strategy provides an approach to synthesize E&#8208;allylic amines in good yields with high atom&#8208;economy and high levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and E&#8208;selectivities with a broad substrate scope.

         <title>Strategic Applications of the &#946;&#8208;Silicon Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Organosilicon reagents are highly versatile and privileged scaffolds in modern synthetic chemistry, largely due to the range of transformations the groups are amenable to. The &#946;&#8208;Silicon effect is one of the fundamental phenomena underpinning the inherent reactivity of organosilicon reagents, allowing unsaturated organosilanes to undergo a range of electrophilic substitutions with a variety of nucleophiles. The application of the &#946;&#8208;Silicon effect in a range of organic transformations is reviewed with the discussion divided up based on the class of silane. The reactivity of these compounds towards carbon, heteroatom and metallic electrophiles is discussed from classical applications such as the Sakurai allylation to contemporary applications such as cross&#8208;coupling chemistry. In addition, examples of these transformations in the context of methodology development and natural product synthesis are provided.

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined Ni&#8722;SNS Complex Catalysed Borrowing Hydrogenative &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Ketones and Dehydrogenative Synthesis of Quinolines</title>

Abstract
The &#8220;borrowing hydrogen&#8221; (BH) method for C&#8208;alkylation reactions using alcohol as alkylating agents is an important synthetic transformation. In this respect, designing cheap and bench stable earth abundant metal catalyst for borrowing hydrogen transformation is a key challenge to be witnessed. Herein we have presented a synthesis of non&#8208;phosphine, easily accessible and bench stable SNS&#8722;Ni complexes. The Ni&#8208;catalyst was successfully applied for the C&#8208;alkylation of ketone enolates to &#945;&#8208;alkylated ketones. Primary alcohol with different functional groups and various heteroaromatic alcohols are well tolerated. The present catalyst system was efficiently applied to gram scale synthesis and also the green chemistry metrics of the reaction were calculated. The present protocol was also extended successfully for the synthesis of biologically important quinoline moieties. Finally, various control experiments and deuterium labelled experiments suggest that the reaction proceeds via borrowing hydrogen pathway.
