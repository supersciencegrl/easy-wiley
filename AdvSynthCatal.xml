         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric 1,6&#8208;Addition of Borylalkene&#8208;derived Nucleophiles to para&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the catalytic 1,6&#8208;addition of chiral alkyl copper nucleophiles, in&#8208;situ generated from borylalkenes and a copper&#8208;hydride catalyst under mild conditions. Chemo&#8208; and stereoselective control was crucial in this reductive coupling process of borylalkenes and para&#8208;quinone methides, sequentially forming adjacent stereogenic centers with good diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Through the multicomponent and catalytic tandem reactions, asymmetric 1,6&#8208;adducts of p&#8208;quinone methides were efficiently synthesized.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Functionalization of Dihydroquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;ones with Pyrazolones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light photoredox functionalization of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;ones with pyrazolones using an inexpensive organophotoredox catalyst is described. The reaction uses 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenedione as photocatalyst, a very simple and cheap photocatalyst, a HP single Blue LED (455 nm) as visible&#8208;light source and oxygen from air as terminal oxidant, obtaining the corresponding acetylated pyrazoles with good yields. The reaction can be extended to other nitrogen heterocycles such as 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles with good results</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Enhanced C&#8208;H Amination of Cyclic Ethers with Iminoiodinanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A two&#8208;step protocol allowing the C&#8208;H amination of cyclic ethers with iminoiodinanes, followed by the reduction of the resulting intermediate has been developed for the preparation of amino alcohols. The initial C&#8208;H functionalization is accelerated by visible light, improving the reactivity compared to the thermal process performed in the dark. The effect of different substituents on the photochemical reactivity of iminoiodinanes has been studied both experimentally and computationally. Photophysical measurements and DFT calculations were performed to better understand the observed reactivities and corroborate the proposed mechanistic proposal.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Structurally Diverse (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;Lactams via an Engineered Amine Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optically pure lactams have a wide diversity of applications, one of which is serving as important intermediates in the synthesis of agricultural bioactive compounds or pharmaceuticals. Efficient stereoselective synthesis of chiral lactams with low&#8208;cost amine donors under mild conditions is desired for manufacturing of these important chemicals. Herein, a two&#8208;step chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy has been designed to produce (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;lactams by engineering a natural amine dehydrogenase from Thermoanaerobacter thermohydrosulfuricus (TtherAmDH). TtherAmDH was subjected to eight cycles of directed evolution to enhance its reductive amination activity toward keto acid substrates. The variants showed improved specific activity toward 6 tested substrates and gave high stereoselectivities of up to 99% in the asymmetric synthesis of &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208; lactams. In particular, TtherAmDHV8 showed a 237&#8208;fold higher specific activity toward the model substrate levulinic acid and gave (S)&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone in 99% ee with a space&#8208;time yield of 75.3 g L&#8722;1 d&#8722;1. These results indicate that the engineered amine dehydrogenase TtherAmDH can serve as an efficient biocatalyst for the manufacture of highly valued chiral lactams.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Bromotrimethylsilane (TMSBr) promoted benzannulation of o&#8208;alkynylbenzaldehydes and alkynes to yield 1&#8208;naphthyl aryl ketones is reported. The reaction condition is mild, free of metal and pretreatment/protection of the substrates. We found that aryl propargyl alcohols were very effective substrates for this reaction, comparing with other alkynes. Studies on the reaction scope, monitoring the reaction progress by 1H NMR and theoretical calculations suggest that isochromenylium (benzopyrilium) ion is the key reaction intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>From Peripheral Stereogenic Center to Axial Chirality: Synthesis of 3&#8208;Arylthiophene Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A practical synthesis of axially chiral biaryls via chirality transfer from peripheral stereogenic carbon centers was reported. Different from the traditional aromatization process of a non&#8208;aromatic structure with ipso stereogenic centers, this method is based on a Pd&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8208;carbon bond cleavage/ring&#8208;opening reaction of optically active 8H&#8208;indenothiophen&#8208;8&#8208;ols with an achiral ligand, enabling synthesis of highly functionalized 3&#8208;arylthiophene atropisomers in high enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically Induced Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C(sp2)&#8208;H Trifluoromethylation and Arylsulfonylation of Enamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we disclosed an electrochemically induced method for the regio&#8208; and stereoselective (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C(sp2)&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of enamides by employing readily available and inexpensive Langlois&#8217; reagent (CF3SO2Na). Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate the involvement of free radicals in the process. The exogenous oxidant&#8208;free reaction proceeds in an undivided electrochemical cell under mild conditions and allows for the accomplishment of the trifluoromethylation products with exclusive E&#8208;selective control. The methodology is featured by catalyst&#8208;free, simple setup, and broad substrate scopes of enamides with good functional group tolerance. Using ArSO2Na as the coupling partner, the corresponding (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C(sp2)&#8208;H arylsulfonylated enamides products are obtained under standard reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A chemo&#8208; and enantioselective protocol for the N&#8208;alkylation of indoles with imines was developed. This process was catalyzed by a BINOL&#8208;derived phosphoric acid catalyst to give the corresponding acyclic aminals of indoles in 46&#8208;99% yields with 70&#8208;98% ee. The application of this method for the &#8220;late&#8208;stage&#8221;  functionalization of a bioactive compound was performed with high efficency.

         <title>Pincer&#8208;Ruthenium Catalyzed Oxygen Mediated Dehydrative Etherification of Alcohols and Ortho&#8208;Alkylation of Phenols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
In the current report, a dehydration strategy has been formulated for the selective etherification of secondary alcohols catalyzed by NNN pincer&#8208;ruthenium(II) carbonyl complexes based on bis(imino)pyridine ligands in the presence of molecular oxygen under solvent&#8208;free and base&#8208;free conditions at 140&#8201;&#176;C. Under these conditions, very high yields (up to 92%, ca. 6133 TON) of the corresponding ethers are obtained at a very low catalyst loading (ca. 0.015&#8197;mol%). Mechanistic studies provide key evidence for the various events that occur during the catalytic cycle. While iodometric titration gives quantitative proof for the liberation of hydrogen peroxide in catalytic amounts and hence confirms the role of oxygen as a co&#8208;catalyst, DFT, HRMS, IR and 13C&#8197;NMR analysis are indicative of the non&#8208;labile nature of the ancillary CO ligand. On the other hand, DFT, NMR and HRMS studies reveal the hemi&#8208;labile nature of the pincer&#8208;ligand in the presence of oxygen. EPR analysis provide conclusive evidence for generation of Ru(III) species via single electron transfer (SET) from O2. Apparently the Ru(III) species (Ph2NN)RuCl2(CO)(OH) is the resting&#8208;state of the etherification reaction and several of its derivatives have been detected by HRMS analysis. The pincer&#8208;ruthenium catalyzed etherification of 1&#8208;phenyl ethanol has been successfully extended not only to various aromatic secondary alcohols but also to the cross&#8208;etherification and/or o&#8208;alkylation of 1&#8208;phenyl ethanols with a variety of phenols. Readily available oxygen and tiny amounts (0.015&#8197;mol%) of pincer&#8208;Ru catalyst are the only requirement for this atom&#8208;economical and environmentally benign dehydrative etherification reaction which apparently has not been reported thus far.

         <title>Construction of Cyclopenta[b]naphthalenol Frameworks by Weinreb Amide&#8208;Directed Umpolung Ring Opening of Methylenecyclopropanes</title>

Abstract
A cascade cyclization from Weinreb amide&#8208;tethered methylenecyclopropanes and alkynes has been disclosed in this paper, which extends the umpolung ring opening of methylenecyclopropanes, giving a synthetic approach for the construction of polycyclic cyclopenta[b]naphthalenol framework. In the protocol, four carbon&#8208;carbon bonds and two carbocycles are formed without the use of transition metals, providing a tool for constructing the structure&#8208;related polycyclic compounds.

Abstract
A variety of functionalized 3&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyaryl)indazoles and N&#8208;(tetrahydrofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyaryl)indazoles were prepared in moderate to good yields through a transition metal&#8208;free radical O&#8208;arylation and sequential [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement cascade strategy from N&#8208;hydroxyindazoles and diaryliodonium salts. The equivalents of diaryliodonium salts controlled the formation of the product structures. Mechanistic studies revealed that the O&#8208;arylation and N&#8722;O bond cleavage via [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement involved an intermolecular radical process. The reaction tolerated various sensitive functional groups, such as halides, ester, and aldehyde groups.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Coupling of Potassium Vinyltrifluoroborate with Arenes: A Direct Access to Functionalized Styrene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Herein, we report a Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed direct alkenylation of arenes with readily available vinyltrifluoroborate to direct access to functionalized styrenes. This method tolerates a wide range of functional groups in 33&#8197;examples with excellent site&#8208; and regioselectivity under mild conditions. The synthetic utility was demonstrated through the further transformation of thus&#8208;obtained functionalized styrenes. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that the reaction probably proceeds through an Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation/Suzuki coupling pathway.

Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction followed by dual annulation has been achieved for the synthesis of various triazolo/pyrrolo fused benzofuro&#8208;quinolines from readily available starting materials. The developed protocol proceeds through palladium&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling, benzannulation followed by C&#8722;H activation triggered second annulation reaction cascades in a single pot. In particular, the polycyclic compound formed by this method consists of three different heterocyclic structures: benzofuran, quinoline, and triazole/pyrrole. The method provides simple access to obtain a range of fused benzofurotriazalo/pyrrolo&#8208;quinolines in good to moderate yields.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Tricycle&#8208;Fused Dispirooxindoles via Organocatalyzed Three&#8208;Component Cascade Reactions of 2&#8208;Pyrones and Trifluoroethylisatin Ketimines</title>

Abstract
An asymmetric synthesis of a series of tricycle&#8208;fused dispirooxindoles frameworks assembled in different rings was disclosed via multicomponent cascade 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyrones and trifluoroethylisatin ketimines under the catalysis of hydroquinine or (DHQD)2PHAL with 61&#8594;99%&#8197;ee and &gt;19:1&#8197;dr. Meanwhile, these potentially biologically important dispirooxindoles fused pyrrolidinyl/tetrahydropyranone/pyrrolidinyl frame&#8208;works bear eight contiguous stereocenters and functionalized pharmacophores which could further transfer to linaer dispirooxindoles and spirooxindoles bearing epoxyethyl moiety with retentive enantioselectivity.

         <title>An Update on Phosphine&#8208;Imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;imine Iridium(I) Catalysts for Hydrogen Isotope Exchange</title>

Exposure of 2b to one atmosphere of dihydrogen gas afforded the diiridium tetrahydride [(1)2Ir2H4][Al{OC(CF3)3}4]2 (3b). The molecular structures of 2a, 2b, and 3b were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. In the latter complex, the positions of the hydrogen atoms in the Ir2H4 core could be refined freely, which had previously proved impossible for the corresponding complex 3a containing the BArF24 anion. Since 2a is an established catalyst for ortho&#8208;directed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE), the performance of 2a and 2b in deuterium labelling reactions was compared for various substrates, including phenylacetic acid derivates and nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Organocatalyzed Functionalization of Tetramic and Tetronic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Organocatalyzed Michael addition of N&#8208;substituted tetramic acids to nitroalkene acceptors followed by O&#8208;alkylation gave polyfunctionalized tetramic acid (31 examples, 59&#8211;94% ee). The enantioselectivity of the product was influenced by the N&#8208;substituent of the substrate. Quantum chemical methods provided the mechanistic insights of the studied transformation. The preferred reaction pathway follows the model proposed by P&#225;pai et&#8197;al. Single crystal structure confirmed the absolute configuration, which was in line with the ECD measured and calculated structure. Additionally, a comparative study of the alkylation of a selected tetramic and tetronic acid with trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene is disclosed. Follow&#8208;up amidations demonstrated the applicability of this class of compounds for the incorporation into both dipeptide and depsipeptide sequences.

         <title>Gold Catalysis: 2,3&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;Addition to Butadiynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
In the past, numerous impressive methodologies have been developed in homogeneous gold catalysis, typically using alkynes, allenes, or different non&#8208;conjugated diyne systems as starting materials. While there are applications catalyzed by other transition metals, the use of 1,3&#8208;butadiyne derivatives has been largely neglected in gold catalysis. In this work we present an efficient gold&#8208;catalyzed method focusing on the functionalization of this specific type of diynes. The starting materials can be synthesized via simple Glaser Coupling, starting from cheap, highly variable, terminal alkynes. These homocoupling products, which are often observed as undesirable side&#8208;products in Sonogashira reactions, can be converted into versatile 1,3&#8208;butadiene derivatives in alcohol as a solvent and nucleophile under mild conditions. The possible field of application of the 1,3&#8208;butadiene derivatives known from the literature is very broad and ranges from a use as transistor or OLED material to a use as an enzyme inhibitor. The approach presented here offers an attractive and highly effective way to versatile functionalized 1,3&#8208;butadiene derivatives.

In this work we present an efficient gold-catalyzed method focusing on the functionalization of this specific type of diynes. The starting materials can be synthesized via simple Glaser Coupling, starting from cheap, highly variable, terminal alkynes. These homocoupling products, which are often observed as undesirable side-products in Sonogashira reactions, can be converted into versatile 1,3-butadiene derivatives in alcohol as a solvent and nucleophile under mild conditions. The possible field of application of the 1,3-butadiene derivatives known from the literature is very broad and ranges from a use as transistor or OLED material to a use as an enzyme inhibitor. The approach presented here offers an attractive and highly effective way to versatile functionalized 1,3-butadiene derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Merging Gold(I) Catalysis with Amine Transaminases in Cascade Catalysis: Chemoenzymatic Transformation of Propargylic Alcohols into Enantioenriched Allylic Amines</title>

Abstract
The compatibility between gold(I) catalysts and amine transaminases has been explored to transform racemic propargylic alcohols into enantioenriched allylic amines in a straightforward and selective manner. The synthetic approach consists of a gold(I)&#8208;catalysed Meyer&#8208;Schuster rearrangement of a series of 2&#8208;arylpent&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;2&#8208;ols and a subsequent stereoselective enzyme&#8208;catalysed transamination of the resulting &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated prochiral ketones. The design of cascade processes involving sequential or concurrent approaches has been studied in our search for ideal reaction conditions to produce the desired amines. Thus, the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complex [1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene]&#8208;[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)&#8208;imide]gold(I) ([Au(IPr)(NTf2)] (A) in aqueous medium was found to be an ideal catalyst, while selective, made&#8208;in&#8208;house and commercial amine transaminases permitted the asymmetric synthesis of both (E)&#8208;4&#8208;arylpent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;amine enantiomers in good isolated yields (53&#8211;84%) and excellent stereoselectivities (97 to &gt;99% enantiomeric excess).

&lt;p&gt;The compatibility between gold(I) catalysts and amine transaminases has been explored to transform racemic propargylic alcohols into enantioenriched allylic amines in a straightforward and selective manner. The synthetic approach consists of a gold(I)-catalysed Meyer-Schuster rearrangement of a series of 2-arylpent-3-yn-2-ols and a subsequent stereoselective enzyme-catalysed transamination of the resulting &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated prochiral ketones. The design of cascade processes involving sequential or concurrent approaches has been studied in our search for ideal reaction conditions to produce the desired amines. Thus, the N-heterocyclic carbene complex [1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]-[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-imide]gold(I) ([Au(IPr)(NTf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;) in aqueous medium was found to be an ideal catalyst, while selective, made-in-house and commercial amine transaminases permitted the asymmetric synthesis of both (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-4-arylpent-3-en-2-amine enantiomers in good isolated yields (53&#8211;84%) and excellent stereoselectivities (97 to &amp;gt;99% enantiomeric excess).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
The combination of organolithium chemistry with gold catalysis has enabled the development of a synthetic strategy for accessing polysubstituted indoles and carbazoles from readily available starting materials. This method is based on a &#8220;back&#8208;to&#8208;front&#8221; approach from ketopyrroles, generated by intramolecular carbolithiation of N,N&#8208;bis&#8208;(2&#8208;lithioallyl)amines that evolve into 3,4&#8208;bis(lithiomethyl)dihydropyrrole intermediates capable of reacting with carboxylic esters and Weinreb amides. These ketopyrroles have demonstrated to be excellent precursors of mono or bis(alkynols)pyrroles that, under gold&#8208;catalysis, experience a benzannulation reaction providing access to regioselectively substituted indoles or carbazoles.

         <title>Recent Progress of Electron&#8208;Withdrawing&#8208;Group&#8208;Tethered Arenes Involved Asymmetric Nucleophilic Aromatic Functionalizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWG) have emerged as a powerful tool for the activation of various arenes to promote nucleophilic dearomative additions for the construction of complicated chiral cyclic structures under asymmetric catalytic systems. Nitro&#8208;indoles, nitro&#8208;benzofurans/benzothiophenes, and related nitro&#8208;heteroarenes are widely applied in the reaction with various nucleophiles to construct various enantioenriched polycyclic skeletons via the asymmetric dearomatization process. Meanwhile, the electron&#8208;deficient azo&#8208;group and nitroso&#8208;group are an alternative powerful tool for the activation of arenes, which enable formal nucleophilic aromatic arylations with various electrophilic aromatics to construct novel chiral biaryl atropisomers. Besides, azo&#8208;naphthanenes are served as dipolar surrogates in the reaction with nucleophilic dipolarophiles to proceed asymmetric cycloadditions to construct chiral polycyclic skeletons. The EWG&#8208;tethered arene has proven to be a versatile protocol for the construction of structurally diversified chiral backbones. This review summarizes the latest progress of the EWG&#8208;tethered arenes involved asymmetric transformations under organo&#8208; or transition metal catalysis.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral, Fused Tricyclic Molecules by Sequential Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions of Simple Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A set of complex tricyclic compounds containing several functional groups and multiple stereogenic centers has been prepared in only two steps with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The synthesis takes advantage of the highly versatile and enantioselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution of simple cyclic allylic acetates or carbonates to form chiral 1,6&#8208;, 1,7&#8208; and 1,8&#8208;enynes, which are then diastereoselectively transformed to the corresponding cyclopentenone&#8208; and cyclobutene&#8208;based tricyclic compounds.

         <title>Zincate&#8208;Mediated Remote Functionalisation of p&#8208;Iodobenzyl Derivatives Through Metallotropy in 2&#8208;Methyltetrahydrofuran as Key Solvent.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates the 1,5&#8208;rearrangement of lithium benzyl(dibutyl)zincate derived from p&#8208;iodobenzyl mesylate. This key elementary step is integral to a complex reaction sequence allowing the remote functionalisation of such a derivative with a wide range of aldehydes (see fruits in the tree). As a remote leaving group (here OMs) is required to trigger the chemical event, the release of LiOMs can be seen as a driving force (LiOMs is thus the driver of the boat). Details can be found in the Research Article by Alexandre Vasseur and co&#8208;workers (A. Pierret, C. Denhez, P. C. Gros, A. Vasseur, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2022, 364, xxxx&#8211;xxxx; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202200475)

     alt="Zincate-Mediated Remote Functionalisation of p-Iodobenzyl Derivatives Through Metallotropy in 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran as Key Solvent."/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front cover picture illustrates the 1,5-rearrangement of lithium benzyl(dibutyl)zincate derived from &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-iodobenzyl mesylate. This key elementary step is integral to a complex reaction sequence allowing the remote functionalisation of such a derivative with a wide range of aldehydes (see fruits in the tree). As a remote leaving group (here OMs) is required to trigger the chemical event, the release of LiOMs can be seen as a driving force (LiOMs is thus the driver of the boat). Details can be found in the Research Article by Alexandre Vasseur and co-workers (A. Pierret, C. Denhez, P. C. Gros, A. Vasseur, &lt;i&gt;Adv. Synth. Catal&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;b&gt;2022&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;364&lt;/i&gt;, xxxx&#8211;xxxx; DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adsc.202200475"&gt;10.1002/adsc.202200475&lt;/a&gt;)

         <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates the Strecker reaction of formaldehyde, primary amines and TMSCN. HCOOH and TBAF were used as cocatalysts and the TMSCN was used to work as both the cyanide source and protecting reagent. As a result, the side reactions were suppressed efficiently and a broad range of aromatic and aliphatic amines were efficiently monocyanomethylated. This work is dedicated to Shenyang University of Chemical Technology on the occasion of its 70th anniversary. Details can be found in the Communication by Jin, Ryu, Zhang and co&#8208;workers. (Y. Liu, J. Zhang, J. Zhang, H. Pei, X. Liu, H. Jin, D. H. Ryu, L. Zhang, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2023, 365, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202200767)

         <dc:description>Abstract. K3PO4&#8208;mediated cycloannulation of (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;iodovinyl sulfones with ortho&#8208;hydroxy chalcones/ortho&#8208;hydroxy cinnamates has been realized to access 2,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted&#8208;4H&#8208;benzopyran derivatives. A metal&#8208;free tandem oxa&#8208;Michael addition and cycloannulation allows the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of the corresponding 3&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;4H&#8208;benzopyrans in good to high yields. More importantly, one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component reaction between (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;iodovinyl sulfones, 2&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehydes, and phosphonium ylides has been established for the synthesis of 4H&#8208;chromene derivatives in moderate to good yields. Notably, this metal&#8208;free process features a broad substrate scope and easy elaboration into numerous multifaceted chromene products, including bioactive estrone&#8208;derivative. The present protocol is sustainable at the gram scale reactions, and post&#8208;synthetic applications were also demonstrated. A plausible mechanism is also presented on the basis of existing experimental results.</dc:description>

K3PO4-mediated cycloannulation of (E)-&#946;-iodovinyl sulfones with ortho-hydroxy chalcones/ortho-hydroxy cinnamates has been realized to access 2,3,4-trisubstituted-4H-benzopyran derivatives. A metal-free tandem oxa-Michael addition and cycloannulation allows the diversity-oriented synthesis of the corresponding 3-sulfonyl-4H-benzopyrans in good to high yields. More importantly, one-pot three-component reaction between (E)-&#946;-iodovinyl sulfones, 2-hydroxybenzaldehydes, and phosphonium ylides has been established for the synthesis of 4H-chromene derivatives in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Cascade 1,4&#8208;Conjugate Addition/Selective Annulation Strategy for Divergent Synthesis of Polysubstituted Imidazoles and 4&#8208;Alkenylquinazolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free cascade annulation of propagylamines with amidines for divergent synthesis of polysubstituted imidazoles and 4&#8208;alkenylquinazolines has been developed. The reaction is believed to proceed by sequential 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition of amidines to propargylamines, 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig annulation/aromatization to form the polysubstituted imidazoles, and nucleophilic addition/elimination/ aromatization to quinazoline skeleton. In this reaction,  a broad range of electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;neutral, and electron&#8208;deficient propagylamines react well with amidines to give polysubstituted imidazoles and 4&#8208;alkenylquinazolines in 53&#8722;93% yields. Moreover, the utility of this method was showcased by gram&#8208;scale experiments and synthetic transformations of the product.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent advances in catalytic asymmetric syntheses of functionalized heterocycles via halogenation/chalcogenation of carbon&#8208;carbon unsaturated bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halogen (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine) or chalcogen (sulfur, seleno)&#8208;containing heterocycles are widely recognized as key building blocks in many natural products and bioactive targets. Catalytic asymmetric halogenation/chalcogenation of carbon&#8208;carbon unsaturated bonds via onium ion transformations are efficient methods to obtain diverse chiral heterocyclic backbones. In the past few years, catalytic enantioselective versions of halo/thio/seleno&#8208;functionalizations with various halogen and chalcogen electrophiles have experienced constant development. This review highlights those advances in preparing functionalized heterocycles promoted by chiral organocatalysts or metal&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Photobiocatalytic Cascades for Acylating N&#8208;Heterocycles with Natural Amino Acids via the 2&#8208;Keto Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photobiocatalysis fully utilizing the unique reactivity of photocatalysis and efficient transforming biobased feedstocks of biocatalysis represents a promising approach for future green synthesis. However, photobiocatalytic cascade with biobased starting substrates has been rarely reported. Here, we present photobiocatalytic cascades that modify the N&#8208;heterocycle with keto acids biocatalytically synthesized from natural amino acids. The types of aliphatic, aromatic, and polar natural amino acids are compatible with the photobiocatalytic cascades system. In addition, the cascade is compatible with a range of N&#8208;heterocycles with moderate to good yield (up to 82%). Furthermore, the cascade system can reach gram scale (0.91 g) with a good separation yield, demonstrating the potential for scaling up production to practical application. This photobiocatalytic cascade can synthesize a range of important N&#8208;heterocyclic derivatives from natural amino acids in a green fashion and paves the way for greener synthesis by combining biocatalysis and photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote &#948;&#8208;C&#8722;H Selenylation of Arylethylamide and Alkenylethylamide Derivatives</title>

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed remote &#948;&#8208;C&#8722;H selenylation of arylethylamide derivatives with readily available diselenides has been reported. This protocol relies on the use of a removable picolinamide directing group to access unsymmetrical diaryl selenides in 45&#8211;98% yields. Furthermore, the inactivated &#948;&#8208;C(alkenyl)&#8722;H bond was also compatible in this reaction and afforded the thermo&#8208;dynamically unfavorable Z&#8208;selective&#8208;alkenyl selenides with complete control of site&#8208; and stereoselectivity.

Abstract
Sodium sulfinate addition to (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;chlorovinyl ketones followed by the aerobic cycloisomerization of alkenyl sulfone intermediates has been established for the synthesis of 3&#8208;sulfonyl furans. The optimal cycloisomerization catalyst system was identified to be Cu(OTf)2, where molecular oxygen acts as a terminal oxidant. With three points of structural variation in both &#946;&#8208;chlorovinyl ketones and sodium sulfinates, the current aerobic cycloisomerization strategy allows the synthesis of highly functionalized and substituted furan derivatives.

Abstract
A Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed ortho C&#8722;H functionalization of N&#8208;nitrosoanilines with &#945;&#8208;sulfonylcarbenes had been developed. The reaction was carried out under mild conditions and the products were obtained with good to excellent yields. The diverse transformations of the products to ortho&#8208;functionalized anilines and nitrogen heterocycles were achieved. Furthermore, a cascade reaction of N&#8208;nitrosoanilines and &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazo&#8208;ketones provided 3&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;indoles efficiently.

Abstract
Internal alkyne hydration using gold(I) catalysts often shows &lt;5:1 regioselectivity. To explore factors that control selectivity, [(IPr)Au]+ paired with the weakly coordinating anion [IMP&#8208;H] was employed in additive free hydration reactions. Solvent influences the anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity of alkylarylacetylene hydration. Although temperature does not impact selectivity, [(IPr)Au(NCMe)][IMP&#8208;H] (C1) is an effective precatalyst for alkyl/alkyl and alkyl/aryl acetylenes at ambient temperature. Overall kinetic behavior of C1 resembles that of other Au hydrofunctionalization reactions of [(IPr)Au]+, where nucleophilic attack and/or proton transfer are turnover limiting. Prospects for improving regioselectivity are discussed.

Abstract
A strategy for the synthesis of quinazolines via elemental sulfur&#8208;mediated oxidative condensation of nitriles and 2&#8208;(aminomethyl)anilines was developed. The reaction was carried out under metal&#8208;/solvent&#8208;free conditions, tolerates a wide range of functional groups to provide the corresponding products in 56%&#8208;91% yield, and can be performed on a gram&#8208;scale. The UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectra of several product derivatives were measured to study their photophysical properties.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Bidirectional Access to Planar Heptacyclic Benzobispyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indoles and Benzobispyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]Quinolines for Materials Science</title>

Abstract
Our recently developed gold&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinolines was successfully expanded towards bidirectional approaches, enabling access to two heptacyclic structural motifs. In the case of benzobispyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indoles, previously inaccessible modifications of the only known representative were made possible. In addition, the synthesis of a new class of nitrogen&#8208;containing heptacycles &#8211; namely benzobispyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinolines &#8211; was achieved by applying alkynylated benzodipyrrole derivatives as starting materials. All new compounds alongside with their corresponding precursors were fully characterized and their properties were investigated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, photophysical measurements and computational methods. The study revealed important structure&#8208;effect relationships between the solid&#8208;state structures and the observed photophysical properties, e.&#8201;g. aggregation&#8208;induced emission and solid&#8208;state fluorescence.

Abstract
In this paper, the application of organocatalysis in the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrolizines is demonstrated. &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated aldehydes and pyrrole&#8208;based hydrazone readily participated in the formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition that was realized according to aminocatalytic iminium ion activation. Products were obtained in high chemical yields, with excellent stereocontrol. The developed method was utilized in the first organocatalytic synthesis of ketorolac, a non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug.

Abstract
This work describes two new synthetic methods for the preparation of isoflavones following the Ni&#8208;catalysed domino arylation reactions of the vast range of ortho&#8208;hydroxyarylenaminones utilising aromatic bromides as well as carboxylic acids. The presented protocols tolerated significant variation of all coupling partners and enabled synthesis of isoflavone library of twenty&#8208;three representatives. This is the first communicated precedent where the mechanic energy was utilised in the synthesis of isoflavones following the domino cyclisation mode.

Abstract
A promoter&#8208;free chalcogenophosphorylation reaction between diverse P(O)&#8722;H reagents and chalcogenosulfonates has been developed. In the absence of metal or any other additives, these transformations proceed through a spontaneous process at room temperature, which provide a convenient and compatible approach to a broad range of selenophosphates and thiophosphates.

Abstract
LLG&#8208;5 1 is a Neu5Gc8Me&#8208;containing echinoderm ganglioside (EG) isolated from starfish Linckia laevigata. It showed neuritogenic activity toward the rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line PC&#8208;12. The first chemoenzymatic total synthesis of the trisialoganglioside LLG&#8208;5 1 has been accomplished by utilizing a convergent [2+3] coupling between a Neu5Gc8Me&#945;(2&#8594;5)Neu5Gc&#8208;linked disialoside and a C5&#8208;amino GM3 ceramide, Neu5NH2(2&#8594;3)Gal&#946;(1&#8594;4)Glc&#946;&#8208;Cer. A photoactivatable lactosyl phytosphingosine bearing a sulphonate moiety was developed to permit aqueous buffer solubility of the hydrophobic glycolipid acceptor for enzymatic &#945;(2,3) sialylation. In addition, the synthetic route is flexible, allowing non&#8208;natural LLG&#8208;5 analogues in native lengths with or without modification at C8 of the terminal Neu5Gc and/or N&#8208;acyl component, further expanding the diversity of LLG&#8208;5 structures that could be achieved. The developed synthetic strategy may enable access to other EGs.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative carboamination of maleimides with alkyl amines and &#945;&#8208;bromo carboxylates is described. These multicomponent reactions show good functional group compatibility and are suitable for the late&#8208;stage modification of a series of neuroprotective agents, providing a direct path for the library synthesis of 3&#8208;carbo&#8208;4&#8208;amino maleimides. The initial copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative amination of maleimides with amines to form enamines intermediate, followed by copper&#8208;catalyzed radical alkylation with &#945;&#8208;bromo carboxylate compounds, triggers a relayed catalytic reaction to achieve the carboamination process.

Abstract
We have developed a synthetic strategy for Et3N&#8208;promoted [5+3] cycloaddition reactions between acetoxypyranones and azomethine imines to access functionalized azabicyclo[3.3.1]alkenones with three tertiary stereocenters (31 examples, 36% to 87% yield, 5.5:1 to &gt;20:1 dr). The method was scalable, and the products could be transformed to various eight&#8208;membered&#8208;ring bridged heterocyclic molecules.

Abstract
A photoinduced multicomponent reaction of arylamines, enaminones and difluorobromoacetates for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;difunctionalized quinolines is reported. This strategy features broad functional groups tolerance and wide substrate scopes that enables further synthetic applications of the obtained products. Mechanistic studies reveal that intermolecular [3+3] cyclization between in&#8208;situ generated 1,3&#8208;vinylimine ions and arylamines is the key step in this transformation.

Abstract
A concise synthesis of axially chiral biaryl aldehydes through Pd/amino acid&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective interannular C&#8722;H arylation of biaryl aldehydes with aryl iodides is developed. This reaction proceeds smoothly involving excellent enantiocontrol and accomplishes with good tolerance of functional groups. Moreover, the readily accessible scale&#8208;up synthesis and further transformation of products has highlighted the potential utility of this asymmetric catalytic protocol.

         <title>Cover Picture: Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Cyclization of 2&#8208;Alkynyl Diaryl Sulfides for the Selective Synthesis of Sulfur&#8208;Containing Polycyclic Compounds (Adv. Synth. Catal. 20/2022)</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 364, Issue 20, Page 3440-3440, October 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inside cover picture illustrates that starting from 2&#8208;alkynyl diaryl sulfides, intramolecular cyclization realized selective construction of sulfur&#8208;containing five to seven&#8208;membered systems by the choice of reaction temperature and aryl group using the same iridium catalysis. When 2&#8208;alkynylphenyl &#8220;naphthyl&#8221; sulfides were used, triaryl&#8208;fused thiepines possessing a 7&#8208;membered ring were obtained at 100&#8201;&#176;C. The reaction of 2&#8208;alkynyl diaryl sulfides at 120&#8201;&#176;C gave 9&#8208;arylidene&#8208;9H&#8208;thioxanthenes with 6&#8208;membered system. The reaction of 2&#8208;alkynylphenyl &#8220;naphthyl&#8221; sulfides at 160&#8201;&#176;C afforded diaryl&#8208;substituted benzothiophene with 5&#8208;membered system.

&lt;p&gt;The inside cover picture illustrates that starting from 2-alkynyl diaryl sulfides, intramolecular cyclization realized selective construction of sulfur-containing five to seven-membered systems by the choice of reaction temperature and aryl group using the same iridium catalysis. When 2-alkynylphenyl &#8220;naphthyl&#8221; sulfides were used, triaryl-fused thiepines possessing a 7-membered ring were obtained at 100&#8201;&#176;C. The reaction of 2-alkynyl diaryl sulfides at 120&#8201;&#176;C gave 9-arylidene-9&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-thioxanthenes with 6-membered system. The reaction of 2-alkynylphenyl &#8220;naphthyl&#8221; sulfides at 160&#8201;&#176;C afforded diaryl-substituted benzothiophene with 5-membered system.

The front cover picture is a metaphor of mechanochemistry. A pair of robotic arms is playing dominoes with the mechanism of Ni&#8208;catalyzed domino&#8208;cyclisation&#8208;arylation of o&#8208;hydroxyarylenaminones, elucidated by the experimental and computational investigations in our group. Meanwhile, another set of mechanical contraptions working at 30&#8197;Hz is about to ground the domino tiles as they fall to obtain isoflavones under mechanochemical conditions. This is the first example where the mechanic energy is used in the synthesis of isoflavones following a domino cyclisation.

Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed annulation reactions to synthesize indenones are reviewed, beginning with the Larock indenone synthesis and focusing on the most recent advances in technology. Proposed reaction mechanisms, and the evidence supporting them, are highlighted throughout this review. Current limitations in these reactions are described in detail. Obtaining high regioselectivity remains challenging with several different classes of alkyne. In particular, high&#8208;yielding and regioselective reactions with alkyl&#8208;substituted alkynes remain elusive, as do reactions with terminal alkynes. In the final section, the case is made that indanone synthesis reactions employing alkenes should be further explored.

Abstract
A general, efficient and regioselective protocol has been developed for the synthesis of trifluoromethylated bis(carbazolyl)methanes. This metal&#8208;free transformation proceeds smoothly under air atmosphere and features broad scope for both reaction partners. This method could also be extended to the synthesis of difluoromethylated and chlorodifluoromethylated bis(carbazolyl)methanes.

Abstract
A metal&#8208;free and external&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free electrosynthesis of &#946;&#8208;acyloxy&#8208;&#947;&#8208;selenyl amines was developed. The cascade reaction is triggered by anodic oxidative generation of electrophilic selenium cation, followed by electrophilic addition to the unactivated alkene, and successive water promoted intramolecular acyl migration. The reactions gave the products in up to 98% yield with controllable regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. Different chemoselectivity towards cyclization products was also viable with N&#8208;Boc and N&#8208;Cbz substrates. Both batch chemistry and flow chemistry were available for scale&#8208;up synthesis with up to 91% yield.

         <title>ortho&#8208;Acylation of Aryl Iodides Enabled with Imides via Palladium/Norbornene/CuI Catalysis</title>

Abstract
Herein, a three component Catellani&#8208;type reaction catalyzed by the Palladium/Norbornene/CuI (Pd/NBE/CuI) cooperative system by using N&#8208;acylph&#8208;thalimides as acyl electrophiles is reported, which gives access to a series of aromatic ketones. The transformation is performable in the presence of water, albeit with decreased reaction yield. The additive CuI was crucial to facilitate the cleavage of C(O)&#8722;N bond of imide. This protocol showed broad substrate scope: both alkyl and aryl acyl groups could be installed at the ortho&#8208;position of aryl iodides; alkenes and boronic acids can be used as termination reagents.

Abstract
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of N&#8208;aryl thiocarbamoyl fluorides and water has been developed, providing access to 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;benzothiazolones in 48&#8211;83% yields. This protocol for 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;benzothiazolones precludes bad&#8208;smell and toxic reagents. Mechanistic studies suggest that the transformation proceeds through hydrolysis followed by dehydrogenative coupling to form C&#8722;S bond involving a radical process.

Abstract
Presented herein is the Br&#248;nsted acid (MsOH) mediated electrophilic sulfenylacyloxylation of o&#8208;alkynylbenzoates via alkyne activation by in&#8208;situ formed sulfonium cations from bench&#8208;stable N&#8208;thioaryl/alkyl&#8208;succinimides followed by the intramolecular regioselective cyclization. The transformation provides access to structurally diverse 4&#8208;sulfenylisocoumarins in 77&#8211;98% yields with broad functional group compatibility. The reaction scalability and reusability of phthalimide protecting group make this protocol synthetically viable.

Abstract
The diastereodivergent synthesis of syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;9&#8208;hydroxyhomoisoflavanone from various chromones and carbaldehydes is described. The synthetic approaches involving the reductive aldol reaction or the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction followed by syn&#8208;selective 1,4&#8208;reduction provide both diastereomers of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy chroman&#8208;4&#8208;ones in 51&#8211;98% yield with anti (2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8211;16&#8201;:&#8201;1 anti/syn) or 22&#8211;80% yield with syn (5&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8211;48&#8201;:&#8201;1 syn/anti) diastereoselectivity. The ambiguity surrounding the stereochemistry of two 9&#8208;hydroxyhomoisoflavanones, homoferrugenone and portulacanone F was elucidated via the first total syntheses.

Abstract
We describe an Ir&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular reaction of 2&#8208;alkynyl diaryl sulfides, which gives 9&#8208;arylidene&#8208;9H&#8208;thioxanthene derivatives via 6&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization. When 2&#8208;alkynylphenyl naphthyl sulfides are used, divergent synthesis of triaryl&#8208;fused thiepines and diaryl&#8208;substituted benzothiophenes can be achieved by simply choosing the reaction temperature.

         <title>Heterocycle Synthesis via Decarboxylative Cyclization Methods</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carboxylic acid compounds are important structural units that exist widely in nature; the only byproduct in the decarboxylation process is carbon dioxide, which is non&#8208;flammable, non&#8208;toxic, and easy to remove. Therefore, decarboxylative reactions are of great importance in synthetic chemistry. Heterocyclic compounds are important backbones that constitute a variety of biologically active molecules; therefore, research into the development of new synthetic tactics for heterocyclic derivatives based on decarboxylative cyclization is of great interest. In this paper, we describe metal&#8208;catalyzed, visible light&#8208;driven, electrochemically enabled, decarboxylative cyclization reactions, as well as other types, that have been rapidly developed in the past 5 years; moreover, for some of these methods, we discuss the scope of their application and the mechanism of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Assembly of Polysubstituted Furans with Dimethyl Sulfoxide as a Multipurpose Precursor via &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization of Saturated Ketones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An I2/K2S2O8 mediated multiple &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization reaction for the construction of polysubstituted furans has been established from readily available ethyl ketones and dimethyl sulfoxide. This transformation features dimethyl sulfoxide as a multipurpose precursor, acting as the precursor of the oxygen, methyl, and sulfur methyl units. Six new chemical bonds, involving two C&#8722;C, two C&#8722;O, and one C&#8722;S bonds were formed sequentially during the intermolecular oxidative annulation process.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract. A copper&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction for selective aerobic oxidative C&#8722;C bond cleavage of &#946;&#8208;alkyl nitroolefins and subsequent oxidative amidation with amines or amides was reported. The reaction all exhibited high selectivities and gave the corresponding &#945;&#8208;ketoamide with 66&#8722;88% yields. The mechanistic study revealed that the NO2&#8208;directed aerobic oxidative C&#8722;C bond cleavage occurred on more electron&#8208;rich allylic nitro tautomers, which originated from the equilibrium of conjugated nitroalkenes.</dc:description>

This protocol is compatible with electron donating groups like &#8208;Me, &#8208;OMe, halogen and elctron withdrawing groups such as &#8208;COOEt, affording respective indazolyl phosphorothioates in 62%&#8208;91% yields.

Abstract
A strategy for the divergent synthesis of polysubstituted pyrazoles and N&#8208;alkylated hydrazone derivatives through three&#8208;component reaction of aromatic aldehydes, aryl sulfonyl hydrazides, and allenoates under the mild reaction conditions is described. Both products can be obtained by changing the reaction base.

         <title>Selective Intermolecular Dual Amino&#8208;Trifluoromethylation of Alkenes by High&#8208;Valent Cu(III)&#8208;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and selective intermolecular amino&#8208;trifluoromethylation of alkenes is developed to produce a range of biologically active &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethyl amines. This method exploits a crucial high&#8208;valent Cu(III)&#8208;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; complex as a combined source of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; radical and Cu(II) oxidant through homolytic Cu(III)&#8208;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bond cleavage. This unique mode of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; radical generation is distinct from current dominant methods that rely largely on photoredox catalysis or the use of sacrificing radical initiator.

         <title>Unexpected Stereoselective Access to 2&#8208;Aminooxazolines from Propargyl Ureas by Silver Salts under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Propargyl ureas can lead to a range of possible heterocyclic compounds, mainly depending on the employed catalyst. Silver salts are known to promote the N&#8208;5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization mode to imidazolidinone derivatives. Conversely, a versatile and stereoselective O&#8208;5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization of propargyl ureas to 2&#8208;aminooxazolines by Ag(I) catalysis is here disclosed. Good to excellent yields and complete stereoselectivity of the external double bond have been achieved under milder reaction conditions (50&#8208;60 &#176;C). A one&#8208;pot protocol starting from the corresponding propargylic amines and isocyanates has been developed as well. N,N&#8217;&#8208;Dipropargyl ureas underwent a singular O&#8208;5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig/N&#8208;5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig double cyclization sequence. Finally, insights into the tautomeric equilibrium of 2&#8208;aminooxazoles and on their relative reactivity are provided.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of o&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;o&#8217;&#8208;alkynylbiaryls in the presence of external or internal nucleophiles provides a straightforward access to phenanthrene&#8208;based polycycles, which are of considerable interest in materials science. Thus, their reactions with alcohols yield functionalized dihydrophenanthrenes, in a process that can also be carried out intramolecularly to provide phenanthrene&#8208;derived heteropolycyclic compounds.
Moreover, benzo[b]triphenylenes can be synthesized from o&#8208;methoxyvinyl&#8208;o&#8217;&#8208;alkynylbiaryls, in a reaction in which an (hetero)aryl substituent at the triple bond acts as an internal nucleophile.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An organocatalyzed one&#8208;pot sequential deracemization of aromatic ketones bearing a stereogenic center at the alpha&#8208;position was achieved thanks to an acid&#8208;base strategy involving an enantioselective protonation reaction as a key step. This simple and efficient protocol yields enantioenriched ketones in up to 89% ee without having to isolate sensitive intermediates such as silyl enolates. The key role of water in this process was underlined. This one&#8208;pot sequence constitutes a useful extension to previously reported chemically&#8208;driven red&#8208;ox protocols thus increasing the panel of molecules eligible to a deracemization strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Hydrogenation of N&#8208;Heterocycles with Trimethylamine Borane and TFA in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A metal&#8208;free hydrogenation of quinoxalines and indoles with Me3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3 and TFA in water at room temperature is reported. The protocol is featured with the usage of environmentally friendly water as the solvent, no need of metal catalyst and broad substrate scope. Sensitive functional groups such as OH&#8208;, NH2&#8208;, Cl&#8208;, Br&#8208;, especially &#8208;CN and &#8208;CO2Me were well tolerated. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested that TFA and Me3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3 provided the proton and hydride sources for the product, respectively.

The front cover image illustrates the successful production of &#8220;heavy&#8221; deuterated linoleic acid. Deuterium was installed at the beginning of the synthesis via hydrothermal deuteration of readily available saturated fatty acids. The fatty acids were stitched together to ultimately afford the requisite cis,cis&#8208;skipped diene of linoleic acid. Deuterated linoleic acid is required for the production of labelled biologically relevant linoleoyl lipids, whereby deuteration facilitates various experimental techniques. This was demonstrated by the synthesis of tail deuterated 1&#8208;palmitoyl&#8208;d31&#8208;2&#8208;linoleoyl&#8208;d31&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine (PLPC&#8208;d62).

         <title>Oxidative Cyclization of Aryl Ynones with NaNO2 for the Divergent Synthesis of NO2&#8208;Containing Spiro[5.5]trienones, Indenones and Thioflavones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A K2S2O8&#8208;promoted nitration/spirocyclization of biaryl ynones using inexpensive NaNO2 as nitro source has been described. This cascade reaction is triggered by nitration of alkyne and followed by 6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig spirocyclization, dearomatization, forming the NO2&#8208;containing spiro[5.5]trienones in 63&#8211;85% yields. The present reaction also provides a practical method for the synthesis of nitrated indenones and thioflavones with 58&#8211;85% yields.

Abstract
Lewis base and Br&#248;nsted base controlled chemodivergent annulations of &#945;&#8208;methyl substituted allenyl imide and o&#8208;aminotrifluoroacetophenones are realized to afford highly valuable furo[3,2&#8208;b]indol&#8208;2&#8208;ones and dihydroquinolines bearing a CF3&#8208;substituted quaternary stereogenic center. The possible reaction mechanisms are proposed through deuterium labelling experiments. This work demonstrates the unprecedented dual reactivities of &#945;&#8208;methyl substituted allenyl imide with electrophilic&#8722;nucleophilic compounds in annulation reactions, and features chemodivergence in transforming allenyl imide through &#946;&#8217;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization via phosphine catalysis and &#946;/&#947;&#8208;bisfunctionalization via Br&#248;nsted base catalysis.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Oxyarylation/Hydroxylation of N&#8208;Alkoxypropiolamides for Chemoselective Synthesis of 4&#8208;Aryl&#8208;3&#8208;(2H)&#8208;isoxazolones</title>

Abstract
3&#8208;(2H)&#8208;isoxazolone is an important skeletal structure in medicinal and agricultural chemistry. However, its synthetic methodology has limited substrate scope and requires unconventional substrate synthesis. Meanwhile, gold&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular oxidative cross&#8208;coupling involving the 5/6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of substrates bearing an ynone structure has not been reported because of an undesirable protonation as a side&#8208;reaction. Thus, we hypothesized that the reactivity of cyclic N&#8208;alkoxypropiolamides would suppress protonation and allow dual functionalization. As a result, sequential gold&#8208;catalyzed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization, oxidative cross&#8208;coupling, and hydroxylation of N&#8208;alkoxypropiolamides was developed to synthesize 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;(2H)&#8208;isoxazolones with a hydroxy group. In an optimization study, dimethylformamide (DMF) and H2O were effective solvents for the sequential reaction. This method enabled 3&#8208;(2H)&#8208;isoxazolone backbone synthesis with the introduction of an aryl and hydroxy group in a single procedure. Moreover, a tolerance toward reactive functional groups, such as ketocarbonyl groups, was observed. Some chemical transformations of the synthesized 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;(2H)&#8208;isoxazolone were conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of functional group interconversion, C&#8722;C bond formation, and additional heterocycle synthesis. Notably, a fluorescent tetracyclic heterocycle was obtained by intramolecular oxidative cross&#8208;coupling. Control experiments indicated that the reactivity for protonation was suppressed by an alkoxyamide moiety. Therefore, the chemoselectivity of oxyarylation was improved. Finally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to estimate the reaction pathway, which suggested that ring&#8208;opening involving solvents (H2O or DMF) is important for these sequential reactions.

As a result, sequential gold-catalyzed 5-&lt;i&gt;endo-dig&lt;/i&gt; cyclization, oxidative cross-coupling, and hydroxylation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkoxypropiolamides was developed to synthesize 4-aryl-3-(2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-isoxazolones with a hydroxy group. In an optimization study, dimethylformamide (DMF) and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O were effective solvents for the sequential reaction. This method enabled 3-(2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-isoxazolone backbone synthesis with the introduction of an aryl and hydroxy group in a single procedure. Moreover, a tolerance toward reactive functional groups, such as ketocarbonyl groups, was observed. Some chemical transformations of the synthesized 4-aryl-3-(2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-isoxazolone were conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of functional group interconversion, C&#8722;C bond formation, and additional heterocycle synthesis. Notably, a fluorescent tetracyclic heterocycle was obtained by intramolecular oxidative cross-coupling. Control experiments indicated that the reactivity for protonation was suppressed by an alkoxyamide moiety. Therefore, the chemoselectivity of oxyarylation was improved. Finally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to estimate the reaction pathway, which suggested that ring-opening involving solvents (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or DMF) is important for these sequential reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Benzannulation and N&#8208;annulation of &#946;&#8208;ketoenamines by the in&#8208;situ generated methyl(methylene)sulfonium ion from the reaction of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane (DBE) was achieved. The &#946;&#8208;ketoenamines underwent N&#8208;annulation to pyridine derivatives, while the N&#8208;alkylated enamines were benzannulated to afford substituted anilines. The utility of the intermediate methyl(methylene)sulfonium ion was further extended for synthesizing methylene&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Oxygen Transfer to Alkynylsulfones: A Diazo&#8208;Free Route to 4&#8208;Sulfonyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;Oxazoles</title>

Abstract
The gold&#8208;catalyzed annulation of alkynylsulfones, involving pyridine N&#8208;oxides (as O&#8208;atom transfer reagents) and nitriles (as C=N synthons), comprises a diazo&#8208;free route to valuable 4&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazoles. This reaction operates under relatively mild conditions (IPrAuNTf2 5&#8197;mol&#8201;%, rt or 60&#8201;&#176;C), and a number of functionalities was compatible (35 examples; 14&#8211;95%). In most cases, the SO2 fragment, which is typically expulsed in the previously reported Au&#8208;catalyzed O&#8208;transfers to alkynylsulfones, retains in the heterocyclic products. The postulated reaction mechanism suggests a key role of reactive gold &#945;&#8208;oxo carbene intermediates formed via the O&#8208;atom transfer.

         <title>Filling the Gaps in the Challenging Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Exocyclic Benzofused Alkenes with Ir&#8722;P,N Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Herein, we report a chiral phosphine&#8208;triazole ligand for the Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of exocyclic benzofused alkenes. Overcoming previous limitations, the catalytic system is able to successfully hydrogenate exocyclic olefins bearing a benzofused five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered ring motif (ee's between 92 to 99%). The catalyst tolerates well the presence of several substituents and substitution patterns at both aromatic rings. The absence of a competing isomerization process together with the perfect fit of the olefins in the catalyst chiral pocket are key to surpass the previous limitations in the hydrogenation of both 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered ring benzofused exocyclic olefins.

The front cover picture illustrates the variety of products accessible through the newly developed asymmetric hydrohydrazonemethylation (HHM). The devised hydroformylation/condensation sequence leads to stable and versatile &#947;&#8208;chiral N&#8217;&#8208;substituted aceto&#8208;hydrazones. They can be reduced in one&#8208;pot to the corresponding &#947;&#8208;chiral N&#8217;&#8208;substituted acetohydrazides, and after deprotection, to &#946;&#8208;chiral hydrazines. They can be also reduced and hydrogenolysed to the &#946;&#8208;chiral primary amines or serve as substrates for diastereoselective C&#8208;C coupling. The high enantioselectivity reached for all product types makes the molecular peacock proud of its pluridecorated tail. Details can be found in the communication by Franci&#242; and co&#8208;workers (M. N. Kliemann, S. Teeuwen, C. Weike, G. Franci&#242;, W. Leitner, Adv. Synth.

         <title>Strecker Reactions of Formaldehyde with TMSCN, Catalyzed by TBAF and Formic Acid: N&#8208;Monocyanomethylation of Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A set of conditions for the Strecker reaction of formaldehyde, amines, and TMSCN that affords three&#8208;component coupling adducts as the major products is reported. HCOOH and TBAF are used as cocatalysts and the TMSCN functions as both cyanide source and protecting reagent for amines. As a result, the side reactions were suppressed efficiently and a broad range of aromatic and aliphatic amines were mono&#8208;cyanomethylated in 52&#8211;99% yield. Furthermore, this protocol was successfully applied toward the synthesis of meta&#8208;diamide insecticides.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Synthesis of Substituted Pyrazoles &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; Hypervalent Iodine Mediated Intramolecular C&#8211;N Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Mn&#8208;Catalyzed Ring&#8208;Opening Peroxidation of Cyclobutanols: A Method for the Synthesis of 4&#8208;Oxo Peroxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A manganese&#8208;catalyzed regioselective ring&#8208;opening peroxidation of cyclobutanols has been disclosed. With this protocol, the C(sp3)&#8722;OOBu&#8208;t bond could be efficiently constructed via the radical&#8208;mediated C&#8722;C bond cleavage/coupling, allowing the facile access to a variety of 4&#8208;oxo peroxides. Besides, the obtained peroxidation products could be readily transformed into other synthetically attractive skeletons.

         <title>Synthesis of Benzofurans from Sulfur Ylides and ortho&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;Functionalized Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The synthesis of benzofurans from readily accessible sulfur ylides and ortho&#8208;hydroxy aryl alkynes is reported. The transformation proceeds through an isomerization/nucleophilic addition/cyclization/aromatization cascade. The substrate scope is very general with respect to both reactants and the products are afforded in 43&#8211;94% yield under conditions which are catalyst&#8208;free and additive&#8208;free.

         <title>Cobalt(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydrogenation of Simple Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several cobalt(II) complexes supported by tetradentate aminobenzimidazole (N4) ligands and a tridentate nitrogen (N3) ligand have been prepared and characterized. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis indicates that the cobalt complex of BPMB (BPMB = 1,2&#8208;bis((S)&#8208;2&#8208;(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) pyrrolidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane) ligand shows a distorted octahedral configuration. These cobalt(II) complexes can  catalyze the transfer hydrogenation reaction of simple olefins with ammonia borane as a hydrogen source, and a variety of terminal olefins can be reduced to corresponding alkanes in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. Note that Co&#8208;N3 complex provides an inferior outcome than those of Co&#8208;N4 complexes.</dc:description>

Abstract
Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of maleimides followed by an annulation sequence for the synthesis of polycyclic azaheterocycles in one pot. The reaction proceeds under redox&#8208;neutral conditions and is compatible with various functional groups. Notably, the as&#8208;prepared product exhibits potential photophysical properties.

         <title>RuH&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Diaryl Ketones via Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aromatic Enones with Aromatic Aldehydes and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of alkenyl ketones with aldehydes has been extended to the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;diaryl 1,3&#8208;diketones. The reaction has been successfully applied to the synthesis of PPT (propyl pyrazole triol), a selective estrogen receptor modulator compound. A study of the stoichiometric reaction of phenyl vinyl ketone with RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 has revealed that the &#946;&#8208;ruthenium ketone PhCOCH2CH2RuCl(CO)(PPh3)2, a five&#8208;membered ruthenacycle is formed with liberation of one molecule of PPh3. The observed catalytic activity of this ruthenacycle in the presence of PPh3 suggests that it serves as a resting state, in equilibrium with an oxa&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl ruthenium species, which is the key coupling partner with aldehyde substrates.

         <title>Controllable Access to Furans and Dihydrofurans through Cyclization/Coupling of Internal Acetylenic &#946;&#8208;Ketoesters with Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed tandem cyclization/coupling of internal &#946;&#8208;propargylic&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters with (hetero)aryl bromides is described. Two protocols are established which selectively lead to 2&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;dihydrofurans, when isomerization is inhibited under mild conditions (temp. &#8804;40&#8201;&#176;C and weak base &#8211; K2CO3), or to 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;furans when base&#8208;induced aromatization is enabled. A catalytic cycle involving oxidative addition, substitution of bromide with alkyne, rate limiting anti&#8208;selective 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig oxocyclization followed by fast deprotonation of the oxonium intermediate, and reductive elimination is proposed based on detailed experimental and theoretical studies.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrohydrazonemethylation of Styrenes: Access to Chiral Hydrazones, Hydrazides, Hydrazines and Amines</title>

Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric hydroformylation of styrenes was combined with condensation of the resulting aldehydes with acetohydrazide as nucleophile leading to &#947;&#8208;chiral N&#8217;&#8208;substituted aceto&#8208;hydrazones. This cascade reaction is called hydrohydrazonemethylation (HHM) in analogy to similar hydroformylation/condensation sequences. The catalyst was formed in&#8197;situ from the commercially available chiral phosphine&#8208;ligand (R,R)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE and [Rh(acac)(CO)2] and used at a loading of 0.2&#8197;mol%. The stable condensation products are not prone to tautomerization providing versatile chiral intermediates. Their one&#8208;pot reduction with DMAB/TsOH resulted in the corresponding &#947;&#8208;chiral N&#8217;&#8208;substituted acetohydrazides (14 examples) with yields ranging from 73% to 91% and enantioselectivities from 77% to 97% ee. Deprotection of the acetohydrazides led to the corresponding &#946;&#8208;chiral hydrazines. Reduction and hydrogenolysis of the hydrazones over Raney&#8208;Ni yielded the corresponding &#946;&#8208;chiral primary amines with 95% ee. Diastereoselective functionalization of the C=N bond of the hydrazones is a further synthetic option, as demonstrated by allylation with (allyl)SiCl3.

&lt;p&gt;The catalytic asymmetric hydroformylation of styrenes was combined with condensation of the resulting aldehydes with acetohydrazide as nucleophile leading to &#947;-chiral N&#8217;-substituted aceto-hydrazones.

         <title>Zincate&#8208;Mediated Remote Functionalisation of p&#8208;Iodobenzyl Derivatives Through Metallotropy in 2&#8208;Methyltetrahydrofuran as Key Solvent</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
2&#8208;MeTHF (2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran) promotes the zincate&#8208;mediated remote functionalisation of p&#8208;iodobenzyl derivatives through metallotropy with a broad scope. This biosourced solvent remarkably impacted all the key elementary steps involved in the tandem reaction. The method tolerates a wide range of sensitive functionalities within the substrates as well as enolisable and activated or deactivated aromatic aldehydes as reaction partners. A challenging benzyl naphthalene derivative was even reacted through an original dearomatisation/rearomatisation/metallotropy chain.

         <title>Synthesis of Perdeuterated Linoleic Acid&#8208;d31 and Chain Deuterated 1&#8208;Palmitoyl&#8208;2&#8208;linoleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine&#8208;d62</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a gram&#8208;scale synthesis of perdeuterated linoleic acid&#8208;d31. The starting materials for the synthesis are two saturated fatty acids, azelaic acid&#8208;d14 and pentanoic acid&#8208;d9, which can be obtained by metal catalysed hydrothermal hydrogen&#8208;deuterium exchange. The synthesis utilises the fatty acids directly via decarboxylative coupling. Copper catalysed coupling of a terminal alkyne intermediate with a propargyl bromide derivative affords a skipped diyne, which can be reduced using P&#8208;2 nickel to obtain the desired cis,cis&#8208;diene geometry. The subsequent synthesis of the tail&#8208;deuterated phospholipid, 1&#8208;palmitoyl&#8208;2&#8208;linoleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine&#8208;d62 (PLPC&#8208;d62) is also described. Optimised reaction conditions were developed to access this phospholipid and its regioisomeric purity was characterised by two complementary mass spectrometry techniques.

Abstract
A ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of allenoates with arylamines has been developed. This strategy provides an approach to synthesize E&#8208;allylic amines in good yields with high atom&#8208;economy and high levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and E&#8208;selectivities with a broad substrate scope.
