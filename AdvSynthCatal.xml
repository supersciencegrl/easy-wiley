      <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of Aryl Halides with Primary and Secondary Aliphatic Alcohols Catalyzed by an O,N,N&#8208;Coordinated Nickel Complex</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
A synthesis of alkyl aryl ethers was achieved via the cross&#8208;coupling of aryl halides with primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols catalyzed by a bench&#8208;stable nickel complex supported by a monoanionic O,N,N&#8208;tridentate ligand. This nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction proceeds smoothly in the absence of a phosphine ligand, affording alkyl aryl ethers in moderate to good yields.

      <title>Catalytic Approach to Diverse &#945;&#8208;Aminoboronic Acid Derivatives by Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Trifluoroborate&#8208;Iminiums</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
A series of structurally diverse benzyl protected trifluoroborate&#8208;ammoniums were prepared in good to high yields by an efficient hydrogenation of corresponding trifluoroborate&#8208;iminiums using Crabtree's catalyst. Subsequent N&#8208; and B&#8208;deprotections were demonstrated on selected examples to provide several &#945;&#8208;aminoboronic acids. Preliminary experiments on asymmetric version of the reaction indicated a correlation between E/Z&#8208;ratio in the trifluoroborate&#8208;iminium substrate and enantioselectivity. The broad scope, operational simplicity and efficiency of the presented method imply its high potential for a facile access to libraries of &#945;&#8208;aminoboronic acid derivatives that can be used in medicinal chemistry applications and beyond.

      <title>A Cascade Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation/Chemodivergent Annulation of N&#8208;carbamoylindoles with Sulfoxonium Ylides for the Synthesis of Dihydropyrimidoindolone and Tricyclic [1,3]Oxazino[3,4&#8208;a]indol&#8208;1&#8208;ones Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>









Abstract
A highly efficient cascade Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation/intramolecular chemodivergent cyclization reaction of N&#8208;carbamoylindoles and sulfoxonium ylides has been successfully achieved for the first time. This synergistic process provides rapid access to functionalized dihydropyrimidoindolone and tricyclic [1,3]oxazino[3,4&#8208;a]indol&#8208;1&#8208;ones skeletons under redox neutral conditions with broad substrate scope and remarkable functional&#8208;group compatibility. Further late&#8208;stage modification of structurally complex drug molecules and mechanistic studies were also accomplished.

&lt;p&gt;A highly efficient cascade Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation/intramolecular chemodivergent cyclization reaction of N&#8208;carbamoylindoles and sulfoxonium ylides has been successfully achieved for the first time. This synergistic process provides rapid access to functionalized dihydropyrimidoindolone and tricyclic [1,3]oxazino[3,4&#8208;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]indol&#8208;1&#8208;ones skeletons under redox neutral conditions with broad substrate scope and remarkable functional&#8208;group compatibility. Further late&#8208;stage modification of structurally complex drug molecules and mechanistic studies were also accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unravelling the C&#8208;H arylation of benzo&#8208;fused cycloalkanones:  combined experimental and computational evidence</title>
      <dc:description>The C&#8208;H functionalization of benzo&#8208;fused cycloalkanones represents a synthetic challenge since such scaffolds display different activation sites, at sp2 and sp3 carbons, a bicyclic structure and various sizes of the cycloalkanone ring. Anticipating the outcome of C&#8208;H functionalisation and the impact of the presence and size of the cycloalkanone ring would help to foresee synthetic routes to more complex molecular architectures. The mechanism of C&#8208;H arylation was studied using DFT calculations for tetralone, benzosuberone and indanone and compared to acetophenone. Comparison of energetic profiles allowed identifying key steps of the process. Analysis of the topology of key intermediates allowed correlating the deformation of palladacycles to the potential reactivity of the benzo&#8208;fused cycloalkanone family members. Our experimental results were in full agreement with the trend provided by the theoretical study. A wide panel of diversely substituted benzo&#8208;fused cycloalkanones has been successfully obtained using optimized conditions. Moreover, an approach towards polycyclic molecules has been illustrated featuring a C&#8208;H arylation and a second step taking advantage of the remaining ketone fragment. The ability of the ketone fragment to undergo diverse transformations leads to alternative pathways to more complex molecular architectures.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Developments in Z&#8208;Selective Olefin Metathesis Reactions by Molybdenum, Tungsten, Ruthenium, and Vanadium Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>








Abstract
This review article summarizes reports for Z&#8208;selective olefin metathesis reactions by molybdenum, tungsten, ruthenium, and vanadium catalysts. It is clearly demonstrated that the ligand modifications play essential roles in achieving the stereospecific olefin metathesis reactions. In particular, Mo&#8208; and W&#8208;alkylidene based complex catalysts having pyrrolide&#8208;aryloxide [or bis(aryloxide)] were highly effective in the efficient enantioselective ring opening/cross&#8208;metathesis (EROCM), cross metathesis (CM), homodimerization, ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), and in ring closing metathesis (RCM) with high Z&#8208; selectivities (&#8764;&gt;98%). Ruthenium&#8208;carbene catalysts having cycloadamantyl, catechothiolate, phenolate and thiophenolate ligands display pronounced Z&#8208;selectivity (&gt;98%) in efficient CM, ROCM, AROCM, RCM, ROMP reactions. Halogenated (arylimido)&#8208;alkoxo vanadium&#8208;alkylidenes were thermally robust and effective for efficient highly cis&#8208;specific ROMP of cyclic olefins to afford end&#8208;functionalized ring&#8208;opened polymers.

The front cover picture illustrates the application of Zn&#8208;complex as a key catalyst for enantioselective hydrosilylation of cyclic imines. As the replacement of platinum&#8208;group metals is currently an interesting challenge in catalysis, a promising alternative in asymmetric hydrosilylation, is to use environmentally benign and easily accessible chiral Zn&#8208;based catalysts. I. W&#281;glarz, K. Michalak and J.

      <dc:description>Chiral 2&#8208;alkylquinazolinones are key synthetic intermediates, but their preparation in high optical purity is challenging. Thus, a multicomponent procedure integrating anthranilic acids, N&#8208;Boc&#8208;amino acids, and amines in the presence of methanesulfonyl chloride, N&#8208;methylimidazole, and copper(II) chloride was developed to mildly afford N&#8208;Boc&#8208;2&#8208;alkylaminoquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones with excellent preservation of enantiomeric purity (&gt; 99% ee). Copper(II) chloride was essential to retaining enantiopurity, and reaction component structural changes were well tolerated, resulting in an efficient, all&#8208;in&#8208;one procedure that promotes sequential coupling, lactonization, aminolysis, and cyclization in good yields. The method was applied to the rapid assembly of four key intermediates used in the synthesis of high profile quinazolinones, including several PI3K inhibitor drugs.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Trends in the Synthesis and Mechanistic Implications of Phenanthridines</title>
      <dc:description>Phenanthridine derivatives are one of the most intensively studied families of biologically active compounds. There has been considerable scientific interest in the turn of this century in the synthesis of these N&#8208;containing heterocycles as they are prevalent in many alkaloids and also possess striking biological activities including antibacterial, antifungal, antitumor activities. In this regard, a number of synthetic approaches toward the construction of phenanthridine moieties with various substituents, and to increase their yield have been developed by the synthetic organic community. Even though many researchers have developed various innovative methods for the synthesis of phenanthridine	derivatives for the past few years, still there is substantial scope for the discovery of novel synthetic methods. In this review, the latest developments in the diverse synthetic strategies of phenanthridine derivatives in the presence and absence of metals were described. The present review also enlightens the use of different reagents, the diversity of the substrates identified, and the plausible mechanisms unraveled towards the construction of these biologically relevant scaffolds.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Couplings (CDC) of C&#8208;H Bond in Aqueous Media</title>
      <dc:description>To develop highly efficient synthetic reactions is quite important in organic chemistry. Cross dehydrogenative couplings (CDC) utilize C&#8208;H bonds of substrates to construct new C&#8208;X (X=C, S, O, N, P) bonds. For CDC, the pre&#8208;functionalization of reaction substrates can be avoided and the C&#8208;X (X=C, S, O, N, P) bonds can be newly formed by simple and efficient synthesis routes. Meanwhile, water is increasingly used as a substitute for organic solvents in cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling because of its rich content, non&#8208;toxicity, and non&#8208; flammability. In recent years, organic chemists are devoted their efforts to explore the cross dehydrogenative couplings (CDC) in aqueous phase which feature high atom utilization rate and environmental friendliness. Herein, we summarized the recent advances in the construction of C&#8208;C, C&#8208;S, C&#8208;O, C&#8208;N, and C&#8208;P bonds through CDC reactions of C&#8212;H bonds in water.</dc:description>

      <title>Dearomatization and Functionalization of Aromatic Rings via &#951;3&#8208;Benzyl Palladium Intermediates</title>
      <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates recent advances on selective dearomatization and functionalization of aromatic rings via &#951;3&#8208;benzyl palladium intermediates. The importance of this topic relies on providing efficient strategy for dearomatization and functionalization of arenes and heteroarenes in mild conditions. A series of C&#8722;C or C&#8208;heteroatom bond formation reactions is summarized. Theoretical calculations are also introduced in details, accounting for the reactions occurring regioselectively in the benzene ring, rather than benzylic position. Details can be found in the review by Ming Bao and co&#8208;workers (S. Zhang, Y. Yamamoto, M. Bao, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2021, 363, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202000838).

      <title>Recent Advances in Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Chemical and Enzymatic Carbene&#8208;Transfer Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>The use of diazo compounds in the transition metal catalyzed coupling reaction to form C&#8208;C and C&#8208;X (X=O, S, N, Si, P etc.) bonds have been a well&#8208;established approach in organic synthesis. In this context, various transition metals such as Pd, Cu, Rh, Ni, Co, Fe, Ir etc. have been proved useful to generate metal&#8208;carbene intermediate which subsequently undergoes carbene transfer or insertion to form C&#8208;C, C&#8208;Si or C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. However, the use of most abundant, cheaper and environmentally benign metal such as iron to catalyze carbene transfer reaction have attracted a great attention in the last few years. Iron is the second most abundant transition&#8208;metal in nature and also an integral part of various biological systems which made it highly valuable to use as a catalyst in organic chemistry. This review is summarizing the efforts made after 2013 in the area of iron&#8208;catalyzed chemical and enzymatic carbene transfer reactions using diazo compounds as carbene precursor.</dc:description>

      <title>Engineering an Alcohol Dehydrogenase from Kluyveromyces polyspora for Efficient Synthesis of Ibrutinib Intermediate</title>
      <dc:description>(S)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypiperidine [(S)&#8208;NBHP] is a key intermediate for the synthesis of mantle cell lymphoma drug, ibrutinib.

By screening key resi&#8208;dues in substrate binding pocket of KpADH, an excellent variant Y127W was obtained with 6&#8208;fold improved activity of 119.3 U&#183;mg&#8208;1, 1.8&#8208;fold enhanced half&#8208;life of 147 h and strict S&#8208;stereoselectivity (&gt;99% ee). When catalyzed by Y127W, a complete conversion of 600 g&#183;L&#8208;1 NBPO was achieved at a substrate to catalyst ratio (S/C) of 30 in 10 h. Based on crystal&#8208;structure of Y127W, molecular docking and dynamic simulations reveal hydrogen bonds formed between W127 and Boc group of NBPO, as well as improved structural stability mainly contribute to the increased catalytic activity and stereoselectivity of Y127W. This study offers guidance for engineering ADHs for biosynthesis of chiral hetero&#8208;cyclic alcohols, and provides insights into mechanisms in catalytic activity and stereoselectivity toward car&#8208;bonyl&#8208;containing heterocyclic substrates.</dc:description>
