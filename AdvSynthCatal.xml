This developed strategy features easily available starting materials, broad substrate scope, ready scalability and high efficiency. Moreover, the antitumor activities of selected products against some human cancer cell lines were also investigated, and the results indicated that several products show the effective antiproliferative activities.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Organocatalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring represents an attractive yet challenging synthetic targets in the field of organic synthesis, especially in a stereocontrolled fashion. Over the past two decades, organocatalysis has emerged as an enabling technology for the facile construction of enantioenriched molecules with remarkably increasing complexity and diversity, and a myriad of chiral architectures containing bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane units were elegantly assembled through organocatalytic asymmetric transformations. This review summarizes recent advancements on this topic (mainly from 2010 to 2023),    emphasizing the reaction types such as desymmetrization  and cascade reactions of different prochiral starting materials toward various chiral bicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes as well as their aza, oxa and thio derivatives. Meanwhile, the synthetic strategy, reaction mechanism, substrate scope and synthetic applications of these catalytic reactions are also discussed. We hope that this review will motivate further development and application of organocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines via Cascade Sigmatropic Rearrangements</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a synthesis for tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines involving cascade sigmatropic rearrangements. The substrates were conveniently prepared from parent anilines via a [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement and cyanomethylation. Silver&#8208;mediated decyanation afforded the corresponding iminium cation, which underwent a cascade consisting of an aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement, an aza&#8208;oxa&#8208;Cope rearrangement, an aromatization, and a Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction, and tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines were obtained as the single product. The reaction involved seven bond scissions and four bond formations and was triggered by a single reagent.</dc:description>

         <title>NaHCO3&#8208;promoted Formal [4+3] Annulation of Salicylaldehydes with Isoquinolinium Salts Accessing Isoquinoline&#8208;fused Benzo[f][1,3]oxazepines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A concise and practical sustainable strategy for modular access to isoquinoline&#8208;fused benzo[f][1,3]oxazepine derivatives through a formal [4+3] annulation of commercially available salicyaldehydes with isoquinolinium salts has been developed. The reactions proceeded through the formation of two new bonds (C=C and C&#8208;O) and a seven&#8208;membered heterocyclic ring in one pot. Remarkably, use of simple NaHCO3 as a mild base, open atmosphere, nonhazardous reagents, nice functional group tolerance, and easily scale up are added characteristics to this approach. A wide range of substrates are compatible with this mild reaction system, thereby proving a facile and reliable protocol for constructing a benzo[f][1,3]oxazepine skeletons.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of AMA Synthase from Pyrenophora teres f. teres 0&#8211;1&#8201;for the Synthesis of Aspergillomarasmine A Analogues and Non&#8208;Canonical Amino Acids</title>

Abstract
The fungal natural product aspergillomarasmine A (AMA) is an inhibitor of metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamases and a promising co&#8208;drug candidate for reversing bacterial &#946;&#8208;lactam resistance. The biosynthesis of AMA from L&#8208;Asp and O&#8208;phospho&#8208;L&#8208;serine is catalyzed by AMA synthase, which possesses high synthetic potential for the biocatalytic preparation of AMA and related aminopolycarboxylic acids. Here, we identified and structurally characterized an AMA synthase from Pyrenophora teres f. teres 0&#8211;1 (PteAMAS). Crystallographic analysis revealed a unique homotetrameric fold and a highly hydrophilic active site, which supports the PLP&#8208;dependent &#946;&#8208;replacement catalytic mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of PteAMAS for the biocatalytic synthesis of AMA and its analogues, achieving structural diversification of the APA1 moiety through a modular two&#8208;enzyme system involving PteAMAS and a selective C&#8722;N lyase, namely EDDS lyase or 3&#8208;methylaspartate ammonia lyase variant MAL&#8722;Q73&#8197;A. In addition, we exhibited the usefulness of PteAMAS for convenient synthesis of various S&#8208;alkyl, &#8208;aryl, and &#8208;arylalkyl substituted L&#8208;cysteines, which are valuable non&#8208;canonical amino acids with broad pharmaceutical applications. The present study has not only provided the structural basis for catalysis and substrate recognition by PteAMAS, but also paved the way for biocatalytic preparation of structurally complex AMA analogues and various non&#8208;canonical amino acids.

         <title>Borane&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Transformation of Levulinic Acid and Hydrazines into Hexahydropyridazines and Tetrahydropyridazin&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones Using Hydrosilane</title>

Abstract
Borane&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation of levulinic acid and other &#947;&#8208;keto acids with hydrazines for selective access to hexahydropyridazines and tetrahydropyridazin&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones has been developed. The combination of B(C6F5)3 and Et3SiH allows for synthesis of various hexahydropyridazines and tetrahydropyridazin&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones in 67&#8211;97% yields with tolerance towards various functional groups and easy scale&#8208;up. This reaction can be rendered enantioselective by using a chiral borane catalyst generated in&#8197;situ from HB(C6F5)2 and a binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral diene and PhMe2SiH, affording the target products in 70&#8211;92% yields with up to &gt;99% ee. The judicious choice of borane catalyst and hydrosilane reductant proves to be critical for catalysis. Mechanistic investigations elucidate the catalytic pathway.

The combination of B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiH allows for synthesis of various hexahydropyridazines and tetrahydropyridazin-3(2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-ones in 67&#8211;97% yields with tolerance towards various functional groups and easy scale-up. This reaction can be rendered enantioselective by using a chiral borane catalyst generated &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; from HB(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a binaphthyl-based chiral diene and PhMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiH, affording the target products in 70&#8211;92% yields with up to &amp;gt;99% ee. The judicious choice of borane catalyst and hydrosilane reductant proves to be critical for catalysis. Mechanistic investigations elucidate the catalytic pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Six&#8208;membered endocyclic benzyl/allyl enecarbamates undergo a Pd&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylation process to generate endocyclic 1&#8208;azaallyl anions and Pd&#8211;benzyl/allyl cations. The ion pair then react with each other followed by reduction to ultimately give unprotected 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl&#8208;3&#8208;benzylpiperidines and 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl&#8208;3&#8208;allylpiperidines in 31&#8211;91% yields as single cis&#8208;diastereomers. These reactions represent a strategy to form unprotected &#946;&#8208;substituted piperidines, which generates elusive endocyclic 1&#8208;azaallyl anion intermediates by introducing the negative charge from the N&#8208;terminal.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Electrochemical Functionalization of Imidazoheterocycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Imidazoheterocycles have extensive applications in the pharmaceutical industry and agrochemicals. A comprehensive overview has been provided on the current advancements in the electrochemical functionalization of imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycles, which have been classified into ten different types of reactions. Electrochemical synthesis has emerged as a highly effective method for producing organic molecules, especially in the context of sustainable development. Employing electrons as the traceless oxidant, several C&#8722;H functionalization reactions of imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycles have been achieved at either the C3 or C5 positions. Electrons may serve as the reducing agent to synthesize pyridine rings that are either partially or fully saturated in imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines. The purpose of the review is to attract the interest of the scientific community and promote additional research on the functionalization of imidazoheterocycles using electrochemical methods.

Abstract
An efficient and operationally simple protocol to access N&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)amides/propiolamides and acrylamides via direct conversion of easily accessible nitriles (aryl/alkyl/alkynyl/vinyl) and in&#8197;situ generated CF3CHN2 as trifluoroethylating reagent has been developed. The protocol offers broad functional group tolerance under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, the conversion of trifluoroethylated propiolamide into its triazole analog via Ru&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloadditions using BnN3 clearly indicates its versatility in the synthetic applications.

         <title>Revisiting the Synthetic Utility of 4,5&#8208;Dehydro[2.2]paracyclophane</title>

Abstract
4,5&#8208;Dehydro[2.2]paracyclophane, an aryne species of [2.2]paracyclophane ([2.2]PCP) was reported more than half a century ago. However, despite its potential usefulness for preparing [2.2]PCP derivatives, this species is rarely considered in synthetic applications, probably because the efficiency of aryne generation and reaction with arynophiles are low under harsh reaction conditions of classical methods involving precursors. We have prepared o&#8208;iodoaryl triflate&#8208; and o&#8208;silylaryl triflate&#8208;type precursors and achieved generation of 4,5&#8208;dehydro[2.2]PCP, which reacted with a diverse range of arynophiles to afford functionalized [2.2]PCP derivatives, including [2.2]PCP&#8208;fused &#960;&#8208;extended polyaromatics. Our results highlight the synthetic utility of the historically overlooked 4,5&#8208;dehydro[2.2]PCP intermediate.

         <dc:description>








Abstract
Recently developed synthetic protocols for the preparation of &#955;3&#8208;phosphanaphthalenes have broadened the general scope of organophosphorus chemistry, but a versatile protocol is still missing. Here, we describe a scalable synthetic approach for the construction of various substituted phosphanaphthalenes. We have obtained 11 derivatives through rigorous study and have demonstrated the robustness of this method. The optical properties of these phosphorus compounds and their aza and carbo analogues have been experimentally compared. Here, we show the power of the method in extending the synthesis to even larger polycyclic aromatic systems with embedded phosphine rings toward its potential applicability to materials science.

         <title>Dual C2 Synthon Strategy for the Synthesis of Pyrimidines: Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Difunctionalization of Tertiary Alkylamines</title>

Abstract
Herein, we describe a two&#8208;component methodology developed for the synthesis of pyrimidine derivatives using tertiary alkylamines and amidines. Tertiary alkylamines serve as dual C2 synthons through copper&#8208;catalyzed aerobic difunctionalization of the &#945;,&#946;&#8722;C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. The process operates under mild conditions and uses atmospheric oxygen as the oxidant. Notably, by this methodology yields up to 85% yields are obtained and a broad substrate scope is shown. Mechanistic studies indicate that the annulation proceeds via a radical&#8208;mediated oxidation and C&#8722;N bond coupling process. This approach provides a pathway for synthesizing various heterocycles by employing tertiary alkylamines as dual C2 synthons.

This approach provides a pathway for synthesizing various heterocycles by employing tertiary alkylamines as dual C2 synthons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A methodology to access stereoisomeric sets of products bearing multiple stereogenic centers is still a significant challenge in asymmetric catalysis. We present herein our experimental studies on the stereodivergent synthesis of chiral hydrobenzofuran&#8208;fused pyrrolidines with three stereogenic centers via organocatalytic asymmetric dearomative cyclization and epimerization process. Chiral bifunctional thiourea catalyst could successfully promote the enantioselective dearomatization cyclization of 2&#8208;nitrobenzofurans with o&#8208;hydroxy aromatic aldimines, which enabled the synthesis of (3S,3aR,8bR)&#8208;hydrobenzofuran[3.2]pyrrolidines in 79&#8211;92% yields with &gt;20:1 stereoselectivities and 93&#8211;&gt;99% enantio&#8208;selectivities. While catalytic amount of DBU could induce the direct intramolecular epimerization of (3S,3aR,8bR)&#8208;hydrobenzofuran[3.2] pyrrolidines to its diastereomers (3R,3aR,8bR)&#8208;hydrobenzofuran[3.2] pyrrolidines in 72&#8211;87% yields without loss of stereoselectivities. The mechanistic pathways of the epimerization process were investigated by a series of control experiments study. This work provides an alternative and forward solution for the stereodivergent preparation of functionalized pyrrolidines with potential bioactivities.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of 4&#8208;Selenylated Oxazolones via Oxyselenylation of Ynamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Electrosynthesis of selenylated&#8208;oxazolone derivatives via cascade selenylation/cyclization of ynamides was disclosed. A series of diaryl diselenides, dialkyl diselenides, and heteroaryl&#8208;substituted ynamides was tolerated in this protocol and delivered 4&#8208;selenyloxazolones in 28&#8211;83% yields. The scale&#8208;up reaction and the oxidation of selenylated&#8208;oxazolone was performed to showcase the practicability of this method. Furthermore, mechanistic experiments indicated that a cationic pathway instead of a radical pathway was probably involved.

         <title>Catalytic Strategies for the Selective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Functionalized Amines via Hydrofunctionalization of Enamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
&#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Functionalized amines are two classes of important compounds, whose structural units are widely present in approved drugs. The hydrofunctionalization of enamides is the most direct and efficient method for constructing these two types of compounds. Regioselectivity is the focus of this conversion, and is largely influenced by the catalytic mode. Therefore, to selectively synthesize &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;functionalized amines, the progress in the catalytic hydrofunctionalization of enamides over the past decade is reviewed, and the catalytic pathways for this process discussed in detail. This account aims to objectively evaluate the effects of various catalytic pathways on the regioselectivity of hydrofunctionalization, to provide a new perspective on the selection of catalytic methods and the design of catalytic pathways for the selective synthesis of &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;functionalized amines.

         <title>[(5+1)&#8722;1] Cyclization of Nitroepoxides to Pyridinium 1,4&#8208;Zwitterionic Thiolates for the Synthesis of Indolizine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The synthesis of indolizine derivatives was achieved through the reaction of pyridinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates with a diverse array of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;nitro&#8208;3&#8208;aryloxiranes. Subsequent investigations unveiled a synthetic route to indolizines via a stepwise [(5+1)&#8722;1] pathway, with unstable pyridothiazines serving as transient intermediates. DFT calculations elucidated that this transformation entails sequential annulation, deacylation, desulfurization, and oxidation steps.

Abstract
We, herein, report a base free, photocatalytic decyanation of &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles. A range of amides and lactams were obtained in 52&#8211;95% yields. Control experiments indicate O2 as an amide/lactam oxygen source and the reaction (lactam formation) follows radical pathway via dioxetanimine species. This methodology also applied for &#945;&#8208;ester/aldehyde substituted pyrrolidines in the presence of a base, probably via decarboxylation pathway.

Abstract
Germanium (Ge), a congener of carbon, possesses unique properties that hold extensive potential for applications across multiple domains. Recent years have seen significant progress in the development of carbon&#8208;germanium bond formation strategies, particularly those for more challenging C(sp3)&#8722;Ge bonds. This review systematically summarizes the recent advances in C(sp3)&#8722;Ge bond forming methodologies, with particular emphasis on (1) the versatility of transition&#8208;metals, including iron, nickel, copper, rhodium and palladium, as catalysts in broadening reaction scope and controlling selectivity; (2) the powerfulness of organic photocatalysis in achieving mild and selective bond formation, and (3) the sustainability of catalytic electrosynthesis in facilitating chemical oxidant&#8208;/reductant&#8208; free conversions. Additionally, examples of (4) non&#8208;catalytic strategies are also discussed. The representative scopes, as well as mechanistic proposals, of these protocols are highlighted. Through an overview on the current state of research, this review aims to offer insights into the catalytic construction of C(sp3)&#8722;Ge bonds, and provide perspectives on future research directions to address the current challenges.

Through an overview on the current state of research, this review aims to offer insights into the catalytic construction of C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;Ge bonds, and provide perspectives on future research directions to address the current challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition of Alkynes To Form Arenes and Pyridines at Low Catalyst Loadings</title>

Abstract
We report the Ni&#8208;catalyzed cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes at very low loadings of catalysts (0.05&#8197;mol% for all substrates). The nickel catalyst containing a terphenyl phosphine ligand allows carrying out the reactions at room temperature in only 30&#8197;min, providing the arene products as a single regioisomer in most cases. The Ni complex is also competent for the synthesis of polysubstituted pyridines through the cycloadditions of diynes and nitriles at mild temperatures (25&#8201;&#176; or 50&#8201;&#176;C) and low Ni loadings (1&#8197;mol%). Experimental data and computational studies support the involvement of monoligated PNi species in all fundamental steps of the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Photocatalytic Silylation of Aryl Alkynoates: Synthesis of Silylated Coumarins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we report the photocatalytic synthesis of 3&#8208;silyl coumarins using hydrosilanes as the silyl radical source with aryl alkynoates. Readily prepared N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts act as hydrogen atom transfer reagents for generating silyl radicals under photoredox catalysis. The reaction proceeds through a silyl radical addition to alkyne followed by radical cascade cyclization/migration with subsequent oxidation and aromatization to give the desired 3&#8208;silyl coumarins in 34&#8211;89% yield.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aroylchromones and Their Application in the Synthesis of Wrightiadione Analogues</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
With a number of biologically active members, 2&#8208;aroylchromones are valuable synthetic targets. A direct route towards 2&#8208;aroylchromones from 2&#8208;(methylsulfonyl)chromones and aldehydes via NHC&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond formation was developed. Yields of the synthesized 2&#8208;aroylchromones were up to 85%. Chromones with angioprotective or antibacterial properties were easily synthesized using the method developed. Additionally, the synthetic utility of the afforded chromones was demonstrated by using them to synthesize the anticancer compound wrightiadione and analogues of it.

         <title>Diaryliodonium Salt&#8208;Mediated Radical Transformation of Indoles with Alcohols for the Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Bis(indolyl)methanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A method for the synthesis of unsymmetrical bis(indolyl)methanes (BIMs) using simple indoles and readily available alcohols as the coupling partners under both heat and 390&#8211;400&#8197;nm light conditions was developed. Detailed research of the mechanism demonstrated that the diaryliodonium salt&#8208;mediated transformation undergoes a nucleophilic hydroxymethyl radical formation process. Moreover, the diaryliodonium salt&#8208;mediated method is also applicable for synthesizing symmetrical BIMs.

         <title>On the Functionalization of C60 with Vinylallenes Generated in&#8197;situ by Rhodium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The functionalization of fullerenes is important for several reasons, primarily related to enhancing their chemical reactivity, solubility, and potential of applications in optoelectronics and biomedicine. In this study, we present a novel approach to functionalize C60 through a cascade process encompassing an unprecedented Rh&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1,6&#8208;allenynes to in&#8197;situ generate a vinylallene that is followed by a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with pristine fullerene, resulting in the formation of 6,6&#8208;fused bicyclic fullerene derivatives. The mechanism governing this process was elucidated by DFT calculations and confirmed by deuterium labelling and control experiments, demonstrating the critical role of traces of water in the reaction medium to mediate the observed reactivity.

Abstract
The iron (&#1030;&#1030;&#1030;)&#8208;promoted tandem cyclization of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;(allyloxy)aryl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles with diselenides has been developed for the preparation of seleno&#8208;benzo[2,3][1,4]oxazepino[4,5&#8208;a]indole derivatives. The investigation to determine the best reaction conditions indicated the use of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;(allyloxy)aryl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles (0.2&#8197;mmol) with diselenides (1.5&#8197;equiv.) and iron(III) chloride (1.5&#8197;equiv.) in acetonitrile at room temperature under air, and more than 48 examples were obtained. The reaction features access to selenized 7&#8208;membered containing nitrogen&#8208;oxygen heterocyclic skeleton, which also represents a 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization process of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;((2&#8208;methylallyl)oxy)aryl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles and diselenides.

         <title>Chiral SPINOL&#8208;Derived Borophosphate&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric 1,4&#8208;Reduction of Exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones</title>

Abstract
An asymmetric 1,4&#8208;reduction of exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, yielding diverse optically active &#945;&#8208;substituted tetralones, has been achieved using a chiral SPINOL&#8208;derived borophosphate catalyst. The enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step of the reaction involves the protonation of a highly active boron enolates intermediate. This catalytic reduction system, comprising chiral SPINOL&#8208;derived borophosphate and pinacolborane, has potential for broader application in other asymmetric reduction reactions.

         <title>DMSO/SOCl2&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Thiomethylnaphthalenes from Propargyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we reported the straightforward synthesis of thiomethylnaphthalenes via the reaction of propargyl alcohols with dimethyl sulfoxide/thionyl chloride (DMSO/SOCl2), which also provided easy access to deuterated thiomethyl and other thioalkyl scaffolds when deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide and dialkyl sulfoxides were used, respectively. In addition, the thiomethyl group can be readily derivatized to the corresponding sulfoxide, sulfone, and sulfoximine of interesting photophysical properties.

Abstract
An expedient strategy for the construction of trifluoromethylselenolated spiro[5.5]trienones/spiro[4.5]trienones through a cascade electrophilic trifluoromethylselenolation cyclization and dearomatization has been developed. This sequential process was induced by N&#8208;trifluoromethylselenophthalimide (Phth&#8208;SeCF3), which was an efficient electrophilic trifluoromethylselenolation reagent. This approach has the feature of mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and high functional group tolerance.

Abstract
Benzofluorenes are an important class of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are widely used in materials science for light&#8208;sensitive electronic components. In addition, the benzofluorene skeleton also serves as a key structural unit in various natural products. Therefore, the development of synthetic strategies for the construction of benzofluorenes has been a prominent research topic in synthetic chemistry. Over the past few decades, numerous efforts have been made for the construction of benzofluorenes via cascade cyclization of alkyne units. This review aims to summarize recent advances in the cascade cyclization of alkyne units for the construction of Based on the different reaction mechanisms underlying these transformations, this review can be divided into four categories: (1) thermal&#8208;induced cascade cyclization of alkyne units for the construction of benzofluorenes, (2) metal&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of alkyne units for the construction of benzofluorenes, (3) acid&#8208;promoted/catalyzed cyclization of alkyne units for the construction of benzofluorenes, and (4) base&#8208;promoted cascade cyclization of alkyne units for the construction of benzofluorenes.

Abstract
Organocatalytic dearomatization of &#946;&#8208;naphthols has been achieved via a 1,6&#8208;conjugated addition of 2&#8208;naphthols to alkynyl 7&#8208;methylene&#8208;7H&#8208;indoles in&#8197;situ generated from &#945;&#8208;(7&#8208;indolyl)methanols. In the presence of racemic phosphoric acid, a series of tetrasubstituted allenes was obtained in high yields. Particularly, with the aid of chiral phosphoric acid, asymmetric dearomatization of &#946;&#8208;naphthols was investigated, affording axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes with moderate enantioselectivity.

Abstract
[10+2]&#8208;Hetero&#8208;higher&#8208;order cycloaddition between tropone hydrazides (acting as 10&#960;&#8208;components) and 3&#8208;alkylidene oxindoles (acting as 2&#960;&#8208;components) has been established. Under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis the reaction proceeded in a fully peri&#8208; and diastereoselective manner with the stereochemical outcome governed mainly by electronic interactions. Following such a strategy, a series of structurally diverse tetrahydropyridazines were prepared in 30&#8211;70% yields. Furthermore, the potential of the obtained cycloadducts has been confirmed in selected chemoselective transformations.

This work describes gold&#8208;catalyzed annulations of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;(dimethoxymethyl)phenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;prop&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;yl acetate substrates with &#945;&#8208;diazo esters and anilines, respectively yielding substituted naphthoates and indeno[1,2&#8208;b]quinoline derivatives. Our mechanistic analysis indicates 1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indenes as their common intermediates. In the formation of naphthoates, &#945;&#8208;diazo ester attacks at gold&#8208;bound intermediate via an SN2 pathway to enable a allylic methoxy substitution. For indeno[1,2&#8208;b]quinoline derivatives, there are two main reactions, including (i) a reversible formation between intermediate and a double amine addition product and (ii) an arylation reaction of intermediate. Species N&#8208;(phenyl((2E)&#8208;1&#8208;(phenylimino)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;inden&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)methyl)aniline was converted to indeno[1,2&#8208;b]quinoline in the presence of gold catalyst.

Abstract
The cyclization reaction and hydrosulfonylation reaction of ynones have been simultaneously realized through a single operation. Under the mediation of cesium carbonate, different S&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;hydroxyaryl) aryl thiosulfonates reacted with various ynones to produce functionalized vinyl sulfones in 37%&#8211;83% yields with E&#8208;selectivity. At the same time, a variety of benzoxathiins were formed in 42%&#8211;97% yields.

         <title>Base&#8208;Mediated Cascade Reaction of CF3&#8208;Imidoyl Sulfoxonium Ylides and Diimides for the Synthesis of Functionalized Amidines</title>

Abstract
A base&#8208;mediated cascade reaction of CF3&#8208;imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides (TFISYs) and diimides has been developed for the preparation of functionalized amidines. In the transformation, a cascade nucleophilic addition and subsequent [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of sulfoxonium ylide occur to enable an intramolecular migration of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The unexpected result of the developed protocol demonstrates the chameleonic reactivity of TFISYs.

         <title>Stereoconvergent Access to Z&#8208;Allylborons from E/Z&#8208;Mixed 1,3&#8208;Dienes via Cu&#8208;Guanidine Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Merging the stereoisomeric mixture of substrate into a single product through stereospecific transformation is a challenging but higher&#8208;order synthetic strategy, which perfectly meets the demand of cost control in the precise chemical production. In this work, the stereoconvergent synthesis of Z&#8208;allylic boronates was realized with protoborylation of E/Z&#8208;mixed 1,3&#8208;dienes catalyzed by a novel copper&#8208;guanidine complex. The reaction could proceed smoothly under very mild conditions with good functional group tolerance, and convert diverse aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes into the desired Z&#8208;1,4&#8208;addition products with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivities in minutes. Detailed mechanistic studies also helped to disclose the origin of stereoconvergency. Both E&#8208; and Z&#8208;diene were found directly undergoing a rapid borylation without E/Z isomerization of C=C bond, followed by a convergent formation of the same thermodynamically stable allylcopper intermediate before the slow protonation step occurred.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of 3&#8208;substituted 2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazines with an azeotropic mixture of HCO2H/NEt3 (5/2) using tethered Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;diamine catalysis has been realized. This process allows access to a broad range of chiral 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazines in high yields with up to 99% ee, and tolerates a variety of functional groups. The enantiocontrol is achieved by the judicious choice of catalyst and hydrogen source. This reaction proceeds with unexpected reversal of enantioselectivity, which is attributed to the acidic reaction conditions and the hydrogen bond between the N&#8722;H of the rhodium species and the O atom in the substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>Bidentate NHC&#8208;Containing Ligands for Copper Catalysed Synthesis of Functionalised Diaryl Ethers</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diaryl and heteroaryl ethers are important and common motifs in drug discovery and agrochemicals. Here we present a catalytic system for the copper catalysed arylation of phenols with aryl halides. Bidentate N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands provide a well&#8208;defined catalytic system that enable low loading of copper in effective coupling reactions (0.5 mol% Cu or lower). The reaction scope of aryl iodides and aryl bromides is developed, that is tolerant of functional groups and a library of biaryl ethers with lead&#8208;like properties is prepared. The presence of excess ligand (in a 1:3 ratio) is shown to be optimal to prevent catalyst degradation, presumably by avoiding decomplexation of the ligand. This is also supported by the catalytic results obtained with pre&#8208;formed copper complexes. The kinetics of the reaction are examined and shown to be first order in copper, supportive of a well&#8208;defined catalyst species, first order in phenol and aryl iodide, and zero order in base under the developed conditions. Computational studies performed using Minnesota MN15&#8208;L parametrisation method support an oxidative addition&#8211;reductive elimination pathway. Reductive elimination would be turnover limiting and occurr through an intimate ion pair intermediate.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Benzylidene imidazolones with an ortho&#8208;sec&#8208;amino group undergo chemodivergent photochemical transformations, based on the wavelength of irradiation. Irradiation at 525 nm causes dimerization and the formation of cyclobutanes with two spiroatoms, related to dictazoles in 87&#8208;98% yields. In turn, irradiation at 365 nm provides access to spirocyclic indolines in 67&#8208;92% yields. Each of the processes proceeds with exclusive atom economy and chemoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Fe(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Hydroamination of 1,3&#8208;Dienes Improved by Using Triphenylphosphate as an Additive</title>

Abstract
We herein report that the combination of Fe(OTf)3 and triphenylphosphate (TPP, (PhO)3PO) has proven to be an effective catalyst for the intramolecular hydroamination of amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes with an efficiency and scope superior to previously reported methods. This catalytic system demonstrated consistent performance with diverse aminodienes as well as aminoolefins, providing five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles. We propose a Lewis/Br&#248;nsted acid cocatalysis mechanism involving proton transfer through hydrogen bonding with TPP. Catalyst system consisting of inexpensive and nontoxic iron salt and phosphate additive, relatively low loading and recyclability of catalyst, and rapid and high&#8208;yielding reaction are the advantages of this protocol.

         <title>Visible Light Photocatalyzed Norrish Type II Reaction of Acrylamides for the Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Lactams</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Here, we present a strategy for the visible&#8208;light&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams based on the Norrish type II reaction. This protocol uses acetonitrile as solvent and commercially available photocatalyst to drive the reaction. Notably, various challenging substrate types reported in previous studies undergo conversion. DFT calculations further elucidate the reaction mechanism, while discussing the competitiveness between [2+2] cycloaddition and the Norrish II reaction.

Abstract
Chiral C&#8208;Glycosyl amino acids are prevalent structural motifs found in pharmaceuticals and natural products, making them a significant dimension for exploration in modern pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. However, the current synthesis methods for these compounds face numerous environmental and practical challenges, highlighting the critical need to establish more sustainable approaches. Herein, we report a simple and powerful strategy for the stereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;glycoamino acids derivatives. This method features the design and use of (&#8722;)/(+)&#8208;camphorsultam as an ideal chiral auxiliary, shielding one prochiral face of the glycine &#945;&#8208;carbon efficiently and imposing a high kinetic barrier for the epimerization of thus&#8208;generated chiral &#945;&#8208;carbon that two configuration products of R and S could be achieved independently. It proceeds under mild conditions, shows broad scope, and allows for the direct stereoselective glycosylation without metal and chiral ligand.

Abstract
TMSOTf&#8208;mediated 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig aminocyclization followed by N&#8208; to C&#8208;[1,3]&#8208;sulfonyl migration on N&#8208;homopropargyl hydroxylamines gave diastereoselective access to trisubstituted 3&#8208;sulfonyl cyclic nitrone (3&#8208;sulfonyl pyrroline N&#8208;oxide) derivatives. The synthetic utility of the 3&#8208;sulfonyl cyclic nitrone products was demonstrated through the diastereoselective synthesis of the sulfonyl&#8208;substituted nonaromatic N&#8208;heterocycles such as N&#8208;hydroxypyrrolidine, pyrrolidine&#8208;fused isoxazoline, and isoxazolidine derivatives.

Abstract
Here we reported the photo&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkylation of pyridyl&#8208;substituted N&#8208;benzyl anilines through nitrogen&#8208;centred radical 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer. A broad range of methylpyridyl&#8208;substituted aniline and hydroxylamine acid derivatives were successfully transformed into the corresponding products in moderate yields without adding any base and metal. This protocol features mild reaction conditions, a broad range of substrates, remarkable functional group tolerance and simple operation procedure.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Ortho&#8208;Halogen&#8208;Substituted Aryl(Alkynyl)Phosphinates Via Aryne&#8208;Phosphite&#8208;Haloalkyne Coupling</title>

Abstract
The one&#8208;pot formation of two C&#8722;P bonds and one C&#8722;halogen bond was achieved through a mild three&#8208;component coupling reaction utilizing arynes, phosphites, and haloalkynes. In this reaction, the aryl anion, generated from the nucleophilic addition of phosphite to aryne, directly attacked the halogen of the haloalkyne. The reaction proceeded smoothly with a wide substrate scope and good functional group tolerance. This operationally simple method enables direct access to ortho&#8208;halogen&#8208;substituted aryl(alkynyl)phosphinates. The synthetic utility of ortho&#8208;halogen&#8208;substituted aryl(alkynyl)phosphinates with prospective applications in natural product synthesis, medicinal chemistry, and materials chemistry has also been demonstrated.

         <title>Visible Light Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Reaction of Styrenes with Malonic Esters and CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A visible light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed bifunctionalization of styrenes with malonic esters and CO2 to form two C(sp3)&#8722;C bonds has been developed. The reaction proceeds at room temperature with 0.1&#8197;mol% of the organic photocatalyst (4DPAIPN) and cesium carbonate as a base at a CO2 pressure of 4&#8197;atm. This results in the production of 3&#8208;arylpropane&#8208;1,1,3&#8208;tricarboxylic acid esters in yields ranging from 48% to 99%.

Abstract
Organophosphorus compounds, especially phosphorylated heterocycles, are gaining increasing attention in the fields of materials science, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemistry due to their excellent biological activities. Consequently, the exploration of green and efficient methods for the synthesis of phosphorylated heterocycles has garnered significant interest from organic chemists. In recent years, visible light&#8208;induced photoredox&#8208;catalyzed organic synthesis has made substantial progress in the field of phosphorylation reaction since its eco&#8208;friendly and mild conditions. This review summarizes the advances of the past five years in the visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthesis of phosphorylated heterocycles using phosphine oxides as precursors through P&#8208;centered radical addition, cross&#8208;coupling, and cyclization reactions.

Abstract
The synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactam scaffolds is of paramount importance due to their extensive applications in pharmaceuticals, particularly as antibiotics. Visible light photocatalysis has emerged as a revolutionary approach in this domain, providing a sustainable and efficient pathway for &#946;&#8208;lactam construction. In this review, we meticulously discuss the recent developments in the synthesis of photocatalysed &#946;&#8208;lactam frameworks. A key focus is the Staudinger reaction, traditionally a cornerstone in &#946;&#8208;lactam synthesis, and its adaptation to visible light photocatalysis. We explore the mechanistic intricacies of the Staudinger reaction under photochemical conditions, along with other pivotal cyclization strategies enabled by visible light. By illuminating the novel photocatalytic routes to &#946;&#8208;lactams, this review provides a thorough understanding of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques and sets the stage for future innovations in the green synthesis of these critical compounds.

Abstract
Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed and K2S2O8&#8208;mediated synthesis of diverse sulfonylated 5&#8208;aroyl&#8208;2&#8208;arylpyridines was developed through one&#8208;pot stepwise annulation of two molecules of &#946;&#8208;ketosulfones and N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) under the sealed tube conditions. In the overall process, DMF acts as the synthon of one carbon and one imino moiety in the construction of pyridine skeleton via cascade formation of single (C&#8722;C/C&#8722;N) and double (C=C/C=N) bonds under refluxing DMF conditions. Plausible reaction mechanism is proposed and discussed.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Cyclization of 2&#8208;(Alkynylaryl)Acetonitriles and Amines: Access to 3&#8208;Hydroxyisoindolinones</title>

Abstract
Herein, we describe an approach to the synthesis of 3&#8208;hydroxyisoindolinone derivatives via copper&#8208;catalyzed tandem cyclization of 2&#8208;(alkynylaryl)acetonitriles and amines. This reaction is compatible with 2&#8208;(alkynylaryl)acetonitriles and primary alkyl amines containing various functional groups, providing the corresponding 3&#8208;hydroxyindolinone derivatives with yields ranging from 44%&#8211;82%. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction involves oxidation of the benzylic carbon, amide formation, hydration of the alkyne and intramolecular cyclization to produce various 3&#8208;hydroxyisoindolinones. The practicality of the strategy was further demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis, late&#8208;stage functionalizations, and the post modification of natural products.

Abstract
Bicyclo[3.3.0]octanes represent crucial structural motifs found in various bioactive natural compounds. In this study, we present the first metal&#8208;free formal [3 + 2] cycloadditions of alkyne&#8208;tethered cyclopropyl ketones via pyridine&#8208;boryl radical catalysis, affording bicyclo[3.3.0]octanes with high efficiency and broad substrate scope. This reaction features the generation of ketyl radical by pyridine&#8208;boryl radical and a consecutive 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig and 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cascade process.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Vinylation of Phosphines with Sulfones and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Herein, we report a manganese&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component vinylation strategy for the synthesis of vinylphosphines from readily available alcohols, sulfones, and phosphines via acceptorless dehydrogenative strategy. This multi&#8208;component, four&#8208;stage, one&#8208;pot protocol offers a stereoselective approach, overcoming the challenges associated with achieving these products through the hydrophosphination of terminal alkynes. The reaction utilizes sulfones and common alcohols to access both (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;substituted vinylphosphines (using methanol) and &#945;&#8208;substituted vinylphosphines (using primary alcohols) in yields ranging from 52% to 99%, with E:Z stereoselectivity of 95:5 to 99:1. Importantly, the synthesized branched&#8208;substituted vinylphosphines exhibited superior ligand performance in the copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl bromides with pyrazole compared to the commercially available PPh3 and diphenyl(vinyl)phosphane.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted, nitrogen&#8208;centered radical&#8208;initiated trifunctionalization of 5&#8208;hexenonitriles via diamidation and 1,4&#8208;cyano migration, using 1&#8197;mol% fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 as the photoredox catalyst, is reported. In this protocol, the O&#8208;acylhydroxylamine derivative acts as a bifunctional reagent, and the carbonitrile solvent also participates in the reaction. This transformation proceeds at room temperature, yielding a wide range of functionalized &#946;&#8208;amino nitriles, including the derivatives of natural products and pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergent C&#8722;H Alkynylation of 2&#8208;Pyridylthiophenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Different catalysts are presented to overcome or augment a substrate's innate regioselectivity. Rhodium was found to overcome the innate C3&#8208;selectivity via chelation&#8208;assisted rhodation. Conversely, palladium was found to enhance the innate C5&#8208;selectivity via electrophilic palladation. These reactions allow for the formation of a diverse range of synthetically versatile C3&#8208; and C5&#8208;alkynylated products from 2&#8208;pyridylthiophenes. Notably, this strategy was successfully employed in the straightforward synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended functionalized 2&#8208;pyridylthiophenes, which could be converted into more valuable compounds.

This one&#8208;step sulfonamide synthesis exhibits excellent reactivity toward highly electron&#8208;deficient and less nucleophilic anilines as well as aminopyridines while tolerating a wide range of functional groups. In addition to the desired sulfonamide target, we also isolated an ionic salt as the sole side product from the reaction mixture that has been identified as bis[1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;3&#8208;ium] hexafluorosilicate (IV). The glass surface of reaction vessel is acting as the source of silicon present in the isolated side product. Formation of hexafluorosilicate salt is also facilitating the consumption of sulfonyl fluoride for sulfonamide synthesis. Optimization of the reaction under various conditions, as well as the isolation of the bis[1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;3&#8208;ium] hexafluorosilicate (IV) salt, highlight the crucial role of N&#8208;methylimidazole and support the glass&#8208;assisted approach. Besides the first example of glass&#8208;assisted SuFEx catalyzed by benign organic bases, this reaction also offers an alternative route for accessing protic hexafluorosilicate&#8208;based molten salts without employing external HF. The synthetic utility of this SuFEx route for late&#8208;stage functionalization is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Cascade Trifluoromethylation of Dienes and Enynes using a Perylene Diimide (PDI) Organophotocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Perylene diimide (PDI) is an underexplored synthetic organic dye with significant potential in photoredox catalysis. We have developed a good chemo&#8208; and regioselective, atom&#8208;economical methodology for synthesizing trifluoroethylated saturated heterocyclic derivatives and trifluoroethyl&#8208;containing cyclobutane derivatives. This process involves the generation of trifluoromethyl radical from the Langlois (CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Na) reagent under photoredox conditions, which selectively reacts with the electron&#8208;rich terminal double/triple bonds in the diene/enyne framework. The resulting intermediate undergoes a cascade cyclization, yielding the desired compounds in a redox&#8208;neutral manner. Our methodology operates under very mild conditions, eliminating the need for transition metals and external oxidizing agents. It is broadly applicable across various substrates and is supported by comprehensive mechanistic insights from regular photophysical experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective One&#8208;pot Double Cascade Hybrid Formation/[3+3] Spirocyclization for the Synthesis of 3&#8208;Spiropiperidines Under Phase Transfer Conditions.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report an efficient approach to synthesizing hybrid 3&#8208;spiropiperidines heterocycles that incorporate both 3&#8208;isochromanone and 3&#8208;isoindolinone units through a one&#8208;pot, double cascade reaction facilitated by an economical K&#8322;CO&#8323;/TBAB catalytic system. By examining the nucleophilicity of the lactone 3&#8208;isochromanone, we developed a cascade reaction pathway that first generates a bi&#8208;nucleophilic hybrid intermediate, which then undergoes [3+3] spirocyclization with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The regioselectivity of the spirocyclization strongly depends on the substitution pattern of lactam ring. The process exhibits high diastereoselectivity, even with the formation of three or four stereocenters, including two contiguous quaternary carbons. These sequential cascade reactions were successfully scaled up, and the subsequent reactivity was readily analyzed, enabling the transformation of existing functional groups into valuable new functionalities.

         <title>Selective 1,2&#8208;Carboimination of Isothiocyanates to Access S&#8208;Substituted Isothioureas via Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we introduce a novel method for the synthesis of S&#8208;substituted isothiourea compounds via the selective 1,2&#8208;carboimination between oxime esters as bifunctional reagents and the C=S bond of isothiocyanates under visible&#8208;light catalysis. This approach deviates from conventional methods by precisely modulating the substrate electronics to selectively functionalize the C=S bond of isothiocyanates over the C=N bond, eliminating the need for strong bases and high temperatures and bypassing the formation of thiourea intermediates. Consequently, this protocol enables the efficient one&#8208;step synthesis of S&#8208;alkyl isothioureas, with featuring mild reaction conditions, operational simplicity and broad substrate scope.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208; and Temperature&#8208;Switched Chemoselectivity: Controlled Synthesis of Diverse Pyrazolo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Divergent synthesis of two types of functionalized pyrazolo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines was established via a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol involving a tunable dehydrogenation process and deacylative oxidation accompanied by elimination of the HNO2 pathway. Key attributes of the procedure included the initial formation of C,N&#8208;cyclic&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;acyl azomethine imines and subsequent switchable chemoseletivity that either led to aroyl&#8208; and nitro&#8208;substituted pyrazolo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines or proceeded via deacylative oxidation and elimination of HNO2 pathway to afford the aromatized pyrazolo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines. The present approach features the use of readily available amines and aldehydes as raw materials, switchable chemoselectivity, wide functional group tolerance such as nitro, halide, aryl, aroyl and sulfonyl group, and easy separation and purification. A combination of control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided important insights into the possible mechanism.

The present approach features the use of readily available amines and aldehydes as raw materials, switchable chemoselectivity, wide functional group tolerance such as nitro, halide, aryl, aroyl and sulfonyl group, and easy separation and purification. A combination of control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided important insights into the possible mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of 2&#8208;Substituted&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethyloxazoles from Amides and Acetylene Gas in the KOH/MeOH/DMSO Catalytic Triad</title>

Abstract
Pharmaceutically prospective 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethyloxazoles are synthesized in 16&#8211;58% yield via cascade assembly of one molecule of primary amide with two molecules of acetylene gas in the KOH/MeOH/DMSO catalytic triad (90&#8201;&#176;C, 2&#8197;h). This self&#8208;organization of oxazoles demonstrates unexpected successful competition with the alkaline hydrolysis of amides. The mechanism involving amide N&#8208;vinylation, enamine&#8208;imine isomerization, imine ethynylation and intramolecular O&#8208;vinylation cascade sequence has been deduced and supported by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations using the B2PLYP&#8722;D3/6&#8208;311+G**//B3LYP/6&#8208;31+G*+IEF PCM (B3LYP/6&#8208;31+G*) approach.

Abstract
Aerobic oxidative tandem C(sp3)&#8722;H imination and amination between pyridylmethane and aminomethane derivatives was demonstrated using a flavin&#8211;iodine&#8208;coupled catalyst. This method provides a simple and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of various 1,3&#8208;substituted imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines with fluorescent properties. The flavin&#8211;iodine catalyst efficiently promoted multiple reactions, including the oxygenation of pyridylmethane and subsequent oxidative C&#8722;N bond formation, utilizing only molecular oxygen, which is a sustainable ideal oxidant. The resulting 1&#8208;ester&#8208;substituted imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives exhibited dual&#8208;state emission in both solution and solid states. In particular, imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine with a bulky 2,6&#8208;dichlorophenyl substituent showed an apparent blue emission with good photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields (0.49 in CH2Cl2 solution and 0.39 in the solid state), making it promising candidate for use in optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Synthesis of Aza&#8208;S(VI) Fluorides and Primary Sulfonimidamides from Sulfinylamines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Aza&#8208;S(VI) fluorides are crucial compounds in the synthesis of various S(VI) derivatives, which find broad applications in drug discovery. However, the synthesis of sulfonimidoyl and sulfondiimidoyl fluorides have been relatively underexplored, often requiring lengthy reaction sequences and/or the use of hazardous gaseous reagents. In this study, we present a rapid one&#8208;pot method for producing sulfonimidoyl fluorides from sulfinylamines via a nucleophilic addition/electrophilic fluorination sequence. Similarly, sulfondiimidoyl fluorides can be synthesized using the same sequence, preceded by the formation of unsymmetrical sulfurdiimides readily generated in&#8197;situ from sulfinylamines. Whereas isolation of sulfondiimidoyl fluorides was not feasible, they could be efficiently converted into primary sulfonimidamides by base hydrolysis in a one&#8208;pot process. Furthermore, we explored the reactivity of aza&#8208;S(VI) fluorides with various nucleophiles, demonstrating a versatile synthetic platform for the synthesis of aza&#8208;S(VI) compounds.

A Cu/Pd&#8208;catalyzed tandem radical cyclization and C&#8722;H activation/carbene insertion of &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyls with &#945;&#8211;diazoesters has been developed for the construction of fused quinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;onescaffolds. The reaction proceeded well to afford a series of 3,5&#8208;dihydrocyclopenta[de]quinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives. Additionally, bioactive molecules such as sesamol and estrone could be modified by using this method.

Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed inert C&#8722;H bond functionalization using sulfoxonium ylides as metal carbene surrogates to replace the explosive and labile diazo compounds is synthetically attractive. Presented herein is a divergent synthesis of (CF3)&#8208;indazolo[3,2&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives based on C&#8722;H bond activation&#8208;initiated cascade reactions of 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;1H&#8208;indazoles with sulfoxonium ylides. The formation of products involves Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H bond metalation, carbene formation, migratory insertion, proto&#8208;demetalation and intramolecular condensation. In general, this newly developed protocol features simple substrates, structurally diverse products, step&#8208;economy and scalability. In addition, evaluation of the photophysical properties and anti&#8208;proliferative activity against three human cancer cell lines of the products thus obtained showed that some of them possess potent anticancer activity with potential self&#8208;tracking capability through fluorescence detection.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Enabled Synthesis of 1&#8208;Aryl&#8208;3&#8208;Sulfonylmethyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;Triazoles by Arylazo Sulfones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a novel and highly efficient method for synthesizing polyfunctionalized 1,2,4&#8208;triazoles. This approach leverages visible light and arylazo sulfones in combination with N&#8208;vinyl amides, in the environmentally friendly solvent ethyl acetate. Remarkably, the reaction proceeds without the need for (photo)catalysts, ensuring near&#8208;perfect atom economy and producing only water as a by&#8208;product. This method exhibits excellent functional group tolerance and can be scaled for both batch and continuous&#8208;flow processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation for Facile Access to Optically Active Dihydrodibenzo&#8208;Fused Azepines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of various dibenzo&#8208;fused azepines including 5H&#8208;dibenzo[b,e][1,4]diazepines, dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepines and 11H&#8208;dibenzo[b,e]azepines using chiral iridium diamine catalysts and HCO2H/NEt3 as the hydrogen source has been accomplished. A rang of chiral 10,11&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5H&#8208;dibenzo[b,e][1,4]diazepines, 10,11&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine and 6,11&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5H&#8208;dibenzo[b,e]azepines have been prepared in 82&#8208;94% yields with 82&#8208;99% ee. Diversely substituted substrates are suitable for this transformation, and a number of functional groups are tolerated. The enantiocontrol is achieved via judicious choice of catalyst, additive and hydrogen source. The synthetic potential of this reaction is explored through gram&#8208;scale reactions without loss of reactivity and optical purity and further transformations on products.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Access to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated &#947;&#8208;Lactams via Palladium&#8208;Catalysed Carbonylation of Propargylic Ureas</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Additive carbonylations typically necessitate strong nucleophiles, such as alcohols or amines. In this study, we carbonylated a poorly nucleophilic urea, under oxidant&#8208;free conditions. Our straightforward carbonylative strategy enables access to versatile &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams featuring an aminocarbonyl fragment, utilizing readily available propargylic ureas as starting materials. The employment of the PdI2/KI catalytic system allowed complete regioselectivity (5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig), high functional group tolerance, broad substrate scope as well as operational simplicity (oxidant&#8208;free, organic ligand&#8208;free and base&#8208;free protocol). The synthetic utility of these &#947;&#8208;lactams is showcased through late&#8208;stage functionalizations, such as Giese reactions and peptide couplings.</dc:description>

         <title>Batch vs Continuous&#8208;Flow Method to Synthesize N&#8208;(3&#8208;acylamidopropyl)lactams through N&#8208;C Bond Cleavage in Amides with Amidines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective N&#8208;C bond cleavage of amides to create value&#8208;added products through a transition metal&#8208;free approach has become a significant challenge. Here, we present a method to convert amides into N&#8208;(3&#8208;acylamidopropyl)lactams through sequential amide chemoselective N&#8208;C bond cleavage and amidine ring opening under mild conditions, applicable in batch and continuous flow processes. These methods utilize bench&#8208;stable reagents and are operationally straightforward and mild, enabling synthesis on a gram scale with excellent functional group tolerance. Additionally, the synthetic feasibility of these reactions under flow conditions has proven to be highly efficient, providing N&#8208;(3&#8208;acylamidopropyl)lactam derivatives with improved yields and shorter reaction time.</dc:description>

         <title>Carboxylate&#8208;Directed Oxidative Annulation via C(Alkenyl)&#65293;H Activation/Double Alkyne Insertion/1,4&#8208;Pd Migration: Synthesis of Functionalized Naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed double consecutive C(alkenyl)&#8211;H activation/alkyne insertion method utilizing a free carboxylic acid as a directing group in the preparation of functionalized naphthalenes is reported. The reaction mechanism involves a sequence of the C (alkenyl)&#8722;H activation/alkyne insertion/1,4&#8208;palladium migration/reductive elimination steps. The second alkyne insertion occurred at the phenyl ring of the intermediate generated from the first alkyne insertion via 1,4&#8208;palladium migration, which is an uncommon case in typical C&#8211;H activation/alkyne insertion chemistry, providing functionalized naphthalene products. Additionally, the kinetic studies and control experiments as well as density functional theory (DFT) studies are also investigated to elucidate the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Radical Borylation of Robust Carbon&#8211;Heteroatom Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Photoinduced borylation has emerged as a valuable strategy for synthesizing arylboronic esters. However, photochemical transformations involving inert bonds such as C(sp2)&#8722;F bonds are still challenging. Herein, we report a straightforward and operationally simple method for the activation of various inert carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds, enabling the synthesis of diverse arylboronic esters without the need for transition metals or catalysts. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the deprotonation of DMSO plays a pivotal role in the reaction, and the excited DMSO anion can undergo electron transfer to the aryl substrates activated by anionic sp2&#8211;sp3 diboron compounds, i.&#8201;e., [FB2pin2]&#8722;, thereby facilitating the cleavage of carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds. The reaction allows the conversion of diverse Caryl&#8211;hetero bonds in batch and flow reactors into the corresponding arylboronic esters. The products can be used in a subsequent Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling without isolation.

Abstract
A cascade regioselective 1,8&#8208;addition/biscyclization of 2&#8208;indolylmethanols with &#945;&#8208;(2&#8208;indolyl) propargylic alcohols has been developed via chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis. A series of chiral cyclopenta[4,5]pyrrolo biindoles bearing a quaternary stereogenic center were obtained in modest to good yields (72&#8211;95%) with high enantioselectivities (82&#8211;94%). Additionally, the photophysical properties of these hexacyclic bisindoles are examined, revealing bright fluorescence with high quantum yields.

Abstract
Herein, hydrogen&#8208;acceptor&#8208;free C2&#8208;selective iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H silylation of indoles and pyrroles with hydrosilanes via C(sp2)&#8722;H bond activation to generate the desired silylated products is presented. The developed protocol allows for the C&#8722;H silylation of a wide range of functionalized indoles with monohydrosilanes under iridium catalysis. Significantly, this process represents a rare silylation of C&#8722;H bonds using S&#8208;directing groups.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthesis of 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208; substituted chroman&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives via deaminative alkylation of amino acid derived Katritzky salts and tandem cyclization with o&#8208;(allyloxy)arylaldehydes has been developed. This approach exhibits functional&#8208;group compatibility with 31 examples and affords the desired products in yields of 16&#8211;88%. Mechanistic research results suggest that the formation of EDA complexes between the Katritzky salts and a base is the main reason for initiating the reaction.

         <title>Synthesis of Rutaecarpine Analogues by Borrowing Hydrogen Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A series of rutaecarpine analogues were synthesized in 11&#8211;90% yields via an iron (II) phthalocyanine&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;alkylation reaction of 3&#8208;hydroxyethyl quinazolinone&#8208;linked indole. Mechanistic investigation revealed that the formation of C&#8722;N bonds in the cyclization reaction occurs through intramolecular borrowing hydrogen annulation. The crucial intermediates in this process were verified by LC&#8211;MS analysis and DFT calculations, further supporting the proposed mechanism. Furthermore, biological evaluation demonstrated that some of the synthesized rutaecarpine analogues exhibited good anti&#8208;inflammatory activity.

Abstract
A three&#8208;component denitrative cross&#8208;coupling reaction mediated by visible light has been developed. Various 2&#8208;arylvinyl thiophosphate compounds were synthesized with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields using cheap, nontoxic, nonvolatile, and non&#8208;hygroscopic elemental sulfur (S8) as the raw material. These transformations allow the direct formation of C&#8722;S and S&#8722;P bonds without metal catalyst via a one&#8208;pot procedure.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of Alkyl Grignard Reagents with Alkenyl Carbonate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Herein, we report the alkylation of alkenyl carbonates using alkyl Grignard reagents and iron catalysis to generate C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds and provide synthetically useful yields over a range of substrates. The transformation allows the alkylation of a wide range of substrates, including aromatic rings, alkanes, cycloalkanes, heterocycles.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report the alkylation of alkenyl carbonates using alkyl Grignard reagents and iron catalysis to generate C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;2)&#8722;C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;3) bonds and provide synthetically useful yields over a range of substrates. The transformation allows the alkylation of a wide range of substrates, including aromatic rings, alkanes, cycloalkanes, heterocycles. This reaction has introduced a new family of electrophiles to the iron-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Ag&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of N&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethylisatin ketimines with conjugated exocyclic double bonds including &#945;&#8208;alkylidene succinimides and aurone derivatives was developed for the first time. Using a catalyst system consisting of a ferrocenyl P,N&#8208;ligand and AgNO2, the reaction provides a facile method for the construction of chiral pyrrolidines bearing four consecutive stereocenters and two adjacent spiro&#8208;quaternary chiral centers, as well as offers a direct route to structurally diverse enantioenriched CF3&#8208;containing 3,2&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidinyl spirooxindole derivatives.

         <title>Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Wavelength&#8208;Dependant Sequential Ring Transformations of Pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazolones.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inside cover picture illustrates novel wavelength&#8208;dependent transformations of pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazolones into 3D&#8208;rich heterocyclic systems. The robot with flashlights represents how two distinct products can be easily obtained by simply adjusting the irradiation wavelength, leading to either 1,2&#8208;diazepines through ring expansion or tricyclic product via consecutive 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization. These transformations are highly stereoselective, do not require photocatalysts or additives, and can be easily scaled up. For more details, see the Research Article by I. Kula&#353;i&#263;, B. &#352;tefane and co&#8208;workers (I. Kula&#353;i&#263;, N. Petek, H. Brodnik, U. Gro&#353;elj, J. Svete, B. &#352;tefane, Adv. Synth.

         <title>The Chemistry of Levulinic Acid: Its Potential in the Production of Biomass&#8208;based Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomass has been identified as the ultimate sustainable resource for all carbon&#8208;based consumer products of the chemical industries in the future. Its catalytic conversion leads to the formation of various platform chemicals that could partially or even fully replace the fossil&#8208;based building blocks that have been currently used in synthetic chemical processes. Among these compounds, levulinic acid (LA) has been recognized as a member of the "Top Value Added Chemicals from Biomass" and has attracted significant attention since the seminal paper reported by Werpy and Petersen in 2004. This review summarizes the properties, recent advances, and developments in the chemistry of levulinic acid.
   The production of LA from both plant and animal&#8208;based carbohydrate feedstocks via 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural or furfuryl alcohol is discussed from a mechanistic perspective, highlighting intrinsic molecular&#8208;level limitations to LA formation. The efficiencies of recently developed catalytic systems are also summarized and compared. Furthermore, the conversion of LA into high&#8208;value&#8208;added downstream chemicals, including its role in the synthesis of complex molecular structures, is overviewed. This section discussed the reactions of LA in the points of view of its various transformations on carbonyl&#8208;, carboxy&#8208;, methyl&#8208;, and methylene functional groups. The reactions of these functionalities with C&#8208; ,N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and S&#8208;nucleophiles, alcohols, amines, organometallic reagents, oxygen etc. were thematically summarized.
   Our review also outlooks to highlight the challenges and opportunities associated with the extensive research area of organic chemistry of levulinic acid.

Among these compounds, levulinic acid (LA) has been recognized as a member of the "Top Value Added Chemicals from Biomass" and has attracted significant attention since the seminal paper reported by Werpy and Petersen in 2004. This review summarizes the properties, recent advances, and developments in the chemistry of levulinic acid.
   The production of LA from both plant and animal-based carbohydrate feedstocks via 5-hydroxymethylfurfural or furfuryl alcohol is discussed from a mechanistic perspective, highlighting intrinsic molecular-level limitations to LA formation. The efficiencies of recently developed catalytic systems are also summarized and compared. Furthermore, the conversion of LA into high-value-added downstream chemicals, including its role in the synthesis of complex molecular structures, is overviewed. This section discussed the reactions of LA in the points of view of its various transformations on carbonyl-, carboxy-, methyl-, and methylene functional groups. The reactions of these functionalities with C- ,N-, O-, and S-nucleophiles, alcohols, amines, organometallic reagents, oxygen etc. were thematically summarized.

         <dc:description>While arylazo sulfones have been widely applied as arylating agents, their exploitation for diazenylation reactions has been previously limited to electron&#8208;rich alkenes such as styrenes and silyl enol ethers.

The satisfactory substrate scope and functional group tolerance, along with scale&#8208;up reaction both in batch and under continuous flow conditions provide a valuable approach to such a class of heteroaryl azo compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Acid&#8208;Mediated Oxidative C&#8208;H Phosphorylation of Quinoxalines and Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quinoxaline is a chemical moiety known for its diverse physicochemical and biological properties, making it the focus of extensive research. Over the past few decades, quinoxaline scaffolds have been utilized in the design and development of various bioactive molecules, dyes, fluorescent materials, electroluminescent materials, organic sensitizers for solar cells, and polymeric optoelectronic materials. Herein, we present a metal&#8208;free and rapid protocol for the phosphorylation of quinoxalines and quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one. This method employs oxygen as an oxidant under ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, with experimental evidence indicating the absence of radical involvement. Our methodology provides range of phosphorylated quinoxalines and quinoxaline&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one in yields ranging from 47% to 99%.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual NHC/HAT&#8208;Promoted Esterification to Access &#945;&#8208;Aryl Glycines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Aryl glycines are among the more important carbonyl compounds, particularly as nonproteinogenic &#945;&#8208;amino acids present in many pharmacophores. As such, many strategies have been developed to access this motif, but direct carboxylation methods remain underdeveloped. Herein, we employ a dual NHC/HAT catalysis strategy to access 2&#8208;azaallyl radicals, which subsequently couple with in situ generated ester azolium radical intermediates. Base&#8208;mediated collapse of the ensuing tetrahedral intermediate liberates the NHC catalyst and benzophenone protected aryl glycine. This methodology was employed to esterify obtain a variety of aryl substituted glycine derivatives, as well as allylic and benzylic sites. Mechanistic studies reveal that this radical process operates under both oxidative and reductive quenching cycles, while preliminary experiments employing a chiral NHC and Lewis acid additive demonstrate modest enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving the Photochemical Skeletal Enlargement of Pyridines to 1,2&#8208;Diazepines with Isocyanates
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we extend the one&#8208;pot protocol to synthesize 1,2&#8208;diazepines from commercially available and cheap starting materials. Capitalizing on isocyanate derivatives as activating agents, the photochemical skeletal enlargement occurs, while preserving key functional groups embedded in more than 30 substrates. We also demonstrated that isocyanates can be generated in situ exploiting the wealth of methods starting from bench stable resources. Compare to previous strategies, the use of these precursors prevents the presence of deleterious HCl traces in the system, thus enabling the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;diazepines in high yields over up to 5 sequential steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of EDA&#8208;Complex Photochemical Reactions Using Computational Vision</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a multidimensional screening strategy to discover Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor (EDA) complex photochemical reactions using only simple photographic devices, such as webcams or cellphones, combined with TLC analysis. An algorithm was designed to automatically identify EDA&#8208;complex reactive mixtures in solution by processing digital images from a 96&#8208;well microplate, alongside TLC results. The code detects the absorption region of the mixture in the visible spectrum and quantifies color changes through grayscale values. Integrated automatic TLC analysis further classifies mixtures as colorimetric reactions, non&#8208;reactive, or potentially reactive EDA complexes. Leveraging this screening platform, we have developed a new EDA&#8208;mediated approach to synthesize iminophosphoranes in yields up to 90%.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstructive synthesis of fluorinated dihydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indolones by a cyclohexadione cut&#8208;to&#8208;fuse strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a fluorinative ring&#8208;cleavage reaction that breaks C&#8211;C bonds in cyclic &#946;&#8208;diketones bearing aryl moiety using N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) in the presence of inorganic carbonates (Cs2CO3 or K2CO3) in methanol at room temperature within one hour. Generated fluorinated keto acid esters bearing ortho&#8208;nitro aryl groups were transformed into fluorinated dihydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indolones (DHPIs) via reductive cyclization using B2(OH)4 followed by amidation in the presence of  K2CO3. This "cut&#8208;to&#8208;fuse" strategy enables the reconstructive synthesis of valuable fused heterocycles from relatively simple cyclohexadione.</dc:description>

         <title>Trifluoroacetic Acid Promotes Umpolung of 2&#8208;Methylindole to Achieve C(sp3)&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An umpolung strategy for the C(sp3)&#8208;H aminomethylation of 2&#8208;methylindole has been developed using trifluoroacetic acid to induce the transformation, with aminals serving as precursors of iminium ion. Mechanistic studies have clearly shown that trifluoroacetic acid may play a pivotal role in this strategy. The utilization of readily available starting materials, mild reaction conditions, tolerance to complex functional groups, combine with yields of up to 98% and potential biological applications render this protocol applicable and useful for organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deuterated hydroxyl acids and amino acids have been widely utilized in life science, biochemistry and drug development. Site&#8208;selective and stereoselective synthesis of deuterated hydroxyl acids and amino acids remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the development of a robust whole&#8208;cell&#8208;based chemoenzymatic platform for the synthesis of deuterated hydroxyl acids and amino acids from off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf aldehydes in high yields with excellent selectivities and levels of deuteration. The platform delivers products with diverse scaffolds and deuteration patterns, as well as broad scopes with both aromatic and aliphatic side chains. The application of the platform was demonstrated by the concise synthesis of a deuterium&#8208;containing antiparkinson's disease candidate. This platform provides a concrete foundation for accessing amino acid isotopologs for potential applications in research and drug discovery and development.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Sulfoximinocyclopentenones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of 4&#8208;sulfoximinocyclopent&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones were prepared in 35 to 99% yield through a calcium(II)&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;Piancatelli reaction, including in enantioenriched form.

Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric dearomative arylation of 2&#8208;naphthols enabled by the unconventional reactivity of o&#8208;quinone diimides, i.&#8201;e. the 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition on quinone sp2 hybridized carbon, has been established. Under the catalysis of chiral phosphoric acid, various cyclohexaenones bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter have been prepared with excellent yields and enantioselectivities.

Abstract
A strategy to access fluorinated spiroindolenines has been developed, involving a selective functionalization of indoles with fluorinated moieties and subsequent catalytic dearomatization. Trifluomethylthio (SCF3), diethyl phosphono(difluoromethyl)thio (SCF2P(O)(OEt)2) and (phenylsulfonyl)difluoromethyl (CF2SO2Ph) groups were embedded at the C2 position of indole derivatives substituted with alkynes, allenes, and allyl carbonate moieties at the C3 position. A gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization gave access to five spiroindolenines, and an enantioselective palladium catalyzed cyclization provided 10 fluorinated spirocyclic products with up to 77% ee.

         <title>Intramolecular Buchner Reaction: Experimental and Theoretical Comparison of the Effect of the Carbene Substituent on the Chemoselectivity</title>

Abstract
The intramolecular Buchner reaction is a powerful transformation able to dearomatize benzenic rings. However, the competitive C&#8722;H insertion of the carbene moiety into benzylic positions still remains a limitation, and the reasons governing this uncomplete chemoselectivity are poorly understood. The carbene substitution, in particular, has been observed to influence the selectivity strongly, though the currently proposed explanation relying on the electrophilicity of the metallocarbene hardly describes some experimental results reported in the literature. In this article, we present our experimental observations of intramolecular rhodium&#8208;catalyzed Buchner reactions, combined with DFT calculations on selected carbene substituents, to propose a complementary explanation for the observed chemoselectivity modification.

         <title>Two Photocatalytic Pathways for Reductive Dearomatizations of N&#8208;Arylformylindoles by a Visible&#8208;Light Triplet Organocatalyst</title>

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light triplet photocatalyst 5&#8208;acetyl&#8208;2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;benzoic acid methyl ester (AcBSH) was developed through introducing acetyl into benzenethiolate to improve the efficiency of intersystem crossing (ISC) and using o&#8208;methoxyformyl to increase the molar extinction coefficient. In the photocatalytic system of AcBSH, the reductive dearomatization of N&#8208;arylformylindoles is achieved to afford the desired indolines in moderate to excellent yields, including both indoles without (1) and with 2&#8208;substituent (2). The 2&#8208;substituent is a steric hindrance for the conjugation between benzoyl and indole moiety, and makes indole 2 and indole 1 exhibit different reduction potentials (Ered) and different triplet energy levels (&#916;ET). Thereby, two kinds of substrates undergo primarily two photocatalytic pathways: i) successive SET/protonation pathway, which merging photosensitization via triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (EnT) and photoinduced SET for substrates 1, and ii) single electron transfer (SET) from the triplet photocatalyst and a concerted hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process for substrates 2.

         <title>Dearomative Functionalization of Activated Quinolines: Transfer Hydrogenation/Cycloaddition Cascade to Construct &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Amines</title>

Abstract
Cascade dearomative functionalization is a robust protocol to convert flat arenes into medicinally relevant three&#8208;dimensional architectures with added new functionality. Herein, a dearomative cycloaddition protocol for synthesizing tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;embedded &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine scaffolds has been developed employing quinolinium salts and sulfonyl azides under metal&#8208;free conditions. An underexplored and mechanistically distinct pathway is unveiled, creating quaternary&#8208;center&#8208;bearing amine skeletons by an amine group migration during the transfer hydrogenation and cycloaddition cascade reaction. This approach provided a broad substrate scope of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine scaffolds from a plethora of C3&#8208;substituted quinolinium and sulfonyl azides. The post&#8208;synthetic modifications have further diversified the &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine core into interesting scaffolds. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested the involvement of aziridine ring formation for the amine migration to the C&#8208;3 position of quinoline to generate the &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine core.

Abstract
The dearomatizations of non&#8208;activated arenes, particularly those under mild reaction conditions, are highly desired transformations in organic synthesis due to their power in converting flat aromatic rings into three&#8208;dimensional frameworks. Although hypervalent iodine (HVI)&#8208;mediated dearomatization of phenol derivatives has developed rapidly, HVI&#8208;mediated dearomatization of non&#8208;activated arenes remains an urgent and challenging task. To fulfil this task, in this work, we established an HVI&#8208;mediated oxidative dearomatization of non&#8208;activated arenes by using biphenylureas and N&#8208; or O&#8208;nucleophiles as reactants. This electrophilic dearomatization (DEAr) process is highly regioselective, which enabled different N&#8208; and O&#8208;nucleophiles to react at the distal C4&#8208;position of the phenyl ring, thus generating dearomative spiro&#8208;products in a single step under mild conditions with wide substrate scope (43 examples, 22%&#8211;76% yield). This approach not only provides a successful example for dearomatization of non&#8208;activated arenes under mild reaction conditions, but also has overcome the challenges in HVI&#8208;mediated dearomatization of non&#8208;activated arenes, which will enrich the chemistry of dearomatization.

Although hypervalent iodine (HVI)-mediated dearomatization of phenol derivatives has developed rapidly, HVI-mediated dearomatization of non-activated arenes remains an urgent and challenging task.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Aerobic Dearomatization of Naphthylamines under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>

Abstract
The dearomatization of aromatic substrates via photocatalytic methodologies has gained escalating prominence to access molecular complexity. Although much focus has been put on non&#8208;active arenes, naphthols and N&#8208;based heteroaromatics, arylamines have so far remained in the background. Herein, we report a photocatalytic strategy for the aerobic, dearomative hydroxylation of naphthylamines under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Our investigation highlights singlet oxygen generation as a viable mechanism for aromaticity disruption, mitigating selectivity issues deriving from the direct oxidation of targeted arylamines. Finally, we showcased the synthetic value of the obtained dearomatized products in a late&#8208;stage diversification campaign.

Abstract
Daphenylline, a structurally unique triterpenoid Daphniphyllum alkaloid, has attracted considerable attention from the synthetic community since its isolation. Herein, we delineate an enantioselective total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;daphenylline, which is based on a gold&#8208;catalyzed dearomatization reaction of &#946;&#8208;methoxynaphthalene. Other features include installation of the initial chiral stereocenter via an enantioselective rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of an alkylidene&#8208;indane derivative; construction of the other vital stereocenter by organocatalytic asymmetric Mukaiyama&#8211;Michael reaction of a structurally complex benzofused cyclohexanone; and a tandem reductive amination/amidation double cyclization reaction to assemble the distinctive azapolycyclic cage&#8208;like architecture.

Abstract
The spirocyclic framework is found in many natural products, some of which are biologically active. However, It remains a challenge to develop environmentally friendly and atom&#8208;economic synthetic methods. Herein, we report an intramolecular dearomatization reaction of benzene derivatives enabled by electrochemistry&#8208;mediated two successive single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer (SET) processes, providing an alternative method for the rapid construction of spirocyclic skeletons without using sacrificial reagents. A series of cyclohexadiene products were obtained in 25&#8211;81% yields. Furthermore, a proposed mechanism involving a sequential electron transfer event was supported by cyclic voltammetry experiments. This strategy features transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions and easy handling, which will greatly enhance its practical utility.

Abstract
Dearomative trifluoromethylation of arenes provides an ideal method for constructing CF3&#8208;containing three&#8208;dimensional architectures which are of increasing interest in drug discovery. However, such transformation is rare and challenging because of the inherently low reactivity of arene &#960;&#8208;systems and selectivity issues. Herein, we disclose a general dearomative 1,2&#8208;hydrotrifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes utilizing activation by temporary &#960;&#8208;complexation to chromium, thus affording convenient access to 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes bearing the privileged CF3 group. The versatility of this strategy further enables a dearomative 1,2&#8208;deuterotrifluoromethylation with high deuterated ratios. The related dearomative 1,2&#8208;(deutero)hydroperfluoroethylation reactions were conducted well for a range of chromium&#8208;bound (hetero)arenes. Finally, a reasonable mechanism was proposed based on the intermediate capture and control experiments.

         <dc:description>We describe a selective preparation of a variety of functionalized pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;c]tetrahydroquinolines and indolo[3,2&#8208;c]tetrahydroquinolines in 40&#8208;82% and 40&#8208;80% yields from alkynyl&#8208;tethered oximes with diaryliodonium triflates, respectively. The one&#8208;pot reaction underwent N&#8208;arylation, intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition, selective [1.3] or [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement of N&#8208;O bond in total three steps. Experimental studies revealed that EtOAc solvent and copper(II)&#8208;catalyst played crucial roles on the formation of these two tetrahydroquinoline scaffolds. Moreover, these two tetrahydroquinoline scaffolds could be converted into various tetrahydroquinoline building blocks by further transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Unsupported Nanoporous Copper Catalyzed Insertion of Carbenes from &#945;&#8208;Diazo Compounds into Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The insertion of diazo carbene into Si&#8722;H bonds with unsupported nanoporous copper (CuNPore) catalyst has been developed. &#945;&#8208;Aryl diazoesters, diazophosphonates, and unstable aryl diazoalkyls can be used as carbene precursors to exquisitely insert into the Si&#8722;H bond of silanes. A variety of &#945;&#8208;silylesters, silylphosphonate, and functionalized arylsilane were obtained in 35&#8722;82% yields. The reusability feature of the CuNPore catalyst for this insertion reaction demonstrated its high heterogeneous catalytic activity and practicality.Further, mechanistic studies revealed that the insertion of carbene from diazo compounds into the Si&#8722;H bond may include a three&#8208;center concerted transition state on CuNPore.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dearomatization of indoles with ynamides is a convenient access towards polycyclic spiroindolines, which can be initiated by &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;additions of ynamides.

Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed dearomative cyclization of aryl&#8208;substituted indolyl ynamides through 	regioselective &#946;&#8208;addition onto ynamides, providing pentacyclic spiroindolines in 81&#8211;97% yields with &gt;25:1 diastereoselectivities.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Nitro Compounds with Grignard and Organozinc Reagents for Synthesis of Functionalized Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The treatment of nitro compounds with Grignard reagents in the presence of a catalytic amount of FeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/4 &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;BuMgCl produced various types of secondary amines in good yields.  This reductive coupling most likely involves the compatibility of functional groups such as chlorine, benzyl ether, olefin, and acetylene. Moreover, the corresponding poly&#8208;substituted amines were not observed under these conditions.  When the Grignard reagents were replaced with organozinc reagents, functionalized secondary amines containing ester and nitrile groups were obtained in good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Arylation of Secondary Phosphines with Diaryliodonium Salts under Metal&#8208;Free and Non&#8208;Photochemical Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new, efficient, as well as metal&#8208; and irradiation&#8208;free approach for the direct arylation of secondary phosphines has been developed. The reaction employs diaryliodonium salts as electrophilic aryl&#8208;transfer reagents, effecting the P&#8211;Ar bond&#8208;formation in a single step, under mild conditions, using t&#8208;BuOK as a base and DMSO as a solvent, at room temperature. The protocol furnishes expedient access to diverse unsymmetrical triarylphosphines and, upon a one&#8208;pot oxidation, the corresponding triarylphosphine oxides. Experimental and computational studies support the inner sphere aryl&#8208;transfer mechanism through a reductive coupling at the hypervalent iodine center. The calculations also point to a key role played by potassium ions, providing extra stabilization to the P&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming transition state by binding the reactants via cation&#8208;&#960; interactions.

         <title>Bioactive Molecules from Lignocellulose&#8208;derived Platform Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ever&#8208;increasing prevalence of diseases and inadequate resources on Earth are threats to society. Biomass is an abundant resource, and bioactive compounds produced from biomass are environmentally benign in contrast to conventional chemical synthesis methods, which frequently depend on non&#8208;renewable resources. In addition, the functionalized monomers from biomass allow the atom economical synthesis of bioactive molecules. This review aims to provide insight into the synthesis of bioactive molecules from the lignocellulose&#8208;derived platform chemicals. Existing methodology and catalytic systems are summarized for the synthesis of targeted bioactive molecules from cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin&#8208;derived platform chemicals. The biological activities of bioactive molecules obtained from biomass, such as antioxidant, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and anticancer properties, are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Synthesis of Pyrroles from Nitroarenes with Glycols as Reductants</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of N&#8208;(hetero)aryl pyrroles directly from inexpensive and commonly available (hetero)nitroarenes via reduction with pinacol and annulation with 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyls or cyclobutane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols has been described. The process does not require an inert atmosphere and tolerates the presence of air and water. This non&#8208;noble catalytic system shows high chemoselectivity, allowing a diverse range of potentially reducible functional groups such as alkynes, alkenes, halogens, cyano, and carbonyls. Moreover, this strategy enables the reuse of a waste byproduct as reactant, facilitating the formation of challenging 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyls from accessible cyclobutane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols used as reducing agents.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This opinionated review underlines the increasing production of 1,3&#8208;propanediol (1,3&#8208;PDO) by whole cell biocatalytic fermentation of biomass and highlights how production has transitioned from petrochemicals to bio&#8208;renewables. Current uses of 1,3&#8208;PDO are listed. Some future prospects for evolving the current technology and expanding the chemical uses of 1,3&#8208;PDO use are discussed, with emphasis on catalytic and atom efficient chemistries. Lessons from the success of biomass derived 1,3&#8208;PDO are noted that may be applied to other bio&#8208;based organic platform chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of Sulfamoyl Radicals via Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Fixation of Sulfur Dioxide for the Synthesis of Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Herein, we report a new approach for the light&#8208;mediated generation of sulfamoyl radicals using sulfur dioxide as key building block and the direct application of these radicals in the synthesis of sulfonamides. In the presence of different photoredox catalysts, sulfamoyl radicals can be generated directly from SO2 or the SO2 surrogate DABSO (1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane&#183;bis (sulfur dioxide) adduct) and N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts as nitrogen radical precursors. Trapping of the in situ generated sulfamoyl radicals with selected electron&#8208;rich olefins affords different sulfonamides in up to 86% yield in a three&#8208;component procedure. This transformation provides an attractive and complementary approach for the in situ generation of sulfamoyl radicals as synthetic intermediates for the assembly of the sulfonamide functionality, a motif in active pharmaceutical ingredients.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amine compounds are widely found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides. We propose a base&#8208;facilitated synthesis method of polysubstituted aromatic amines. A simple, rapid, plateau&#8208;utilization, and highly regioselective non&#8208;in&#8208;situ amination reaction was achieved by using aryl thianthrenium salt as the aryne precursor, and the arylynyl distortion induced by the substituents. This method provides new possibilities for organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Combined Gold and Photoredox Catalysis: Synthesis of 3&#8208;Alkenyl&#8208;2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Indazoles from 2&#8208;Alkynylazobenzenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose the intramolecular synthesis of 3&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;indazoles from 2&#8208;alkynylazobenzenes promoted by a dual catalysis using AuCl3 and a ruthenium photocatalyst under irradiation with visible light. This reaction goes through a hydroamination of the alkynyl fragment. The yields are governed by the electronic factors. Control experiments and DFT calculations suggest that a radical and polar mechanisms are operating in parallel. This transformation goes through first formation and C&#8208;N bond and 1,2&#8208;hydride shift. Derivatization was also carried out to extend the versatility of this methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrofluoroether Synthesis through One&#8208;Pot Anodic Iodoalkoxylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of carbon&#8208;fluorine bonds can profoundly influence the chemical and physical properties of drugs, agrochemicals, and materials. Different methods allow the installation of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H units and C&#8211;F bonds including trifluoro&#8208; and difluoromethoxylations, reflecting the limited diversity of reactions available to synthetic chemists. We introduce the trifluoroethoxy group through an electro&#8208;oxidative iodination of alkenes as a versatile substituent for fluorine chemists. An iodoarene serves as an unusual iodine source facilitating the 1,2&#8208;iodoalkoxylation of a broad range of industrially relevant aliphatic alkenes in high yields (31&#8211;98%) showing high Markovnikov regioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Methodology to Control the Regioselective Installation of a Carboxylic Acid for the Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Diarylpropionic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A stepwise copper&#8208;catalyzed boracarboxylation then palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling methodology was developed to access 2,3&#8208;diarylpropionic acid derivatives regioselectively by pre&#8208;setting the position of the carboxylic acid in the boracarboxylation reaction. This method provides access to a wide range of aryl and heteroaryl products in up to 80% isolated yield. Pharmaceutical potential was demonstrated by synthesizing a glucagon receptor antagonist drug in 3&#8208;steps (31% overall yield) from commercially available 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylstyrene.</dc:description>

         <title>Recyclable All&#8208;in&#8208;one Organo&#8208;Photo&#8208;Auxiliaries Enabling (sp3)C&#8211;(sp3)C Coupling Reactions with Diverse Functionalities
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical C&#8211;C coupling reactions can be tailored to environmentally benign industrial chemical processes and preparations of valuable pharmaceuticals. Yet, recent approaches in this area are limited to using precious transition metal coordination complexes that facilitate light absorption and redox processes with benchtop chemicals. Herein, we propose a new paradigm that involves all&#8208;in&#8208;one organo&#8208;photo&#8208;auxiliaries, thio&#8208;heteroarenes, which exhibit unique photophysical properties. These thio&#8208;heteroarenes were employed to prepare several all&#8208;in&#8208;one ionic photo&#8208;salts from commercially available alkyl/benzyl and heterocyclic halides via aromaticity&#8208;mediated nucleophilic substitution reactions. From the library of &gt; 30 salts, we performed on&#8208;demand photochemical C&#8211;C coupling reactions to isolate numerous symmetrical and unsymmetrical diary/alkyl&#8208;ethanes with yields up to 84% and mass balance as high as 96%. We also investigated the influence of structural features/properties on the outcomes of the photochemical C&#8211;C coupling reactions. The current photochemical C&#8211;C method was successful in the isolation of &gt;30 photoproducts, including the natural product Brittonin A, a precursor of Imipramine, and derivatives of the bioactive Honokiol Analogues. Furthermore, transient absorption spectroscopy and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations were used to decipher the nature of light&#8208;promoted electronic transitions. The present research opens new avenues in sustainable photochemical C&#8211;C coupling reactions to afford valuable compounds and bioactive systems while avoiding the use of precious metals&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>PTC in the polyenolate&#8208;mediated [10+2]&#8208;cycloaddition for the synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acid precursors</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. The manuscript describes a formal [10+2] higher&#8208;order cycloaddition between 2&#8208;benzylideneindan&#8208;1&#8208;ones and &#945;&#8208;alkilidene azlactones as higherene precursors and  higherenofiles respectively. The reaction is realized under Br&#248;nsted&#8208;base catalysis utilizing the phase transfer catalysis approach. The key intermediate is an isobenzofulvene&#8208;derived polyenolate which acts as a 10&#8208;electron component in the higher&#8208;order cycloaddition. By using this strategy, a series of structurally diverse compounds containing a polycyclic hydrocarbon scaffold was prepared in 79&#8208;99% yields. In addition, the potential of the obtained [10+2]&#8208;cycloadducts has been confirmed by transformations, including the synthesis of a highly&#8208;valuable alpha,alpha&#8208;disubstituted N&#8208;protected alpha&#8208;aminoester.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Abstract. The manuscript describes a formal [10+2] higher-order cycloaddition between 2-benzylideneindan-1-ones and &#945;-alkilidene azlactones as higherene precursors and  higherenofiles respectively. The reaction is realized under Br&#248;nsted-base catalysis utilizing the phase transfer catalysis approach. The key intermediate is an isobenzofulvene-derived polyenolate which acts as a 10-electron component in the higher-order cycloaddition. By using this strategy, a series of structurally diverse compounds containing a polycyclic hydrocarbon scaffold was prepared in 79-99% yields. In addition, the potential of the obtained [10+2]-cycloadducts has been confirmed by transformations, including the synthesis of a highly-valuable alpha,alpha-disubstituted N-protected alpha-aminoester.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Initiated Uranyl&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation and Hydrosulfonylation of Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study investigates the visible&#8208;light&#8208;initiated uranyl(VI)&#8208;catalyzed activation of Si&#8208;H bonds through direct hydrogen atom transfer, which facilitates the formation of silyl radicals from silanes. The silyl radical can abstract a chlorine atom from the sulfonyl chloride, leading to the generation of sulfonyl radicals. These silyl radicals and sulfonyl radicals could react with alkenes and alkynes, achieving the first example of uranyl&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation and hydrosulfonylation of unsaturated C&#8208;C bonds. This method features mild reaction conditions and a broad substrate scope, and exhibiting exceptional functional&#8208;group tolerance. Consequently, it is suitable for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Raney Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Deuterium Labeling of Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Heterocycles and Pharmaceuticals under Continuous Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deuterium&#8208;labeled compounds play a pivotal role in physical organic chemistry, life sciences, and materials science. This has resulted in a surge of interest in deuterium&#8208;labeled active pharmaceutical ingredients in recent years. In this study, we present a continuous flow Raney nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange process that boasts compatibility with a wide spectrum of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles and pharmaceutical compounds. The broad applicability of the developed method was demonstrated through successful labeling of various purine bases, imidazoles, pyridines, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including complex structures like abacavir and remdesivir. Control experiments revealed Raney nickel's crucial role in the exchange process, showcasing the superiority of the continuous flow approach over batch reactions. Furthermore, a scaled&#8208;up experiment demonstrated the robustness of the catalyst.</dc:description>
