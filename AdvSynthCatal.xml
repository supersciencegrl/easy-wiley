         <title>Insight into the Modes of Activation of Pyridinium and Bipyridinium Salts in Non&#8208;Covalent Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A series of pyridinium and bipyridinium salts were prepared and their catalytic properties were evaluated in the aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between imines and Danishefsky diene. Depending on the substituents of the pyridinium/bipyridinium rings and on the nature of the counterion, two mechanisms of activation were demonstrated. In case of non&#8208;substituted rings, the substrate is activated through charge transfer involving the aryl ring on the C&#8208;side of the imine. When halogen atoms were introduced on the catalysts, the activation mode switched to halogen bond involving the imine nitrogen lone pair. Moreover, alternative activation modes based on hydrogen bonding and radical cation were ruled out. This work allowed us to develop two families of catalysts whose potential was demonstrated in the cycloaddition of various imines with Danishefsky diene. The first family is composed of the simple methyl pyridinium triflate and dioctyl bipyridinium triflate. The former is active only with imines bearing a p&#8208;methoxyphenyl group on the C&#8208;side and the latter was found to be efficient with imines bearing different substituents on both the N&#8208; and C&#8208;sides of the imines. The second family is based on halogenated pyridinium salts which proved active with almost all considered imines.

         <title>Non&#8208;Chelate&#8208;Assisted Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidative Heck Reaction of Fluorobenzenes and Other Arenes: When Does the C&#8722;H Activation Need Help?</title>

Abstract
The pyridone fragment in the ligand [2, 2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridin]&#8208;6(1H)&#8208;one (bipy&#8208;6&#8208;OH) enables the oxidative Heck reaction of simple arenes with oxygen as the sole oxidant and no redox mediator. Arenes with either electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing groups can be functionalized in this way. Experimental data on the reaction with toluene as the model arene shows that the C&#8722;H activation step is turnover limiting and that the ligand structure is crucial to facilitate the reaction, which supports the involvement of the pyridone fragment in the C&#8722;H activation step. In the case of fluoroarenes, the alkenylation of mono and 1,2&#8208;difluoro benzenes requires the presence of bipy&#8208;6&#8208;OH. In contrast, this ligand is detrimental for the alkenylation of 1,3&#8208;difluoro, tri, tetra and pentafluoro benzenes which can be carried out using just [Pd(OAc)2]. This correlates with the acidity of the fluoroarenes, the most acidic undergoing easier C&#8722;H activation so other steps of the reaction such as the coordination&#8208;insertion of the olefin become kinetically important for polyfluorinated arenes. The use of just a catalytic amount of sodium molybdate as a base proved to be optimal in all these reactions.

&lt;p&gt;The pyridone fragment in the ligand [2, 2&#8217;-bipyridin]-6(1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-one (bipy-6-OH) enables the oxidative Heck reaction of simple arenes with oxygen as the sole oxidant and no redox mediator. Arenes with either electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups can be functionalized in this way. Experimental data on the reaction with toluene as the model arene shows that the C&#8722;H activation step is turnover limiting and that the ligand structure is crucial to facilitate the reaction, which supports the involvement of the pyridone fragment in the C&#8722;H activation step. In the case of fluoroarenes, the alkenylation of mono and 1,2-difluoro benzenes requires the presence of bipy-6-OH. In contrast, this ligand is detrimental for the alkenylation of 1,3-difluoro, tri, tetra and pentafluoro benzenes which can be carried out using just [Pd(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]. This correlates with the acidity of the fluoroarenes, the most acidic undergoing easier C&#8722;H activation so other steps of the reaction such as the coordination-insertion of the olefin become kinetically important for polyfluorinated arenes.

         <title>Enantioselective 1,6&#8208;Conjugate Addition of Dialkyl &#945;&#8208;Diazo Methylphosphonate to para&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An asymmetric 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition reaction of dialkyl diazomethylphosphonates to para&#8208;quinone methides promoted by phase&#8208;transfer catalysis has been developed. A series of chiral diarylmethylated diazomethylphosphonates were accessed with up to 85% yields and 99% ee enantioselectivities. The resulting products were further transformed into bioactive compounds, namely, a chiral dihydrocinnoline phosphonate and a chiral &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonate, bearing diarylmethine stereogenic centers.

         <title>Organocatalytic Synthesis of Vinylene Carbonates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The organocatalytic synthesis of vinylene carbonates from benzoins and acyloins was studied using diphenyl carbonate as a carbonyl source. A range of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) precursors were screened and it was found that imidazolium salts were the most active for this transformation. The reaction occurs at 90&#176;C under solvent&#8208;free conditions. A wide range of vinylene carbonates (symmetrical and unsymmetrical, aromatic or aliphatic), including some derived from natural products, were prepared with 20&#8208;99% isolated yields (24 examples). The reaction was also developed using thermomorphic polyethylene&#8208;supported organocatalysts as recoverable and recyclable species. The use of such species facilitates the workup and allows the synthesis of vinylene carbonates on the preparative scale (&gt; 30 g after 5 runs).</dc:description>

         <title>Umpolung Strategy for Arene C&#8211;H Etherification Leading to Functionalized Chromanes Enabled by I(III) N&#8208;Ligated Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct formation of aryl C&#8211;O bonds via the intramolecular dehydrogenative coupling of a C&#8211;H bond and a pendant alcohol represents a powerful synthetic transformation. Herein, we report a method for intramolecular arene C&#8211;H etherification via an umpoled alcohol cyclization mediated by an I(III) N&#8208;HVI reagent. This approach provides access to functionalized chromane scaffolds from primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols via a cascade cyclization&#8208;iodonium salt formation, the latter providing a versatile functional handle for downstream derivatization. Computational studies support initial formation of an umpoled O&#8208;intermediate via I(III) ligand exchange, followed by competitive direct and spirocyclization/1,2&#8208;shift pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Cyclobutenes and Spirocycles via Asymmetric P(III)/P(V) Redox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An enantioselective phosphine&#8208;catalyzed transformation has been developed for the synthesis of chiral cyclobutene triesters and fluorinated spirocyclic compounds. The strategy involved a P(III)/P(V) redox cycling process, via in&#8197;situ reduction of phosphine oxide with phenylsilane. This catalytic methodology has enabled the enantioselective synthesis of functionalized cyclobutenes (24 examples, up to 94% ee). On the occasion of the extension of this study to &#945;&#8208;ketoester indenone substrates, a surprising reactivity has been discovered for the synthesis of spiro&#8208;indenone products.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Oxidative Homocoupling of 2&#8208;Acyl Imidazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A diastereoselective and enantioselective construction of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds is reported. Nishiyama's RuPhebox complex (2.0&#8197;mol% catalyst loading) serves as a chiral Lewis acid catalyst in conjunction with BrCCl3 and a base for the oxidative homocoupling of 2&#8208;acyl imidazoles via the stereocontrolled reaction of intermediate Ru enolates with in&#8197;situ brominated 2&#8208;acyl imidazoles. Cleavage of the achiral imidazole auxiliary provides optically active 2,3&#8208;disubstituted succinic acids which are useful intermediates in the synthesis of chiral compounds like the natural product class of lignans.

Abstract
A protocol for the synthesis of terminal N&#8208;vinylazoles from aromatic aldehydes, DMSO, and azoles has been reported. In this strategy, DMSO was involved in the construction of the C=C bond as a terminal carbon synthon. Both aromatic aldehydes and azoles could be well tolerated and give the corresponding terminal N&#8208;vinylazoles in 52&#8211;91% yields. Based on preliminary experiments, a plausible mechanism is proposed.

         <title>A Unified Approach for Divergent Synthesis of Heterocycles via TMSOTf&#8208;Catalyzed Formal [3+2] Cycloaddition of Electron&#8208;Rich Alkynes</title>

Abstract
We present a synthetic protocol for the construction of polysubstituted five&#8208;membered heterocycles via TMSOTf&#8208;catalyzed formal [3+2] cycloaddition of electron&#8208;rich alkynes, which features free from any metal, atom economy and water as the main by&#8208;product. Furthermore, alkenyl ether adduct has been verified as the key intermediate. Notably, by utilizing this approach, we can synthesize a broad range of polysubstituted furans, thiophenes and pyrroles, and extend this transformation to deliver fused&#8208;polyheterocycles. This reaction can be achieved on a gram scale and the corresponding products are intermediates for producing diverse potentially useful scaffolds.

         <title>Optimizing the Iodide/Iodonium/O2 Oxidation Cycle Enhances the Scope, Selectivity, and Yields of Hydroiodic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Multicomponent Cyclocondensation Reactions</title>

Abstract
Catalytic iodine in the presence of water acts indirectly as a source of Br&#248;nsted acid and, concurrently, generates iodonium ion and hydrogen peroxide, which mediate the final oxidative aromatization step in the multicomponent cyclocondensation of an aromatic amine and two aliphatic aldehyde compounds. The oxidative cycle in this and related iodine&#8208;catalyzed reactions is seldom discussed, generally unoptimized, and rarely investigated in detail. This work establishes that two independent catalytic cycles (H+ and I&#8722;/I+) drive such multicomponent cyclocondensation/ oxidation reactions, provided that the oxidant is generated in sufficient concentration to inhibit oxidation of the dihydroquinoline by the intermediate iminium cation. The complementary dual catalytic cycles, when optimized, act in concert to suppress side product formation, which simplifies isolation and purification of the self&#8208;aggregating products, and increases the efficiency and scope of the Wang&#8208;Kozlov multicomponent reaction.

         <title>Recent Advances in Organophosphorus&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation and Silylation Reactions</title>

Abstract
Over the past few decades, organophosphorus catalysis has emerged as a robust platform for the preparation of highly functionalized molecules with excellent control of reactivity and selectivity. Organophosphorus catalysis has the advantages of mild and metal&#8208;free reaction conditions. The easy&#8208;to&#8208;tune electronic and steric properties of phosphorus provide an easy handle for developing efficient synthetic methodologies with high stereochemical fidelity. This review describes the efforts to introduce boron and silicon functionalities into organic substrates catalyzed by organophosphorus compounds. These catalysts are categorized into nucleophilic, electrophilic, and biphilic phosphorus catalysts. Phosphorus compounds efficiently catalyze hydroboration of various unsaturated systems, carbonyl compounds, imines, etc.; hydro&#8208;/cyano&#8208;silylation of carbonyls; and silylation of alcohols. The present review emphasizes the scope of nucleophilic, electrophilic, and biphilic phosphorus&#8208;based catalysis to introduce boron and silicon functionalities into organic compounds, mainly from the recent decade.

Abstract
An iridium/f&#8208;diaphos catalytic system for the enantioselective hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;ketoesters via dynamic kinetic resolution is reported. The desired anti &#946;&#8217;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino esters were obtained in moderate to good yields (60&#8211;95%) with 72&#8211;99% ees and 91:9 to 99:1 drs. This protocol tolerates various functional groups and could be easily conducted on gram scale with lower catalyst loading (TON up to 9100).

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Continuous&#8208;Flow Synthesis of Fungicide Metalaxyl through Catalytic C&#8722;N Bond&#8208;Formation Processes</title>

Abstract
Metalaxyl, an acylalanine fungicide, was synthesized through catalytic continuous sequential&#8208;flow reactions. Commonly used syntheses of this compound use batch systems and suffer from problems such as coproduction of halogen&#8208;containing by&#8208;products derived from acyl and alkyl halides in the substitution reactions of 2,6&#8208;dimethylaniline. To minimize waste and enhance efficiency, a halide&#8208;free approach including two continuous&#8208;flow catalytic processes, heterogeneous Pt&#8208;catalyzed reductive alkylation and homogeneous acid&#8208;catalyzed amidation with an acid anhydride, was developed. Systematic examination of the two reactions in flow mode enabled a high&#8208;yielding, two&#8208;step sequential continuous&#8208;flow process to be achieved.

         <title>Synthesis of indoline&#8208;fused 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine scaffolds via Ugi&#8208;4CR in the basic mediated tandem consecutive cyclization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study has developed a method to prepare diastereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective indoline&#8208;fused 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine scaffolds.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study has developed a method to prepare diastereo- and regio-selective indoline-fused 2,5-diketopiperazine scaffolds. The synthetic process involved an Ugi four-component reaction in which readily available starting materials were used and a metal-free intramolecular post-Ugi tandem consecutive 5-exo-trig/6-exo-dig cyclization under basic conditions. The plausible mechanism and substrate structures were elucidated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and supported by density functional theory calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Divergent Access to Benzocycles through Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylative Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A copper&#8208;catalyzed chemodivergent approach to five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered benzocycles from dienyl arenes tethered with a ketone has been developed. Through proper choice of coordinating ligands and catalytic conditions, copper&#8208;catalyzed borylative cyclization of a single dienyl arene can be diverted to two different pathways, leading to indanols and dihydronaphthalenols with high stereoselectivity. The chiral bidentate bisphosphine ligand (S,S)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE was highly efficient for asymmetric copper&#8208;allyl addition to a tethered ketone via a boat&#8208;like transition state, whereas NHC ligands led to boro&#8208;allyl addition producing indanols with high diastereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe herein that the cross coupling of bromodifluoroacetamides with (iodoethynyl)arenes efficiently proceeds without recourse to any photocatalyst when exposed to visible light at room temperature to afford alkynyldifluoroacetamides in moderate to 62&#8208;83% yields (27 examples). Several control experiments suggest that the reaction involves the homolysis of bromodifluoroacetamides and the coupling of the resultant difluoromethyl radical species with the 1&#8208;iodoalkynes via a radical chain process. Divergent transformations of the coupling products led to various organofluorine compounds, demonstrating the synthetic utility of the developed photo&#8208;coupling method.</dc:description>

In this synthetic process, crude less stable N&#8208;aroyldiazene intermediates generated by I2&#8208;mediated oxidation of hydrazides were used directly in a subsequent annulation reaction to afford the selenadiazole products.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A dehydrohalogenative approach for isoxazole annulation by partnering &#946;&#8208;vinyl halides and &#945;&#8208;nitrocarbonyls under mechanochemical setting was accomplished. This chemistry is operative under the cooperative catalysis of cupric oxide nanoparticles (&lt; 50 nm) and DABCO. The key beneficial aspects of this protocol include: (i) broad substrate scope, (ii) no vigorous work&#8208;up, (iii) short reaction time, (iv) solvent&#8208;free condition, (v) commercial viability of substrates/reagents (vi) good chemical yields and selectivity.  	The other merit of this chemistry is the ease with which CuO can be recuperated and reused after the reaction with not much drop in catalytic activity for six runs. With no confinement to &#946;&#8208;vinyl halides, the validated condition is also open to alkynes for isoxazole preparation, thereby establishing the broader utility of the current methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of Alkynyl Norbornene Derivatives for the Synthesis of Benzofused Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modular approaches, which allow a systematic variation of heteroaromatic cores and substituents, are crucial for the development of heteroaromatic drug candidates and organic functional materials. A new strategy involving the cyclization of heteroarenes tethered with alkynes through a norbornene bridge was developed. The precursors were readily prepared by a three&#8208;component coupling process of heteroaryl halides, norbornadiene, and terminal alkynes. The Pd catalytic system derived from Pd(OAc)2 and 2&#8208;(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine transformed a variety of five&#8208;membered heteroarenes to the corresponding benzofused products, including (di)benzothiophene, indazole, carbazole, indole, and benzofuran, with aryl and alkyl substituents at the C4(C7) position. During the cyclization process, the norbornene ring underwent a retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, serving as an acetylene synthon. This approach was used to synthesize naphthalene derivatives from electron&#8208;rich arenes, demonstrating its versatility in the annulation of (hetero)aromatic rings.</dc:description>

During the cyclization process, the norbornene ring underwent a retro-Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, serving as an acetylene synthon. This approach was used to synthesize naphthalene derivatives from electron-rich arenes, demonstrating its versatility in the annulation of (hetero)aromatic rings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Protein Engineering of d&#8208;Succinylase from Cupriavidus sp. for d&#8208;Amino Acid Synthesis and the Structural Implications</title>

Abstract
d&#8208;Amino acids are important chiral building blocks for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Previously, we have used d&#8208;Succinylase (DSA) from Cupriavidus sp. P4&#8208;10&#8208;C and N&#8208;succinyl amino acid racemase (NSAR, EC.4.2.1.113) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus NCA1503 to produce d&#8208;amino acids via the dynamic kinetic resolution of N&#8208;succinyl&#8208;dl&#8208;amino acids. However, the use of this bioconversion system remains challenging for industrial application due to the insufficient enantioselectivity of DSA toward N&#8208;succinyl&#8208;d&#8208;amino acids. Therefore, we screened DSA mutants for improved enantioselectivity by directed evolution. Several mutants showed improved enantioseletivity compared to wild&#8208;type DSA. L182E mutant had superior enantioselectivity, and the thermal stability was also remarkably improved by this single mutation. We solved the crystal structure of the L182E mutant in complex with succinic acids at a resolution 2.0&#8197;&#197;. The mutated residues in all generated mutants that showed improved enantioselectivity (including the substituted Glu182 in the L182E mutant) are found very close to the active site. The solved crystal structure also provides some rationale to explain the higher thermostability of the L182E mutant compared to wild&#8208;type DSA. d&#8208;phenylalanine and d&#8208;tryptophan were produced in high conversion (approximately 90%) with 98.8% ee and 99.6% ee, respectively, using coupled L182E DSA and NSAR with the one&#8208;pot enzymatic method. These data suggested that L182E DSA may be a useful biocatalyst for industrial d&#8208;amino acids production.

Abstract
The iodine&#8208;promoted oxidative domino annulation and carbonylation process has been developed for the synthesis of biologically important azaarene&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;b:4&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;e]pyridines (BPPs), diuracilpyridines and o&#8208;amino diheteroaryl ketones. The domino procedure proceeded with easily available methyl azaarenes, 5&#8208;aminouracils and substituted 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles. This protocol is a simple and metal&#8208;free approach which exhibits high functional group compatibility and broad substrates scope. Moreover, this transformation can be applied for the preparation of dipyrazolo/diuracil&#8208;fused pyridines on a gram scale.

         <title>A Study of the Reactions of 3&#8208;Bromopropenals with Anilines for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Bromo Enaminones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. A one&#8208;pot strategy for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;bromo enaminones is reported. The reactions proceed via the p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (TsOH&#183;H2O) catalyzed reactions of 3&#8208;bromopropenals with anilines in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and does not require an external brominating agent. The chemoselective 1,2&#8208;addition was accomplished by employing aniline with a sterically hindered electron&#8208;withdrawing group attached at the ortho&#8208;position.	In addition, the reactions involving other aniline derivatives as nucleophiles have resulted in minor yields of 1,4&#8208;addition product. The 3&#8208;bromopropenals showed a diverse range of reactivities with aniline derivatives.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Radical cascade cyclization of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazones/oximes has recently emerged as an efficient and powerful protocol for the construction of diverse and valuable functionalized pyrazolines and isoxazolines. In this review, three catalytic ways of radical cascade cyclization of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazones/oximes are summarized and classified, which are transition&#8208;metal&#8208; catalyzed systems, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free systems, or photo&#8208;/electrocatalytic systems, respectively. Through these methods, various functional groups are installed on the pyrazoline and isoxazoline skeletons to enrich the small organic molecules library.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first direct transition metal&#8208;free access to 3,6&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;pyrones from &#945;&#8208;chloro aldehydes and &#946;&#8208;tosyl enones is reported. The reactions proceed via the Michael addition/lactonization/elimination cascade. The regioselective addition of NHC&#8208;bound enolates/homoenolates to the enones bearing a bulkier functionality such as tosyl group at the &#946;&#8208;position has remained challenging. The 3,6&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;pyrones could be converted to valuable products such as 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenes, 1,4&#8208;disubstituted naphthalenes as well as anthracenes and 6,13&#8208;disubstituted dihydro&#8208;ethenopentacenes in a simple operation.</dc:description>

Abstract
A catalytic carbonylative approach to the multicomponent synthesis of benzothiophene derivatives from simple building blocks [1&#8208;(2&#8208;(methylthio)phenyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ols, carbon monoxide, and an alcohol)] is presented. It is based on an S&#8208;cyclization&#8208;demethylation&#8208;alkoxycarbonylation&#8208;reduction sequence promoted by the PdI2/KI catalytic system, occurring under relatively mild conditions (40&#8197;atm, 80&#8201;&#176;C, 15&#8197;h). Benzothiophene&#8208;2&#8208;acetic esters are obtained in moderate to good yields (35&#8211;70%) starting from variously substituted substrates in combination with different alcohols as external nucleophiles (17&#8197;examples).

         <dc:description>Indium&#8208;catalyzed sequential remote C&#8208;H functionalization (C&#8208;6 position) and C3&#8208;indolylation of peroxyoxindole using indole is described for the synthesis of terindolinone derivatives.

In contrast with Indium (III) Chloride, FeCl3&#183;6H2O facilitates oxidative cleavage of the peroxyoxindole (Hock cleavage) and further reaction with indole to afford biologically important trisindoline derivatives.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Amination of Aryl Nitriles for Accessing Diarylamines through C&#8722;CN Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed amination to access diarylamines has been developed through C&#8722;CN bond activation of aryl nitriles with anilines. In this developed catalytic protocol, various aromatic and heteroaromatic nitriles could be utilized as the electrophiles to couple with substituted anilines. A diversity of diarylamines were obtained in 15&#8211;95% yields.

         <dc:description>A Cu&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidative azo&#8208;ene cyclization has been developed. The developed CuI/DMAP/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system efficiently facilitated the aerobic oxidations of ene&#8208;containing hydrazides to azo compounds, and the generated azo compounds underwent azo&#8208;ene cyclizations for the synthesis of oxazolidinones. In addition, the present approach enabled the synthesis of lactams, as well as a nitroso&#8208;ene cyclization. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that two carbonyl groups were essential for the successful azo&#8208;ene cyclization and that a concerted mechanism might be the plausible mechanism for the present azo&#8208;ene cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Time&#8208;Dependent Diastereodivergent Michael Addition Enabled by Phosphazenes Acting as Catalysts and Reactants</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A switching of the step order within cascade process enabled design of a diastereodivergent approach to phosphazenopyrrolines with a 1,3&#8208;relationship of stereocenters. The approach is based on a cascade transformation of readily accessible &#947;&#8208;azidobutyronitriles that includes Staudinger, aza&#8208;Wittig and Michael steps. Stereodivergence is achieved at the Michael step that is self&#8208;catalyzed by phosphazene intermediates and provides construction of quaternary stereocenter. Depending on the type of phosphazene intermediates, generating either via Staudinger reaction or via subsequent intramolecular aza&#8208;Wittig reaction with nitrile and then reacting with a Michael acceptor, either trans&#8208; or cis&#8208;isomers of the target product can be produced. Thus, diastereoselectivity can be achieved by varying the time of addition for the Michael acceptor. Therefore, three distinct roles were revealed for phosphazenes in this process: catalysts, reactants and stereoselectivity controllers. This stereodivergent strategy was applied for the synthesis of all stereoisomers of the biorelevant tetrahydro&#8208;7&#8208;aza&#8208;indoles.</dc:description>

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed/TsOH&#8208;promoted one&#8208;pot tandem annulation of 1,6&#8208;allenynes with organic azides was reported, providing N&#8208;allyl 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;fused structures in moderate to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. Moreover, the late&#8208;stage diversification of the N&#8208;allyl products can be realized by chemoselectively reducing to the N&#8208;alkyl counterparts.

         <title>Cp*Co(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrative C2&#8208;Prenylation of Pyrrole and Indole with Allyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Non&#8208;activated allyl alcohols are utilized as allylating agent for thiocarbamate&#8208;directed allylation of pyrrole and indole. The synthetic methodology is accompanied by advantages like silver&#8208;free conditions and generates water as the by&#8208;product. A wide range of substituted pyrroles and indoles along with several structurally different allyl alcohols took part in the reaction. Among notable examples, biologically relevant prenylation, geranylation, and synthesis of 1,3&#8208;dienes are achieved. Selective mono allylation of pyrrole, gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and ready deprotection of directing group are the other key highlights of this method.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Alkynylation of Selenophenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed (Pd(PPh3)4/Ag2O/PivOH) C2&#8208;regioselective direct dehydrogenative alkynylation of unsubstituted selenophene was achieved. The selenophenes substituted with R1 groups at 2&#8208;position can be C5&#8208;alkynylated with a variety of 4&#8208;substituted phenylacetylenes (R2 groups). The R1 and R2 can be either electron&#8208;withdrawing or electron&#8208;donating groups, demonstrating a wide range of substrate scope with various functional group tolerance. The mono/C2&#8208;alkynylated selenophenes can subsequently undergo the second direct alkynylation at C5&#8208;position to afford symmetrical or unsymmetrical donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor 2,5&#8208;dialkynylated selenophenes.

Abstract
The o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketone skeleton is prevalent in many biologically active natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Herein, a two&#8208;step protocol has been developed for synthesis of various &#946;&#8208;substituted o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketones. A base&#8208;mediated ring opening of 4&#8208;chromanone was used to introduce the &#946;&#8208;ethoxyl o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketone intermediary, followed by nucleophile substitution under BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O assisted conditions to give the desired &#946;&#8208;carbon, nitrogen, or thiol substituted o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketones. With the aid of this protocol, a silica&#8208;supported cobalt(II) salen complex was successfully prepared and its structure was confirmed by FTIR, 13C MAS NMR, UV&#8208;Vis absorption, and XPS spectra. The immobilized cobalt(II) salen catalyst not only displayed comparable catalytic activity in the synthesis of several heterocycles including 1,3&#8208;oxazolidine, benzimidazole, and benzoxazole as compared with their homogeneous counterparts, but also could be recycled for several times without obvious loss of its catalytic activity.

Abstract
A radical promoted approach for the selective synthesis of furo[3,2&#8208;b]quinolines and benzylidene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydrofuro[3,4&#8208;b]quinolines have been achieved from 2&#8208;alkynyl quinoline&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehydes by fine&#8208;tuning of base and oxidant in good yields. In the presence of an oxidant, the reaction afforded the 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclized furoquinolines by decarbonylative intramolecular cyclization via a Dakin&#8208;type reaction; however, in the absence of oxidant, 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclized products were obtained selectively through reductive intramolecular cyclization. The formation of furoquinolines was further supported by X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies. The proposed mechanism was well supported by the control experiments.

         <title>Stereo&#8208; and Regioselective [3+3] Annulation Reaction Catalyzed by Ytterbium: Synthesis of Bicyclic 1,4&#8208;Dihydropyridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An ytterbium catalyzed formal [3+3] cycloaddition of cyclic enamines and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones catalyzed is reported. The reaction proceeds with a &#8216;head to tail&#8217; regioselectivity through a conjugate addition of the enamine moiety followed by an amine&#8208;carbonyl condensation. In addition the use of chiral enamines provided a high degree of stereoselectivity, driven by a possible balance between steric and &#960;&#8208;stacking effects. The resulting bicyclic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines were evaluated as antiproliferative agents against A549 (carcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cell) and SKOV3 (human ovarian carcinoma) human tumor cell lines. Good toxicities were found for some of the compounds against A549 and SKOV3 cell lines, with best IC50 values of 0.89&#8197;&#956;M for A549 and 6.69&#8197;&#956;M for SKOV3, and a very good selectivity was observed towards MRC5 (non&#8208;malignant) cell lines.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalysed Electrophilic Amination of Aryl(alkenyl) Boronic Acids with Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Hypervalent Iodine (III) Reagent</title>

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalysed electrophilic N&#8208;imination of aryl(alkenyl) boronic acids with a stable hypervalent iodine(III) reagent containing a transferable (diarylmethylene)amino group is developed. The electrophilic C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling reaction proceeds smoothly at room temperature under oxidant&#8208;free and base&#8208;free conditions, which is further characterized by the broad functional group compatibility, thereof, extending the N&#8208;electrophile scope of electrophilic C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling outside the limitation of N&#8722;O and N&#8722;Cl reagents.

Abstract
The organocatalytic transformation of resorcinols is extremely rare. In this article, we report a highly enantioselective, organocatalytic intramolecular cyclization of these systems by a Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type 1,4&#8208;addition using a J&#248;rgensen&#8208;Hayashi&#8208;like organocatalyst with a large silyl protecting group, and show that heat improves reaction yield with virtually no detriment to enantioselectivity. A variety of bicyclic resorcinols were obtained with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 94%). To show the utility of these constructs, and as part of a wider project involving the synthesis of cannabinoid&#8208;like compounds, the resorcinol formed was used to generate both &#8216;normal&#8217; and &#8216;abnormal&#8217; cannabidiol (CBD) derivatives which were shown to have anticonvulsant activity.

Abstract
An enantioselective synthesis of 1&#8208;substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines from L&#8211;Dopa methyl ester through intramolecular aryl radical cyclization is demonstrated. The strategy consists of bromination of (S)&#8208;2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;bromo&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)propanoate followed by condensation with various aldehydes to afford bromoimidate ester. Aryl radicals generated from bromoimidate ester under the radical generating conditions (nBu3SnH/AIBN) cyclizes via 6&#8208;endo mode to afford cis&#8208;1&#8208;substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines exclusively in 99% ee. The utility of this synthetic protocol is demonstrated in the synthesis of (6S, 12aS) Tadalafil (5 steps, 21%, 99% ee).

Abstract
Herein we report a catalytic, easily scalable protocol for the enantioselective synthesis of Tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives, using a biphasic system composed by catalytic DBU in DME and aqueous solutions of Na2CO3. Under very mild reaction conditions, without using metal or chiral additives, this heterogeneous system promotes the degradative rearrangement of functionalized N&#8208;aryl sulphonyl &#945;&#8208;amino esters into the corresponding tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;amino esters, with high enantiomeric ratios (up to 97.5:2.5) and good yields (up to 95%).

By using a palladium complex [PdCl2(MeCN)2] and the photosensitizer [Acr&#8208;Mes]ClO4 in aqueous medium and at room temperature, and by simple irradiation with blue led light, the desired carbonyl compounds were synthesized with high conversions (&gt;80%) and excellent selectivities (&gt;90%). The key process was the transient formation of Pd nanoparticles that can activate oxygen, thus recycling the Pd(II) species necessary in the Wacker oxidative reaction. While light irradiation was strictly mandatory, the addition of the photocatalyst improved the reaction selectivity, due to the formation of the starting allyl(hetero)arene from some of the obtained by&#8208;products, thus entering back in the Wacker&#8208;Tsuji catalytic cycle. Once optimized, the oxidation reaction was combined in a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step sequential protocol with an enzymatic transformation. Depending on the biocatalyst employed, i.&#8201;e. an amine transaminase or an alcohol dehydrogenase, the corresponding (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;1&#8208;arylpropan&#8208;2&#8208;amines or 1&#8208;arylpropan&#8208;2&#8208;ols, respectively, could be synthesized in most cases with high yields (&gt;70%) and in enantiopure form. Finally, an application of this photo&#8208;metal&#8208;biocatalytic strategy has been demonstrated in order to get access in a straightforward manner to selegiline, an anti&#8208;Parkinson drug.

Abstract
A Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed C6&#8208;selective C&#8722;H arylation of 2&#8208;pyridones with inexpensive, readily available, safe and structurally diverse aryl carboxylic acids with the aid of a pyridine directing group is developed. This decarbonylative arylation protocol features an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle catalytic system, and is amenable to diversely substituted 2&#8208;pyridones and aryl carboxylic acids. It allows access to a wide range of C6&#8208;arylated 2&#8208;pyridones, including those that are difficult to prepare using conventional C&#8722;H arylation processes. The method tolerates various electron&#8208;neutral, electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient functional groups, and affords the products in 41&#8211;91% yields.

Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate that organic, single&#8208;electron oxidant in the presence of diarylprolinol silylether type catalyst serves as a tool for the transformation of electron&#8208;rich enamines to iminium ions. These iminium ions take part in a subsequent Michael&#8208;initiated ring&#8208;closure (MIRC) reaction with in&#8197;situ present nucleophile giving rise to overall cyclopropanation reaction of saturated aldehydes. Stereodefined cyclopropanes are obtained in high yields and selectivities. This one&#8208;pot transformation represents the additional example of saturated aldehydes being used in the coupled one&#8208;pot processes.

Abstract
The borrowing hydrogen strategy has been applied in the synthesis of nonsymmetric N,N&#8208;dialkylated acyl hydrazides via a tandem three&#8208;component reaction catalyzed by a phosphine free diaminocyclopentadienone ruthenium tricarbonyl complex. This strategy represents the first direct one&#8208;pot approach to nonsymmetric functionalized acyl hydrazides. Different aromatic acyl hydrazides underwent dialkylation with a variety of primary or secondary alcohols and methanol or ethanol as alkylating agents in mild reaction conditions and good yields. Deuterium labelling experiments suggested that the primary or secondary alcohol was the hydrogen source in this tandem process. DFT calculations show that the combination of the tandem mixed product cannot be perfectly explained neither structurally nor electronically, but might be dependent of the physical state of the aldehyde or ketone intermediate (gaz vs. liquid) at the reaction temperature.

Abstract
An operationally mild, ruthenium&#8208;based photocatalytic protocol has been developed for the conversion of &#947;&#8208;mono&#8208; and &#947;,&#947;&#8208;disubstituted allyl carbonates in the presence of Umemoto's reagent to afford substituted six&#8208;membered cyclic carbonates. Variation and diversification of the carbonate ring substitution provides access to new monomers useful in ring&#8208;opening polymerization leading to polycarbonates with potentially tailored properties, as illustrated by comparative experiments using monomers with different pi&#8208;stacking capabilities.

         <title>Direct Use of Benzylic Alcohols for Multicomponent Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aryl Quinazolinones Utilizing the &#960;&#8208;Benzylpalladium(II) System in Water</title>

Abstract
We demonstrate the direct use of benzylic alcohols for a multicomponent reaction of readily available isatoic anhydrides with amines in water, which is a synthetic route for the direct construction of a series of 2&#8208;aryl quinazolinones. This one&#8208;pot synthetic method involves the dehydrative N&#8208;benzylation of in&#8197;situ generated anthranilamides followed by an amide&#8208;directed benzylic C&#8722;H amination process utilizing the &#960;&#8208;benzylPd(II) system. Comparison of independent rate measurements using benzyl alcohol and its deuterated form gave a kinetic isotope effect of 3.5. Therefore, the benzylic C&#8722;H bond is cleaved in the rate&#8208;determining step. We successfully carried out a gram&#8208;scale reaction in 85% yield with simplified product isolation.

This one-pot synthetic method involves the dehydrative N-benzylation of in&#8197;situ generated anthranilamides followed by an amide-directed benzylic C&#8722;H amination process utilizing the &#960;-benzylPd(II) system. Comparison of independent rate measurements using benzyl alcohol and its deuterated form gave a kinetic isotope effect of 3.5. Therefore, the benzylic C&#8722;H bond is cleaved in the rate-determining step. We successfully carried out a gram-scale reaction in 85% yield with simplified product isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
Herein, a direct C8&#8208;oxygenation of naphthalene derivatives is described. Different carbonyl groups were used as directing group to deliver corresponding naphthols via a palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation reaction using PhI(OAc)2 in a TFA/TFAA mixture. Interestingly, when Weinreb amide was employed as the directing group, the naphtholactone skeleton was directly obtained. This methodology was applied to the synthesis of variously substituted naphtholactones.

Abstract
An organocatalyzed asymmetric dearomative [3+2] annulation reaction of electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;nitrobenzo heteroarenes including 2&#8208;nitrobenzofurans, 2&#8208;nitrobenzothiophenes and 2&#8208;nitroindoles with 3&#8208;isothiocyanato oxindoles was developed. With a multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding bifunctional thiourea as the catalyst, the reaction displays broad substrate scope and provides an access to structurally diverse polycyclic spirooxindoles containing three contiguous stereogenic centers in high yields with good diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to 99% yield, 94:6 dr, and 97% ee). This organocatalysis protocol is able to afford the products with complementarily diastereoselectivity versus the previous work with transition metal catalysis.

         <title>A Mechanistic Probe into 1,2&#8208;cis Glycoside Formation Catalyzed by Phenanthroline and Further Expansion of Scope</title>

Abstract
Phenanthroline, a rigid and planar compound with two fused pyridine rings, has been used as a powerful ligand for metals and a binding agent for DNA/RNA. We discovered that phenanthroline could be used as a nucleophilic catalyst to efficiently access high yielding and diastereoselective &#945;&#8208;1,2&#8208;cis glycosides through the coupling of hydroxyl acceptors with &#945;&#8208;glycosyl bromide donors. We have conducted an extensive investigation into the reaction mechanism, wherein the two glycosyl phenanthrolinium ion intermediates, a 4C1 chair&#8208;liked &#946;&#8208;conformer and a B2,5 boat&#8208;like &#945;&#8208;conformer, have been detected in a ratio of 2:1 (&#946;:&#945;) using variable temperature NMR experiments. Furthermore, NMR studies illustrate that a hydrogen bonding is formed between the second nitrogen atom of phenanthroline and the C1&#8208;anomeric hydrogen of sugar moiety to stabilize the phenanthrolinium ion intermediates. To obtain high &#945;&#8208;1,2&#8208;cis stereoselectivity, a Curtin&#8208;Hammett scenario was proposed wherein interconversion of the 4C1 chair&#8208;like &#946;&#8208;conformer and B2,5 boat&#8208;like &#945;&#8208;conformer is more rapid than nucleophilic addition. Hydroxyl attack takes place from the &#945;&#8208;face of the more reactive 4C1 &#946;&#8208;phenanthrolinium intermediate to give an &#945;&#8208;anomeric product. The utility of the phenanthroline catalysis is expanded to sterically hindered hydroxyl nucleophiles and chemoselective coupling of an alkyl hydroxyl group in the presence of a free C1&#8208;hemiacetal. In addition, the phenanthroline&#8208;based catalyst has a pronounced effect on site&#8208;selective couplings of triol motifs and orthogonally activates the anomeric bromide leaving group over the anomeric fluoride and sulfide counterparts.

Abstract
Microbial synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;menthol, a compound of plant origin, is of great importance because of the high demand for this product and related sustainability issues. However, the total biosynthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;menthol from easily available feedstocks like (&#8722;)&#8208;limonene by engineered microbial hosts is stalled by the poor protein expression or activity of several enzymes from the native (&#8722;)&#8208;menthol biosynthesis pathway of mint (Mentha piperita). Among these unsatisfied steps, (&#8722;)&#8208;isopiperitenol dehydrogenase (IPDH) catalyzed oxidation reaction of (&#8722;)&#8208;trans&#8208;isopiperitenol was one of the bottlenecks that need to be optimized. In this work, two novel bacterial enzymes with IPDH activity were discovered to replace their inefficient counterpart from plant cells in microbial (&#8722;)&#8208;menthol synthesis. Two key residues in PaIPDH from Pseudomonas aeruginosa were mutated to PaIPDHE95F/Y199V with 4.4&#8208;fold improved specific activity than PaIPDH. The mechanism for the beneficial mutations was elucidated by molecular dynamics simulations. PaIPDHE95F/Y199V was used to synthesize (&#8722;)&#8208;isopiperitenone from (&#8722;)&#8208;limonene in&#8197;vivo via a self&#8208;sufficient cofactor cascade enzyme reaction, affording a 3.7&#8208;fold enhanced titer of (&#8722;)&#8208;isopiperitenone compared with that obtained using the original mint IPDH (MpIPDH). The bacterial enzyme PaIPDHE95F/Y199V can be applied in the future for constructing a more efficient artificial pathway to biosynthesize (&#8722;)&#8208;menthol in a microbial whole&#8208;cell system.

Abstract
We herein describes an HFIP&#8208;mediated [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction from simple and easily available isatoic anhydrides and cyclopropenones under silver catalysis. This transformation involves the tandem decarboxylative esterification, intermolecular addition, intramolecular substitution, small ring opening and isomerization processes, which allows the rapid assembly of versatile 2&#8208;diarylalkenyl&#8208;4H&#8208;3,1&#8208;benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones.

Abstract
Herein, we report substituent&#8208;controlled divergent cascade cycloaddition reactions of chalcones and arylalkynols in the presence of PtI2. Depending on the substituent on the chalcone, either spiroketals or oxa&#8208;bridged fused heterocycles could be obtained in the ranges of 86&#8211;97% and 87&#8211;95% yields under identical reaction conditions. Control experiments were carried out to elucidate the origin of the high chemoselectivity. These provide a method for the synthesis of a diverse array of structurally complex oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Reactivity Reversal in the Sulfonylation Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Allenols: Controlled Synthesis of 4&#8208;(Arylsulfonyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;Dihydrofurans</title>

Abstract
The synergy between metal catalysis and radical chemistry allows to surpass previous limitations of the reactions between allenols and sulfonylating reagents. Considering that previous studies of the reactivity of the allenol moiety with sulfonylating reagents have been limited to addition and rearrangement reactions lacking cyclization, we decided to modify the protocol for achieving a catalytic cyclization/functionalization. In this way, we accomplished a copper&#8208;catalyzed cascade cycloetherification/sulfonylation for the controlled preparation of 4&#8208;(arylsulfonyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydrofurans from allenols and sulfinates involving in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated sulfur&#8208;centered radicals. The generality of our strategy was illustrated using various methyl&#8208; and phenyl&#8208;substituted allenes.

Abstract
A gold&#8208;catalyzed carbocyclization/C=N bond formation cascade reaction has been developed for the synthesis of polyfunctionalized 4&#8208;iminonaphthalenones and indenes in good to high yields under mild reaction conditions. The reaction goes through 5/6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig diazo&#8208;yne carbocyclization to form the endocyclic vinyl carbene species from corresponding alkyne&#8208;tethered diazo compounds, followed by electrophilic addition/N&#8722;O bond cleavage/aromatization sequence with benzo[c]isoxazoles, which features a C=N bond formation process. In addition, the resulting products could be converted into multi&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;naphthol derivatives in high yields.

Abstract
Heterocycles play an essential role in medicinal as well as in organic synthetic chemistry. The synthesis of these valuable scaffolds is an emerging and challenging field of today&#8216;s research in organic chemistry. In recent years, several heterocycles as new synthons have emerged as potential nucleophiles in asymmetric transformations. Among them, 5H&#8208;oxazol&#8208;4&#8208;one is one of the strategic synthons for synthesizing enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acid derivatives, which are otherwise very challenging via direct installation of a hydroxy group at the &#945;&#8208;position of carbonyls. Over the years, considerable progress has been made to establish new and efficient methodologies under mild reaction conditions exploiting metal&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalysis. This review presents a comprehensive summary of various catalytic development in asymmetric synthesis employing 5H&#8208;oxazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones as &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acid surrogates.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterocycles play an essential role in medicinal as well as in organic synthetic chemistry. The synthesis of these valuable scaffolds is an emerging and challenging field of today&#8216;s research in organic chemistry. In recent years, several heterocycles as new synthons have emerged as potential nucleophiles in asymmetric transformations. Among them, 5&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-oxazol-4-one is one of the strategic synthons for synthesizing enantioenriched &#945;-alkyl-&#945;-hydroxycarboxylic acid derivatives, which are otherwise very challenging via direct installation of a hydroxy group at the &#945;-position of carbonyls. Over the years, considerable progress has been made to establish new and efficient methodologies under mild reaction conditions exploiting metal- and organo-catalysis. This review presents a comprehensive summary of various catalytic development in asymmetric synthesis employing 5&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-oxazol-4-ones as &#945;-alkyl-&#945;-hydroxycarboxylic acid surrogates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
Allyl alcohol compounds are widely used structural units. In recent years, considerable attention has been devoted to exploring the migration reactions of allyl alcohols via semipinacol or neophyl rearrangements, and so on, providing an attractive and powerful strategy for obtaining various important carbonyl compounds.
However, to date, no review has been published that summarizes the significant advances in the preparation of functionalized carbonyl compounds using these migration rearrangement reactions. In this paper, the latest progress in the use of allyl alcohols as flexible synthons involving group migration is introduced, and the reaction scopes, limitations, and some of the mechanisms are also discussed.

Abstract
Directing group&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H activation has been widely used to control regioselectivity in the field of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization. Common functionalities found in complex organic molecules and/or readily available reagents are the most appealing directing groups, as they circumvent the need to install/remove the directing group. The aldehyde group is an important functional group in many areas including pharmaceuticals and material science. In this review, we present the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in aldehyde&#8208;assisted, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed sp2 C&#8722;H functionalization of arenes.

Abstract
We developed a B(C6F5)3 catalyzed hydroarylation of terminal alkynes with various phenols at room temperature without adding any additives, leading to the synthesis of 2&#8208;gem&#8208;vinylphenols with good regio&#8208;selectivity. Those transformations featured a broad substrate scope with moderate yields. Mechanism studies indicated that those transformations proceeded through the activation of phenol by B(C6F5)3 with subsequent protonation of alkyne/Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type reaction.

Abstract
A cascade annulation of 2&#8208;isocyanophenyloxyacrylate and propargylic ester under basic conditions has been disclosed. This methodology enables diastereoselective synthesis of oxa&#8208;bridged tetracyclic benzooxazine. The annulation proceeds through isomerization, Michael addition, triple annulation and acyl migration processes.

Abstract
A visible light&#8208;initiated method has been developed for preparation of Se&#8722;S bond&#8208;containing peptides. The method is based on generation of sulfur&#8208;centered radical employing organic dye. The protocol is tolerant to unprotected peptides with &#8220;sensitive&#8221; amino acids. The stability of Se&#8722;S bond is evaluated in buffers at different pH (3.0&#8211;10.0) and also in the presence of oxidants and reducing agents. Additionally, the ability of Se&#8722;S bond to serve as an oxidation sensitive linker in biocompatible materials has been confirmed.

Direct and site&#8208;selective C5 and C7 palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylations of 4&#8208;azaindazole N&#8208;oxide have been achieved. A bidentate ligand and Pd(OAc)2 catalyst in toluene promoted the activation of C5 position, while a phosphine ligand and PdCl2 catalyst in DMA directed the arylation at C7 position. Using this new method, the synthesis of C5, C7&#8208;diarylated 4&#8208;azaindazole N&#8208;oxides as well as the C3, C5, C7&#8208;triarylated 4&#8208;azaindazoles was achieved towards future medicinal compounds development.

Abstract
Herein we reported a protocol for synthesis of oxy&#8208;substituted ferrocenes via cobalt&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8722;H alkoxylation under mild conditions. Notably, alcohol serves as an both alkoxide reagent and a solvent. Various ferrocene amides including estrone&#8208;derived ferrocene amide are compatible with these reaction conditions. Moreover, control experiments suggested that this alkoxylation might undergo a Co(III)/Co(IV)/Co(II) catalytic cycle.

         <title>Visible Light Promoted Chan&#8208;Lam Reaction and Cycloaddition to Prepare Chromeno[4,3&#8208;c]isoxazolidines in One&#8208;Pot Reaction</title>

Abstract
A variety of chromeno[4,3&#8208;c]isoxazolidines were prepared in good yields through visible light promoted Chan&#8208;Lam reaction and [3+2] cycloaddition cascade reaction in one pot. Mechanistic studies showed that visible light promoted both Chan&#8208;Lam reaction and cycloaddition. The obtained products were converted to various useful chromenone derivatives. Moreover, the reaction was easily performed at gram scales with the purification of products without column chromatography and used to efficiently synthesize estrone&#8208;derived chromeno[4,3&#8208;c]isoxazolidine.

         <title>Activated Hoveyda&#8208;Grubbs Olefin Metathesis Catalysts Derived from a Large Scale Produced Pharmaceutical Intermediate &#8211; Sildenafil Aldehyde</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Two EWG&#8208;activated Hoveyda&#8208;Grubbs&#8208;type ruthenium complexes (Sil&#8208;II and Sil&#8208;II&#8217;) were obtained, characterized, and screened in a set of olefin metathesis reactions. These catalysts were conveniently synthesized from a commercially available pharmaceutical building block &#8211; Sildenafil aldehyde &#8211; in two steps only. Stability and catalytic activity tests disclosed that the bulkier NHC&#8208;ligand bearing catalyst Sil&#8208;II&#8217; is visibly more stable and productive than its smaller NHC&#8208;analogue Sil&#8208;II. Good application profile of catalyst Sil&#8208;II&#8217; was confirmed in a set of diverse metathesis reactions including ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) and cross&#8208;metathesis (CM) of complex polyfunctional substrates of medicinal chemistry interest, including a challenging macrocyclization of the Pacritinib precursor. Compatibility of the new catalyst with various green solvents was checked and metathesis of Sildenafil and Tadalafil&#8208;based substrates was successfully conducted in acetone. The mechanism of Sil&#8208;II&#8217; initiation has been investigated through kinetic experiments unveiling that the decrease of the steric hindrance of the chelating alkoxy moiety (from iPrO to EtO) favors the interchange initiation pathway over the typical dissociation pathway for other popular 2nd generation Hoveyda&#8208;Grubbs catalysts.

         <title>Auto Tandem Catalysis: Asymmetric Vinylogous Cycloaddition/Kinetic Resolution Sequence for the Enantioselective Synthesis of Spiro&#8208;Dihydropyranone from Benzylidene Meldrum's Acid</title>

Abstract
A catalytic enantioselective vinylogous domino reaction has been achieved from ketone&#8208;derived benzylidene Meldrum's acid and &#945;&#8208;ketolactones to provide spirolactone dihydropyranones with more than 99%&#8201;ee. An Auto Tandem Catalysis (ATC) process resulting from dual and complementary role of (DHQ)2PHAL organocatalyst resulted in a sequence involving an asymmetric vinylogous formal (4+2) cycloaddition of benzylidene and the subsequent kinetic resolution operating through a 1,3&#8208;prototropic shift leading to good yields (&gt;50%) and the high selectivity.

         <title>Enantioselective Vinylogous Mannich Reaction of Acyclic Vinylketene Silyl Acetals with Acyclic Ketimines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The first enantioselective vinylogous Mannich reaction of acyclic vinylketene silyl acetals with acyclic ketimines derived from alkynyl ketoesters was developed. Excellent yields and enantioselectivities were obtained from the reaction using bis(imidazoline)&#8208;Zn(II) catalyst. Based on experiments and MO calculation, a plausible transition state was proposed to explain the stereoselectivity of the reaction. The obtained products were converted into various amines and a lactam. This process provides an efficient route for the synthesis of acyclic &#948;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and their derivatives.

Herein, we report on the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of triazoles with acyl selenides. Under thermal reaction conditions and in the presence of a rhodium catalyst, a rapid 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization reaction occurs to provide valuable &#945;&#8208;seleno enamides with high stereoselectivity and broad functional group tolerance, which was demonstrated in 35 examples with up to 95% yield. Computational calculations suggest a reaction pathway that gives a direct access to the 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization without intermittent formation of ylide intermediates.

Abstract
This paper reports the transition metal&#8208;free C(sp3)&#8722;H sulfenylation of arylacetamides by using thiophenols as the sulfenyl reagents. The reactions take place in the presence of only K3PO4. Control experiments indicate that the reactions proceed via a featured sulfur&#8208;centred free radical intermediate. In addition, the synthesis of 2&#8208;thiomethyl benzoxazoles has been realized via the p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (p&#8208;TSA) promoted annulation of the sulfenylated products.

Abstract
We report herein a strategy to afford a multicomponent catalytic enantioselective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;substituted isoxazolidin&#8208;5&#8208;ones via a KMC process promoted by a suited cupreine used as bifunctional organocatalyst. The hydroxamic acid component, with a sterically hindered amide moiety, proved to be key for the successful formation and transformation of the obtained original N&#8208;amide isoxazolidin&#8208;5&#8208;ones.

         <title>Modification of the Enantioselectivity of Biocatalytic meso&#8208;Desymmetrization for Synthesis of Both Enantiomers of cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;Disubstituted Cyclohexane by Amidase Engineering</title>

Abstract
Both enantiomers of cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclohexane have been obtained enantioselectively through engineered amidase&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of meso carbocyclic 1,2&#8208;dicarboxamides under mild condition. Based on the enzyme&#8208;substrate binding model suggested by molecular docking, the amplification and reversal of enantioselectivity of amidase was quickly achieved through generating and testing only 8 variants. The origin of enantiopreference for amidase was revealed by MD simulations and the reason for the reversal of enantioselectivity towards amidase variant was disclosed. The synthetic application of biocatalytic meso&#8208;desymmetrization was demonstrated by straightforward transformation of the products to enantiomerically pure heterocyclic compounds.

Abstract
A series of enantioenriched 4,5,6,7&#8208;tetrahydrofuro[2,3&#8208;b]pyridines were accessed by a cycloisomerization/cycloaddition strategy. Starting from ynamide derivatives and aldehydes, yields ranging from 27 to 90% and high levels of stereoselectivity (de&gt;95%, 93&#8211;99% ee) were obtained through sequential relay catalysis. The concurrent use of a gold complex with a diphenylprolinol silyl ether was applied to a combination of diversely functionalized substrates.

Abstract
A nitrogen&#8208;centered radical strategy for the preparation of 3&#8208;acylated spiro[4,5]trienones via visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated acylation/ipso&#8208;cyclization of alkynes with acyl oxime esters is reported. The alkyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted acyl radicals, which generate from the cleavage of carbon&#8208;carbon &#963;&#8208;bonds in acyl oxime esters via nitrogen&#8208;centered radical pathway, attack the carbon&#8208;carbon triple bonds in propiolamides and then undergo ipso&#8208;cyclization. This method provides a way for the construction of 3&#8208;acyl&#8208;substituted spiro[4,5]trienones, which can introduce aryl&#8208; or alkyl&#8208;substituted acyl into spiro[4,5]trienone skeletons.

The alkyl- and aryl-substituted acyl radicals, which generate from the cleavage of carbon-carbon &lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;-bonds in acyl oxime esters &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; nitrogen-centered radical pathway, attack the carbon-carbon triple bonds in propiolamides and then undergo &lt;i&gt;ipso&lt;/i&gt;-cyclization. This method provides a way for the construction of 3-acyl-substituted spiro[4,5]trienones, which can introduce aryl- or alkyl-substituted acyl into spiro[4,5]trienone skeletons.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed tandem intermolecular ylide formation/intramolecular cycloaddition of diazo compounds and aldehyde&#8208;tethered&#8208;cyclohexadienones was reported, chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectively providing oxapolycyclic frameworks in moderate to excellent yields under mild conditions. This reaction creates two C&#8722;C bonds and one C&#8722;O bond with five stereocentres including two all&#8208;carbon quaternary centres. Moreover, the late&#8208;stage diversification of products can be realized via chemoselective substitutions.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Spirothiazolones via Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Cooperative amino&#8208; and palladium catalysis utilizing heterocyclic systems containing strongly coordinating and adsorptive sulfur atom remains an underdeveloped area. Herein, we describe an enantioselective cyclization of enals with thiazole derivatives catalyzed with the combination of achiral Pd(0) complexes and chiral secondary amines. Chiral spirocyclic thiazolones were produced in yields ranging from 41% to 98% with stereoselectivities (from 5:1 to 12:1 dr, and 95&#8211;99%&#8197;ee). Moreover, the developed strategy allows access to highly substituted chiral cyclopentane derivatives by additional transformations of spirocyclic thiazolones.

         <title>Biochemical and Structural Characterization of an (R)&#8208;Selective Transaminase in the Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Hydroxy Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
An (R)&#8208;selective transaminase RbTA with excellent stereoselectivity (&gt;99% ee) in the asymmetric amination of hydroxy ketones was identified. Biochemical characterization showed that RbTA exhibited the highest activity toward 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone among reported enzymes, and that it has broad substrate specificity, including for aliphatic, aromatic, and alicyclic ketones. Crystallization of RbTA were performed, as were molecular docking and mutagenesis studies. Residue Tyr125 plays a key role in substrate recognition by forming a hydrogen bond with hydroxy ketone. The applicability of the enzyme was determined in preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of (R)&#8208;3&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;butanol, demonstrating the potential of RbTA as a green biocatalyst for production of value&#8208;added chiral hydroxy amines. This study provides an efficient tool for enzymatic synthesis of chiral hydroxy amines, as well as structural insight into substrate recognition by transaminases in the asymmetric amination of hydroxy ketones.

         <title>Cascade Reaction of &#945;, &#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones and 2&#8208;Aminoaryl Alcohols for the Synthesis of 3&#8208;Acylquinolines by a Copper Nanocatalyst</title>

         <dc:description>









Abstract
3&#8208;Acylquinolines possess widespread applications in functional chemicals. However, the convenient and selective synthesis of such important substructures has to date remained a challenge. Herein, we report a method to access 3&#8208;acylquinolines from &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones and 2&#8208;aminoaryl alcohols in one pot with a copper nanocatalyst supported on nitrogen&#8208;silica&#8208;doped carbon (Cu/N&#8722;SiO2&#8722;C). Mechanistically, the construction of the product involves a cascade procedure including radical&#8208;type oxidation of 2&#8208;aminoaryl alcohols, aza&#8208;Michael addition and annulation. This developed protocol proceeds with merits of mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance, earth&#8208;abundant and reusable copper catalyst, easily available stocks and O2 as the sole oxidant, which provides an alternative way for the sustainable synthesis of quinoline derivatives.

         <title>Recent Advances in Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed, Directing&#8208;Group&#8208;Assisted C&#8722;H Bond Amidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
C&#8722;N bond formation reactions have garnered a lot of interest in recent years due to the predominance of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds in most pharmacological medications. Since traditional approaches have several limitations, the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H amidation/amination process has arisen as a more atom&#8208;friendly option. Because there are so many distinct kinds of C&#8722;H bonds in organic molecules, selective amidation of C&#8722;H bonds has always been a challenge. In this scenario, the directing&#8208;group&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H amidation has received considerable attention, especially with inexpensive metal cobalt, due to its unique properties and efficiency. We summarize recent developments in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed directing&#8208;group&#8208;aided C&#8722;H bond amidation reactions in this review. We briefly discuss the evolution of directing group preferences and their function in the site selection.

Abstract
A tandem Ir(III)&#8208;catalyzed and Ag2O&#8208;promoted cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC)/ intramolecular cyclization of ketene dithioacetals with benzothiophene derivatives was developed, affording a series of sulfur&#8208;containing cyclization compounds. Mechanistic investigation demonstrated a radical process may be involving intramolecular cyclization. This tandem reaction described herein could be carried out with a broad range of substrates and wide functional group tolerance.

This tandem reaction described herein could be carried out with a broad range of substrates and wide functional group tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Machine&#8208;Assisted Preparation of a Chiral Diamine Ligand Library and In Silico Screening Using Ab Initio Structural Parameters for Heterogeneous Chiral Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A ligand library containing 31 chiral diamines was synthesized using a flow&#8208;based semiautomatic reductive amination system. These ligands were evaluated in a continuous&#8208;flow asymmetric 1,4&#8208;addition reaction with a heterogeneous Ni catalyst. Based on the experimental results of ab initio DFT calculations, a prediction model for enantioselectivities was successfully constructed. Furthermore, virtual screening of possible ligands was conducted to identify promising structures, which showed good enantioselectivities in experiments.

Abstract
In this report, two distinctive intramolecular cyclizations of o&#8208;propargyloxy diketopiperazines (achieved from a one&#8208;pot Ugi post&#8208;transformation) is achieved via a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular reaction of azomethine ylide and alkyne moiety. The presence of internal alkyne in the starting materials directed the reaction towards through [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition, while terminal alkyne led to a spirocyclization reaction between azomethine ylide and terminal unsaturated C&#8722;C bond. This method offering an opportunity for the synthesis of challenging Diazabicyclics and Spiro&#8208;Diketopiperazinochromanes in high yields with exclusive diastereoselectivity.

Abstract
The first organocatalytic asymmetric [4+3]&#8208;cycloaddition of 2&#8208;aminophenyl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls with in&#8197;situ generated azaoxyallyl cations was developed, and enantioenriched functionalized seven&#8208;membered 1,4&#8208;benzodiazepine&#8208;3&#8208;ones were obtained in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. This approach was also extended to the first asymmetric [4+3]&#8208;cycloaddition of &#948;&#8208;hydroxy &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls, affording 1,4&#8208;oxazepanes in one step under mild conditions. Several of the novel adducts demonstrated promising bioactivity in the prevention of peripheral nerve degeneration.

Abstract
A two&#8208;step transition metal&#8208;free methodology for the C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) functionalisation of saturated N&#8208;heterocyclic systems is disclosed. First, aminal derivatives are generated through the anodic oxidation of readily accessible carboxylic acids. Then, in the presence of BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2, iminium ions are unmasked and rapidly alkylated by organozinc reagents under flow conditions. Secondary, tertiary and quaternary carbon centers have been successfully assembled using this methodology. Such an approach is especially relevant to drug discovery since it increases C(sp3)&#8208;functionalities rapidly within a molecular framework. As proof of concept, our methodology was applied to derivatization of peptides and an API.

Abstract
Herein, an air&#8208;stable, molecularly defined NNN&#8722;Mn(II) pincer complex catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols with indoles is reported. A wide variety of symmetrical and unsymmetrical bis(indolyl)methane derivatives as well as some structurally important products such as Vibrindole A, Turbomycin B alkaloid, Antileukemic, and Anticancer agents were synthesized. Mechanistic studies illustrate the importance of the NH moiety in the complex and the crucial role of metal&#8208;ligand cooperation during catalysis.

Abstract
A series of N&#8208;unsubstituted/substituted fullerotetrahydroquinolines without a directly attached nitrogen atom were synthesized in moderate to good yields via a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step reaction of [60]fullerene with arylamines and paraformaldehyde in the presence of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate. Aromatic primary amines produce N&#8208;unsubstituted fullereotetrahydroquinolines, while aromatic secondary amines give N&#8208;substituted fullereotetrahydroquinoline derivatives. As precursors, N&#8208;unsubstituted fullerotetrahydroquinolines could be further derivatized by the N&#8208;alkylation/acylation/carboamidation reactions to produce a large variety of N&#8208;substituted fullerotetrahydroquinolines containing Cl, NO2, C(O), and C(O)NH functional groups, which may have applications in the field of perovskite&#8208;based solar cells. Plausible reaction pathways for the formation of N&#8208;unsubstituted/substituted fullerotetrahydroquinolines were suggested to elucidate the above&#8208;mentioned reaction process.

As precursors, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-unsubstituted fullerotetrahydroquinolines could be further derivatized by the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkylation/acylation/carboamidation reactions to produce a large variety of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-substituted fullerotetrahydroquinolines containing Cl, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C(O), and C(O)NH functional groups, which may have applications in the field of perovskite-based solar cells. Plausible reaction pathways for the formation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-unsubstituted/substituted fullerotetrahydroquinolines were suggested to elucidate the above-mentioned reaction process.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Sulfoxide&#8208;Controlled Stereoselective Aza&#8208;Piancatelli Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The development of a stereoselective aza&#8208;Piancatelli reaction to access 4&#8208;aminocyclopentenones is reported. This transformation relies on the use of chiral o&#8208;sulfinyl anilines as chiral inductors to afford the targeted products in good to excellent yields. Remarkably, the high value&#8208;added cyclopentenones could be obtained in drs up to &gt;95:5, depending upon the furan substitution pattern.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Diazirines and 15N2&#8208;Diazirines from Ketones, Aldehydes and Derivatives: Development and Mechanistic Insight</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Broad scope one&#8208;pot diazirine synthesis strategies have been developed using two different oxidants depending on the nature of the starting material. In all cases, an inexpensive commercial solution of ammonia (NH3) in methanol (MeOH) was employed, avoiding the difficult use of liquid ammonia. With aliphatic ketones, t&#8208;butyl hypochlorite (t&#8208;BuOCl) was found to be the best oxidant whereas it is preferable to use phenyliodine diacetate (PIDA) with aromatic ketones, aldehydes and imines. The nature of the imine&#8208;protecting group is essential and only t&#8208;butyl imine allowed the synthesis of 15N2&#8208;diazirine with complete 15N incorporation, emphasizing a key trans&#8208;imination step in the reaction mechanism. These methods are operationally simple, and tolerant to most functional groups, providing diazirines with yields ranging from 20 to 99%.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Construction of Acyclic N,N&#8208;Acetals via Aza&#8208;Addition of Arylamines to Ketimines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed enantioselective aza&#8208;addition of arylamines to ketimines has been developed for the construction of chiral acyclic N,N&#8208;acetal motifs. Under the standard conditions, arylamines reacted smoothly with ketimines from isoquinoline&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione to afford a series of acyclic N,N&#8208;acetals in 82&#8211;99% yield with 80&#8211;96% ee.

         <dc:description>








Abstract
An isochromene synthesis is developed utilizing a cascade reaction involving a CuI catalyzed coupling reaction between an alkyne and diazoacetate followed by allenoate isomerization and subsequent oxa&#8208;Michael addition. The cascade sequence was also demonstrated for the synthesis of naphthalenes. Furthermore, the methodology developed herein was applied toward a stereoselective synthesis of pyranonaphthoquinone kalafungin.

         <title>Water Can Accelerate Homogeneous Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A selection of gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions was examined in a kinetic study on the influence of water on the rate constant. Two intramolecular reactions and one intermolecular reaction, which proceed via proton transfer and/or protodeauration steps, were investigated. The kinetic data was collected by GC or 1H NMR spectroscopy. The obtained rate constants provided information about the influence of water in these test reactions. On the basis of the data collected, beyond the commonly assumed tolerance against water, a reaction&#8208;promoting influence of water on gold catalysis was identified and kinetically quantified. The results underline that the often&#8208;mentioned water&#8208;tolerance of gold catalysis not only simplifies these reactions operationally, but in addition even provides better results than a troublesome exclusion of water.

Abstract
Alkynes generally serve as C2 synthons in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H annulations, herein, exploiting electron&#8208;deficient alkynes as unconventional C1 synthons, the chemo&#8208; and regiospecific synthesis of functionalized 1H&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]indol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones via a redox&#8208;neutral rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed [4+1] annulation of N&#8208;carbamoyl indoles has been achieved. This process is characterized by high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, broad substrate scope, good tolerance of functional groups, moderate to high yields and mild redox&#8208;neutral conditions, thus affording a robust approach to access valuable 1H&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]indol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones.

This process is characterized by high chemo- and regioselectivity, broad substrate scope, good tolerance of functional groups, moderate to high yields and mild redox-neutral conditions, thus affording a robust approach to access valuable 1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-imidazo[1,5-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]indol-3(2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-ones.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot cascade cyclization of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;(acetyloxy)propargyl)benzaldehydes with o&#8208;phenylenediamines for an access to substituted isoindolo[2,1&#8208;a]quinoxalines has been developed. The reaction features readily available starting materials, simple operational procedure, and broad substrate scopes. Under optimal conditions, various isoindolo[2,1&#8208;a]quinoxalines were afforded in 41&#8211;88% yields.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Enantiopure Oxazolidinones via Biocatalytic Asymmetric Aminohydroxylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Chiral oxazolidinones are of significance in both medicinal and synthetic chemistry, while preparing these compounds usually involves using expensive starting materials and harsh reaction conditions. Herein, a one&#8208;pot biocatalytic cascade process was developed for stereo&#8208; and regioselective aminohydroxylation of diverse alkenes by combining styrene monooxygenase and halohydrin dehalogenase, providing an approach to enantiopure oxazolidinones.

         <title>Manganese(III) Acetate Catalyzed Aerobic Dehydrogenation of Tertiary Indolines, Tetrahydroquinolines and an N&#8208;Unsubstituted Indoline</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A Mn(OAc)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O&#8208;catalyzed aerobic dehydrogenation of five and six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles for the synthesis of N&#8208;heteroarenes is reported. Of note, this protocol can be applied to the dehydrogenation of tertiary indolines with various electron&#8208;deficient N&#8208;substituents. Preliminary mechanistic investigations support that a single&#8208;electron transfer pathway might be involved.

Abstract
Copper(II)&#8208;mediated unprecedented intermolecular radical [3+2] annulation of N,N&#8208;dimethyl enaminones has been developed. The protocol is promoted simply by copper(II) chloride to access 5&#8208;acyl&#8208;3&#8208;furancarboxaldehydes with acceptable to good yields and broad substrate scope. This reaction allows the formation of multiple new bonds, including C(sp2)&#8722;O bond between two nucleophilic sites, C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) bond and C=O bond, through a radical cyclization process. Moreover, gram&#8208;synthesis and application research show the potential application value of this transformation in industry.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Functionalized oxindoles are privileged heterocyclic scaffolds and common core structural motifs that are broadly present in numerous natural products and serve as key intermediates in the synthesis of biological products, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Oxindoles exhibit a broad pharmacological and physiological activities, and diverse range of applications in medicinal chemistry and biomedical research. Owing to these fascinating biological and physiological activities of oxindoles, several methodologies have been developed for the construction of oxindoles. In the past decade, the visible light mediated methodologies have attracted substantial attention and emerged as a promising approach for the construction of oxindoles. In this review, the visible light mediated synthesis of oxindoles have been described.

         <title>Asymmetric Epoxidation of Enones Promoted by Dinuclear Magnesium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Asymmetric synthesis with cheaper and non&#8208;toxic alkaline earth metal catalysts is becoming an important and sustainable alternative to conventional catalytic methodologies mostly relying on precious metals. In spite of some sustainable methods for enantioselective epoxidation of enones, the development of a well&#8208;defined and efficient catalyst based on magnesium complexes for these reactions is still a challenging task. In this perspective, we present the application of chiral dinuclear magnesium complexes for asymmetric epoxidation of a broad range of electron&#8208;deficient enones. We demonstrate that the in&#8197;situ generated magnesium&#8208;ProPhenol complex affords enantioenriched oxiranes in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). Our extensive study verifies the literature data in this area and provides a step forward to better understand the factors controlling the oxygenation process. Elaborated catalyst offers mild reaction conditions and a truly wide substrate scope.

Abstract
Series of chiral palladium(II) allyl and cinnamyl complexes bearing a C1&#8208;symmetric N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes were synthesized from achiral precursors. The chirality of theses complexes results from the formation of the carbene&#8208;palladium bond which restricts the rotation of dissymmetric N&#8208;aryl substituents of the NHC and thus creates an axis of chirality. Chiral HPLC at preparative scale enabled the resolution of racemic complexes and provided a straightforward access to complexes with excellent enantiopurities (&gt;99.5% ee). Enantiopure complexes were studied by crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and electronic circular dichroism (ECD). Their configuration stabilities were investigated both experimentally and theoretically through the determination of the rotational barrier values. These complexes were tested for the intramolecular &#945;&#8208;arylation of amides, with a moderate chiral induction (up to 54% ee).
