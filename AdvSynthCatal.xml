      <dc:description>Enantioenriched spirocyclic compounds bearing three contiguous stereocenters and high functionalization were obtained through a formal [3+2] cycloaddition reaction catalyzed by a cooperative system. The spiro compounds were synthesized from 4&#8208;arylideneisoxazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones and isocyanoacetate esters using a bifunctional squaramide/Br&#248;nsted base organocatalyst derived from a Cinchona alkaloid and silver oxide as Lewis acid. This method afforded two out of the four possible diastereomers with good yields and high enantiomeric excess for both diastereomers.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A direct and versatile copper&#8208;mediated three&#8208;component reaction of arylboronic acids, Me3SiN3 and aldehydes for the synthesis of A direct and versatile copper&#8208;mediated three&#8208;component reaction of arylboronic acids, trimethylsilyl azide and aldehydes for the synthesis of benzimidazoles is reported. The reaction is well tolerated in a wide range of substituted aromatic aldehydes and aromatic boronic acids to produce the corresponding benzimidazoles with moderate to high yields. Mechanism investigation demonstrated that copper&#8208;promoted Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam coupling, C&#8208;H amination and oxidative cycloaddition are involved in the tandem processes.</dc:description>

      <title>Halogen Bond&#8208;Catalyzed Povarov Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>The use of a bidentate halogen bond donor to catalyse Povarov reactions of imines derived from aryladehydes and anilines is reported.  Dienophiles used in these reactions included 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran, N&#8208;vinyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone and N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;protected 2,3&#8208;dihydropyrrole.

      <dc:description>Substituted oxabicyclo derivatives bearing two quaternary carbon centers and five contiguous stereocenters have been synthesized from C3&#8208;thioester/&#8208;ester substituted dienones, a simple and linear pluripotent molecular platform. The conversion proceeds from neat reactants, possibly via a thermally&#8208;driven pericyclic cascade manifold involving sequential (E)&#8208;s&#8208;trans to (E)&#8208;s&#8208;cis isomerization, oxa&#8208;6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization, and intermolecular, regioselective [4&#960; + 2&#960;] cycloaddition. The proposed mechanism has been substantiated by intermediate trapping experiments and DFT studies. Such dienones have also been exploited to effect stereoselective cross Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadditions with olefins and sequential Diels&#8208;Alder/retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with activated alkynes.

      <dc:description>Iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective transfer hydrogenation of ketones with formic acid was developed using a prolinol&#8208;phosphine chiral ligand. Cooperative action of the iridium atom and the ligand through alcohol&#8211;alkoxide interconversion is crucial to facilitate the transfer hydrogenation. Various ketones including alkyl aryl ketones, ketoesters, and an aryl heteroaryl ketone were competent substrates.

      <title>Imidazodipyridines via DMAP Catalyzed Domino N&#8208;H Carbonylation and 6&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization: Synthetic Scope and Application</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, we report a domino reaction for access to highly functionalized imidazo[1,2&#8208;a:5,4&#8208;b']dipyridines simply by stirring Boc2O in the presence of DMAP as a catalyst with readily prepared 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;(vinyl)imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine. This methodology enables the synthesis of highly functionalized imidazodipyridines. The process proved to be compatible with a wide variety of substrates. The synthetic potential of this method was illustrated by performing a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling on 4&#8208;phenylimidazo&#8208;dipyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ol derivatives. Screening of the biological activity of the newly generated compounds led to the identification of a new hit.

      <title>Synthesis of Se&#8208;Heterocycles by Cascade Cyclization of Alkynes Containing Heteroatoms</title>
      <dc:description>Over the last decades, many methods have been reported for the synthesis of selenium&#8208; heterocyclic scaffolds by virtue of their interesting reactivities and a broad range of applications in the medicinal and material chemistry. This review involves the electrophilic/radical cyclization of alkynes containing heteroatoms which resulted into the novel Se&#8208;heterocycles. The synthesis of seleno&#8208;heterocycles via different nucleophiles including O, N, S, Se, Te, and C&#8208;nucleophiles is exhaustively discussed. Also, one&#8208;pot electrophilic cyclization of 1,3&#8208;diynes and 1,3,5&#8208;triynes was described in details. Furthermore, the various mechanisms underlying the synthesis of selenium&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactam, carbapenem heterocycle, bis&#8208; and tris&#8208;selenide alkene, &#946;&#8208;selenosulfonation and selenated alkynes were discussed. The Se&#8208;heterocyles reported in this review allow preparing these selenated compounds bearing the selenium moiety both on the rings (outside) and inside the ring (e.g. selenophenes). The review outline show the growing opportunities to construct the alkyne heteroatom resulted in the selenium containing heterocycles.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Abstract. A highly efficient Heck&#8208;Matsuda desymmetrization of unsaturated spirohydantoins directed by non&#8208;covalent interactions, which allows the construction of two simultaneous stereogenic centers, including a trisubstituted quaternary one, is described. This Heck arylation permitted a novel enantioselective total synthesis of the S1PR1 agonist (also an S1PR3 antagonist) compound VPC01091, a potential drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. The broad scope of these enantioselective Heck&#8208;Matsuda arylations of the spirohydantoins provided several arylated spiro systems in yields ranging from 76% to 99%, with enantiomeric ratios (er) up to 97:3, and diastereoselectivities (dr) of &gt;20:1 in all cases studied. The method uses only 2% of Pd(TFA)2 and 3 mol% of the chiral N,N&#8208;ligand Pyrabox in short reaction times of 1&#8208;2 h. These enantioselective Heck arylations can also be carried out at the gram scale in high yields with no erosion of their diastereoselectivity or enantioselectivity.	The key spiro Heck products (R,R)&#8208;21 and (R,R)&#8208;27 bearing an aryl iodide moiety or an aryl n&#8208;octyl moiety were employed as starting materials for the total enantioselective syntheses of the (S,S)&#8208;VPC01091, in overall yields of 20% and 22% respectively after 10 or 9 steps from the starting spirohydantoin, with an er&gt; 95:5.

      <title>Recent Advances in Carbonylative Difunctionalization of Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>The carbonylation reaction represents one of the most powerful methods for the rapid build&#8208;up of carbonyl structures and has widely applied in both academic and industry fields. Carbonylative difunctionalization of alkenes, which installs a unique functional group and a carbonyl group across the C&#8208;C double bonds, offers a high potential strategy for the selective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;substituted carbonyl compounds. The carbonylative difunctionalization of alkenes involves the formation of three &#963;&#8208;bonds and two stereocenters as well as a carbonyl group in a single transformation. Careful design of the substrate and control of reaction pathway would result unexpected advantages in constructing complex structures, which are ubiquitous in natural products, pharmaceuticals and functional materials. In this Review, the important advances and contributions in carbonylative difunctionalization of alkenes are summarized based on the different reaction types, with the wish to inspire future studies and promote further developments in this field.</dc:description>

      <title>Zinc/Indium Bimetallic Lewis Acid Relay Catalysis for Dehydrogenative Silylation/Hydrosilylation Reaction of Terminal Alkynes with Bis(hydrosilane)s</title>
      <dc:description>When mixed with two different Lewis acid catalysts of zinc and indium, terminal alkynes were found to elegantly react with bis(hydrosilane)s to selectively give 1,1&#8208;disilylalkenes from among several possible products, by way of a sequential dehydrogenative silylation/intramolecular hydrosilylation reaction. Adding a pyridine base is crucial in this reaction; a switch as a catalyst of the zinc Lewis acid is turned on by forming a zinc&#8208;pyridine&#8208;base complex. A range of the 1,1&#8208;disilylalkenes can be obtained by a combination of aryl and aliphatic terminal alkynes plus aryl&#8208;, heteroaryl&#8208;, and naphthyl&#8208;tethered bis(hydrosilane)s. The 1,1&#8208;disilylalkene prepared here is available as a reagent for further transformations by utilizing its C&#8208;Si or C=C bond: the former includes Hiyama cross&#8208;coupling, bismuth&#8208;catalyzed ether formation, and iododesilylation; the latter includes double alkylation and epoxidation. Mechanistic studies clarified the role of the two Lewis acids: the zinc&#8208;pyridine&#8208;base complex catalyzes the dehydrogenative silylation as a first stage, and, following on this, the indium Lewis acid catalyzes the ring&#8208;closing hydrosilylation as a second stage, thus leading to the 1,1&#8208;disilylalkene.</dc:description>

The directly utilize nitroarenes in synthetically valuable C&#8211;N bond formation is of great significance, because the pre&#8208;reduction step to corresponding amines can be avoided.

Currently, much attention has been attracted to organosilanes as new potential reducing agents, not only because they are inexpensive, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, and mild reagents, but also various novel reaction models of nitroarenes have been explored. In this review, we mainly summarize the recent progress on the reductive coupling of nitroarenes by using organosilanes as the end reductants. We hope that a deep understanding of the reaction model and underlying working mechanism can provide a timely guideline for researchers who are interested in this fantastic area, leading to further exploration of practical and efficient reductive coupling of nitroarenes for C&#8208;N bond formation and N&#8208;heterocycle synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>Advances in the Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Atropisomeric Hexatomic N&#8208;Heterobiaryls</title>
      <dc:description>Axially chiral hexatomic N&#8208;heterobiaryls are among the most important class of structures with extensive utility in asymmetric catalysis as chiral ligands and organocatalysts, as exemplified by QUINAP and QUINOX. Besides, these atropisomers have attracted broad attention due to their application in drug discovery. Hence, it is not surprising that extensive efforts have been devoted for the pursue of efficient catalytic asymmetric methods for their direct and atroposelective construction. In addition to the direct heteroaryl&#8208;aryl cross&#8208;coupling, which remains as a challenge, a series of creative catalytic asymmetric strategies based on pre&#8208;formed heterobiaryl systems have been developed by taking advantage of the intrinstic property of N atom on the heteroarenes. Generally, the methods employed extensively involved kinetic resolution, dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation, dynamic kinetic resolution and desymmetrization reaction. A growing number of approaches through stereoselective de novo formation of a six&#8208;membered
N&#8208;heteroaromatic ring have also been reported for specific applications in this field. This review summarizes recent advancements of axially chiral hexatomic N&#8208;heterobiaryls construction by means of asymmetric catalysis, including their scope, limitations, mechanisms and applications.

In addition to the direct heteroaryl&#8208;aryl cross&#8208;coupling, which remains as a challenge, a series of creative catalytic asymmetric strategies based on pre&#8208;formed heterobiaryl systems have been developed by taking advantage of the intrinstic property of N atom on the heteroarenes. Generally, the methods employed extensively involved kinetic resolution, dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation, dynamic kinetic resolution and desymmetrization reaction. A growing number of approaches through stereoselective de novo formation of a six&#8208;membered
N&#8208;heteroaromatic ring have also been reported for specific applications in this field. This review summarizes recent advancements of axially chiral hexatomic N&#8208;heterobiaryls construction by means of asymmetric catalysis, including their scope, limitations, mechanisms and applications.

      <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Alkyne Functionalization by N&#8208;O/S&#8208;O/C&#8208;O Bond Oxidants</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract: Since the beginning of this century, homogeneous gold&#8208;catalyzed alkyne transformations have been an active area of research in pursuit of developing novel and efficient synthetic methodologies. This emerging area of research which at the beginning exploited the mild Lewis acid character of gold and its propensity to form &#960;&#8208;complex with alkyne, has been reinvigorated upon the discovery of gold&#8208;catalyzed oxidative alkyne functionalization in 2007. The gold&#8208;catalyzed alkyne oxidation enabled direct access to &#945;&#8208;oxo gold carbenes and gold alkynal complex with versatile reactivity which has been applied to achieve novel transformations including but not limited to oxyarylation, C&#8722;H, X&#8722;H (X = N, O) insertion, cyclization, cycloaddition, ring expansion, and various novel cascade reaction. This review provides a comprehensive summary of methods, applications and mechanistic insight of gold&#8208;catalyzed oxidative alkyne functionalization by N&#8722;O/S&#8722;O/C&#8722;O bond oxidants covering the literature reports appeared since 2007.</dc:description>

      <title>Double Carbonylation Reactions: Overview and Recent Advances</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. The compounds like amides, carbamates, oxamates, oxamides, &#945;&#8208;keto amides, diketones, esters, ureas, etc. find extensive applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and organic synthesis. The classical syntheses of these compounds often involve cumbersome routes involving toxic chemicals. The carbonylation reactions such as aminocarbonylation, alkoxycarbonylation, oxidative carbonylation and double carbonylation deliver as an efficient and attractive alternative to the conventional synthetic routes even at industrial scale. The catalytic single carbonylation reactions are extensively studied, however, catalytic double carbonylation reactions are not explored for several potential applications. This review covers literature on the use of different types of catalysts involving various	metals like Pd, Cu, Fe, Co, Rh and Ni for double carbonylation reactions along with the chemistry of associated ligands. It also covers double carbonylation used for synthesis of different types of novel substrates with the discussion related to mechanism of formations of mono and di carbonylation products. The notable introduction of several CO&#8208;surrogates and exploration of their efficiency have solved the problems related to the toxicity of CO.  CO&#8208;surrogates used for double carbonylation reactions are also discussed.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Heteroarene&#8208;Fused Cyclopentadienes and Related Compounds Suitable for Metallocene Preparation</title>
      <dc:description>Metallocene catalysis is widely used in transformations of unsaturated organic compounds, including the bulk industrial synthesis of polyolefins. Over the last few decades, the electronic and structural properties of their &#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;coordinated ligands have been modified by introducing electron&#8208;donating, electron&#8208;withdrawing, and sterically hindered substituents to obtain desirable catalytic properties for the metallocenes. An efficient way to design &#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;coordinated ligands is to exploit the annelation of heterocyclic fragments with a cyclopentadiene ring. In the present review, we summarize, systematize, and analyze synthetic approaches to heterocycle&#8208;fused cyclopentadienes suitable for metallocene catalyst preparation.
