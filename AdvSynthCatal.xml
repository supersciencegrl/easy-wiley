         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts Alkylation Reactions of Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Substituted and annulated pyrroles containing chiral centers are potentially accessible by means of an organocatalytic enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation (FCA) reaction. They are interesting compounds because of their abundant natural occurrence and their different biological activities. In comparison to indoles, for which a myriad of asymmetric procedures involving the FCA have been developed, pyrroles have been relatively less used as nucleophilic counterparts in this reaction. However, in the last two decades, huge synthetic efforts have been performed around this interesting asymmetric transformation and several methodologies have been devised. In this context, this review article provides a general overview of the organocatalytic enantioselective FCA chemistry of pyrroles, which has not been revised to date.

         <title>The Trityl&#8208;Cation Mediated Phosphine Oxides Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Reduction of phosphine oxides into the corresponding phosphines using PhSiH3 as a reducing agent and Ph3C+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; as an initiator is described. The process is highly efficient, reducing a broad range of secondary and tertiary alkyl and arylphosphines, bearing various functional groups in generally good yields. The reaction is believed to proceed through the generation of a silyl cation, which reaction with the phosphine oxide provides a phosphonium salt, further reduced by the silane to afford the desired phosphine along with siloxanes.

         <title>Copper(0) nanoparticle catalyzed Z&#8208;Selective Transfer Semihydrogenation of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The use of copper(0) nanoparticles in the transfer semihydrogenation of alkynes has been investigated as a lead&#8208;free alternative to Lindlar catalysts. A stereo&#8208;selective methodology for the hydrogenation of internal alkynes to the corresponding (Z)&#8208;alkenes in high isolated yields (86% average) has been developed. This green and sustainable transfer hydrogenation protocol relies on non&#8208;noble copper nanoparticles for reduction of both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient, aliphatic&#8208;substituted and aromatic&#8208; substituted internal alkynes. Polyols, such as ethylene glycol and glycerol, have been proven to act as hydrogen sources, and excellent stereo&#8208; and chemoselectivity have been observed. Enabling technologies, such as microwave and ultrasound irradiation are shown to enhance heat and mass transfer, whether used alone or in combination, resulting in a decrease in reaction time from hours to minutes.

Abstract
An intramolecular palladium&#8208;catalyzed tandem &#947;&#8208;arylation/aromatization reaction of cyclohex&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives was developed. This work provides a simple and efficient approach for the construction of substituted 3,4&#8208;dihydroanthracen&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones in good yields with a broad substrate scope.

         <title>Electrochemical Generation of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes for Use in Synthesis and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The electrochemical generation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) offers a mild and selective alternative to traditional synthetic methods that usually rely on strong bases and air&#8208;sensitive materials. The use of electrons as reagents results in an efficient and clean synthesis that enables the direct use of NHCs in various applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical generation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) offers a mild and selective alternative to traditional synthetic methods that usually rely on strong bases and air&#8208;sensitive materials. The use of electrons as reagents results in an efficient and clean synthesis that enables the direct use of NHCs in various applications. Herein, the use of electrogenerated NHCs in organocatalysis, synthesis and organometallic chemistry is explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkene Thioacylation: A C&#8722;S Bond Activation Approach for Accessing Indanone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular alkene thioacylation reaction initiated by the activation of thioester C(acyl)&#8722;S bonds is reported. This approach successfully suppressed decarbonylation and &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination with related acyl and alkyl metal thiolate intermediates, providing an efficient and atom&#8208;economical method to access indanone scaffolds. Mechanistic studies provide support for C(acyl)&#8722;Pd bond insertion of olefins. The synthetic utility of this protocol is demonstrated by the further conversion of the newly formed methylene sulfide substituent.

         <title>Nucleophilic Halogenation of Heterocyclic N&#8208;Oxides: Recent Progress and a Practical Guide</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The review summarizes recent advances in the synthesis of C2&#8208;halogenated nitrogen heterocycles via nucleophilic halogenation of corresponding N&#8208;oxides as well as application of this methodology in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. Both scientific and patent literature is reviewed mostly over the period of the last ten years. The review contains a practical guide (typical procedures and infographic based on extensive literature analysis), which can help practitioners in choosing optimal reagents/conditions for nucleophilic halogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles of different types. The bibliography contains 199&#8197;references.

A series of previously unknown structurally diverse azide&#8208; substituted quinoline&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones were obtained under metal&#8208;free and room&#8208;temperature conditions. The key features of this reaction are a broad substrate scope, amenability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and easy product derivatization. Preliminary mechanistic studies support participation of an organoselenium species in a radical relay pathway.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Directing group&#8208;assisted C&#8208;H activation has been widely used to control the regioselectivity in the field of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H functionalization. The most appealing directing groups are those common functionalities in complex organic molecules and/or readily available reagents, as it circumvents the need to install/remove the directing group. The aldehyde group is an important functional group in many areas including pharmaceuticals and material science. In this review, we present the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in aldehyde&#8208;assisted, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed sp2 C&#8211;H functionalization of arenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Phloretin &#945;&#8208;Glucosides using a Sucrose Phosphorylase Mutant and its Effect on Solubility, Antioxidant Properties and Skin Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosylation of polyphenols may increase their aqueous solubility, stability, bioavailability and pharmacological activity. Herein, we used a mutant of sucrose phosphorylase from Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum engineered to accept large polyphenols (variant TtSPP_R134A) to produce phloretin glucosides. The reaction was performed using 10% (v/v) acetone as cosolvent. The selective formation of a monoglucoside or a diglucoside (53% and 73% maximum conversion percentage, respectively) can be kinetically controlled. MS and 2D&#8208;NMR determined that the monoglucoside was phloretin 4&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside and the diglucoside phloretin&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;[&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranosyl&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;O&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside], a novel compound. The molecular features that determine the specificity of this enzyme for 4&#8217;&#8208;OH phenolic group were analysed by induced&#8208;fit docking analysis of each putative derivative, using the crystal structure of TtSPP and changing the mutated residue. The mono&#8208; and diglucoside were, respectively, 71&#8208; and 1200&#8208;fold more soluble in water than phloretin at room temperature.  The &#945;&#8208;glucosylation decreased the antioxidant capacity of phloretin, measured by DPPH and ABTS assays; however, this loss was moderate and the activity could be recovered upon deglycosylation in vivo. Since phloretin attracts a great interest in dermocosmetic applications, we analyzed the percutaneous absorption of glucosides and the aglycon employing a pig skin model. Although the three compounds were detected in all skin layers (except the fluid receptor), the diglucoside was present mainly on superficial layers.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Chemoselective and Stereoselective Approach to Synthesis of Spiro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;Lactams with Potent Anticancer Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Chemoselective approaches were developed for derivatizing diastereoselective chromanone spiro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams through the Michael&#8208;type addition by using amide as a weak nucleophile to construct the spiro&#8208;carbon center under basic conditions. To expand the scope of this post&#8208;Ugi cascade reaction, a new series of oxidized chromone derivatives was synthesized by altering solvent from EtOH to DMF. Compounds 7&#8201;a and 7&#8201;b which could be synthesized in one day, demonstrated comparable anticancer activities with legendary anticancer drug paclitaxel in the PANC and U87&#8197;cell lines. This methodology offers a new approach to construct spiro&#8208;carbon centers with functionalized chromanones or chromones under mild reaction conditions.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Functionalized coumarins are privileged scaffolds which display diverse pharmacological and physiological activities, and a myriad of applications in medical science and biomedical research. Owing to these multifarious activities of coumarins, synthetic chemists are actively engaged in developing new and superior methods for their synthesis. In the last decade, the synthesis of functionalized coumarins via visible light&#8208;induced methodologies has turned into one of the most significant and fundamental missions in organic synthesis. This review covers the literature on the synthesis of functionalized coumarins under visible light&#8208;assisted methodologies.

Abstract
Nano&#8208;ferrite&#8208;supported Cu nanoparticles (Fe&#8208;dopamine&#8208;Cu NPs) catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroboration of alkenes with B2pin2 is reported under mild reaction conditions. This protocol can be applied to a broad range of substrates with high functional group compatibility. In addition, we demonstrated the use of Fe&#8208;dopamine&#8208;Cu NPs as a catalyst for the &#946;&#8208;borylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones and ester, providing alkylboronate esters in up to 98% yield. Reuse of the magnetically recyclable catalyst resulted in no significant loss of activity in up to five reaction runs for both systems.

         <title>Stepwise Suzuki&#8722;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling of Triborylalkenes Derived from Alkynyl&#8722;B(dan)s: Regioselective and Flexible Synthesis of Tetrasubstituted Alkenes</title>

Abstract
Alkenes with three boryl groups of differing reactivities were synthesized and subsequently cross&#8208;coupled regioselectively with aryl halides in a stepwise manner to afford tetrasubstituted alkenes. The key triborylalkene is derived from the platinum&#8208;catalyzed diboration of alkynyl&#8722;B(dan)s with B2(pin)2. Due to excellent regioselectivity and reaction efficiency of each step starting with alkynyl&#8722;B(dan)s, tetrasubstituted alkenes with desired carbon frameworks at desired positions can be prepared in high yields. For example, an alkene with four distinct aryl groups, p&#8208;MeOC6H4, p&#8208;CF3C6H4, p&#8208;MeC6H4, and p&#8208;NCC6H4, was obtained in 71% overall yield via six steps, starting with the dehydrogenative borylation of p&#8208;MeC6H4C&#8801;CH with HB(dan). Moreover, a variety of tetrasubstituted alkenes, including regio&#8208; and stereoisomers of the above tetraarylalkene, AIE&#8208;active TPTPE and derivatives thereof, and (Z)&#8208;tamoxifen, a well&#8208;known breast cancer drug, were accessed via the developed strategy.

Due to excellent regioselectivity and reaction efficiency of each step starting with alkynyl&#8722;B(dan)s, tetrasubstituted alkenes with desired carbon frameworks at desired positions can be prepared in high yields. For example, an alkene with four distinct aryl groups, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;MeOC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;MeC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;NCC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, was obtained in 71% overall yield via six steps, starting with the dehydrogenative borylation of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;MeC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&#8801;CH with HB(dan). Moreover, a variety of tetrasubstituted alkenes, including regio&#8208; and stereoisomers of the above tetraarylalkene, AIE&#8208;active TPTPE and derivatives thereof, and (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;tamoxifen, a well&#8208;known breast cancer drug, were accessed via the developed strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
Recently, we disclosed the uncatalyzed formation of polyaminoboranes (PABs) from monomeric diisopropylaminoborane (iPr2N&#8722;BH2) and primary amines (RNH2). Their structure is studied through a detailed multinuclear NMR study and their full spectroscopic characterization is presented revealing that N&#8208;alkyl substituted PABs exhibit magnetically non&#8208;equivalent methylenic protons in the close vicinity of the BN&#8208;backbone. We also performed an in&#8208;depth theoretical study of this global chemical process. The mechanism is fully apprehended and the strong influence of the temperature on the outcome of the reaction is unveiled. DFT&#8208;calculations clearly show that the formation of the polyaminoboranes (RNH&#8722;BH2)n results from a kinetically controlled step&#8208;growth polymerization reaction that can be globally viewed as a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail association process of the in&#8197;situ generated transient monomeric monoalkylamino&#8208;borane [RNH&#8722;BH2].

The front cover picture, provided by Seung Hwan Cho and co&#8208;workers, illustrates (R)&#8208;TRIP&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution of &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allylboronate esters through chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective allylation of aldehydes. The reaction is proposed to proceed via a chair&#8208;like transition state by the double coordination of (R)&#8208;TRIP to the C&#8722;H bond of aldehydes and the oxygen atom of Bpin group, thus effectively resolving &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allylboronate esters with high enantiomeric ratios.

Abstract
Here, we review recent progress in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free inter&#8208;element boration reactions via Lewis&#8208;basic activation of various boron reagents, focusing mainly on the boration reactions of carbon&#8208;carbon multiple bonds without an electron&#8208;withdrawing (activating) group and those with an electron&#8208;withdrawing group where the polarity of the addition reaction is inverse to the &#8220;natural&#8221; reactivity.

         <title>Borata&#8208;Alkene Species as Nucleophilic Reservoir</title>

Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Monoboryl anions show remarkable stability due to the valence deficiency of the adjacent three&#8208;coordinate boron center and can be expressed as its resonance form, the borata&#8208;alkene systems [R2B=CH2]&#8722;. The diversity of synthetic approaches as well as the properties of the C=B bond are disclosed in this review, dealing with both electronic and structural properties of the boryl moieties involved. Full characterization in solid state by X&#8208;ray diffraction demonstrated the short distances between B and C, as a consequence of the boron ylide character in the boron&#8208;stabilized carbanions. This review includes a collection of C&#8722;B length distances as well as 11B NMR data that can be useful for diagnostic evidence of the partial boron&#8208;carbon double&#8208;bond character. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis on DFT computed structures also supports and justifies the borata&#8208;alkene character.
The reactivity of the C=B bond acting as nucleophilic synthon is unveiled through extensive electrophilic trapping examples. The homologation protocols with diborylmethane, via single carbon chain extension, involves a facile introduction of the C(sp3)&#8722;B bonds, which can be subsequently transformed into functionalized target products, containing C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N or C&#8722;C bonds.

Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;containing compounds have a long history of utility in a broad range of fields, including agricultural, pharmaceutical, and metal&#8208;mediated reactions. In recent decades, numerous methods have been developed to streamline the synthesis of organophosphorus reagents based on these numerous applications. This review focuses upon the recent development of phosphorus(III)&#8208; and phosphorus(V)&#8208;directed C&#8722;H borylation reactions. This transformation has evolved significantly in the past two years, resulting in several new methods that provide access to organic substrates containing both phosphorus and boron. Further functionalization of the carbon&#8722;boron bond to provide functionalized organophosphorus products is discussed.

Abstract
The particular nature of boron compounds allows an ample modularity of their properties ranging from Lewis acids, C&#8208;nucleophiles, B&#8208;nucleophiles, or even conjunctive reagents for new synthetic manipulations. Moreover, the increasing demand for functionalized boron derivatives for pharmaceutical or material science applications requires the development of new synthetic methods for boron introduction in organic compounds. This review summarizes the possible combinations of boron derivatives with a variety of strained heterocycles reported in the most recent literature.

Abstract
This review describes recent advances in the synthesis of anthranilamide/1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene&#8208;substituted organoboron compounds with diminished boron Lewis acidity via catalytic B(aam)&#8208; and B(dan)&#8208;installing borylation reactions, which have attracted growing attention especially in the last five years owing to their unique reactivity, regioselectivity, and the outstanding stability toward air and moisture of organoboron compounds obtained therefrom. Direct Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings with R&#8211;B(aam)/B(dan), which were believed to be wholly unreactive until recently, are also discussed.

Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Aminoalkylboronic acids display a distinct role in medicinal chemistry, and their utility has been demonstrated by the successful commercialization of three drugs: bortezomib, ixazomib, and vaborbactam. Just as &#945;&#8208;aminoalkylboronic acids are a bioisostere of &#945;&#8208;amino acids, &#946;&#8208;aminoalkylboronates are a bona fide bioisostere of &#946;&#8208;amino acids, thus they also hold promising potential in drug discovery. Moreover, &#946;&#8208;aminoalkylboronates are versatile synthetic intermediates that are amenable to many of the established C&#8722;B bond derivatization reactions of chiral optically enriched alkylboronates, leading to the stereocontrolled preparation of valued classes of products such as &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols, 1,2&#8208;diamines, and hemiboronic acid heterocycles. In addition, &#946;&#8208;aminoalkylboronates were shown to act as catalysts in certain organic reactions. This review presents an overview of the strengths and limitations of current preparative methods to access &#946;&#8208;aminoalkylboronic acid derivatives stereoselectively with various substitution patterns. Strategically, several disconnections can be exploited to establish both functional groups. Some of the key methods include the classical Matteson asymmetric homologation chemistry, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed aminoboration of alkenes and formal hydroboration of enamine derivatives, nucleophilic additions of boryl&#8208;substituted carbanions onto N&#8208;functionalized imines, borylative ring openings of aziridines, and functionalization of alpha&#8208;boryl aldehydes.

Abstract
Certain electron&#8208;rich 1,4&#8208;diborabenzene derivatives efficiently activate single, double, and triple bonds and thereby increasingly compete with transition metals in homogeneous catalysis. This review compares the activation of three model substrates (H2, H2C=CH2, CO2) by (i) 9,10&#8208;dihydro&#8208;9,10&#8208;diboraanthracene dianions, (ii) their neutral carbene&#8208;stabilized congeners, (iii) 1,3,2,5&#8208;diazadiborinines, and (iv) 1,4,2,5&#8208;diazadiborinines. Distinct structure&#8208;properties relationships become apparent, the most influential factors being (i) the steric demands of the B&#8208;bonded substituents, (ii) the charges on the B&#8208;doped (hetero)arenes, (iii) charge polarization as a result of additional N&#8208;doping, and (iv) the energies and nodal structures of the frontier orbitals. The observed reactions are explained by a transition metal&#8208;like activation mechanism. If the two boron atoms are chemically inequivalent, contributions of a B(+I)/B(+III) mixed&#8208;valence state determine the observed regioselectivities when polar substrates are added. The lessons learned from the conversions of the model substrates are subsequently used to rationalize the behavior of the B2 heterocycles also toward more sophisticated substrate molecules. Finally, catalytic cycles based on H2&#8208; and H&#8722;&#8208;transfers, hydroboration reactions, and CO2 reductions will be covered.

         <title>Fluorinated Aryl Boronates as Building Blocks in Organic Synthesis</title>

Abstract
Organoboron compounds are well known building blocks for many organic reactions. However, under basic conditions, polyfluorinated aryl boronic acid derivatives suffer from instability issues that are accelerated in compounds containing an ortho&#8208;fluorine group, which result in the formation of the corresponding protodeboronation products. Therefore, a considerable amount of research has focused on novel methodologies to synthesize these valuable compounds while avoiding the protodeboronation issue. This review summarizes the latest developments in the synthesis of fluorinated aryl boronic acid derivatives and their applications in cross&#8208;coupling reactions and other transformations.

         <title>Selectivity in the Elaboration of Bicyclic Borazarenes</title>

Abstract
Among aromatic compounds, borazarenes represent a significant class of isosteres in which carbon&#8208;carbon bonds have been replaced by B&#8722;N bonds. Described herein is a summary of the selective reactions that have been developed for known systems, as well as a summary of computationally&#8208;based predictions of selectivities that might be anticipated in reactions of yet unrealized substructures.

         <title>Synthesis of Boronic Ester &#947;&#8208;Lactam Building Blocks</title>

Abstract
Saturated heterocycles are found widely in biologically active compounds such as medicinal drugs and agrochemicals. However, boronic acid&#8208;derived building blocks for these structures have limited availability, particularly in comparison to heteroaromatic boronic acids. We report the preparation of boronic ester &#947;&#8208;lactams through a Cu&#8208;catalysed conjugate borylation&#8208;cyclisation protocol. Using a chiral catalyst, this can be performed in high enantioselectivity. Exploration of the further transformations of these reagents suggest that the boronic esters have much potential as chemical building blocks.

Abstract
Boron&#8208;catalyzed environmentally benign dehydrative Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of indole/pyrrole and aniline derivatives with &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl ketones has been developed for the first time. This method provides an efficient and green replacement of toxic and unstable methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) by safer and cheaper &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl ketone. The reaction features easy operation, wide substrate scope and significantly, only water is formed as by&#8208;product.

Abstract
An intriguing pyridine&#8208;boryl radical&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H alkynylation reaction of inactivated alkanes was described. The reaction features mild operation condition and wide substrate scope, and affords the corresponding products in moderate to good yields. Notably, The presence of 4&#8208;cyanopyride N&#8208;oxide was key to the success of the reaction. Cyclohexane are more easily to be functionalized in this reaction than toluene, which could be rationally explained by polarity&#8208;match principle.

Abstract
Kinetic resolution (KR) and dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of &#947;&#8208;aryl and heteroaryl&#8208;substituted butenolides via CuH&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;hydroboration using pinacolborane is reported. With a copper&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE catalyst, selectivity factors were extremely high (s=&gt;400) with regard to the kinetic resolution of &#946;&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;phenyl butenolide; DKR was possible in the presence of an amine base (DBU), which facilitated racemization of the starting unsaturated lactones. The reaction provided easy access to highly enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones (&gt;99% ee) containing &#946;,&#947;&#8208;substituents.

         <title>Zwitterion&#8208;Initiated Hydroboration of Alkynes and Styrene</title>

Abstract
The hydroboration of alkynes and styrene with HBpin has been developed using tris(pentaflurophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3) as the initiator of catalysis. The hydroboration is proposed to be initiated by Lewis acid activation of the alkyne by (B(C6F5)3) to form a highly reactive zwitterionic species which subsequently react with HBpin to give the alkenyl boronic ester. This zwitterion has also showed potential to be a competent catalyst for the hydroboration of styrene. The zwitterionic intermediate is analogous to that proposed in the Piers borane&#8208;catalysed hydroboration and 1,1&#8208;carboboration of alkynes with B(C6F5)3.

Abstract
A series of structurally diverse benzyl protected trifluoroborate&#8208;ammoniums were prepared in good to high yields by an efficient hydrogenation of corresponding trifluoroborate&#8208;iminiums using Crabtree's catalyst. Subsequent N&#8208; and B&#8208;deprotections were demonstrated on selected examples to provide several &#945;&#8208;aminoboronic acids. Preliminary experiments on asymmetric version of the reaction indicated a correlation between E/Z&#8208;ratio in the trifluoroborate&#8208;iminium substrate and enantioselectivity. The broad scope, operational simplicity and efficiency of the presented method imply its high potential for a facile access to libraries of &#945;&#8208;aminoboronic acid derivatives that can be used in medicinal chemistry applications and beyond.

Abstract
A method for the synthesis of allylboronates via Zweifel&#8208;type deprotonative olefination was demonstrated. Tetrasubstituted vinylboronates were used as the substrates. NCS (N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide) was used as a bifunctional additive, electrophile and base. This method exhibited a different elimination strategy in Zweifel type transformation to afford allylboronates. The homo&#8208;alcohols and alkenes were stereoselective synthesized from the obtained allylboronates, demonstrating the synthetic value of this methodology.

Abstract
We describe the kinetic resolution of &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allylboronate esters via chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective allylboration of aldehydes. This process provides two synthetically versatile enantioenriched compounds, (Z)&#8208;&#948;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted anti&#8208;homoallylic alcohols and &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allylboronate esters, with a selectivity factor up to 328. We propose that the reaction proceeds through a closed chair&#8208;like transition state with the silane moiety occupying a pseudo&#8208;axial position, thus readily resolving &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allylboronate esters. The synthetic utility of the obtained enantioenriched compounds is highlighted by their further transformations to give a diverse set of enantioenriched molecules.

         <title>Recent Advances in Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Functionalization of Indoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Indole is one of the most important heterocycles in organic synthesis, natural products, and drug discovery. Recently, tremendous advances in the selective functionalization of indoles have been reported. Although the most important advances have been powered by transition metal catalysis, exceedingly useful methods in the absence of transition metals have also been reported. In this review, we provide an overview of functionalization reactions of indoles that have been published in the last years with a focus on the most recent advances, aims, and future trends. The review is organized by the positional selectivity and type of methods used for functionalization.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indole is one of the most important heterocycles in organic synthesis, natural products, and drug discovery. Recently, tremendous advances in the selective functionalization of indoles have been reported. Although the most important advances have been powered by transition metal catalysis, exceedingly useful methods in the absence of transition metals have also been reported. In this review, we provide an overview of functionalization reactions of indoles that have been published in the last years with a focus on the most recent advances, aims, and future trends. The review is organized by the positional selectivity and type of methods used for functionalization. In particular, we discuss major advances in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization at the classical C2/C3 positions, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization at the remote C4/C7 positions, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling, and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free functionalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Semi&#8208;Rational Engineering of Toluene Dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida F1 towards Oxyfunctionalization of Bicyclic Aromatics</title>

Abstract
Toluene dioxygenase (TDO) from Pseudomonas putida F1 was engineered towards the oxyfunctionalization of bicyclic substrates. Single and double mutant libraries addressing 27 different positions, located at the active site and entrance channel were generated. In total, 176 different variants were tested employing the substrates naphthalene, 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline, and 2&#8208;phenylpyridine. Introduced mutations in positions M220, A223 and F366, exhibited major influences in terms of product formation, chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. By semi&#8208;rational evolution, we lighted up the TDO capability to convert bulkier substrates than its natural substrate, at unprecedented reported conversions. Thus, the most active TDO variants were applied to biocatalytic oxyfunctionalizations of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline, and 2&#8208;phenylpyridine, enabling the production of substantial amounts of (+)&#8208;(R)&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;4&#8208;ol (71% isolated yield, 94% ee) and (+)&#8208;(1S,2R)&#8208;3&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)cyclohexa&#8208;3,5&#8208;diene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diol (60% isolated yield, 98% ee), respectively. Here, we provide a set of novel TDO&#8208;based biocatalysts useful for the preparation of oxyfunctionalized bicyclic scaffolds, which are valuable to perform downstream synthetic processes.

         <title>Alkene, Bromide, and ROH &#8211; How To Achieve Selectivity? Electrochemical Synthesis of Bromohydrins and Their Ethers</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bromohydrins and their ethers were electrochemically synthesized via hydroxy&#8208; and alkoxybromination of alkenes using potassium bromide and water or alcohols. High selectivity of bromohydrins formation was achieved only with the use of DMSO as the solvent and an acid as the additive. The proposed combination of starting reagents, additives, and solvents allowed to form bromohydrins or their ethers selectively despite the variety of side&#8208;products (epoxides, dibromides, diols). Bromohydrins were obtained in high yields, up to 96%, with a broad substrate scope in an undivided electrochemical cell equipped with glassy carbon and platinum electrodes at high current density.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese Catalyzed Enantioselective Epoxidation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Amides with H2O2</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herewith, we report the enantioselective epoxidation of electron&#8208;deficient cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides with the environmentally benign oxidant H2O2. The catalysts &#8208; manganese complexes with bis&#8208;amino&#8208;bis&#8208;pyridine and structurally related ligands &#8208; exhibit reasonably high efficiency (up to 100&#8197;TON) and excellent chemo&#8208; and enantioselectivity (up to 100% and 99% ee, respectively). Crucially, the cis&#8208;enamides epoxidation enantioselectivity and yield are dramatically enhanced by the presence of NH&#8208;moiety, which effect can be explained by the hydrogen bonding interaction between the cis&#8208;enamide substrate and the manganese based oxygen transferring species.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Manganese complexes with tridentate PNN ligands have been synthesized as catalysts for hydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of nitriles and amines to form secondary imines. This reaction afforded a variety of unsymmetrical secondary imines in good yields with excellent selectivity. Investigation of catalyst intermediates indicated that an amido manganese complex may be the active catalyst species for this reaction.

Abstract
An efficient enantioselective dearomative cycloaddition reaction between either 2&#8208;nitroindoles or 2&#8208;nitrobenzofurans and N&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethylisatin ketimines by dipeptided phosphonium salt catalysis is firstly established. This protocol provides a new and facile synthetic approach to create a variety of CF3&#8208;containing polycyclic spirooxindole derivatives under mild reaction conditions with high yields in excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (all &gt;20:1 dr, up to 95% ee).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient enantioselective dearomative cycloaddition reaction between either 2&#8208;nitroindoles or 2&#8208;nitrobenzofurans and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethylisatin ketimines by dipeptided phosphonium salt catalysis is firstly established. This protocol provides a new and facile synthetic approach to create a variety of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;containing polycyclic spirooxindole derivatives under mild reaction conditions with high yields in excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (all &amp;gt;20:1 &lt;i&gt;dr&lt;/i&gt;, up to 95% ee).&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Biocatalytic Application of a Membrane&#8208;Bound Coumarin C&#8208;Glucosyltransferase in the Synthesis of Coumarin and Benzofuran C&#8208;Glucosides</title>

Abstract
A number of plant C&#8208;glycosyltransferases (CGTs) have been recently identified, whereas the coumarin CGTs have not been found. Here we reported the first identification of a coumarin C&#8208;glucosyltransferase MaCGT from Morus alba. The whole&#8208;cell biocatalyst harboring MaCGT was exploited and exhibited strictly and efficiently regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;specific C&#8208;glucosylation capacity toward structurally different coumarins. The whole&#8208;cell of MaCGT was further applied to chemo&#8208;enzymatically synthesize benzofuran C&#8208;glucosides. Moreover, MaCGT is reported as the first characterized membrane&#8208;bound CGT from plants, although sequence homology search has shown other potentially membrane&#8208;bound CGTs from M. notabilis; and the presence of the transmembrane domain is critical for its catalytic activity and stability as demonstrated by the C&#8208;glucosylation activity of truncated MaCGT proteins. In addition, the key residues involved in the C&#8208;glucosylation of MaCGT were explored. These findings suggest the diversity of CGTs in the plant kingdom and demonstrate the significant potential of biocatalytic approach to produce structurally diverse C&#8208;glycosides for drug discovery.

         <title>Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Keto Sulfones through a Three&#8208;Component Reaction of Cyclopropanols, DABCO&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(SO2)2 and Alkyl Halides</title>

Abstract
A route to &#947;&#8208;keto sulfones through a metal&#8208;free reaction of cyclopropanols, DABCO&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(SO2)2 and alkyl halides is described. This reaction occurs under mild conditions in the absence of any catalysts, additives, or oxidants. Various functional groups including as ester, amino, methoxy, bromo, trifluoromethyl, nitro and carbonyl are tolerated well in this transformation, and the corresponding &#947;&#8208;keto sulfones are afforded in 35% to 95% yields. The proposed mechanism implies that this reaction proceeds through &#947;&#8208;keto sulfinate intermediate generated in&#8197;situ, which further undergoes nucleophilic substitution with alkyl halides leading to &#947;&#8208;keto sulfones.

         <dc:description>Carbon bisnucleophiles are important building blocks in organic synthesis and have widespread applications in the construction of carbocyclic compounds. Among them, 1,2&#8208;carbon bisnucleophile has been much less explored. Herein, we developed a [2+3] annulation of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;oxoindolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)malononitrile with 2&#8208;nitroallylic acetates, where 2&#8208;(2&#8208;oxoindolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)malononitrile served as a new type of 1,2&#8208;carbon bisnucleophile. Remarkably, the annulation reaction exhibits exclusive chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. A 	Michael addition/SN2 mechanism was proposed to avoid the "anti&#8208;Baldwin" cyclization. This stereoselective strategy provides a facile synthetic route for a new series of spirocyclopentane oxindole derivatives containing three stereogenic centers.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Amidation of Esters and Amines under Continuous&#8208;Flow Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates that N&#8208;hexylbenzamide is produced by flow. It depicts that the methyl benzoate and n&#8208;hexylamine as starting materials flow from upstream, and they react with each other to form an amide product by passing through pebbles that stand for the zirconium oxide catalysts. The new flow system enables direct reaction of fundamental substrates, carboxylic acid ester and amine, to realize green chemistry such as low environment load, high efficiency substance conversion, and safe process. Details can be found in the Communication by Md. Nurnobi Rashed, Koichiro Masuda, Tomohiro Ichitsuka, Nagatoshi Koumura, Kazuhiko Sato, and Sh&#363; Kobayashi (M. N. Rashed, K. Masuda, T. Ichitsuka, N. Koumura, K. Sato, S. Kobayashi, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2021, 363, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202001496).

Abstract
Chemists are generally familiar with polar reactions and radical reactions, in comparison, are underdeveloped. In the last few years, however, the novel concept of amalgamation of the above two in the form of radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPCO) and polar&#8208;radical crossover (PRCO) reactions has emerged as a valuable and powerful tool. This methodology tends to bridge the gap between the two as well as overcomes limitations of both radical and traditional polar chemistry. By bringing together the unorthodox chemistry of radicals with orthodox carbocations and carbanions, the green quotient of such reactions is significantly improved. The development and shaping up of this area in the last few years in the form of synthetically important transformations is summarised in this review.

Abstract
An environmentally&#8208;benign electrochemical approach for the construction of quinoline derivatives employing N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) as the methine source has been devised by cyclization of 4&#8208;(phenylamino)&#8208;2H&#8208;chromen&#8208;2&#8208;ones. In a user&#8208;friendly undivided cell, 6H&#8208;chromeno[4,3&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;6&#8208;ones were obtained under chemical oxidant&#8208;free and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions in 43&#8211;92% yields with high functional tolerance.

         <title>Chemoselective Peptide Backbone Diversification and Bioorthogonal Ligation by Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Activation/Annulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of peptide derivatization by metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation has been mostly directed to modify the side chains, but poor attention has been given to the peptide backbone. Here we report a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation/annulation process that can chemoselectively modify the peptide backbone producing functionalized isoquinolone scaffolds with high regioselectivity in a rapid and step&#8208;economical manner. This strategy is characterized by racemization&#8208;free conditions and the production of fluorescent peptides, and peptide conjugates to drugs, natural products and other peptide fragments, providing a chemical approach for the construction of novel peptide&#8208;pharmacophore conjugates. Mechanistic studies suggest that amide bonds of peptide backbone act as the bidentate directing group to promote the C&#8208;H activation/annulation process. This report provides an unprecedented example of peptide backbone diversification and bioorthogonal ligation exploiting the power of ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation.</dc:description>

Abstract
A double&#8208;ligands enabled ruthenium catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H arylation of dialkyl phosphines is described, which provides a straight access to aryl&#8208;substituted dialkyl phosphine ligands. The combination of 1,3&#8208;diketone and amino acid ligands is essential for this transformation. An important six&#8208;membered cycloruthenium intermediate was successfully isolated and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Mechanistic studies showed that the 1,3&#8208;diketone promoted the process of oxidative addition of cycloruthenium intermediate. Some of modified CyJohnPhos ligands exhibited highly catalytic activity in palladium catalyzed C&#8722;N bond formation.

         <dc:description>A synthetic procedure, catalysed by Ir(ppy)3 under visible&#8208;light irradiation, for the chemodivergent synthesis of 2,3&#8208;dihydrofurans (3) or &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones (7) starting from &#945;&#8208;halo ketones (1) and alkenes (2) has been developed. The mild reaction conditions and the redox&#8208;neutral nature of the process make it particularly sustainable avoiding the use of both sacrificial reactants and stoichiometric strong oxidants.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions: Present Approach and Future Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reactions have allowed researchers to attain unorthodox bond formation and elusive chemical processes under mild and inherently safe reaction conditions. However, these methods have relied heavily on Ru&#8208; and Ir&#8208;based complexes or metal&#8208;free chromophores. While the heavy transition metal complexes are limited by their high cost, toxicity, and adverse environmental effects. Metal&#8208;free photo&#8208;redox catalysts are restricted due to their poorer photo&#8208;stability. In order to overcome these shortcomings, extensive research aimed towards utilizing 3d&#8208;transition metals has come to the forefront. Manganese, in this regard, holds great promise as a versatile and economically sustainable 3d&#8208;transition metal catalyst. Hence, it is not surprising that recent years have witnessed several advances in visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated manganese catalysis in areas of organic, polymer, and materials chemistry. Manganese&#8208;based heterogeneous systems have also been utilized to effect dimerization and oxygenation reactions showcasing the versatility of manganese. Moreover, manganese has enabled late&#8208;stage functionalization of valuable medicinal compounds and natural products, which are all important from the viewpoint of medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry. In the present review, comprehensive discussions on the advances, significance, approaches, and mechanistic aspects have been added for each photochemical reaction process. Further, the reaction scope, limitations, and future prospects of visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced manganese catalysis have also been reviewed.

In order to overcome these shortcomings, extensive research aimed towards utilizing 3d&#8208;transition metals has come to the forefront. Manganese, in this regard, holds great promise as a versatile and economically sustainable 3d&#8208;transition metal catalyst. Hence, it is not surprising that recent years have witnessed several advances in visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated manganese catalysis in areas of organic, polymer, and materials chemistry. Manganese&#8208;based heterogeneous systems have also been utilized to effect dimerization and oxygenation reactions showcasing the versatility of manganese. Moreover, manganese has enabled late&#8208;stage functionalization of valuable medicinal compounds and natural products, which are all important from the viewpoint of medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry. In the present review, comprehensive discussions on the advances, significance, approaches, and mechanistic aspects have been added for each photochemical reaction process. Further, the reaction scope, limitations, and future prospects of visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced manganese catalysis have also been reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Catalyst&#8208; and substrate&#8208; dependent chemodivergent reactivity of stabilised sulfur ylides with salicylaldehydes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stabilised sulfur ylides are synthetically appealing compounds, which reactivity under Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis has been poorly explored. Herein, we report a new catalyst&#8208; and substrate&#8208; dependent chemodivergent reaction between stabilised sulfur ylides and salicylaldehydes, leading to the (suprising) formation of 2H&#8208;chromenes or dihydrobenzofurans products. Particular attention was set on the unusual mechanisms involved. Two unique reaction routes including two ylide units in the reactions are proposed. These pathways were validated by performing a selectivity switch in some cases, enabled by the modulation of the nucleophilicity of the sulfur ylide, and by the loading of the Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst in the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective [3+1+1+1] Cycloaddition to Six&#8208;membered Carbocycle Based on DMSO as Dual Carbon Synthon</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A [3+1+1+1] cycloaddition was developed among 2&#8208;arylpropene, ketone and DMSO in the presence of K2S2O8. 2&#8208;arylpropene provides three carbons, ketone offers one carbon, and DMSO as dual carbon donor contributes two carbons to the six&#8208;membered carbocycle. It gave the cyclohexene motif and spirocyclohexene skeleton. Four C&#8208;C bonds formed in this process. Both propylene and ketone could be well tolerated and give the corresponding cyclohexene or spirocyclohexene motif in useful yields. Based on the controlled experiments, a possible mechanism was proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of Isoquinoline&#8208;Fused Isoquinolines via Intramolecular Hydroamination/Aza&#8208;Claisen Type Rearrangement Cascade</title>

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step synthesis of isoquinoline&#8208;fused isoquinolines from &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters and 2&#8208;alkynyl benzaldehydes are reported. The strategy comprises an unconventional Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction between &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters and 2&#8208;alkynyl benzaldehydes to give isoquinoline intermediates. Subsequent gold&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroamination furnishes isoquinoline&#8208;fused isoquinolines. The scope of this strategy is further extended to prepare multisubstituted isoquinoline&#8208;fused isoquinolines via subjecting the N&#8208;allylated isoquinoline intermediates to gold&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroamination followed by aza&#8208;Claisen type rearrangement.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Cascade Reaction of Benzaldehyde with Benzylamine and Hydroxylamine or Aniline: Synthesis of 1,2,4&#8208;Oxadiazoles and Quinazolines</title>

Abstract
The analogous three&#8208;component synthesis strategy for substituted 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole and quinazoline derivatives from readily available benzaldehyde, benzylamine and hydroxylamine or aniline has been developed. Both the cascade reaction sequences involves nucleophilic addition of C&#8722;N bond, introduction a halogen donor, nucleophilic substitution and Cu(II)&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation. This synthesis methodology demonstrated good yields, broad substrate scope and oxygen as a green oxidant. Thus, this synthesis protocol provides strategies for the construction of substituted 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole and quinazolines from readily and simple starting materials.

         <title>Vinylogous Aza&#8208;Michael Addition of Urea Derivatives with p&#8208;Quinone Methides Followed by Oxidative Dearomative Cyclization: Approach to Spiroimidazolidinone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we report an efficient protocol for the synthesis of spiro&#8208;imidazolidinone&#8208;cyclohexadienones from p&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) and dialkyloxy ureas under mild conditions. The strategy follows a two&#8208;step process involving an initial vinylogous conjugate addition of urea derivatives to p&#8208;QMs, followed by oxidative dearomative cyclization of open&#8208;chain product to the projected spiro&#8208;imidazolidinones. This protocol exhibits good functional group tolerance and provides a straightforward method to access spiro&#8208;imidazolidinone&#8208;cyclohexadienones. In follow&#8208;up chemistry, we have shown the debenzylation of spiroimidazolidinones to give N&#8208;hydroxycyclic ureas.

         <title>Base&#8208;Mediated Generation of Ketenimines from Ynamides: [3+2] Annulation with Azaallyl Anions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Under basic conditions and heat, ynamides can serve as precursors to ketenimines, whose synthetic potential is often hampered by their difficulty of access. Herein, we report that they can undergo a [3+2] cycloaddition with 2&#8208;azaallyl anions, obtained from benzylimines under the same reaction conditions. This reaction between two highly reactive intermediates, both generated in&#8197;situ from bench stable starting materials, gives access to various nitrogen&#8208;rich heterocycles. The reaction usually proceeds with excellent diastereoselectivity, in favor of the cis adduct. Deuteration experiments and DFT calculations helped rationalize the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the process as well as the formation of side products.

         <title>Assembly of 5&#8208;Aminoimidazoles via Palladium&#8208;Catalysed Double Isocyanide Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalysed tandem cyclisation reaction of amidoximes, isocyanides and amines to produce 5&#8208;aminoimidazoles was developed. Various 5&#8208;aminoimidazoles were prepared in good to excellent yields under mild conditions. This elegant domino process involves the effective cleavage of the N&#8722;O bond and the formation of new C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds in a single operation.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Disulfides via Three&#8208;Component Reaction of Thiosulfonates, Thiourea and Alkyl halides</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free approach to synthesize unsymmetrical disulfides is reported that relies on a K2CO3&#8208;promoted one&#8208;pot reaction of thiosulfonates, thiourea and alkyl halides under mild conditions. The protocol tolerates a wide range of substrates, leading to various types of unsymmetrical disulfides in moderate to excellent yields. More importantly, the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and drug molecules was also achieved.

         <title>Oxime&#8208;Derived Iminyl Radicals in Selective Processes of Hydrogen Atom Transfer and Addition to Carbon&#8208;Carbon &#960;&#8208;Bonds</title>

Abstract
Oximes represent one of the fundamental organic compound classes with a wide range of synthetic applications. In the last decade O&#8208;substituted oximes were recognized as the synthetically available and versatile precursors of iminyl radicals via one&#8208;electron oxidation or one&#8208;electron reduction employing visible light photoredox catalysts, salts of abundant metals (such as Cu or Fe), or other convenient reagents. Iminyl radicals are powerful synthons for various processes of cyclization, ring&#8208;opening, CH&#8208;functionalization, and coupling. The present review is focused on the synthetic methods based on oxime&#8208;derived iminyl radicals developed in the last few years excluding ring opening reactions of cyclic iminyl radicals that were summarized in recent publications. The review consists of two main parts: (1) reactions of iminyl radicals involving 1,n&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (n=5 in most cases) and (2) reactions involving the addition of iminyl radical to the carbon&#8208;carbon &#960;&#8208;bond.

         <title>Synthesis of Dibenzosiloles through Electrocatalytic Sila&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A novel electrocatalyzed method for the preparation of dibenzosiloles was developed through intramolecular C&#8722;H/Si&#8722;H dehydrogenative coupling strategy starting from biarylhydrosilanes. Both electro&#8208;donating and electro&#8208;withdrawing substitution groups were tolerated for this transformation, and the desired dibenzosilole products could be obtained in moderate to excellent yields. A sila&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction mechanism was proposed on the basis of previous literature and our controlled experiments.

         <title>peri&#8208;Xanthenoxanthene (PXX): a Versatile Organic Photocatalyst in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Recent years have witnessed a continuous development of photocatalysts to satisfy the growing demand of photophysical and redox properties in photoredox catalysis, with complex structures or alternative strategies devised to access highly reducing or oxidising systems. We report herein the use of peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene (PXX), a simple and inexpensive dye, as an efficient photocatalyst. Its highly reducing excited state allows activation of a wide range of substrates, thus triggering useful radical reactions. Benchmark transformations such as the addition of organic radicals, generated by photoreduction of organic halides, to radical traps are initially demonstrated. More complex dual catalytic manifolds are also shown to be accessible: the &#946;&#8208;arylation of cyclic ketones is successful when using a secondary amine as organocatalyst, while cross&#8208;coupling reactions of aryl halides with amines and thiols are obtained when using a Ni co&#8208;catalyst. Application to the efficient two&#8208;step synthesis of the expensive fluoro&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrido[4,3&#8208;b]indole, a crucial synthetic intermediate for the investigational drug setipiprant, has been also demonstrated.

Abstract
Spirocyclic molecules are widely recognized for their complex three&#8208;dimensional features and structural rigidity. Among this class of molecules, the spiro&#8208;lactams subclass stands out, being extensively explored due to its bioactivity and utility in a variety of scientific fields such as drug design and organic synthesis. Given the recognition of spirocyclic lactams&#8217; broad potential, several efforts have been engaged on the pursuit of new synthetic strategies towards these molecules. The present review gathers advances on the synthesis of both spiro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams (spiroazetidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones) and spiro&#8208;&#948;&#8208;lactams (spiropiperidon&#8208;2&#8208;ones) reported since 2015. The work is divided into two distinct parts, each one dedicated to one of these types of spiro&#8208;lactam, with the approach used for building the spirocyclic system being extensively discussed, according to the method's scope, efficiency, selectivity, and reaction mechanism.

         <title>Asymmetric Allylation Catalyzed by Chiral Phosphoric Acids: Stereoselective Synthesis of Tertiary Alcohols and a Reagent&#8208;Based Switch in Stereopreference</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The substrate scope of the asymmetric allylation with zinc organyls catalyzed by 3,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl)&#8208;1,1&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl hydrogenphosphate (TRIP) has been extended to non&#8208;cyclic ester organozinc reagents and ketones. Tertiary chiral alcohols are obtained with ee&#8217;s up to 94% and two stereogenic centers can be created. Compared to the previous lactone reagent the stereopreference switches almost completely, proving the fact that the nature of the organometallic compound is of immense importance for the asymmetry of the product.</dc:description>

Abstract
We have developed a palladium&#8208;catalyzed regioselective and enantiospecific ring&#8208;opening Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura arylative cross&#8208;coupling of N&#8208;tosyl&#8208;2&#8208;arylazetidines to give enantioenriched 3,3&#8208;diarylpropylamines. This reaction represents an example of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening cross&#8208;coupling using azetidines as a non&#8208;classical alkyl electrophile. Density functional theory rationalized the mechanism of the full catalytic cycle, which consists of the selectivity&#8208;determining ring opening of the azetidine, reaction with water, rate&#8208;determining transmetalation, and reductive elimination. Transition states of the selectivity&#8208;determining ring&#8208;opening step were systematically determined by the multi&#8208;component artificial force induced reaction (MC&#8208;AFIR) method to explain the regioselectivity of the reaction.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Carboamination of Allenes by Tertiary Amines Proceeding with Benzylic Group Migration</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Tertiary amines bearing a benzyl&#8208;type group (CH2Ar) undergo Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular addition to allenes. A formal 1,3&#8208;transfer of the CH2Ar group takes place during the cyclization. As demonstrated by both experimental and DFT studies, these unprecedented intramolecular carboaminations involve two consecutive [3,3] rearrangements via a dearomatized intermediate. Because of the poor stability of the enamine products, protocols were developed to convert them in&#8197;situ to more stable polycyclic chiral compounds.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Decarboxylative Acylation of Pyridine N&#8208;Oxides with &#945;&#8208;Oxocarboxylic Acids Using Fluorescein Dimethylammonium as a Photocatalyst</title>

Abstract
Herein, the development of a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced catalytic system to achieve the decarboxylative acylation of pyridine N&#8208;oxides with &#945;&#8208;oxocarboxylic acids, at room temperature and using the organic dye fluorescein dimethylammonium as a new type of photocatalyst, is reported. A series of 2&#8208;arylacylpyridine N&#8208;oxides were selectively synthesized in moderate to good yields by controlling the polarity of the reaction solvent. The developed strategy was successfully applied in the synthesis of an important intermediate of the drug, acrivastine, on a gram scale. Notably, this is the first time that fluorescein dimethylammonium has been used to catalyze the Minisci&#8208;type C&#8722;H decarboxylative acylation reaction. The mechanism of decarboxylative acylation was studied by capturing adducts of acyl radicals and 1,1&#8208;diphenylethylene to confirm a radical mechanism. The disclosed catalytic system provides a green synthetic strategy for decarboxylative acylation without the use of additional oxidants or metal catalysts.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Free Direct Arene C&#8722;H Amination</title>

Abstract
The synthesis of aryl amines via the formation of a C&#8722;N bond is an essential tool for the preparation of functional materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients and bioactive products. Usually, this chemical connection is only possible by transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions, photochemistry or electrochemistry. Here, we report a metal&#8208;free arene C&#8722;H amination using hydroxylamine derivatives under benign conditions. A charge transfer interaction between the aminating reagents TsONHR and the arene substrates enables the chemoselective amination of the arene, even in the presence of various functional groups. Oxygen was crucial for an effective conversion and its accelerating role for the electron transfer step was proven experimentally. In addition, this was rationalized by a theoretical study which indicated the involvement of a dioxygen&#8208;bridged complex with a &#8220;Sandwich&#8208;like&#8221; arrangement of the aromatic starting materials and the aminating agents at the dioxygen molecule.

         <title>Paired Electrosynthesis of Aromatic Azo Compounds from Aryl Diazonium Salts with Pyrroles or Indoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An efficient paired electrosynthesis of functionalized aromatic azo compounds through a diazenyl radical pathway has been developed. The paired electrolysis simultaneously uses the anode and cathode reactions to avoid the electricity expense of oxidation/reduction of sacrificial substances, thereby maximizing energy efficiency and achieving high atom economy. The in&#8197;vitro cytotoxicity of all compounds was evaluated against four cancer cell lines by MTT assay. Results showed that the aromatic azo compounds exhibited good antitumor activity in&#8197;vitro, and one of the compounds induced tumor cell apoptosis.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Fused Indolines via Copper (II)&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomatizing Cyclization of Indoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a copper(II)&#8208;catalyzed dearomative cyclization amination of N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminobenzoyl) indoles is presented. Under mild reaction conditions, the cyclization proceeds to afford tetracyclic indolines by forming a new C&#8208;N bond in good yields. The tetracyclic 5a,6&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,1&#8208;b]quinazolin&#8208;12(5H)&#8208;ones  are obtained in good to excellent yields (up to 99% yield) by using trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH) mediated N&#8208;Ts bond cleavage. The obtained compounds could be easily functionalized by simple synthetic methods.</dc:description>

Abstract
A two&#8208;enzyme cascade reaction plus in&#8197;situ oxidative decarboxylation for the transformation of readily available canonical and non&#8208;canonical l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids into 2&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acid derivatives is described. The biocatalytic cascade consisted of an oxidative deamination of l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids by an l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid deaminase from Cosenzaea myxofaciens, rendering 2&#8208;oxoacid intermediates, with an ensuing aldol addition reaction to formaldehyde, catalyzed by metal&#8208;dependent (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;selective carboligases namely 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;l&#8208;rhamnonate aldolase (YfaU) and ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase (KPHMT), respectively, furnishing 3&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxoacids. The overall substrate conversion was optimized by balancing biocatalyst loading and amino acid and formaldehyde concentrations, yielding 36&#8211;98% aldol adduct formation and 91&#8211;98% ee for each enantiomer. Subsequent in&#8197;situ follow&#8208;up chemistry via hydrogen peroxide&#8208;driven oxidative decarboxylation afforded the corresponding 2&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acid derivatives.

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot domino benzannulation protocol involving strapping of o&#8208;chloropyrazolyl ynones with various nitromethane derivatives has been devised as a entry to diversely functionalized indazole frameworks. These preparatively useful transformations proceed via tandem Michael addition&#8208;intramolecular SNAr reaction pathway to efficiently furnish a range of functionally enriched indazoles with bioactivity potential from readily accessible precursors.

         <title>Direct, Asymmetric Synthesis of Carbocycle&#8208;Fused Uracils via [4+2] Cycloadditions: a Noncovalent Organocatalysis Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The peculiar versatility of remotely enolizable 6&#8208;methyluracil&#8208;5&#8208;carbaldehydes as useful vinylogous pronucleophiles in direct, asymmetric [4+2] cyclizations with suitable nitroolefins has been demonstrated. Under the strategic exploitation of noncovalent bifunctional organocatalysis, a dearomative remote enolization strategy was implemented, to generate oQDM&#8208;type dienolate intermediates that were efficiently and stereoselectively trapped by either aromatic or aliphatic nitroolefins. A series of functionalized, chiral carbocycle&#8208;fused uracils embedding three contiguous stereocenters were thus collected in one step in good yields, with generally good levels of enantioselectivity, and complete diastereocontrol. Furthermore, the ability to provide enantiopure products via simple one&#8208;cycle recrystallizations and the possibility to further functionalize these scaffolds without losing their chiral integrity were demonstrated.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Aminoiodination of Alkynes Under Visible Light Irradiation for the Construction of a Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Eight&#8208;Membered Ring System</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A method for the synthesis of dihydrodibenzo[c,e]azocine derivatives via a regioselective intramolecular aminoiodination of alkynes under visible light irradiation has been developed. This protocol uses a combination of iodine and hypervalent iodine to realize a sulfonamidyl radical, followed by intramolecular addition to alkyne to form a vinyl radical. Subsequent trapping of iodine radical affords an 8&#8208;membered heterocycle. Applications of the obtained iodinated 8&#8208;membered heterocycles in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling and deiodination are also demonstrated.

         <title>Generation of Alkyl Radicals from Thiols via Zinc Thiolates: Application for the Synthesis of gem&#8208;Difluorostyrenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Reaction of thiols with &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)styrenes under photocatalytic conditions leading to desulfurative allylic fluorine substitution is described. The reaction is performed by treatment of thiols with benzyl zinc chloride to generate zinc thiolates followed by visible light induced desulfurization by means of triphenylphosphine. Radicals formed after the C&#8722;S bond cleavage react with the double bond affording gem&#8208;difluorostyrenes.

         <title>Decarboxylation&#8208;Initiated Intermolecular Carbon&#8722;Heteroatom Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carboxylic acids are among the most used feedstock chemicals due to their great structural diversity and easy handling. The use of carboxylic acids and their derivatives in decarboxylative couplings has proven to be a valuable tool for the construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bonds. This synthetic strategy provides a complementary bond disconnection to traditional cross&#8208;coupling methods. In this review, we provided a comprehensive overview of decarboxylation&#8208;initiated intermolecular C&#8211;heteroatom bond formation, outlining several main mechanistic concepts combined with early examples and highlighting the achievements made in the past decade until January 2021. In these reactions, carboxylic acids and their derivatives undergo initial decarboxylation and then react with other heteroatom electrophiles and nucleophiles, thus replacing the carboxylate group with a valuable and prevalent heteroatom functionality.</dc:description>

         <title>Haloalkenyl Imidoyl Halides as Multifacial Substrates in the Stereoselective Synthesis of N&#8208;Alkenyl Compounds.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates the reaction of N&#8208;fluoroalkylated&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles with aluminum trihalide, proceeding via a vinyl cation (illustrated as the structure in brackets in the middle) to afford structurally diverse N&#8208;haloalkenyl imidoyl halides. These products are formed in a stereoselective fashion on both double bonds and have been utilized in the synthesis of various N&#8208;alkenyl compounds, such as enamides, enamidines, enimines, N&#8208;alkenyl tetrazoles, and other. In this work, Beier and co&#8208;workers show a new, mild and efficient 1,2,3&#8208;triazole denitrogenative ring&#8208;opening process mediated by easily available Lewis acids. Details can be found in the Full Paper by Beier and co&#8208;workers (A. Markos, L. Janeck&#253;, T. Chvojka, T. Martinek, H. Martinez&#8208;Seara, B. Klepet&#225;&#345;ov&#225;, P. Beier, Adv.

         <title>Indene Derived Phosphorus&#8208;Thioether Ligands for the Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Olefins with Diverse Substitution Patterns and Different Functional Groups</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A family of phosphite/phosphinite&#8208;thioether ligands have been tested in the Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of a range of olefins (50 substrates in total). The presented ligands are synthesized in three steps from cheap indene and they are air&#8208;stable solids. Their modular architecture has been crucial to maximize the catalytic performance for each type of substrate. Improving most Ir&#8208;catalysts reported so far, this ligand family presents a broader substrate scope, covering different substitution patterns with different functional groups, ranging from unfunctionalized olefins, through olefins with poorly coordinative groups, to olefins with coordinative functional groups. &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated acyclic and cyclic esters, ketones and amides were	hydrogenated in enantioselectivities ranging from 83 to 99% ee. Enantioselectivities ranging from 91 to 98% ee were also achieved for challenging substrates such as unfunctionalized 1,1&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted olefins, functionalized tri&#8208; and 1,1&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted vinyl phosphonates, and &#946;&#8208;cyclic enamides. The catalytic performance of the Ir&#8208;ligand assemblies was maintained when the environmentally benign 1,2&#8208;propylene carbonate was used as solvent.

         <title>Silver/Rhodium Relay Catalysis Enables C&#8722;H Functionalization of In&#8197;Situ Generated Isoquinolines with Sulfoxonium Ylides: Construction of Hexahydrodibenzo[a,g]quinolizine Scaffolds</title>

Abstract
Employing silver/rhodium relay catalysis strategy, an intramolecular electrophilic cyclization and C&#8722;H activation followed by cascade hydrogenation and reductive amination has been developed. The acylmethylated isoquinoline derivatives could be afforded with broad substrate scope in 23&#8211;88% yields, which could be further transformed to the core skeleton of hexahydrodibenzo[a,g]quinolizine as drug&#8208;candidates. Moreover, this reaction was achieved in a gram&#8208;scale. A reasonable reaction mechanism has been proposed based on a series of control and KIE experiments.

Abstract
A synthetic method is described to produce &#945;,&#945;&#8208;bis&#8208;sulfonyl arylketones from bromoalkynes and sulfinic acids under visible&#8208;light irradiation, this visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted multicomponent cascade processes are used without additives or photocatalysts. Replacing sulfinic acids with sodium arylsulfinates results in another multicomponent reaction for synthesizing multisubstituted conjugated dienes with 26%&#8211;54% yields via construction of a C&#8722;C bond and without the use of transition metals and other additives.

Abstract
A Y(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes with donor&#8208;acceptor aziridines has been developed, accessing diversely substituted imidazolidines high efficiency. Mechanistic investigations support the formation of imidazolidines through an SN1&#8208;like pathway. Furthermore, these imidazolidines exhibit promising anti&#8208;tumor activity against a series of human cancer cell lines.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Aerobic Oxidative Csp3&#8722;H Functionalization of Glycine Derivatives for 2&#8208;Substituted Benzoxazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We report a simple oxidative Csp3&#8722;H functionalization reaction of glycine derivatives by visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis. A wide range of glycine derivatives readily undergo the oxidative cyclization to afford various 2&#8208;substituted benzoxazoles. Importantly, this photocatalytic intramolecular dehydrogenative coupling reaction allows for the C&#8722;H functionalization of glycine derivatives involving short peptides under mild conditions, which may have value in preparing peptide&#8208;derived pharmacologically active molecules.

         <title>Discovery of New Carbonyl Reductases Using Functional Metagenomics and Applications in Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract.  Enzyme discovery for use in the manufacture of chemicals, requiring high stereoselectivities, continues to be an  important avenue of research. Here, a sequence directed metagenomics approach is described to identify short chain carbonyl reductases. PCR from a metagenomic template generated 37 enzymes, with an average 25% sequence identity, twelve of which showed interesting activities in initial screens. Six of the most productive enzymes were then tested against a panel of 21 substrates, including bulkier substrates that have been noted as challenging in biocatalytic reductions. Two enzymes were selected for further studies with the Wieland Miescher ketone.	Notably, enzyme SDR&#8208;17, when co&#8208;expressed with a co&#8208;factor recycling system produced the anti&#8208;(4aR,5S) isomer in excellent isolated yields of 89% and 99% e.e. These results demonstrate the viability of a sequence directed metagenomics approach for the identification of multiple homologous sequences with low similarity, that can yield highly stereoselective enzymes with applicability in industrial biocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Allenylboron Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Organoboron compounds have found widespread application in everyday organic synthesis. The Lewis acidic properties, non&#8208;toxicity, stability, and easy commercial availability of organoboron compounds have resulted in considerable attention from organic chemists. Over the last several decades, there has been a sizeable development of new organoboron compounds useful in organic synthesis. Allenylboron compounds have emerged as a promising scaffold for various synthetic transformations, including allenylation and propargylation of carbonyl compounds, imines, activated olefins, and others; hydroboration&#8208;allylation with carbonyl/imine, and more. On the other hand, a good number of synthetic methods have evolved over the years to access substituted allenylboron compounds in good yield. This review highlights the methods known to date for the synthesis and reactivity of allenylboron compounds in a chronological manner.

Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot synthesis of 3&#8208;halo&#8208;2&#8208;organochalcogenylbenzo[b]chalcogenophenes has been developed using 1&#8208;(2&#8208;organochalcogenylethynyl)&#8208;2&#8208;butylchalcogenylbenzenes generated in&#8197;situ from 1&#8208;(2,2&#8208;dibromovinyl)&#8208;2&#8208;organochalcogenylbenzenes and diorganoyl dichalcogenides. By this method, several 2,3&#8208;disubstituted benzo[b]chalcogenophenes were prepared in yields of 48&#8211;93%. The mechanistic investigation suggests that the formation of chalcogenoacetylenes containing an adjacent chalcogen atom in the first step of this one&#8208;pot procedure involves acetylide anions formed from 1&#8208;(2,2&#8208;dibromovinyl)&#8208;2&#8208;organochalcogenylbenzenes and mild bases.

Abstract
A protocol involving intramolecular formal [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of in&#8197;situ generated o&#8208;aza&#8208;quinone methide for the facile synthesis of 1,4&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;fused quinoline motifs is demonstrated. The cascade involved tandem C&#8722;O, C&#8722;C, and C&#8722;N bond formation and also exhibited excellent functional group tolerance. Enantiomerically enriched 1,4&#8208;oxazepino quinolines were synthesized using alkynols derived from L&#8208;amino acids. The sulfoxide embedded quinolines were transformed to pentacyclic 1,4&#8208;thiepino tethered indeno&#8208;quinoline scaffolds via Pummerer cyclization.

Abstract
A stereoselective synthetic route to chiral C3&#8208;spirooxindole&#8208; and C2&#8208;spiropseudoindoxyl&#8208;pyrrolidines was accomplished by an enantioselective organocatalyzed Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction of tryptamines and isotryptamines followed by a diastereoselective oxidative rearrangement using eco&#8208;friendly oxidants (i.&#8201;e., NaOCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;5H2O and Oxone&#174;). This sequential reaction enables rapid access to chiral C3&#8208;spirooxindole&#8208; and C2&#8208;spiropseudoindoxyl&#8208;pyrrolidines in a one&#8208;pot process. A Wnt signaling inhibitory assay of the prepared enantioenriched spiro compounds demonstrated that they exhibited moderate activities.

         <title>Robust Photocatalytic Method Using Ethylene&#8208;Bridged Flavinium Salts for the Aerobic Oxidation of Unactivated Benzylic Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
7,8&#8208;Dimethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;ethylenealloxazinium chloride (1a) was found to be a superior photooxidation catalyst among substituted ethylene&#8208;bridged flavinium salts (R=7,8&#8208;diMeO, 7,8&#8208;OCH2O&#8208;, 7,8&#8208;diMe, H, 7,8&#8208;diCl, 7&#8208;CF3 and 8&#8208;CF3). Selection was carried out based on structure vs catalytic activity and properties relationship investigations. Flavinium salt 1a proved to be robust enough for practical applications in benzylic oxidations/oxygenations, which was demonstrated using a series of substrates with high oxidation potential, i.&#8201;e., 1&#8208;phenylethanol, ethylbenzene, diphenylmethane and diphenylmethanol derivatives substituted with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (Cl or CF3). The unique capabilities of 1a can be attributed to its high photostability and participation via a relatively long&#8208;lived singlet excited state, which was confirmed using spectroscopic studies, electrochemical measurements and TD&#8208;DFT calculations. This allows the maximum use of the oxidation power of 1a, which is given by its singlet excited state reduction potential of +2.4&#8197;V. 7,8&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;ethylenealloxazinium chloride (1&#8197;h) can be used as an alternative photocatalyst for even more difficult substrates.

         <title>Development of a Radical Silylzincation of (Het)Aryl&#8208;Substituted Alkynes and Computational Insights into the Origin of the trans&#8208;Stereoselectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Aryl&#8208; and hetaryl&#8208;substituted acetylenes undergo regio&#8208; and stereoselective silylzincation by reaction with [(Me3Si)3Si]2Zn in the presence of Et2Zn (10&#8211;110&#8197;mol%) as additive. The distinctive feature of this addition across the C&#8722;C triple bond is its trans stereoselectivity. The radical nature of the silylzincation process is supported by diagnostic experiments and DFT calculations, which also corroborate the role played by steric effects to obtain that stereoselectivity. The procedure can be combined in one&#8208;pot with the copper(I)&#8208;mediated electrophilic substitution of the C(sp2)&#8722;Zn bond, with retention of the double bond geometry. This makes it valuable for the synthesis of stereodefined di&#8208; and trisubstituted vinylsilanes.

Abstract
In this paper, a high&#8208;yield, facile route for the scalable synthesis of sulfonyl 2&#8208;aroylbenzofurans via a Bi(OTf)3&#8208;mediated intermolecular double cyclocondensation of &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl o&#8208;hydroxyacetophenones with substituted &#945;&#8208;hydroxy arylketones under mild open&#8208;vessel reaction conditions is described. In the overall reaction, water is generated as the only byproduct. Various metal triflate&#8208;promoted reactions and conditions are investigated for the efficient one&#8208;pot (4+1) annulation reaction.

A chiral phosphorus acid catalyzed enantioselective 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition of arylamines to in&#8197;situ formed 7&#8208;methylene&#8208;7H&#8208;indoles from 7&#8208;indolylmethanols has been developed for the first time. Without additives, the catalytic protocol enabled the formation of 1,4&#8208;adducts with a nitrogen&#8208;containing tertiary carbon stereocenter in 66&#8211;96% yield with 70&#8211;89% ee under mild conditions.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective C&#8722;H Arylation of 4&#8208;Azaindazole at C3, C5 and C7 Positions</title>

Abstract
Direct and site&#8208;selective C5 and C7 palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylations of 4&#8208;azaindazole N&#8208;oxide have been achieved. A bidentate ligand and Pd(OAc)2 catalyst in toluene promoted the activation of C5 position, while a phosphine ligand and PdCl2 catalyst in DMA directed the arylation at C7 position. Using this new method, the synthesis of C5, C7&#8208;diarylated 4&#8208;azaindazole N&#8208;oxides as well as the C3, C5, C7&#8208;triarylated 4&#8208;azaindazoles was achieved towards future medicinal compounds development.

         <title>Catalytic Formal Hydroamination of Allylic Alcohols Using Manganese PNP&#8208;Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Several manganese&#8208;PNP pincer catalysts for the formal hydroamination of allylic alcohols are presented. The resulting &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols are selectively obtained in high yields applying Mn&#8208;1 in a tandem process under mild conditions.
