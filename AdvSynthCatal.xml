      <title>Sequential N&#8208;Arylation and Intramolecular Imine Addition Reaction of Indoloazomethine Ylides with Arynes for the Synthesis of Thiadiazepine Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free reaction of indoloazomethine ylides with 2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)aryl triflates in the presence of TMAF and MeOH provided 1,4&#8208;thiadiazepines through sequential N&#8208;arylation and intramolecular imine addition reaction, which is fully oxidized with p&#8208;chloranil. These compounds are smoothly isomerized to indoloindolizines in quantitative yield. Moreover, formation of indoloindolizine was accessed from indoloazomethine ylide and 2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)aryl triflate in semi&#8208;one&#8208;pot.</dc:description>

      <title>Direct Reductive Amination of Biobased Furans to N&#8208;Substituted Furfurylamines by Engineered Reductive Aminase</title>
      <dc:description>Furfurylamines are important building blocks for the synthesis of many pharmacologically active compounds and polymers. In this work, direct reductive amination of biobased furans to N&#8208;substituted furfurylamines by reductive aminase from Aspergillus oryzae (AspRedAm) was reported. Besides the reductive amination activity, AspRedAm also showed a promiscuous, yet low alcohol dehydrogenase activity. The variant W210F proved to be a good catalyst for the synthesis of N&#8208;substituted furfurylamines. Furans were transformed to the target products with the conversions up to &gt;99% and selectivities up to &gt;99%. In addition, N&#8208;substituted furfurylamines were synthesized in the total turnover number (TTN) up to 3200 on a preparative scale, indicating the applicability of this biocatalytic route in synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis and Applications of &#945;&#8208;Ketothioesters</title>
      <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Ketothioesters have only recently received widespread attention as synthetic intermediates and an impressive growth has been realized for their utilization in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Several elegant approaches such as oxidative thioesterification and radical coupling allow for their convenient synthesis from easily available starting materials, e. g., methyl ketones, alkenes, alkynes, and &#945;&#8208;hydroxyketones. Due to their multifaceted and diverse reactivities, several important reactions such as C(O)&#8211;S bond cleavage and S&#8208;migration with various C&#8208;, N&#8208;, and O&#8208;based nucleophiles, Ni&#8208;catalyzed mono&#8208; and double&#8208;decarbonylations, enantioselective carbonyl&#8208;ene reaction, diastereoselective hetero Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with olefins, and different types of cyclization reactions have been observed. They have also proven to be a valuable tool for the synthesis of heterocycles, pharmaceutically relevant anticancer drug, and natural product. However, in comparison to other 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives such as &#945;&#8208;ketooxoesters, &#945;&#8208;ketoamides, and &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehydes, they are much less appreciated as synthetic intermediates. This review summarizes the recent advancements achieved in the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;ketothioesters as well as their applications in the development of new reactions for the formation of C&#8211;C, C&#8211;N, and C&#8211;O bonds, including multiple bond&#8208;forming processes.</dc:description>

      <title>Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed (4 + 1) Annulation of 3&#8208;Diazooxindoles/4&#8208;Diazooxisoquinolines with para&#8208;Quinone Methides to Access Chiral Spiro[dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;2,3'&#8208;oxindoles/2,4'&#8208;oxisoquinolines]</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. An asymmetric (4 + 1) annulation of 3&#8208;diazooxindoles/4&#8208;diazooxisoquinolines with para&#8208;quinone methides, catalyzed by a chiral phosphoric acid, has been described. A wide range of spiro[dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;2,3'&#8208;oxindoles/2,4'&#8208;oxisoquinoline] derivatives were afforded with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. In this study, the possible reaction pathway was proposed and the synthetic applications were shown by a tenfold scale&#8208;up conversion as well as the further transformations into other structurally more complex spirocyclic compounds. The signi&#64257;cance of this protocol is highlighted by its metal&#8208;free participation with heterocyclic diazo compounds as the direct nucleophile and extremely high e&#64259;ciency in a straightforward and mild reaction process to access the structurally&#8208;diverse spiro&#8208;heterocyclic 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran derivatives with good to excellent stereocontrol.</dc:description>

      <title>Organocatalytic Deuteration Induced by the Dynamic Covalent Interaction of Imidazolium Cations with Ketones</title>
      <dc:description>In this article, we suggest a new organocatalytic approach based on the dynamic covalent interaction of imidazolium cations with ketones. A reaction of N&#8208;alkyl imidazolium salts with acetone&#8208;d6 in the presence of oxygenated bases generates a dynamic organocatalytic system with &#1072; mixture of protonated carbene/ketone adducts acting as H/D exchange catalysts. The developed methodology of the pH&#8208;dependent deuteration showed high selectivity of labeling and good chiral functional group tolerance. Here we report a unique methodology for efficient metal&#8208;free deuteration, which enables labeling of various types of &#945;&#8208;acidic compounds without trace metal contamination.</dc:description>

      <title>Phosphorus compounds as precursors and catalysts for radical C&#8208;C bond forming reactions</title>
      <dc:description>The photochemistry of organophosphorus compounds and their reactions with carbon&#8208;centred radicals was studied from the 1950s to the 70s, but has not been well exploited in synthetic chemistry until very recently. This review discusses the various modes of reactivity that phosphorus compounds display in radical C&#8208;C bond forming reactions, including the role of phosphonium salts as radical precursors, phosphines and phosphites as deoxygenating  agents from oxygen&#8208;centred radicals and phosphines in 	electron&#8208; and charge&#8208;transfer chemistry.

      <title>Uncatalyzed Formation of Polyaminoboranes from Diisopropylaminoborane and Primary Amines: a Kinetically Controlled Polymerization Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. Recently, we disclosed the uncatalyzed formation of polyaminoboranes (PABs) from monomeric diisopropylaminoborane (iPr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&#8208;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and primary amines (RNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Their structure is studied through a detailed multinuclear NMR study and their full spectroscopic characterization is presented revealing that N&#8208;alkyl substituted PABs exhibit magnetically non&#8208;equivalent methylenic protons in the close vicinity of the BN&#8208;backbone. We also performed an in&#8208;depth theoretical study of this global chemical process. The mechanism is fully apprehended and the strong influence of the temperature on the outcome of the reaction is unveiled. DFT&#8208;calculations clearly show that the formation of the polyaminoboranes (RNH&#8208;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; results from a kinetically controlled step&#8208;growth polymerization reaction that can be globally viewed as a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail association process of the in situ generated transient monomeric monoalkylamino&#8208;borane [RNH&#8208;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;].</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Chemical and Enzymatic Carbene&#8208;Transfer Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>The use of diazo compounds in the transition metal catalyzed coupling reaction to form C&#8208;C and C&#8208;X (X=O, S, N, Si, P etc.) bonds have been a well&#8208;established approach in organic synthesis. In this context, various transition metals such as Pd, Cu, Rh, Ni, Co, Fe, Ir etc. have been proved useful to generate metal&#8208;carbene intermediate which subsequently undergoes carbene transfer or insertion to form C&#8208;C, C&#8208;Si or C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. However, the use of most abundant, cheaper and environmentally benign metal such as iron to catalyze carbene transfer reaction have attracted a great attention in the last few years. Iron is the second most abundant transition&#8208;metal in nature and also an integral part of various biological systems which made it highly valuable to use as a catalyst in organic chemistry. This review is summarizing the efforts made after 2013 in the area of iron&#8208;catalyzed chemical and enzymatic carbene transfer reactions using diazo compounds as carbene precursor.</dc:description>

      <title>Engineering an Alcohol Dehydrogenase from Kluyveromyces polyspora for Efficient Synthesis of Ibrutinib Intermediate</title>
      <dc:description>(S)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypiperidine [(S)&#8208;NBHP] is a key intermediate for the synthesis of mantle cell lymphoma drug, ibrutinib.

By screening key resi&#8208;dues in substrate binding pocket of KpADH, an excellent variant Y127W was obtained with 6&#8208;fold improved activity of 119.3 U&#183;mg&#8208;1, 1.8&#8208;fold enhanced half&#8208;life of 147 h and strict S&#8208;stereoselectivity (&gt;99% ee). When catalyzed by Y127W, a complete conversion of 600 g&#183;L&#8208;1 NBPO was achieved at a substrate to catalyst ratio (S/C) of 30 in 10 h. Based on crystal&#8208;structure of Y127W, molecular docking and dynamic simulations reveal hydrogen bonds formed between W127 and Boc group of NBPO, as well as improved structural stability mainly contribute to the increased catalytic activity and stereoselectivity of Y127W. This study offers guidance for engineering ADHs for biosynthesis of chiral hetero&#8208;cyclic alcohols, and provides insights into mechanisms in catalytic activity and stereoselectivity toward car&#8208;bonyl&#8208;containing heterocyclic substrates.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Organocatalytic &#947;&#8208;Allylic Alkylation of Quinolines</title>
      <dc:description>We report the first synthesis of 2&#8208;alkenylquinolines from 2&#8208;allylquinolines and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The reaction proceeds in a highly regioselective and enantioselective way and shows a broad tolerance of functionalities both in the aromatic ring of the enal and on the quinoline.</dc:description>

      <title>Metal&#8208;free Synthesis of Pyrrole&#8211;imidazole Alkaloids via a Tandem C&#8208;N, C&#8208;C coupling Protocol</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we present a strategy for the synthesis of pyrrole alkaloid derivatives through a tandem C&#8208;N, C&#8208;C coupling reaction employing 2&#8208;pyrrole formaldehyde and proline as starting materials. This cyclization protocol is successfully applied to polarity&#8208;controlled site&#8208;selective and stereoselective C(sp3)&#8722;H hydrocarboxylation of proline derivatives, allowing for a remarkably streamlined synthesis of pyrrole alkaloid derivatives which have shown promising biological activities.</dc:description>
