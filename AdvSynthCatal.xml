         <title>Oxidative photochemical cyclisations to access spiroketals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The spiroketal moiety is an important substructure within many biological natural products.  One method to access them is via the oxidative cyclisation of a pendant hydroxyl group on to a pre&#8208;formed pyran.  However applications of this methodology have been severely limited by requiring the use of toxic and powerful oxidants, such as lead (IV) tetraacetate or mercuric oxide.  Herein we report a novel and high yielding photochemical route to prepare complex spiroketals using a photochemical oxidative approach with mild and non&#8208;toxic reagents and demonstrate the methodology to the synthesis of a number of insect pheromones.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclohexenone(aryl)iodonium Salts and Their Application in Construction of Fused aza&#8208;Heterocyclic Skeletons</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A class of cyclohexenone(aryl)iodonium salts was readily prepared from 2&#8208;iodocyclohexenones and arenes under mild conditions. This novel series of hypervalent iodonium building blocks exhibits dual characteristics of hyperiodonium salts and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated cyclic ketones, enabling access to intricate aza&#8208;heterocycles. The reaction of these cyclohexenone(aryl)iodonium salts with arylamines and benzene sulfonamides affords 2&#8208;acylaziridines, while with 1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines leads to the formation of the 1H&#8208;imidazoimidazole&#8208;fused compounds. The transformation is postulated to proceed through an exclusive hyperiodonium&#8208;mediated N&#8208;Michael addition followed by N&#8208;annulation cascade.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
The front cover illustrates the cooperative action between organolithium reagents (RLi) and alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs). This chemoenzymatic strategy facilitates the conversion of a range of aromatic nitriles into chiral alcohols. The critical aspect of this research was identifying optimal conditions that allow both RLi and ADHs to function effectively in the same reaction vessel. Details of the studies can be found in the research article by Joaqu&#237;n Garc&#237;a&#8208;&#193;lvarez and co&#8208;workers (N. R&#237;os&#8208;Lombard&#237;a, G.

         <title>Synthesis of Oxaspirocyclohexadienones via Lewis&#8208;Acid Catalyzed [2+3]&#8208;Annulations of p&#8208;Quinone Methides and Iodonium Ylides</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a mild method for the synthesis of oxaspirocyclohexadienones by using a combination of Lewis acid&#8208;HFIP mediated [2+3]&#8208;annulation of p&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) and iodonium ylides. The proposed mechanism proceeds through a one&#8208;pot sequence of carbonyl activation/cyclopropyl formation/Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement to provide a broad range of oxaspirocyclohexadienones in moderate to high yields. Interestingly, the spiro&#8208;annulated products were further converted to tetrahydroxanthane derivatives via BF3.OEt2 mediated dienone&#8208;phenol rearrangement pathway. Moreover, the spiro&#8208;annulated derivatives also showed a moderate anti&#8208;tuberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra ATCC25177.

         <title>g&#8208;C3N4 Photocatalyzed Decarboxylative Oxidation of Carboxylic Acids and the Oxidation of Alkenes and Alkanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The decarboxylative oxygenation of readily available carboxylic acids as well as the oxidation of alkenes and alkanes has been accomplished through visible light using g&#8208;C3N4 as a robust and recyclable catalyst. The scalable protocol furnishes an array of aldehydes and ketones under mild reaction conditions, requiring only molecular oxygen as an oxidant. Notably, no addition of stochiometric amounts of base is required, and furthermore, the reaction proceeds efficiently open to the air.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decarboxylative oxygenation of readily available carboxylic acids as well as the oxidation of alkenes and alkanes has been accomplished through visible light using g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as a robust and recyclable catalyst. The scalable protocol furnishes an array of aldehydes and ketones under mild reaction conditions, requiring only molecular oxygen as an oxidant. Notably, no addition of stochiometric amounts of base is required, and furthermore, the reaction proceeds efficiently open to the air.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deep Study of Thiocarbamoyl Fluorides: Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Thiocarbamoyl fluoride is an understudied fluorinated group, mainly due to the paucity of data on its properties. Herein, an in&#8208;depth study of the stability of thiocarbamoyl fluorides, especially under near&#8208;physiological conditions, is described. Since efficient and easy to implement syntheses of these compounds are still under&#8208;described, a new method, based on the use of a trifluoromethanesulfenamide, a well&#8208;described reagent, has also been developed. This trifluoromethanesulfenamide turned out to be able to generate in&#8197;situ difluorothiophosgene, which was able to react rapidly with amines to provide various thiocarbamoyl fluorides.

         <title>In Situ Triflation&#8208;Tandem Cross&#8208;Coupling Enables Synthesis and Photophysical Studies of Indenones and Benzofulvenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Indan&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones stand as versatile precursors to a plethora of complex molecules with wide applications; however, their direct cross&#8208;coupling methodologies remain largely unexplored. Herein, we unveil an in&#8197;situ triflation&#8208;tandem cross&#8208;coupling strategy to synthesize a diverse variety of indenones and benzofulvenes from indan&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones. The successful synthesis of a neolignan natural product and the key intermediate of Indatraline (antidepressant) showcased the synthetic utility of the methodology. The strategy enabled tuning the electronic characteristics of indenones and benzofulvenes, modulating the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps. The photophysical properties of these molecules were studied, and the experimental results were compared with the predictions obtained from the DFT studies.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8722;Catalyzed Synthesis of Cyclic Sulfamides via an Intramolecular Dehydrative Amination of Allylic Alcohols: A Strategy for 1,3&#8208;Diamine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular dehydrative amination method has been developed to synthesize diverse cyclic sulfamides efficiently. Reactions proceed smoothly at room temperature using a combination of (IPr)AuCl (5&#8197;mol%) and AgBF4 (5&#8197;mol%). This method showcases a broad substrate scope, encompassing challenging seven&#8208;membered ring structures, and exhibits functional group compatibility. Moreover, the reaction demonstrates high stereoselectivity, allowing the synthesis of enantiomerically enriched cyclic sulfamides from chiral secondary allylic alcohols. The synthesized cyclic sulfamides serve as valuable intermediates for generating 1,3&#8208;diamines. This approach provides an improved route for cyclic sulfamide synthesis and a strategic entry point for obtaining essential 1,3&#8208;diamine derivatives.

         <title>Asymmetric Boracarboxylation of Styrenes Using Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 366, Issue 13, Page 2976-2986, July 2, 2024. </description>

Abstract
The boracarboxylation reaction has potential for the production of natural products and drug candidates, but the development of an asymmetric version of this transformation is challenging. We report an enantioselective boracarboxylation of styrenes, enabled by a copper catalyst containing chiral phosphines. Our experimental conditions provide yields between 31&#8211;76% and enantiomeric ratios from 80:20 up to 98:2 for electron&#8208;rich styrenes. Oxidation of a boracarboxylation product gives (S)&#8208;tropic acid, an intermediate towards several tropane alkaloids. A computational analysis of the mechanistic details shows a complex pattern of competing reaction pathways, highlighting challenges encountered when developing asymmetric reactions using CO2.

Abstract
It is extremely rare for reactive intermediates to possess a ground state triplet character. Excited state triplet intermediates are generally accessed by means of photon transfer from a tunable light source or by using any triplet sensitizers. N&#8208;acyl N&#8208;alkoxy nitreniums are an important class of reactive intermediates in the synthetic organic community due to their prolonged lifetime and ground&#8208;state singlet character. Herein, we report an external oxidant and toxic catalyst&#8208;free mild electrochemical protocol to access nitrenium reactive intermediate. Experimental findings of the mechanistic pathway suggested a theoretically predicted triplet reactive intermediate that is energetically favorable compared to the singlet pathway.

Abstract
Thanks to Pd(II)&#8208;catalysis, an efficient synthesis of unsaturated macrocycles is achieved by [3+6+3+6] condensation of cyclic ethers with aryl &#945;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters. The presence of the electron&#8208;rich aryl ester moieties forbids the use of dirhodium complexes as these diazo decomposition catalysts provoke unforeseen intermolecular Csp2&#8722;H insertion reactions that derail the targeted reactivity. However, with Pd(acac)2, using high concentration conditions (1&#8197;M), a variety of 18&#8208;membered macrocycles (16 examples) is afforded with both aryl and alkyl diazo reagents. Catalyst selection for either electrophilic aromatic substitution (Rh) or ylide (Pd) pathways are explained by computational approaches.

Abstract
An Iridium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H cyclization of N&#8208;arylphthalazinones with &#945;&#8208;diazotized Meldrum's acid afforded tetracyclic phthalazine derivatives with a carbonyl group in 98% yield in only 30&#8197;min. The initial formation of tetracyclic phthalazine derivatives also provided access to a powerful building block. The utility of this method is emphasized by the synthetic transformation into a series of potentially bioactive derivatives.

Abstract
The cascade reaction of ynamides with propargyl thiols by Au(I) catalysis involving regioselective hydrothiolation, thio&#8208;Claisen rearrangement, and cycloisomerization to generate 2&#8208;aminothiophenes in a one&#8208;pot manner is described. In this reaction, the selection of reaction temperature is crucial, with the initial step, namely hydrothiolation, conducted at a low temperature (40&#8201;&#176;C), followed by the subsequent reaction requiring an increase in temperature (&gt;110&#8201;&#176;C). Furthermore, it was revealed that multi&#8208;substituted anilines could be synthesized from the resulting 2&#8208;aminothiophenes.

Abstract
The use of halogen bonding interactions as an alternative to acid and metal catalysts for substrate activation has gained popularity in recent years. In this work we demonstrate a halogen bond assisted activation of chalcones under visible light irradiation for the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction with indole to yield &#946;&#8208;indolylketones. The simple and scalable protocol uses the readily available CBr4 as halogen bond catalyst. The targets are produced in 31&#8211;94% of yield with excellent functional group tolerance. The proposed mechanism of the reaction is supported by UV&#8208;vis, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopic studies. Further it is demonstrated that the &#946;&#8208;indolylketones can be oxidised to indole substituted &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones by DDQ or cyclized to thieno[2,3&#8208;b]indoles in the presence of elemental sulfur and base.

         <title>Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reaction of Glycals with Base&#8208;Labile Protecting Groups as a New Route to Glycoporphyrins</title>

Abstract
Glycoporphyrins are considered promising photosensitisers of new generation. Herein, we describe a metal&#8208;catalysed synthetic method towards porphyrin&#8208;carbohydrate C&#8722;C conjugates. The protocol of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction has been developed and it was compatible with peracetylated 2&#8208;iodoglycals. The utility of the reaction was exemplified on 15 different (C&#8208;2)&#8208;arylated sugar derivatives. Then it was applied on more challenging starting materials, namely, porphyrin boronates in which we addressed the issues of difficult transmetalation step usually observed on palladium&#8208;catalysed processes of porphyrin derivatives. The efficiency of the protocol was finally applied to synthesize the library of glycoporphyrins proving the versatile character of this strategy. Finally, the methodology was transferred onto A4&#8208;type porphyrin to efficiently obtain an interesting example of a multivalent glycoconjugate.

The utility of the reaction was exemplified on 15 different (C-2)-arylated sugar derivatives. Then it was applied on more challenging starting materials, namely, porphyrin boronates in which we addressed the issues of difficult transmetalation step usually observed on palladium-catalysed processes of porphyrin derivatives. The efficiency of the protocol was finally applied to synthesize the library of glycoporphyrins proving the versatile character of this strategy. Finally, the methodology was transferred onto A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-type porphyrin to efficiently obtain an interesting example of a multivalent glycoconjugate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Styrene Oxide Isomerase Towards Enhanced Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of (S)&#8208;Flurbiprofen</title>

Abstract
The conventional synthesis of (S)&#8208;flurbiprofen, a valuable non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID), involves inefficient chiral resolution with low&#8208;yielding multiple reaction steps, or asymmetric synthesis with low enantioselectivity and/or regioselectivity. Here, we developed high&#8208;yielding, enantioselective, and sustainable synthesis of (S)&#8208;flurbiprofen via two chemoenzymatic approaches from a simple alkene: (A) enzymatic epoxidation&#8208;isomerization&#8208;oxidation cascade and Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation; and (B) chemical epoxidation, enzymatic isomerization&#8208;oxidation cascade, and Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation. Styrene oxide isomerase (SOI)&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;retentive Meinwald rearrangement was the key step in the two pathways, but SOI suffers from low activity. SOI was engineered via two rounds of iterative saturation mutagenesis and screening with a three&#8208;enzyme cascade assay, generating a double&#8208;mutant SOIDM (N99A/D95A) with 5.5&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM). In Pathway A, cascade biotransformation of 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylstyrene with engineered E. coli strain expressing SOIDM, styrene monooxygenase (SMO) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), and subsequent Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation afforded (S)&#8208;flurbiprofen in 98% yield and 91% ee. In Pathway B, chemical epoxidation (Sharpless dihydroxylation and ring&#8208;closing), cascade conversion using an engineered E. coli strain expressing SOIDM, ALDH and NADH oxidase (NOX), and Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation produced (S)&#8208;flurbiprofen in 83% yield and 98% ee. Compared to conventional synthesis, the developed methods reduced reaction steps, minimized waste generation and improved enantioselectivity or overall yield.

Abstract
An efficient three&#8208;component reaction of biaryl ynones, sodium metabisulfite and aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates is developed. The reaction occurs at room temperature without any additives, thus offering a sustainable approach to access sulfonyl&#8208;containing spiro[5,5]trienones. This protocol features mild conditions, broad substrate scope and high functional group compatibility, furnishing the target products in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction undergoes a 6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig dearomative spirocyclization process which is initated by an aryl radical with the insertion of sulfur dioxide.

Abstract
A method for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;amino sulfones through visible light&#8208;induced oxidative decarboxylation and radical reductive addition is described. Various readily available N&#8208;protected natural amino acids react with aromatic/aliphatic vinyl sulfones to directly produce &#947;&#8208;amino sulfone derivatives. This reaction is also applicable to &#945;&#8208;N(O)&#8208;acids and other aliphatic carboxylic acids, resulting in the corresponding sulfone derivatives. The method operates without the need for sacrificial reducing agents or additional hydrogen atom donors. The sole by&#8208;product is CO2 released from decarboxylation, rendering the process both atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical.

Abstract
Herein, the synthesis of homoallylic amines, quinolines, and tetrahydroquinolines has been demonstrated. The domino one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component approach has been accomplished using Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed conditions. A useful scaffold construction strategy can be achieved by controlling the electronic effect of aniline rather than relying on reaction conditions. The described method applies to a wide variety of substrates embedded with diverse functional groups and can be extended toward the synthesis of natural products. Suitable control experiments, real&#8208;time NMR studies, and DFT calculations have validated the reported process. The protocol outlines a strategy for synthesizing homoallylic amines and quinolines, controlled by the electronic properties of anilines.

         <title>Endogenous Group&#8208;Directed Late&#8208;Stage C&#8722;H Functionalization of Peptides</title>

Abstract
Peptides are diverse in terms of their functional groups and side&#8208;chain functionalities, and late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization plays a crucial role in their design. Approaches for such synthesis require pre&#8208;installation and post&#8208;removal of the directing group (DG). In recent times, chemical methods have been developed, focusing on the external DG&#8208;free C&#8722;H functionalization of peptides. These approaches utilize the inherent native functionality of peptides as DG to simplify synthetic routes, reducing synthetic steps, waste generation, enhancing sustainability, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and operational flexibility. Such approaches facilitate late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization of both natural and unnatural amino acid&#8208;containing peptides.

         <title>C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization Using Chlorine Radicals</title>

Abstract
Converting any desired C&#8722;H bond to the intended C&#8722;Z bond in a given organic molecule could be the final peak of the C&#8722;H functionalization methodology. Among the three types of C&#8722;H bonds, the functionalization of the ubiquitous C(sp3)&#8722;H bond has gained particular attention, especially in the last two decades. There are different ways to transform C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds into desired C&#8722;Z bonds. The use of chlorine radicals is one of these methods with a promising future. The literature review shows that different sources have been used for chlorine, including chloride ions (HCl or chloride salts), coordinated chlorides (transition metal complexes), and organic chlorides (organochlorine compounds). However, HCl and FeCl3 have gained the most attention among these sources. There are three major ways to convert chlorine from these sources to chlorine radicals: 1) oxidation of hydrogen chloride or chloride salts, 2) photolysis of metal chloride, and 3) transition metal insertion into C&#8722;Cl bonds. This review summarizes published research papers on the use of chlorine radicals for C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds functionalization. Therefore, chlorination reactions of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and reactions in which chlorine radicals do not play a direct role in C(sp3)&#8722;H bond cleavage are not within the scope of this review.

         <title>Electrochemical Trifluoromethylalkoxylation of Endocyclic Enamides in Batch and Flow</title>

Abstract
A regioselective electrochemical oxytrifluoromethylation of endocyclic enamides is reported. The 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization proceeds under mild conditions and employs the inexpensive bench stable Langlois&#8217; reagent. This multicomponent strategy gives access to a wide range of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;substituted amines by means of various alcohols as nucleophiles in high yields and with good functional group tolerance. In addition, an electrochemically induced C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of enamides has been developed. A continuous flow protocol using a commercial microflow electrochemical reactor was also developed with improved reaction performance and efficiency over traditional batch versions without any supporting electrolyte.

Abstract
An intermolecular annulation reaction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;indandions with alkynes was reported using Pd(OAc)2 to access spirobi[indene]&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones. Under palladium catalysis, the substrates form a homocoupling dimer intermediate through a catalytic dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling process. The palladium(II) species could come from dimer or 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;indandion. Notably, this pathway is not typically observed in enol&#8208;directed formal sp3 C&#8722;H functionalization/oxidative annulation palladium chemistry. This transformation provides a route to access a class of functionalized spiro carbocyclic indenes.

Abstract
A [3+2]/[2+1] domino annulation reaction of cyclohexadienones and &#945;&#8208;aryl vinylsulfonium salts has been reported. A range of cyclopropane fused tricyclic enones bearing four contiguous stereocenters were obtained as a single diastereomer in 44&#8211;93% yields. The synthetic utility was demonstrated with the gram&#8208;scale reactions and further transformations of the products.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A [3+2]/[2+1] domino annulation reaction of cyclohexadienones and &#945;-aryl vinylsulfonium salts has been reported. A range of cyclopropane fused tricyclic enones bearing four contiguous stereocenters were obtained as a single diastereomer in 44&#8211;93% yields. The synthetic utility was demonstrated with the gram-scale reactions and further transformations of the products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A formal atom transfer radical [3+2] annulation (ATRAn) reaction between different homoallyl radical precursors and 1,1&#8208;diborylethene was developed. It provides a rapid access to polysubstituted cyclopentanes containing a gem&#8208;diboronic ester moiety. The synthetic utility of theses uniquely functionalized 5&#8208;membered rings is highlighted by their easy conversion to attractive borylated building blocks such as 1&#8208;borylated bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes. The ATRAn reaction was extended to homopropagylic radicals giving access to unique allylic gem&#8208;diboronic esters that could be used in allylboration of aldehydes. Furthermore, this work highlights that 1,1&#8208;diborylethene represents a synthetic equivalent to ketene, a so far elusive radical trap due to its daunting reactivity.

         <title>Cu&#8208;catalyzed Formal Addition of Aliphatic C(sp3)&#8211;H Bonds to Alkenes via Phenyl Radical Involved Intermolecular HAT</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A copper catalyzed aerobic formal addition of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds to alkenes via a phenyl radical mediated intermolecular HAT process is reported herein, in which the phenylhydrazine not only acts as a good HAT reagent precursor but also as an excellent hydrogen atom donor. This reaction affords an alternative method for the direct formal addition of the aliphatic C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds to alkenes utilizing air as the radical initiator without additional reductants at the ambient temperature. A variety of alkanes and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes are successfully incorporated, furnishing a series of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8211;H formal addition products in 20&#8208;93% yields. The preliminary mechanistic studies uncover that the 2&#8208;tetrahydrofuranyl and phenyl radical are formed in this reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reported a one&#8208;pot photocyclization/ oxidation cascade of N&#8208;aryl acrylamides to afford quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones. Thioxanthone was used as a bifunctional energy transfer agent to mediate both photocyclization and generation of singlet oxygen, the latter facilitates the dehydrogenation of dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;one intermediate. This cascade strategy also supports the 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization to synthesize tetrahydrocarbazolones from phenylamino cyclohexenones.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomative 1,2&#8208;(Deutero)Hydrotrifluoromethylation of Chromium&#8208;Bound Arenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dearomative trifluoromethylation of arenes provides an ideal method for constructing CF3&#8208;containing three&#8208;dimensional architectures which are of increasing interest in drug discovery. However, such transformation is rare and challenging because of the inherently low reactivity of arene &#960;&#8208;systems and selectivity issues. Herein, we disclose a general dearomative 1,2&#8208;hydrotrifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes utilizing activation by temporary &#960;&#8208;complexation to chromium, thus affording convenient access to 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes bearing the privileged CF3 group. The versatility of this strategy further enables a dearomative 1,2&#8208;deuterotrifluoromethylation with high deuterated ratios. The related dearomative 1,2&#8208;(deutero)hydroperfluoroethylation reactions were conducted well for a range of chromium&#8208;bound (hetero)arenes. Finally, a reasonable mechanism was proposed based on the intermediate capture and control experiments.</dc:description>

The related dearomative 1,2-(deutero)hydroperfluoroethylation reactions were conducted well for a range of chromium-bound (hetero)arenes. Finally, a reasonable mechanism was proposed based on the intermediate capture and control experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, silyl ethers of phenols and alcohols have been successfully prepared and tested as neutral carbon (silicon) centered radical precursors. The organocophotocatalyzed oxidation (by the Fukuzumi catalyst) of these ethers caused the cleavage of a C&#8208;Si (or a Si&#8208;Si) bond for the release of the desired radical to be used for the forging of C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) (or C(sp3)&#8208;Si) bonds via a Giese reaction.</dc:description>

Abstract
We are reporting the preparation and use in cross&#8208;coupling reactions of a newly developed, bench&#8208;stable (1&#8208;fluorocyclopropyl)metalloid reagent. The Stille cross&#8208;coupling reaction described for this &#945;&#8208;fluorinated stannane reagent is amenable to a wide range of aryl and alkenyl (pseudo)halides bearing a variety of functional groups. An enantioenriched cross&#8208;coupled product was also obtained from the corresponding 1&#8208;fluorocyclopropyltin reagent bearing an ester handle. Finally, the chemical stability of the 1&#8208;fluorocyclopropyl moiety was also demonstrated by performing several post&#8208;functionalizations.

         <title>Three Component Cascade Processes Involving Palladium Catalyzed Transformations/Dipolar Cycloadditions for the Synthesis of Angular Heterotriquinane Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Combining chemical reactivities of allenes and oximes created a methodology for the preparation of heterocyclic triquinane&#8208;type skeletons via a cascade process constructing four bonds in a single step. The initial reaction of allene moiety promoted by Pd&#8208;catalysis, affording &#960;&#8208;allyl Pd&#8208;species, was followed by two additional transformations &#8208; nucleophilic displacement and dipolar cycloaddition &#8208; to furnish the product highly stereoselectively in moderate to good yields. For the process to be efficient, it was necessary to use a dipolarophilic component as a solvent. Intriguingly, while the reaction with cyclopentanone derived oxime progressed through the whole cascade, with cyclohexanone analogue it stopped at the nitrone stage, requiring an additional step to yield similar type of products. Some aspects of the studied cascade were examined by DFT.

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Decarboxylative Mannich Reaction for the Synthesis of Non&#8208;Natural &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids Bearing Alkynyl Groups</title>

Abstract
Asymmetric decarboxylative Mannich addition of &#946;&#8208;keto acids or malonic acid half&#8208;esters to &#946;,&#947;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketimino esters catalyzed by cinchona alkaloid&#8208;derived squaramide has been developed. The reaction proceeded by forming a nucleophilic enolate after decarboxylation, followed by its addition to &#946;,&#947;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketimino esters facilitated by the bifunctional catalyst. A broad range of substrates with various substituents are tolerated in this reaction, yielding a series of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acid derivatives bearing alkynyl functional groups in high yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities. The practicality of this method was demonstrated by a gram&#8208;scale reaction and subsequent elaboration of the Mannich adducts.

Abstract
Herein, we report thiouracil&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;selective O&#8208;glycosylations employing easily accessible glycosyl trichloroacetimidate donors without using any co&#8208;catalyst or additive. A variety of alcohol nucleophiles including saccharides, and amino acids with different protecting groups containing glycosyl trichloroacetimidate donors were successfully &#945;&#8208;glycosylated using an operationally simple protocol. Moreover, mechanistic investigations suggest that thiouracil functions as Br&#248;nsted acid/base catalyst in this glycosylation process.

         <title>Oxidative Rearrangement Approach for the Ring Contraction of N&#8722;H Piperidines to Pyrrolidines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We have developed a method for ring contraction of N&#8722;H piperidines using oxidative rearrangement with PhI(OAc)2. The reaction forms iminium ion intermediates that are effectively trapped by nucleophiles (e.&#8201;g., NaBH4, H2O) yielding the corresponding pyrrolidine derivatives. Additionally, we propose an ionic mechanism supported by experiments and density&#8208;functional theory calculations.

The development of an efficient alternative to the widely employed Balz&#8208;Schiemann deaminative fluorination method (i.&#8201;e. without using aryl diazonium tetrafluoroborate salt) is a challenging task. Herein, we report a convenient one&#8208;pot method for the FeCl3&#8208;nanocellullose mediated mechanochemical synthesis of fluoroarenes through the selective substitution of an aromatic amino group by fluorine group using pyrylium tetrafluoroborate (Pyry&#8208;BF4) and sodium fluoride (NaF) via in&#8197;situ formation of pyridinium salt intermediate. The scope of the present protocol includes synthesis of thirty&#8208;four organofluorine compounds with excellent yields via a selective substitution (SNAr) of an amino group by fluorine. The presented concise methodology opens a pathway to access new chemical spaces for the late&#8208;stage functionalization in pharmaceutical industries.

Abstract
Enantioselective reduction of cyclobutenones to optically active cyclobutanones has been achieved by using whole&#8208;cell overexpressing Seqenzym ene&#8208;reductases (EREDs). By using these enzymes, trans&#8208;cyclobutanones were isolated in good yields and with enantiomeric excesses up to 99%.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Daphenylline, a structurally unique triterpenoid Daphniphyllum alkaloid, has attracted considerable attention from the synthetic community since its isolation.

Other features include installation of the initial chiral stereocenter via an enantioselective rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of an indene derivative; construction of the other vital stereocenter by organocatalytic asymmetric Mukaiyama&#8211;Michael reaction of a structurally complex benzofused cyclohexanone; and a tandem reductive amination/amidation double cyclization reaction to assemble the distinctive azapolycyclic cage&#8208;like architecture.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme Cascade with Four Enzymes in One Pot for the Synthesis of  L&#8208;Phosphinothricin</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The biocatalytic oxidative deamination&#8208; reductive amination process for the production of L&#8208;phosphinothricin (L&#8208;PPT) from D,L&#8208;phosphinothricin (D,L&#8208;PPT) is a green and environmentally friendly approach with significant development potential. In this study, the adopted technological route involves the oxidative deamination of the D&#8208;PPT component in D,L&#8208;PPT to 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)butanoic acid (PPO) by utilizing D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAAO), fol&#8208;lowed by the catalytic reductive amination of PPO to L&#8208;PPT using phosphinothricin dehydrogenase (PpDH). In order to enhance the catalytic rate and reduce the inhibitory effect of the intermediate product PPO on the catalytic process, optimization of both oxidative deamination and reductive amination phases was conducted through separate strategies of constant&#8208;pressure oxygen supply and substrate feeding, respectively. A "two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot" method was employed to link the optimized reactions, significantly shortening the production time. Furthermore, the "two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot" catalytic strategy was optimized, ultimately achieving a high 97.7% yield of L&#8208;PPT with ee of L&#8208;PPT &#65310;99.9% after 5.5 h of reaction under 800 mM D,L&#8208;PPT catalytic conditions,further enchanced the catalytic efficiency and product yield.The aforementioned results demonstrate that this proposed approach has great potential for industrial&#8208;scale production of L&#8208;PPT as well as significant competitive advantages in terms of economic feasibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging Organolithium Chemistry and Stereoselective Biocatalysis: Transformation of Aromatic Nitriles into Chiral Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The combination of RLi&#8208;mediated organic transformations (under air and at room temperature) with a subsequent stereoselective biocatalytic reaction is for the first time presented. Most of the previous asymmetric chemoenzymatic routes have been limited to the concomitant or sequential combination of transition metals/organocatalysts with enzymes. However, the use of polar organometallic reagents (RLi) in the design of these stereoselective hybrid protocols has been totally neglected, as far as we are concerned. Thus, in this work, the combination of organolithium chemistry and asymmetric biocatalysis is described for the first time in a one&#8208;pot fashion. The chemoenzymatic approach converts a series of nitriles into chiral alcohols consisting of two steps, where the key item was the finding of suitable conditions to adapt the reactivities of organolithiums and alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) in the same recipient. The organolithium addition occurred with total chemoselectivity (no side reactions were observed) under neat conditions and room temperature leading to the corresponding imines, which were hydrolyzed using a buffer, and adjusting the pH for the subsequent ADH action. Commercial and made in house overexpressed ADHs allowed to produce chiral alcohols with excellent selectivities and good overall yields. The different behavior displayed for the reductive enzymes in the presence of diethyl ether clearly influenced in the decision to let the organolithium solvent evaporate under open&#8208;air conditions before developing the bioreduction step. Our results demonstrate the importance of the fine orchestration of the reaction conditions for the development of efficient hybrid chemoenzymatic cascades without the need of intermediate isolation/purification steps or compartmentalization of the different synthetic systems.

         <title>An Acid Catalyzed Alkynyl&#8208;Prins Cyclization&#8211;Rearrangement Cascade of 2&#8208;(Alkynol)benzoates: An Approach to 3&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;[n,5]&#8208;oxaspirophthalides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxaspiro&#8208;phthalides ([n,5]&#8208;oxaspirobenzalactones) bearing a phthalide spirofused to a cyclic&#8208;ether of various sizes are frameworks found in bioactive natural products. The discovery and development of an alkynyl&#8208;Prins cyclization based, strategy for the construction of structurally interesting, medicinally useful [5,5]&#8208; [6,5]&#8208;, and [7,5]&#8208;oxaspirophthalides is reported in this manuscript. Our strategy may represent the first report on the construction of oxaspiro&#8208;phthalides using the alkynyl&#8208;Prins cyclization.	This approach exhibits broad substrate scope with respect to carbonyl compounds and 2&#8208;(alkynol)benzoates, with yields ranging between 71&#8208;98%.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The oxaspiro-phthalides ([n,5]-oxaspirobenzalactones) bearing a phthalide spirofused to a cyclic-ether of various sizes are frameworks found in bioactive natural products. The discovery and development of an alkynyl-Prins cyclization based, strategy for the construction of structurally interesting, medicinally useful [5,5]- [6,5]-, and [7,5]-oxaspirophthalides is reported in this manuscript. Our strategy may represent the first report on the construction of oxaspiro-phthalides using the alkynyl-Prins cyclization.	This approach exhibits broad substrate scope with respect to carbonyl compounds and 2-(alkynol)benzoates, with yields ranging between 71-98%. Isolation of intermediate, and further conversion of it to the end-product supported the proposed mechanistic pathway.

         <title>Oxidative Synthesis of 2,5&#8208;Diarylphenanthro[9,10&#8208;c]thiophenes and Their Aerobic Photoconversion to 9,10&#8208;Diaroylphenanthrenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our study introduces a streamlined oxidative method for synthesizing 1,3&#8208;diarylphenanthro[9,10&#8208;c]thiophenes, and their subsequent oxidative cleavage to yield 9,10&#8208;diaroylphenanthrenes. Harnessing an optimized aerobic photochemical transformation, we showcase broad substrate scope and tolerance to various photosensitive functional groups. Our mechanistic investigations unveil the pivotal role of singlet oxygen, providing intriguing insights into the reaction pathway. The synthesized 9,10&#8208;diaroylphenanthrenes serve as versatile building blocks for nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, dibenzoannulated phthalazines, that are promising compounds with diverse functionalities. Offering mild conditions, and broad applicability, our synthetic strategy is useful for organic synthesis and chemical biology exploration.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Here we report a transition metal&#8211; and oxidant&#8211;free annulation cascade method for the synthesis of chromeno&#8211;isoxazoles. The annulation reaction involves easily accessible starting materials, 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2H&#8208;chromene and &#945;&#8208;chloro aldehyde, yielding the structurally intriguing framework, chromeno[3,4&#8208;c]isoxazoles employed by tripotassium phosphate as a base. The isoxazole ring construction over the 2H&#8211;chromene unit is believed to occur via a series of multiple reaction sequences. Here, the enolate generation/Michael addition/C&#8211;Cl bond cleavage/oxy&#8211;anionic addition to reactive tethered&#8208;aldehyde/deformylation via retro&#8211; C&#8211;C and N&#8211;O bond cleavages are the most possible sequences which furnish the desired end&#8211;product in good chemical yields. The multiple reaction sequences occur in one&#8208;pot at mild conditions, supported by experimental results and a few control experiments including DFT studies. This process exhibits a broad substrates scope illustrating good functional group compatibility towards both the nitrochromenes and aldehydes, and thus prove to be a general and efficient protocol for the synthesis of chromeno[3,4&#8211;c]isoxazoles. Overall, the use of nitrochromene as the limiting reagent, noteworthy functional group tolerance, scalability including great applications like chiral pool strategy towards the synthesis of enantioenriched chromeno&#8208;isoxazole are the additional features.

Abstract
A photoinduced three&#8208;component reaction of thianthrenium salts, DABCO&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(SO2)2, and benzyl ether substituted alkenes is developed, affording &#948;&#8208;hydroxylsulfones with good functional group tolerance. This transformation proceeds through an anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrosulfonylation of alkenes under a mild reaction condition. Mechanism studies indicates that this reaction undergoes a radical pathway involving sulfur dioxide insertion and 1,5&#8208;hydrogen transfer processes.

Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced difunctionalization of alkenes is a powerful strategy for constructing complex molecules. Herein, we disclose a three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;alkylpyridylation of alkenes under mild and photosensitizers&#8208;free conditions. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopy studies and NMR titration experiments indicate that the formation of an EDA complex between 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;DHPs and 4&#8208;cyanopyridines. Primary, secondary, and tertiary C(sp3)&#8208;centered radicals were formed by homolytic cleavage of 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;DHPs. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage functionalization of medicinally relevant molecules showed the synthetic potential of our methodology.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Naphthalenone Spiroindanediones or 4&#8208;Acyl&#8208;1&#8208;naphthols from Aryl Enaminones Featuring Reuse of Dimethylamine</title>

Abstract
Presented herein is a switchable synthesis of naphthalenone spiroindanediones or 4&#8208;acyl&#8208;1&#8208;naphthols via condition&#8208;controlled divergent cascade reactions of aryl enaminones with diazoindanediones. When the reaction was carried out in the presence of an oxidative additive, naphthalenone spiroindanedione was formed through C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation followed by simultaneous spiroannulation and elimination of dimethylamine. When the reaction was carried out in the presence of an acid additive, on the other hand, 4&#8208;acyl&#8208;1&#8208;naphthol was formed through ring opening of the spiroindanedione moiety attacked by the in&#8197;situ released dimethylamine. In addition, the reactions are suitable for gram&#8208;scale applications and compatible with a variety of substrates. Moreover, the naphthol products allow structural elaborations and hybridization with a drug, thus further enhancing the value of this developed method.

         <title>Hybrid Catalysts in Photoredox Arylation of Sodium Arylsulfinates</title>

Abstract
Complexes [(bpy)2Ru(BL)](PF6)2 (Ru(BL), BL=N,N&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthrolinamine) have been investigated in the coupling reaction of aryl halides and sodium arylsulfinates under visible light irradiation. The position (3, 4 or 5) of the nickel&#8208;coordinating di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amine fragment in the 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline core has a strong influence on the activity of the catalytic system. The advantage of binding fragments of photocatalyst and metal complex into one molecule in the systems with bridging ligands N,N&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthrolin&#8208;3&#8208;amine (BL1) and N,N&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthrolin&#8208;4&#8208;amine (BL2), in comparison with mixed catalytic systems, is shown. With Ru(BL2) photocatalysts it is possible to reduce the loading to 0.1&#8197;mol%, instead of the commonly used 1&#8211;2&#8197;mol%, and to eliminate the use of the additional ligand for nickel. Under these conditions, more than 20 diarylsulfones of different structures were synthesized in 25&#8211;95% yields.

         <title>In(OTf)3&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereoselective [2+3+1] Annulation of 3&#8208;Formylchromones with &#945;&#8208;Methylstyrenes for Divergent Synthesis of Tetrahydroxanthones</title>

Abstract
An In(III)&#8208;catalyzed [2+3+1] annulation strategy is developed for the diastereoselective construction of diversely functionalized tetrahydroxanthones bearing chromone rings. This protocol is based on a three&#8208;component reaction involving various 3&#8208;formylchromones and &#945;&#8208;methylstyrenes via a carbonyl&#8208;ene and formal [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. Notable features of this reaction include its wide substrate scope, high tolerance towards functional groups, atom economy, and excellent diastereoselectivity. In addition, the synthesized tetrahydroxanthones are readily transformed into 2&#8208;hydroxybenzophenone products.

         <title>Selective Access to Sultams and Spirocyclic Sultams by the Divergent Annulations of (N&#8208;Aryl)&#8208;Alkynyl Sulphonamides</title>

Abstract
Herein, we present the first annulation reaction of (N&#8208;aryl)&#8208;alkynyl sulphonamides leading to sultams or spirocyclic sultams. The selective formation of aforesaid products is based on the variable reactivity, intramolecular ortho&#8208;cyclization or dearomative ipso&#8208;annulation, guided by the substituent on N&#8208;aryl group of the substrate. The ortho&#8208;annulation is mediated by electrophile, while the ipso&#8208;annulation is promoted by the radical, enabling the functionalization (selenyl or iodo) on sultams. The synthetic potential of this method is illustrated by modifications of the functional groups present in the products obtained.

Abstract
An electrochemical method with high faradaic efficiency was developed for the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;regioselective aroylation of quinoline N&#8208;oxides under oxidant&#8208;free conditions by using aryl &#945;&#8208;ketoacids as the aroylation reagent. A series of 8&#8208;aroylquinoline N&#8208;oxides were effectively synthesized in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. Furthermore, the proposed method was successfully applied to the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a tubulin polymerization inhibitor. Additionally, a plausible reaction mechanism for the decarboxylation radical acylation was proposed on the basis of the results of cyclic voltammetry and control experiments. Overall, this method provides a novel solution for the C8&#8208;regioselective aroylation of quinoline N&#8208;oxides.

         <title>Imidazolidine&#8208;Pyrroloimidazolone Pyridine&#8208;Ni(acac)2 Complex Catalyzed Asymmetric Darzens Reaction of Isatins with Phenacyl Chlorides: A Chiral Amplification Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
With phenacyl chlorides as simple nucleophilic species, the asymmetric Darzens reaction of isatins using Ni(acac)2 as the Lewis acid and imidazolidine&#8208;pyrroloimidazolone pyridine as the ligand is reported. In the presence of 1&#8197;mol% of the catalyst, diverse spiro&#8208;epoxyoxindoles with two new contiguous stereocenters were afforded in 82&#8211;99% yields, &gt;20:1 dr, with 91&#8211;99% ee. Chiral spiro&#8208;epoxyoxindoles could undergo ring&#8208;opening reactions in further transformations. The developed method was applied to the derivatization of complex molecules including indomethacin, gemfibrozil, and febuxostat&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;chloroketones. A strong positive nonlinear effect was observed, which was caused by the precipitation of a less&#8208;soluble racemic catalyst complex.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of CF3&#8208;Pyrano[3,4&#8208;c]quinolones from Hetero&#8208;Dendralenes and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate an Oxa&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 3&#8208;trifluoroacetyl&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;quinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one with aldehydes in the presence of a base to engineer the functionalized pyrano[3,4&#8208;c]quinolones. This reaction proceeds through an in&#8208;situ generated hetero dendralene intermediate and features perfect stereoselectivity on a wide range of substrates with excellent atom economy. The high electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of CF3&#8208;group is responsible for making the methyl group present in quinolone moiety more acidic to furnish the corresponding hetero dendralene intermediate.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we demonstrate an Oxa-Diels-Alder reaction of 3-trifluoroacetyl-4-methyl-quinolin-2(1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-one with aldehydes in the presence of a base to engineer the functionalized pyrano[3,4-&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]quinolones. This reaction proceeds through an in-situ generated hetero dendralene intermediate and features perfect stereoselectivity on a wide range of substrates with excellent atom economy. The high electron-withdrawing nature of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-group is responsible for making the methyl group present in quinolone moiety more acidic to furnish the corresponding hetero dendralene intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoinduced, trans&#8208;Diastreoselective Oxyselenenylation of Allylic Alcohols to Form Selenylated Cyclic Boronic Esters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced method was developed to synthesize selenylated cyclic boronic esters through intermolecular oxyselenenylation. This method can be performed under additive&#8208;free and photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions and generates potentially pharmaceutically useful heterocycles. A plausible reaction mechanism was proposed based on several control experiments and previous reports.

         <title>Synthesis of Fluorinated Spiroindolenines by Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Indole Dearomatizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A strategy to access fluorinated spiroindolenines has been developed, involving a selective functionalization of indoles with fluorinated moieties and subsequent catalytic dearomatization. Trifluomethylthio (SCF3), diethyl phosphono(difluoromethyl)thio (SCF2P(O)(OEt)2) and (phenylsulfonyl)difluoromethyl (CF2SO2Ph) groups were embedded at the C2 position of indole derivatives substituted with alkynes, allenes, and allyl carbonate moieties at the C3 position. A gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization gave access to five spiroindolenines, and an enantioselective palladium catalyzed cyclization provided 10 fluorinated spirocyclic products with up to 77% ee.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Oxazoles: Aminotrifluoromethylation of Alkynes/in&#8208;situ Cyclization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We report the development of a four&#8208;component electrochemical method for the synthesis of CF3&#8208;oxazoles, utilizing alkynes and NaSO2CF3 in MeCN. The method leverages the simplicity and mildness of the reaction conditions, despite the inherent complexity of utilizing four distinct components through aminotrifluoromethylation of alkyne followed by in&#8208;situ cyclization. Notably, in addition to MeCN solvent, the presence of residual water in the reaction mixture also contributed as a coupling partner. The synthesis involves a sequence of four controlled oxidation steps under constant potential with graphite electrodes, facilitated by the mediator TMEDA, highlighting the precision achievable in electrochemistry.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An electrochemical protocol for synthesizing tetra&#8208;substituted sulfonated pyrazoles is developed. The notable feature of this method is the electrocatalytic generation of an active iodine species, which enables the direct use of 1,3 dicarbonyls as the reactant and also eliminates the necessity for external electrolytes. A wide range of functionalities are compatible under the electrocatalytic condition, resulting good to excellent production of the desired pyrazole derivatives. Detailed synthetic and electrochemical studies enlighten the electrocatalytic pathway.

Abstract
Copper&#8208;catalyzed and visible&#8208;light catalytic difluoroalkylation reactions of N&#8208;cyanamide alkenes have been developed. Various &#945;&#8208;bromodifluoromethyl substituted esters, amides and heterocycles were employed as the CF2 source. Both protocols are characterized by medium to high yields, good functional group compatibility, and applicable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Comparable studies of copper catalysis and photoredox catalysis demonstrate minimal differences between the two protocols. Preliminary mechanism suggest that both transformations involve tandem radical cyclization process.

Abstract
We report herein a general one&#8208;pot perfluoroalkylation/dehydrohalogenation protocol for the selective perfluoroalkenylation of silyl dienol ethers in their &#947; position. Importantly, this methodology is applicable to the synthesis of a wide range of &#947;&#8208;perfluoroalkenylated enals, enones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides. Various perfluoroalkenyl moieties could be efficiently introduced, with an important impact on the E/Z diatereoselectivity of the newly formed fluorinated double bond.

         <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective amination of N&#8208;heterocycles is an interesting topic in organic synthesis and drug discovery. We herein present a method for the vicarious&#8208;type nucleophilic amination of azine N&#8208;oxides and cyclic iminoamides using iminyl anions, readily generated from organic azides under basic conditions. The plausible reaction mechanism involving nucleophilic aromatic substitution by iminyl anions is elucidated by a series of mechanistic investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclization Through Dual C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H functionalization methods have been widely employed in many organic transformations such as cyclization reactions, heterocycle synthesis, cross&#8208;coupling protocols, and photochemical transformations. Among these transformations, cyclization reaction through C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H functionalization offers a direct route to convert simple linear substrates to complex products. There are three modes of utilizing C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H bonds in cyclization reactions including single, double, and dual C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H functionalization. As the most challenging mode, dual C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H functionalization refers to converting two separate C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H bonds in one molecule into desired C&#8211;Z bonds which can be employed in cyclization reactions. Cyclization reaction &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; dual functionalization of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H can be classified based on the C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H reactivities. Therefore, these reactions can be categorized into three classes based on the types of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H bonds including activated&#8208;activated, activated&#8208;unactivated, and unactivated&#8208;unactivated C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H bonds. Most published reports for cyclization reactions &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; dual C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H functionalization involve activated&#8208;activated C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H bonds. However, the number of reported papers on the other two classes has been growing. This review focuses on the dual C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H functionalization protocols used for cyclization reactions and categorizes the published papers based on the types of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H bonds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A direct visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted radical&#8208;triggered tandem cyclization of 1,7&#8208;diene systems with cyclic sulfonium salts by using copper(I)&#8208;based complexes as photoredox catalyst is developed. With this approach, a variety of sulfur&#8208;containing polycyclic derivatives are prepared through alkylation/6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization/5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization of 1,7&#8208;diene systems under mild conditions. In addition, the photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening of cyclic sulfonium salts provides the alkyl radical intermediates, which prefers addition to the Ph&#8208;linked C&#8208;C double bond rather than the electron&#8208;deficient vinyl in 1,7&#8208;dienes. Moreover, oxidation of the desire sulfur&#8208;containing polycyclic products provides a strategy for the preparation of remote nitrogen&#8208;fused polycyclic substituted sulfoxide or sulfone&#8208;containing derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing SuFExable Cyclobutane&#8208;Fused Indolines via Photocatalytic Intermolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition of Indoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Indoline&#8208;fused polycycles are commonly found as a key structural component in numerous natural products and biologically active compounds. In recent times, the incorporation of sulfonyl fluoride groups has drawn significant attention in research due to their potential to enhance or confer new biological activities to molecules. In this study, we report the development of a modular approach for synthesizing FSO2&#8208;functionalized cyclobutane&#8208;fused indolines by employing an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between indoles and SuFExable ethenesulfonyl fluoride under triplet energy&#8208;transfer catalysis. This method features mild reaction conditions, metal&#8208;free photocatalysts, and excellent tolerance to various functional groups. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of further modifying the FSO2&#8208;functionalized indoline products via SuFEx click reactions, enabling their conjugation with other molecules.

         <title>Enabling Regioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Methyl BODIPYs via H2O2/DMSO&#8208;Promoted Direct Methylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Achieving &#945;&#8208;methylation of BODIPYs remains challenging due to the electron&#8208;deficient property of &#945;&#8208;position of BODIPYs. Herein, a H2O2/DMSO&#8208;promoted radical process was employed, providing an approach for the construction of a series of &#945;&#8208;methyl and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dimethyl BODIPYs in 57&#8211;68% yields.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted chemodivergent phosphorylation&#8208;peroxidation and oxyphosphorylation of alkenes with phosphine oxides and HOOtBu was realized under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. Using the commercially available Eosin Y as a SET&#8208;photocatalyst, the &#946;&#8208;peroxy&#8208;phosphine oxides were selectively obtained with a catalytic amount of base, while the addition of acid led to the exclusive formation of &#42933;&#8208;keto&#8208;phosphine oxides. Control experiments showed that Eosin Y could also act as a HAT&#8208;catalyst to induce the O&#8208;O bond cleavage of peroxides under acidic conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Allylation of Cyclic Ketones with Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric &#945;&#8208;allylation of ketones is a particularly useful tool for constructing stereocenters via C&#8211;C bond formation. However, this type of reaction often necessitated the use of activated ketones or pre&#8208;prepared enol intermediates as substrates. In this study, we developed a nickel&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;allylation of unactivated cycloketones with allylic alcohols to synthesize chiral cycloketones with a &#945;&#8208;quaternary carbon center. The reaction affords the products with 42&#8211;97% yield, 72&#8211;86% ee, and no additive is needed, the only by&#8208;product is water.</dc:description>

This methodology enables the construction of C&#8211;N and N&#8211;N bonds under mild reaction conditions without transition metal catalysts or external oxidizing agents.

         <title>Base&#8208;Catalyzed Domino Isomerization/Oxidant&#8208;Free Dehydrogenative Annulation of Allylic Alcohols: Scope, Mechanism, and Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A domino reaction comprising four consecutive steps based on the strategy of isomerization of allylic alcohols was developed. This base&#8208;catalyzed protocol provided an approach for constructing polysubstituted quinolines without additional additives. A wide range of di&#8208; or trisubstituted &#947;&#8208;aminoaryl allylic alcohols bearing alkyl or (hetero)aryl substituents were transformed to the structurally diverse quinolines. The utility of this transformation was demonstrated by the application in the concise synthesis of several polysubstituted quinoline derivatives, including natural products and pharmacological agents. Preliminary mechanistic experiments suggested that the isomerization of &#947;&#8208;aminoaryl allylic alcohol underwent an intramolecular 1,3&#8208;hydrogen shift and the aromatization of the dihydroquinoline intermediate went through two possible pathways simultaneously exist, acceptorless dehydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing 2&#8208;(chalcogen)benzothiazoles via electrochemically mediated intermolecular cyclization of isocyanides with thiols or diselenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;(chalcogen)benzothiazoles are frequently used as core structures for the development of pharmaceutical agents. A mild strategy for the synthesis of 2&#8208;(chalcogen)benzothiazoles under electrooxidative conditions using isocyanides, thiols or diselenides as substrates was developed. This protocol allows access to structurally diverse 2&#8208;(chalcogen)benzothiazoles in good yields and with good functional group tolerance, which does not require heavy metal catalysts and exogenous oxidants. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale synthesis was performed to demonstrate the scale&#8208;up applicability of this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Difunctionalization of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons Employing the Same Functional Reagent</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The radical difunctionalization of unsaturated hydrocarbons serves as an efficient means to rapidly construct molecular skeletons and synthesize&#8208;highly valuable compounds. In this transformational process, diverse positions within unsaturated hydrocarbons are sequentially functionalized by a single radical precursor reagent, thereby achieving highly efficient and selective transformations that promote atom economy. Furthermore, this approach minimizes the generation of numerous byproducts stemming from cross&#8208;coupling reactions between reactants, owing to the   reduction of the number of participating components. Therefore, this review provides an in&#8208;depth analysis of the radical difunctionalization of unsaturated hydrocarbons utilizing a single functional reagent in recent decades. The discussion is based on eight different radical classes (carbon&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, phosphine&#8208;, oxygen&#8208;, sulfur&#8208;, selenium&#8208;, tellurium&#8208;, and chlorine&#8208;centered radicals), emphasizing the mechanism of specific radical difunctionalization. It also analyzes in detail the regulation of key factors such as regional selectivity, and provides unique insights into reaction transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Hydroxymethylation to 2&#8208;Pyridones and Isoquinolones via C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyridine&#8208;directed regioselective C&#8208;H hydroxymethylation to pyridones and isoquinolones using para&#8208;formaldehyde has been developed under manganese catalysis, offering a wide variety of hydroxymethylated products in 40&#8208;85% yields. This operationally simple methodology proceeds in one step using an earth&#8208;abundant first&#8208;row transition metal&#8208;catalyst without the generation of unwanted salt wastes. A mechanistic study revealed that the C&#8208;H metalation step is reversible but not the rate&#8208;determining step. The introduction of hydroxymethyl group in the biologically relevant scaffolds could be used as an intermediate for valuable synthetic transformations.</dc:description>

</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel strained spiro heterocycles (SSHs) as bioisosteres for aromatic or non&#8208;strained aliphatic rings is highly sought after for improving drug design. Their high molecular rigidity and predictable vectorization can enhance drug&#8208;likeness, target selectivity and clinical success. Towards this goal, 1&#8208;oxa&#8208;2,6&#8208;diazaspiro[3.3]heptane (ODASE) is reported as a novel potential SSH&#8208;bioisostere. We demonstrate through theoretical studies the potential of this strained spiro heterocycle to act as a bioisostere for piperazine. We have developed its synthesis from the highly strained azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl intermediate through a robust and mild flow technology&#8208;assisted two&#8208;step protocol. Its tolerance and stability towards medicinally relevant N&#8208;functionalisation protocols are studied, as well as its mild reduction to the C3&#8208;aminoalkylazetidinol motif found in anti&#8208;cancer drug cobimetinib.

         <dc:description>A copper&#8208;catalyzed annulation of enaminones with maleimides was developed to synthesize various pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;e] isoindoles. In this strategy, 2&#8208;aminopyridine served as a traceless directing group, and target products were obtained in 54&#8208;72% yields. Moreover, a plausible mechanism for this reaction  was proposed based on several control experiments, deuterium exchange experiments, and previous reports.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We herein describe a method in the synthesis of aryl ether derivatives from a cross&#8208;coupling reaction of vinylidenecyclopropane&#8208;diesters (VDCP&#8208;diesters) with phenolic compounds that can be purchased directly from dealers for the formation of C&#8722;O bond under palladium catalysis and assisted by Sc(OTf)3/Cs2CO3. This developed transformation proceeds through a nucleophilic addition at the 2&#8208;position of allenic moiety at 50 &#176;C for 4.0 h and are compatible with substituents such as bromine, iodine and borate on the phenolic substrates via a zwitterionic &#960;&#8208;propargyl palladium species, affording the desired products in 29% to 95% isolated yields. A plausible reaction mechanism has been also proposed on the basis of control, deuterium labeling experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Formal olefinic C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling between alkenyl sulfonium salts and secondary phosphine oxides and H&#8208;phosphinates has been developed. A base enables construction of alkenyl C&#8722;P bonds as well as aliphatic C&#8722;P bonds at ambient temperature under an air atmosphere. This protocol provides an alternative access to multisubstituted alkenyl phosphine oxides and phosphinates in 40&#8208;99% yields from functionalized alkenes through an interrupted Pummerer activation/base&#8208;promoted olefinic C&#8722;S bond phosphinylation sequence.

         <title>Unconventional Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Catalyst Ratio for the Distal C&#8211;C Bond Formation via C&#8211;H Activation and Chain&#8208;Walking</title>

         <dc:description>A mechanism&#8208;navigated enantioselective alkylation of an indole C2 C&#8211;H bond with an internal alkene was developed. Under the inharmonious ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal catalyst ratio, a moderate enantiomeric ratio (er) was achieved with our original ligand. We propose that chain&#8208;walking and bond formation are mechanistically independent, and suggest that hydridoiridium does not play a role in the chain&#8208;walking process.</dc:description>

Abstract
Heterocycles are important compounds existed in diverse advanced chemicals, functional materials, bioactive molecules and natural products. Different strategies through transition metal&#8208;catalyzed alkyne cyclization have been developed to synthesize various heterocycles. The merger of alkyne cyclization and metal nanoparticle catalysis has emerged as an important approach to diverse heterocycles. By using different kinds of metal nanoparticle catalysts, such as gold, silver, copper and palladium nanoparticles, a number of heterocycles are prepared with high yield and selectivity in a green, sustainable and highly efficient manner. This review summarizes and discusses recent achievements in metal nanoparticle&#8208;catalyzed alkyne cyclization for the synthesis of heterocycles.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction of Trifluoromethylated &#946;&#8208;Keto Diazos and Nitriles Proceeding via H2O Addition to Nitrile Ylides</title>

Abstract
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed multi&#8208;component reaction of trifluoromethylated &#946;&#8208;amino ketones and nitriles using tert&#8208;butyl nitrite as a diazotization reagent has been developed. Under the optimized conditions, N&#8208;trifluoroalkyl amides were obtained with yields up to 87%. Control experiments and computational studies reveal that the reaction proceeds through the generation of diazo, in&#8197;situ formation of nitrile ylide, water addition and final enol tautomerism. This approach features mild reaction conditions, wide substrate tolerance, and scale&#8208;up applicability, which provides an efficient and practical strategy for amide synthesis.

Abstract
A class of novel chiral&#8208;bridged biphenyl monophosphine ligands with a benzofuran moiety (He&#8208;phos) has been successfully synthesized and reported. These ligands exhibited good performance in the gold&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cycloaddition reaction of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones with nitrones, resulting in the successful preparation of a series of polyaryl&#8208;substituted heterocyclic compounds with high enantioselectivities (up to 99% yield, 98% ee). The wide substrate adaptability (53 examples) and mild reaction conditions demonstrate the practicability of He&#8208;phos in this reaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A class of novel chiral-bridged biphenyl monophosphine ligands with a benzofuran moiety (&lt;b&gt;He-phos&lt;/b&gt;) has been successfully synthesized and reported. These ligands exhibited good performance in the gold-catalyzed enantioselective cycloaddition reaction of 2-(1-alkynyl)-2-en-1-ones with nitrones, resulting in the successful preparation of a series of polyaryl-substituted heterocyclic compounds with high enantioselectivities (up to 99% yield, 98% ee). The wide substrate adaptability (53 examples) and mild reaction conditions demonstrate the practicability of &lt;b&gt;He-phos&lt;/b&gt; in this reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous appropriately substituted pyridyl or phenyl groups serve as a particularly advantageous activation motif for the electrochemical oxidation of amines. Such groups enable a general, mild method for the electrochemical &#945;&#8208;functionalization of tertiary amines across numerous activating groups and amine scaffolds. Notably, the method accommodates an unprecedented range of nucleophile classes, allowing for the introduction of diverse functional groups to the readily prepared amine substrates. The utility of this method is then demonstrated through applications to unsymmetrical bisfunctionalization, site&#8208;selective functionalization of N&#8208;pyridyl amines vs. other activated amines, a formal synthesis of ivosidenib and the diversification of FDA&#8208;approved drugs or natural product substrates.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract. We present a new metal&#8208;free photocatalytic approach for the synthesis of difluoroalkoxylated ketones. This strategy involves the generation of alkoxyl radicals from pyridinium salts upon the activity of a catalytic electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex. This mild process tolerates several functional groups and can be scaled up to gram scale. Diverse products manipulations accounts for the versatility of the obtained fluorinated products, highlighting the synthetic usefulness of this method.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a strategy for the synthesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from readily available 2&#8208;iodostyrenes and o&#8209;halobenzoic acids through a ligand&#8208;free palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade vinyl C&#8208;H activation/decarboxylative cyclization. A vinyl&#8208;coordinated five&#8208;membered palladacycle was proposed as the key intermediate for this sequential process. Furthermore, Heptagon&#8208;embedded aromatic compounds can be smoothly synthesized by employing 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;naphthoic acid as decarboxylative insertion unit.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Buchner reaction: experimental and theoretical comparison of the effect of the carbene substituent on the chemoselectivity.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intramolecular Buchner reaction is a powerful transformation able to dearomatize benzenic rings. However, the competitive C&#8211;H insertion of the carbene moiety into benzylic positions still remains a limitation, and the reasons governing this uncomplete chemoselectivity are poorly understood. The carbene substitution, in particular, have been observed to influence strongly the selectivity, though the currently proposed explanation relying on the electrophilicity of the metallocarbene hardly describes some experimental results reported in the literature. In this article, we present our experimental observations of intramolecular rhodium&#8208;catalyzed Buchner reactions, combined with DFT calculations on selected carbene substituents, to propose a complementary explanation for the observed chemoselectivity modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Rh(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Selective C&#8208;H Alkylation and Alkenylation of 1,2,3&#8208;Benzotriazinones with Maleimides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a condition&#8208;based switchable Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H alkylation and alkenylation of 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazinones with maleimides, where triazinone serves as a directing group rather than its traditional role denitrogenative precursor. This strategy enables the selective synthesis of diverse 3&#8208;arylated succinimides and 3&#8208;arylated maleimides in up to 99% yield with broad substrate scope (48 examples). Furthermore, for the first time, a tandem C&#8208;H alkylation and denitrogenative coupling of 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazinones has been realized by slightly modifying the reaction conditions. Additionally, gram&#8208;scale reactions and product derivatizations were conducted to demonstrate the synthetic utility.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Polyaryl&#8208;Substituted Azafluoranthenes via Co&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition of 1,6&#8208;Diynes with Nitriles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of azafluoranthene derivatives under mild conditions via [2+2+2] cycloaddition of 1,6&#8208;diynes and nitriles catalyzed by CoBr2/dppp, exhibiting good atom economy. This procedure uses an inexpensive ligand and an earth&#8208;abundant metal as catalyst to lower the cost of synthesis. Several azafluoranthenes are produced in 28&#8211;95% yields using this approach, featuring mild conditions, wide substrate scope, and good functional group tolerance. The fluorescence spectra of some azafluoranthenes indicate that these scaffolds have good photophysical properties for material science.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic regioselective aldol reaction of hydroxyacetone with aliphatic aldehydes for the synthesis of linear products</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present an organocatalyst that addresses the reactivity issue of aliphatic aldehydes with hydroxyacetone, leading to the formation of a linear product. Previous proline&#8208;based catalysts required a significant excess of hydroxyacetone and could only be applied to aromatic aldehydes. The proposed sulphonamide containing a proline moiety effectively controls the reaction, generating a new stereogenic center dependent on the catalyst's configuration and does not require a large excess of the ketone. We demonstrated that this methodology can be effectively utilized in the synthesis of natural compounds, as confirmed by obtaining the 2&#8208;keto&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;gluconic acid (KDG) methyl ester from optically pure glyceraldehyde and protected hydroxyacetone.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>2H&#8208;Azirines are an important class of small&#8208;ring heterocycle that have been employed as versatile synthetic building blocks. Herein, a one&#8208;pot CuAAC/ring&#8208;cleavage/[4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/rearrangement reaction sequence involving terminal ynones, sulfonyl azides and 2H&#8208;azirines is reported that leads to 2&#8208;aminopyridine derivatives. In the first step, highly reactive N&#8208;sulfonyl &#945;&#8208;acylketenimines are generated, via a CuAAC/ring&#8208;cleavage process, from sulfonyl azides and terminal ynones and these undergo inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8722;Alder cycloaddition reactions with 2H&#8208;azirines to form (isolable) 1,3&#8208;oxazines that themselves undergo base&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;cleavage and rearrangement reactions to afford the title compounds.</dc:description>

In the first step, highly reactive N-sulfonyl &#945;-acylketenimines are generated, via a CuAAC/ring-cleavage process, from sulfonyl azides and terminal ynones and these undergo inverse electron-demand Diels&#8722;Alder cycloaddition reactions with 2H-azirines to form (isolable) 1,3-oxazines that themselves undergo base-promoted ring-cleavage and rearrangement reactions to afford the title compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Benchmarking methanophosphocines as versatile PIII/PV redox organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PIII/PV redox cycling has recently emerged as a valuable strategy to minimized the chemical waste generated by phosphine&#8208;mediated reaction, as well as enabling asymetric transformation. In this article, we detail our contribution to this field by designing a series of diversely functionalized, electron&#8208;rich bridgehead phosphine oxides with structural features that make them well&#8208;suited for PIII/PV redox organocatalysis. Their catalytic performance has been assessed in various model reactions, including Wittig or Staudinger reactions, along with the reduction of activated alkenes and allenes. For each of these scenarios, we performed a comparative analysis with existing catalysts in order to demonstrate the applicability and limitation of methanophosphocines.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Aerobic Dearomatization of Naphthylamines under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The dearomatization of aromatic substrates via photocatalytic methodologies has gained escalating prominence to access molecular complexity. Although much focus has been put on non&#8208;active arenes, naphthols and N&#8208;based heteroaromatics, arylamines have so far remained in the background. Herein, we report a photocatalytic strategy for the aerobic, dearomative hydroxylation of naphthylamines under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Our investigation highlights singlet oxygen generation as a viable mechanism for aromaticity disruption, mitigating selectivity issues deriving from the direct oxidation of targeted arylamines. Finally, we showcased the synthetic value of the obtained dearomatized products in a late&#8208;stage diversification campaign.

         <dc:description>We developed a second&#8208;generation of Lewis acid catalyst enabling selective and user&#8208;friendly phosphonylation of diverse alcohols. This one&#8208;pot method utilizes P(III) reagent bis(2,2,2&#8211;trifluoroethyl) phosphite under mild conditions. Exploring the influence of metal selection in Lewis acid catalysts revealed four highly active complexes for alcohol phosphonylation: Zn(II), Al(III), Zr(IV), and Hf(IV). Notably, Hf(IV) displayed superior selectivity compared to the previously developed Zn(II) catalyst.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, external photocatalyst&#8208;free, site&#8208;selective C&#8208;H arylation of 4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones and various 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes has been developed to provide ortho arylated products  41&#8208; 95% yield at room temperature. A mechanistic study using controlled experiments, UV&#8208;visible study, DFT study, and observation of colored aggregates suggest that in situ generated Ag&#8208;palladacycle complex of 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes is responsible for absorbing the visible light and generating aryl radicals from aryldiazonium salts. Further, this methodology demonstrates its versatility by transforming various 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes, including 2&#8208;phenylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;one, 3&#8208;phenylquinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one, 2&#8208;phenylpyridines, pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines, 2&#8208;phenylquinolines, 2&#8208;phenylisoquinolines, and 2&#8208;phenylbenzo[d]thiazoles, into their respective regio&#8208;selective C&#8208;H arylated products under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

Abstract
A silver&#8208;catalyzed regioselective one&#8208;pot cyclization reaction of diazo reagents with fluoronitroalkenes was developed. This transformation presents a method for accessing a series of 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;fluoropyrazoles that are substituted with various groups such as trifluoromethyl, carboxylic ester, nitrile, and phosphonate ester. Further synthetic transformations offered the corresponding fluorinated and trifluoromethylated analogues of two fungicide compounds.

         <title>On&#8208;off Pulsed Ultrasound Promote Asymmetric Noncovalent Organocatalysis &#8220;on Water&#8221;: An Investigation in Michael Addition and Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>

Abstract
Pulsed ultrasonic irradiation with on&#8208;off modulation remarkably enhances asymmetric noncovalent organocatalysis &#8220;on water&#8221;, specifically for Michael addition and Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. This approach effectively addresses challenges associated with solid reactant dispersion encountered in &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221; reactions and mitigates overheating issues caused by continuous ultrasound exposure, thereby significantly augmenting reaction rates and stereoselectivities.

         <title>Ambiphilic Reactivity of SF5&#8208;Alkynes Applied to Regioselective and Stereodivergent Halogenation Reactions: An Experimental and Theoretical Case Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We explored the ambiphilic reactivity of SF5&#8208;alkynes, and we proved they can act as both nucleophiles and electrophiles. We selected halogenation reactions as benchmark reactions and developed highly selective stereodivergent hydrohalogenation (I, Br, Cl, F) reactions of SF5&#8208;alkynes. The stereochemistry is finely controlled thanks to the nature of the acids used (strong or soft) in the presence of halide source, while the high regioselectivity is governed by the strong polarization of SF5&#8208;alkynes. Mechanistic studies supported by DFT calculations shed light on two different reaction mechanisms responsible of the excellent stereocontrol. This stereoselectivity was quantitatively rationalized with the ASM and EDA methods. A few dihalogenation reactions are reported and DFT calculations rationalize this cis&#8208;stereoselectivity. Relative configuration of all the SF5&#8208;haloalkenes was unambiguously determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Noteworthy, several post&#8208;functionalization reactions such as cross&#8208;couplings, cyanation and reductions are described to strengthen the synthetic potential.

         <title>Stereoselective Access to &#946;&#8208;gem&#8208;Difluorinated Alcohols Through Enzymatic Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We report here a mild process to access diversely functionalized enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluorinated (S)&#8208;alcohols by using biocatalytic reduction in &gt;99% yield and enantiomeric excesses ranging from 96% to &gt;99%. This novel approach involves enzymatic reduction of &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluorinated heterocyclic and carbocyclic ketone derivatives as well as an acyclic gem&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;ketosulfone and proceeds under mild conditions at 30&#8201;&#176;C under aqueous conditions to produce a range of high added value enantioenriched difluorinated alcohols including 3,3&#8208;difluorochromanol, 3,3&#8208;difluorothiochromanol, 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;dihydroquinolinol, and &#945;&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfone derivatives. A comparative study between enzymatic reduction and metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation was carried out as well.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Formation of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes Using Oxime Esters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
In this manuscript a general photocatalytic approach for the synthesis of alkyl&#8208;substituted gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes using readily available oxime esters and 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoroprop&#8208;2&#8208;ene (BDFP) has been established. This strategy involving a radical bromo elimination provides access to a large variety of value&#8208;added fluorinated molecules. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with many functional groups including complex natural products or drug molecules. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic investigations indicate that the efficiency of the process relies on the crucial role of imine radical, which is formed after photoexcitation via energy transfert (EnT) and decarboxylation of the oxime ester. Indeed, the imine radical would either behave as a bromine radical scavenger or an XAT promoter in this reaction.

         <title>TBHP&#8208;Mediated Hydroxyperfluoroalkylation of Alkenes with Perfluoroalkyl Iodides to Construct &#946;&#8208;Perfluoroalkyl Alcohols</title>

Abstract
A three&#8208;component strategy for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl allyl alcohols from 1,3&#8208;dienes is developed. A diverse range of synthetically valuable &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl allyl alcohols are obtained in moderate to high yields. Broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance are observed. This method is also applicable to mono&#8208;olefins and 1,3&#8208;enynes. The control experiment results demonstrate that the hydroxyl group OH in the product comes from TBHP. In addition, the practicality and mild reaction conditions make these synthetic transformations attractive and valuable for organic synthesis.

Abstract
A scalable procedure for the synthesis of 4,6&#8208;difluorotryptophan is reported based on a deaminative coupling of a 4,6&#8208;difluorogramine with 2&#8208;benzylthio&#8208;1,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;imidazolone as glycine equivalent. Thus prepared 4,6&#8208;difluorotryptophan was incorporated into the C&#8208;terminal domain of the HIV&#8208;1 capsid protein (CA&#8208;CTD), and 19F spectra of the 4,6&#8208;difluoro Trp CA CTD were recorded and compared to the singly fluorinated counterparts.

Abstract
We report herein a palladium&#8208;catalyzed, site&#8208;selective cyclative annulation of o&#8208;alkynyl arylamides with maleimide for the stereoselective construction of succinimide&#8208;fused benzoxazine derivatives. This operationally simple and modular protocol provides access to polycyclic frameworks. The other associated features are high functional group compatibility, gram&#8208;scale synthetic potential, and downstream transformations. Control and labeling experiments were conducted to get insights into the mechanism.

Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric dearomative arylation of 2&#8208;naphthols enabled by the unconventional reactivity of o&#8208;quinone diimides, i.&#8201;e. the 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition on quinone sp2 hybridized carbon, has been established. Under the catalysis of chiral phosphoric acid, various cyclohexaenones bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter have been prepared with excellent yields and enantioselectivities.

Abstract
The direct diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective Ru(II)&#8208; catalyzed cyclopropanation reaction of alkenes with ((2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoroethyl)sulfinyl)benzene was described. The desired enantioenriched PhSO2CF2&#8208;cyclopropanes were obtained in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities in the presence of a chiral ruthenium complex Ru(II)&#8208;Pheox (17&#8211;94% yields, &gt;20:1 d.r. and 83:17&#8211;98:2 e.r.). The robustness of the approach was showcased and This methodology gave access to chiral 1,2&#8208;trans difluoro&#8208;methylcyclopropanes.

         <title>Tetrafluoropyridinyl Thiolate as a Tool for Enabling Photoredox Alkylation of 1,2,4&#8208;Oxadiazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A method for the radical functionalization of 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazoles using alkyl halides as precursors of radicals is described. The reaction efficiency is determined by potassium tetrafluoropyridinyl thiolate additive, which plays dual role. First, the thiolate converts alkyl halides into more reactive fluorinated aryl sulfides, which undergo photoredox activation of the C&#8722;S bond. Second, the thiolate decreases the unproductive loss of alkyl radicals by converting them back to the sulfides.
