         <title>Copper&#8208;catalyzed Alkenylation and Alkenyloxylation with&#8208;Alkenyl(phenyl)iodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and straightforward Cu&#8208;catalyzed vinylation method for alkenyl ethers has been developed. This method demonstrates outstanding performance, delivering high yields and remarkable stereoselectivities for both cyclic and chain alkenyl ether substrates. Furthermore, we have successfully applied this method to directly vinylate the C&#8208;2 position of protected glucals, offering a valuable tool for their functionalization. Moreover, through the utilization of alkenyl alcohols as substrates, we accomplished a 1,2&#8208;alkenyloxylation of alkenyl double bond, enabling the synthesis of functionalized cyclic ether compounds with five or six&#8208;membered rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;light mediated Ugi&#8208;type reaction for the synthesis of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted phthalides
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of diverse phthalides containing quaternary carbon centers remains poorly exploited, requiring stepwise reactions with toxic reagents under high temperatures. Herein, we describe a visible&#8208;light promoted, photo&#8208; and metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free protocol for the modular synthesis of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted phthalides with water as the sole by&#8208;product. This process featured an open&#8208;flask operation of a three&#8208;component reaction involving an isocoumarin as the self&#8208;photosensitizer for aerobic ring contracting rearrangements, allowing the convenient preparation of 3&#8208;(1&#8242;&#8208;indolyl)&#8208;phthalides in moderate to good yields. The mechanistic investigations suggested that singlet oxygen (1O2) was generated through an energy&#8208;transfer pathway.</dc:description>

Herein, we describe a visible-light promoted, photo- and metal-catalyst-free protocol for the modular synthesis of 3,3-disubstituted phthalides with water as the sole by-product. This process featured an open-flask operation of a three-component reaction involving an isocoumarin as the self-photosensitizer for aerobic ring contracting rearrangements, allowing the convenient preparation of 3-(1&#8242;-indolyl)-phthalides in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Improved Palladium Catalysis in Suzuki&#8208;Type Coupling of Benzotriazinones for o&#8208;Aryl/Alkenyl Benzamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium catalyst system based on PdCl2(PPh3)2 or PdCl2(dppf) is reported for Suzuki&#8208;type coupling of both N&#8208;aryl and alkyl benzotriazinones with aryl/alkenyl boronic acids to afford a series of ortho&#8208;aryl/alkenyl benzamides in yields up to 99%, showing improvements on catalytic efficiency, substrate scope and practicality. Scope and limitations of the improved protocol have been demonstrated with more than 40 examples, including a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of activated o&#8208;biphenyl amide. Large electronic and steric effects from the boronic acid counterpart have been observed, implying the transmetallation from boron to palladium should be involved in the rate&#8208;determining step in catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

Abstract
In this manuscript we report the synthesis of 3&#8208;amido&#8208;benzo[b]silines thanks to a 2&#8208;step strategy involving a 3&#8208;component silylformylation of ynamides followed by a Friedel&#8208;Crafts cyclization/isomerizing dehydration domino sequence. This reaction is tolerant to various structural variations and has allowed us to synthesize a library of diversely substituted silacycles with yields from 33 to 85%. We also studied the fluorescence properties of these compounds which show structural similarities with recognized probes such as Si&#8208;Rhodamine for example.

The front cover picture, made by painter Monika Tomanov&#225; and reproduced with permission, illustrates that nitrobenzenesulfonamides prepared from 2&#8208;aminobenzyl cyanide and alkylated with various agents can be converted to N&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;nitroarylindoles. The reaction proceeds via base&#8208;catalyzed Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement leading to metal&#8208;free intramolecular C&#947;&#8208;arylation followed by spontaneous cyclization. The process is as simple as developing a black and white photo in a darkroom chamber. Details can be found in Research Article by Miroslav Soural and co&#8208;workers (K. Zakova, P. Kralova, M. Soural, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2024, 366, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202400143)

The front cover illustrates pandas as gold catalysts on trees, with the leaves symbolizing reaction reagents, intermediates, and products. It portrays the 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#8208;selective cyclization of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;ynones. The smiling panda under the tree captures the synthesized 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones, which reflect the isolation of the intermediates. The illustration suggests the synthetic utility of the 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones for syntheses of spiropseudoindoxyl and pyranoindole derivatives, and implies the opening of avenues toward the discovery of new bioactive materials.

         <title>Access to Benzyl Oxindoles via Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complex Photoactivation Using Thianthrenium Salts and Potassium Carbonate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photochemical synthesis of biologically relevant benzyl oxindoles is presented via electron&#8208;donor acceptor (EDA) complex strategy. This exogenous photocatalyst&#8208;free method describes the formation of a new electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex based on potassium carbonate and thianthrenium salts for C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) bond formation. This transition&#8208;metal free reaction allows a rapid increase in oxindoles molecular complexity chemical space, tolerating different functional groups as well as sophisticated biomolecules. The scalability and sustainability of this method is highlighted by an important waste recovery protocol. Mechanistic investigations support the formation of an EDA complex that induces a radical chain, and the applicability of this method is showcased by straightforward derivatization reactions.</dc:description>

Abstract
An I2&#8208;promoted [3+2] cyclization reaction between thiocarbamates with enaminones has been developed for the synthesis of thiazol&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;one derivatives. This protocol involves C&#8722;S and C&#8722;N bond formation and exhibits good functional group tolerance. The reaction proceeded well at room temperature and provided up to 98% yield of the desired products.

Abstract
A tert&#8208;butyl nitrite (TBN) promoted visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced one&#8208;pot C&#8722;N cross coupling reaction of 3&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles with benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine was explored. Simultaneously, the indoline motif of 3&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles as well as 3&#8208;ylidene oxindoles are regioselectively nitrated at the C&#8208;6 position by in&#8208;situ formed NO2 radical. (E)&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;(aryl)&#8208;2&#8208;oxoethylidene)oxindole and (E)&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene oxindole produce distinct nitrated diastereomeric coupling products, a phenomenon influenced by the steric bulk of the functional group. The experimental findings suggest the potential involvement of a radical pathway in this reaction.

         <title>Nitrosonium Ion Catalyzed Oxidative Bromination of Arenes</title>

Abstract
A nitrosonium catalyzed bromination of electron&#8208;rich arenes has been developed, using bromide salts as bromine sources, oxygen gas as a terminal oxidant and Br&#248;nsted acids (sulfuric acid, TFA or HBr). This arene bromination process is free of transition metals, proceeding in acetic acid and under mild temperatures (25&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C) to give brominated arenes with good to excellent yields. Our mechanistic studies indicated that this oxidative bromination of arenes reaction is catalyzed by nitrosnium ion (NO+), without the involvement of Br2 or Br+. The kinetic isotope effect of this reaction was measured using pentadeuteriophenyl phenyl ether (kH/kD=1.1).

Abstract
We conceptualized a radical cyclization approach for the synthesis of SCF3, SAr, SO2Ar and COAr featured spirocyclic [4.5] and [5.5] trienone between biaryls and ArSO2H or ArCOCO2H in presence of RFTA as a photocatalyst whereas the insertion of ArSSAr or AgSCF3 devoid of photocatalyst via an energetically demanding dearomative transformation under visible&#8208;light catalysis. The photo&#8208;excited charge transfer complex with biaryl tethered ynones provides a way to promote S&#8208;centered radical generation followed by its insertion to enable a wide range of biologically important molecules.

Abstract
This study describes the palladium&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective amination of chloro(hetero)aryl triflates in the C&#8722;Cl bond for the first time. A newly designed and synthesized alkyl&#8208;pyrazole&#8208;based phosphine ligand, L26 (BirdPhos), which is featured with the pyrazole ligand core and the cyclohexyl group at the C3 and C5 positions, was key to the success of this reaction. A variety of chloro(hetero)aryl triflates coupled with aromatic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic amines smoothly afforded the corresponding products up to 97% yields with general chemoselectivity (&gt;99%) in the C&#8722;Cl bond. Drug analogs were also synthesized via the chemoselective intermolecular amination. This study attempts to investigate the structure&#8208;activity relationship of this new class of ligand through experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Abstract
An acylative fluorination of two different alkenes is developed, assisted by the interaction of silver catalyst and Selectflour. Various &#945;&#8208;ketonic acids can be decarboxylated to form acyl radicals at 35&#8201;&#176;C, sequentially add to the electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208; rich alkenes to provide the benzyl fluorinated compounds containing diversified functional groups.

Abstract
An asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkylated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated 2&#8208;acyl imidazole with nitrones or N,N&#8217;&#8208;cyclic azomethine imines to construct chiral &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkylated &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols or chiral &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkylated 1,3&#8208;diamino compounds has catalyzed by chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal rhodium complexes is reported. The corresponding products with three contiguous tertiary stereocenters were obtained in 62%&#8211;98% yields with stereoselectivities up to &gt;20:1 dr and 99% ee. Remarkably, as low as 0.06&#8197;mol% of chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal rhodium complex can promote a gram&#8208;scale reaction with nitrones or N,N&#8217;&#8208;cyclic azomethine imines.

Abstract
This study developed a method of synthesizing distal amino acid derivatives by the ring&#8208;opening reaction of cyclic ketones, following the amino esterification functionalization of both terminals. To achieve this goal, we performed the ring&#8208;opening reaction of cyclic ketones with an aminating reagent and alcohol under metal&#8208; and photocatalysis&#8208;free conditions in a single step. The method directly afforded distal amino acid derivatives bearing C4&#8722;C6, C8, and C12 carbon main chains, such as &#947;, &#948;, and &#1013;&#8208;amino esters. The obtained amino esters were simply transformed into amino acids by hydrolysis.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Vicinal Amino Alcohol Derivatives via Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Ring Opening of Aziridines with Alcohols and Carboxylic Acids</title>

Abstract
Under the catalysis of a Cu(I) or Ag(I) salt with a chiral diphosphine ligand, the enantioselective nucleophilic ring opening of racemic 2&#8208;styrenylaziridines via kinetic resolution or dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) and of meso aziridines via desymmetrization with alcohols was realized. The reaction provided a range of chiral vicinal amino ether derivatives in 47%&#8208;98% yields and with 50%&#8211;98% ee. The reaction could be extended to aliphatic carboxylic acids as nucleophiles.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the catalysis of a Cu(I) or Ag(I) salt with a chiral diphosphine ligand, the enantioselective nucleophilic ring opening of racemic 2-styrenylaziridines via kinetic resolution or dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) and of meso aziridines via desymmetrization with alcohols was realized. The reaction provided a range of chiral vicinal amino ether derivatives in 47%-98% yields and with 50%&#8211;98% ee. The reaction could be extended to aliphatic carboxylic acids as nucleophiles. The synthetic utility was demonstrated in a four-step formal synthesis of a diastereomer of the antirythmetic agent vernakalant.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Herein, we present a photoinduced deconstructive alkoxyamination of alkyl alcohols catalyzed by iron salts. This transformation involves the initiation of alkoxy radicals through chlorine radical&#8208;induced alkoxy radical formation, followed by &#946;&#8208;scission and trapping of the resulting carbon radicals with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl (TEMPO). This reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope (40 examples), including primary and secondary alcohols that are prone to oxidation by the combination of TEMPO and iron. Mechanistic investigations have revealed that enhanced coordination of the chloride ion with the iron center inhibits the OH oxidation process, thereby enabling the tolerance of primary and secondary alcohols.

         <title>Organocatalytic Activation of Pyruvates Toward Michael Addition to Nitroalkenes: Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) Derivatives</title>

Abstract
Despite the significant role of pyruvic acid in biotransformations, the utilization of pyruvates in the field of catalytic asymmetric synthesis has been unexpectedly limited. This statement also applies to enamine catalysis, in which pyruvates seem to be challenging substrates. Recently, the first illustration of the asymmetric addition of pyruvic acid to &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes, catalyzed by a NahE enzyme using the enamine mechanism, has appeared in the literature. Now, we demonstrate pyrrolidine&#8208;based catalyst can mimick enamine mechanism used by this enzyme to activate pyruvates in the asymmetric addition to structurally diverse nitroalkenes to produce highly enantioenriched Michael adducts without the limitations in substrate structures associated with biocatalysts. In addition to confirming that optically pure pyrrolidines can serve as ultimately small organic catalysts in pyruvate activation, we present an exceedingly simple and versatile method for the synthesis of optically pure &#947;&#8208;nitro acids, which are precursors for well&#8208;known active pharmaceutical ingredients namely GABA derivatives

Abstract
A method for the asymmetric synthesis of phthalides containing a stereogenic &#947;&#8208;carbon has been described. The protocol, based on the arylogous Michael addition to chiral alkenoyl oxazolidinones catalyzed by a crown ether under phase&#8208;transfer conditions does not require anhydrous conditions and uses commercially available materials. A complete syn&#8208;stereocontrol is achieved and facial diastereoselectivities are moderate to excellent (62:38 to 99:1 dr). Purification of the major diastereomer by chromatography and selective cleavage of the chiral auxiliary affords enantiopure Michael products. The protocol has been applied to the formal synthesis of escitalopram.

This front cover illustrates the palladium&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective amination of chloro(hetero)aryl triflates using alkyl&#8208;pyrazole&#8208;based phosphine ligands. The sea hawk, or osprey, depicted in the picture symbolizes the accuracy of this reaction, much like the bird&#8216;s skill in catching its prey. The alkyl&#8208;pyrazolyl&#8208;phosphine ligand plays a crucial role, demonstrating remarkable selectivity and reactivity towards the C&#8722;Cl bond within chloro(hetero)aryltriflates. This enables the palladium&#8208;catalyzed amination reaction to proceed with broadening substrate scope. Details can be found in the Research Article by Chau Ming So and co&#8208;workers (C. Gu, O.

Abstract
Pyridines and quinolines substituted with sulfur&#8208;containing functional groups are widely used as drugs, drug candidates, organic materials, N,S&#8208;ligands and others. Traditional synthetic routes to produce these compounds are based on nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions of (pseudo)halopyridines. While effective in many cases, both approaches are limited due to using forcing conditions and expensive, specifically designed catalytic systems. In the last decade, a number of innovative methods for the functionalization of the pyridine ring via the formation of a C&#8722;S bond have been developed. Most of these methods proceed through the direct or indirect C&#8722;H functionalization of unfunctionalized pyridines, thus avoiding the use of oftentimes not readily available halopyridines as the starting materials. Deoxygenative C&#8722;H functionalization of pyridine&#8208;N&#8208;oxides and deaminative transformation of aminopyridines have been also employed for the introduction of diverse organosulfur functionality into the pyridine ring. All these processes can be easily performed under mild conditions, typically affording value pyridines and quinolines in good to high yields. Usually being highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective, these methods allow the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules including drugs and natural products. In this Review, we summarize the most recent synthetic methods for functionalization of pyridines and fused pyridines with sulfur&#8208;containing functional groups reported mostly since 2018. For a better understanding of the processes, the mechanisms of the described reactions are briefly discussed.

Abstract
Due to amine derivatives widely existing in numerous clinical medicines and bioactive compounds, their synthesis has received considerable attention over the past few decades. Traditional methods for the synthesis of amine derivatives largely relied on the reduction of nitroarenes, amides, hydrazines, nitriles, and azides. Recently, the discovery of 2&#8208;azaallyl anions as super&#8208;electron&#8208;donors (SEDs) has opened up new possibilities for the construction of diverse carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds through radical coupling strategies. This breakthrough highlights the potential of generating 2&#8208;azaallyl radicals as versatile intermediates in organic synthesis. Then, hydrolysis of the coupling product can easily separate the corresponding amine derivatives. Thus, tremendous attention has been paid to the C&#8722;H functionalization of ketimines as an alternative strategy for the synthesis of amine derivatives. Herein, we comprehensively summarize the recent progress in radical coupling strategies enabled by 2&#8208;azaallyl anions as SEDs. Their proposed mechanistic pathways, advantages, and limitations are also discussed in detail. 1. Introduction 2. C&#8722;C Bond Formation 2.1. Vinylation of Ketimines 2.2. Arylation of Ketimines 2.3. Alkylation of Ketimines 2.3.1. Methylation of Ketimines 2.3.2. Other Alkylation of Ketimines 3. C&#8722;X Bond Formation 3.1. C&#8722;P and C&#8722;S Bonds Formation 3.2.

Abstract
Recently, C&#8208;glycosidic bonds have emerged as pivotal elementary units present in many naturally occurring alkaloids as well as in pharmaceutically active molecules. Because of the stability and great utility of C&#8208;glycosides, synthetic approaches en route to the C&#8722;C bond formation have gradually become a center of attraction in carbohydrate chemistry. Towards these researches, C&#8208;glycosylation with heteroaryl moieties like indole, and tryptophan can remarkably expand the functional and structural evolution, which has great value for medicinal chemists and chemical biologists. The indolyl and tryptophan&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides have unique structures and biological activities that have attracted a number of synthetic studies. Therefore, these motifs have possessed an extensive interest in the direction of efficient synthesis. Herein, this review systematically summarizes the classical approaches to C&#8208;heteroaryl glycosides mainly focusing on indole and tryptophan synthesis. Furthermore, highlighted the recently developed metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization and photoinduced cross&#8208;coupling strategies that aim to control the regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity of the reaction in carbohydrate chemistry. In view of reaction type, mechanism, and status, this review will cover the synthesis of indole and tryptophan C&#8208;heteroaryl glycosides with diverse regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity from four perspectives which include a) conventional approach, b) heterocyclization and C&#8208;glycosylation sequence, c) metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization, and d) photoinduced cross&#8208;coupling. 1.

Abstract
A photoredox/copper co&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening cross&#8208;coupling of aryl azides with cyclopropanols has been developed with fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 as the photocatalyst. The reaction involves intermediacy of the anilino radical generated through reduction of the azido group by fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3* and [CuII]&#8208;enabled oxidative ring&#8208;opening of the cyclopropanol. An array of &#946;&#8208;aminoketone compounds were synthesized under redox&#8208;neutral conditions by using this method.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Arylsilanes via Barbier&#8208;Type Reaction between Aryl Halides and Chlorosilanes with Magnesium</title>

Abstract
The reaction of chlorosilanes with organometallic reagents is an old and well&#8208;developed approach to organosilicon compounds, however, its application was limited due to the sensitivity of organometallic reagents to air, water. Here we display a mechanochemical access to arylsilanes via Barbier&#8208;type reaction of chlorosilanes with aryl halide with magnesium. By treatment of the two halides with Mg powder under electromagnetic milling, a series of arylsilanes are obtained within 15 minutes. Taking the advantages of the electromagnetic milling, this protocol features transition&#8208;metal free, good functional group tolerance, air stable and mild conditions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction of chlorosilanes with organometallic reagents is an old and well-developed approach to organosilicon compounds, however, its application was limited due to the sensitivity of organometallic reagents to air, water. Here we display a mechanochemical access to arylsilanes via Barbier-type reaction of chlorosilanes with aryl halide with magnesium. By treatment of the two halides with Mg powder under electromagnetic milling, a series of arylsilanes are obtained within 15 minutes. Taking the advantages of the electromagnetic milling, this protocol features transition-metal free, good functional group tolerance, air stable and mild conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Mn(II)&#8208;catalyzed alkylations of methyl N&#8208;heteroarenes was reported via borrowing hydrogen strategy with alcohols as the alkylating reagent. The developed geometry&#8208;constrained benzimidazole&#8208;iminopyridyl ligand played a key role in promoting the transformation and stablizing the metal center. A wide range of alcohols (aromatic, heteroaromatic and aliphatic) and methyl N&#8208;Heteroarenes could be able to apply in the current catalytic system, with TON up to 7400.

Abstract
Benzostannoles were synthesized from commercially available and easily accessible substrates. The ring construction proceeds via an Al&#8722;Li&#8208;dimetal intermediate generated in&#8197;situ from 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;(silylethynyl)benzenes. This methodology provided various 2&#8208;silylbenzostannoles in 32% to 97% yields. The benzostannoles obtained were converted into dibenzofulvenes by treatment with 1,2&#8208;dibromobenzenes in the presence of a Pd catalyst. This transformation yielded various types of symmetrical and unsymmetrical dibenzofulvenes, with combination of the benzostannoles and 1,2&#8208;dibromobenzenes.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Sonogashira Couplings: Extending the Reaction Scope to Aryl Bromides and Chlorides</title>

Abstract
The alkyne motif is present in several naturally occurring molecules and specialty chemicals. The Sonogashira reaction is recognized as one of the most exploited methods for the synthesis of substituted alkynes. While palladium catalysts have been traditionally employed, recent efforts have been directed towards developing alternatives based on Earth&#8208;abundant metals such as nickel. However, nickel&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira couplings still present important substrate limitations. While more reactive aryl iodides have been well documented, the coupling of more challenging yet cost&#8208;effective aryl bromides and chlorides lags significantly behind. Herein, we present a method for the nickel&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling of aryl bromides and chlorides, whose discovery was accelerated thanks to high&#8208;throughput experimentation. Fine&#8208;tuning of the bipyridine ligand was essential to activate chemoselectively C(sp2)&#8722;Br or C(sp2)&#8722;Cl bonds. A wide range of functionally diverse alkynes, including examples of active ingredients and their intermediates, were accessed in a single step and with yields up to 98%. The developed methodology is expected to be widely adopted by academia and industry, marking a step forward in the field of base metal catalysis.

Abstract
Herein we report a method for the synthesis of thioethers by forging C(aryl)&#8208;S bond via an aryne mechanism. The active aryne species can be generated from o&#8208;diiodoarenes and NaH in THF at room temperature, then lead to the arylations of a wide range of aryl thiols and thioureas. Different from transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, no disubstituted byproduct is formed in our protocol. The o&#8208;iodoaryl thioether products are intermediates that could be transformed into pharmaceutically interesting molecules.

Abstract
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component sulfonaminoformyloxylation reaction between alkenes, N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts and DMF has been developed, which avoids the usage of erosive formic acid as the formyloxylation reagent. Besides DMF, alkyl and aryl carboxylic acids proved to be feasible nucleophiles to afford various &#946;&#8208;amino esters. The robustness of this method was further demonstrated by its applicability in the late&#8208;stage modification of biological molecules. Control experiments suggested that a sulfonamidyl radical was involved in this reaction.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Enabled Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition of Alkynes</title>

Abstract
Manganese (Mn) is the third most abundant transition metal on Earth and is known for its exceptional biocompatibility. The development of novel catalytic mode for Mn is of great significance to advancing organic synthesis. In this study, the first manganese (Mn)&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of alkynes is achieved with the aid of visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis. Photoredox catalysis is proposed to promote the transformation by in&#8197;situ reduction of high&#8208;valent Mn(II) complex to Mn(0) species, thereby initiating the reaction. Additionally, a photooxidation&#8208;induced reductive ellimination step is also suggested. This system is further distinguished by its notable tolerance towards both terminal and internal alkynes as counterparts of diynes.

Abstract
A scalable procedure for the synthesis of 4,6&#8208;difluorotryptophan is reported based on a deaminative coupling of a 4,6&#8208;difluorogramine with 2&#8208;benzylthio&#8208;1,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;imidazolone as glycine equivalent. Thus prepared 4,6&#8208;difluorotryptophan was incorporated into the C&#8208;terminal domain of the HIV&#8208;1 capsid protein (CA&#8208;CTD), and 19F spectra of the 4,6&#8208;difluoro Trp CA CTD were recorded and compared to the singly fluorinated counterparts.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalysed C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation and Hydrogen Isotope Exchange via Nitrogen&#8208;Based Carbonyl Directing Groups</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Growing interest in improved structural diversity within the pharmaceutical industry has led to a focus on more sp3&#8208;rich drug frameworks. Meanwhile, spiralling pharmaceutical research and development costs continue to require expedited adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity studies, which are heavily reliant on the use of molecules incorporating deuterium and tritium. Herein, we report a an iridium catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H activation and hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) methodology capable of utilizing pharmaceutically ubiquitous nitrogen&#8208;based carbonyl directing groups. High levels of deuterium incorporation (&gt;80% in 37 of the examples) are demonstrated across a range of substrates (5&#8208;, 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered lactams,  cyclic carbamates and ureas, acyclic amides), with tolerance	of a range of common functional groups (aryl, alkoxy, halogen, ester, alcohol, sulfonamide) and predictable regioselectivity. The applicability of this methodology was demonstrated with up to 98% deuterium incorporation observed in a range of challenging bioactive molecules such as Nefiracetam, Praziquantel, and Unifiram. Density functional theory has provided mechanistic insight into the C&#8208;H activation and HIE at both the expected site of incorporation and an unexpected aryl labelling via a 7&#8208;membered metallocyclic intermediate.

         <title>Synthesizing Silyl Arylsulfonyl Hydrazones as Silyldiazomethane Precursors and Their Use in Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A method for synthesizing silyl arylsulfonyl hydrazones as silyldiazomethane precursors has been developed. Although silyldiazomethanes are an important class of diazo compounds, their use in intramolecular cyclization reactions has not been fully explored despite the rich chemistry of diazo compounds, particularly metal carbenoid chemistry. The fundamental challenge underlying the absence of such studies is the lack of a method for synthesizing silyldiazomethanes with functional groups that can react with metal carbenoids. The method reported here provides access to variety of silyl arylsulfonyl hydrazones with functional groups such as ethers, carbamates, and alkynes, which can serve as reaction sites for metal carbenoids. A one&#8208;pot hydrazone formation using unstable formylsilane formed in&#8197;situ is key to a successful synthesis. The use of 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzenesulfonohydrazide contributed toward achieving broad generality in hydrazone formation. The synthetic potential of this method was demonstrated through the generation of silyldiazomethane and its transformation to several silacycles.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Defluorination to Access 1,1&#8208;Difluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;Enynes</title>

Abstract
Herein, a visible light&#8208;mediated defluorination reaction to access 1,1&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes is described. Compared with previous studies, this protocol employs more readily accessible acids as a radical precursor under redox&#8208;neutral conditions. Moreover, the reaction exhibits high compatibility with diverse primary, secondary and tertiary acids, especially natural amino acids and drug&#8208;derived acids.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, a visible light-mediated defluorination reaction to access 1,1-difluoro-1,3-enynes is described. Compared with previous studies, this protocol employs more readily accessible acids as a radical precursor under redox-neutral conditions. Moreover, the reaction exhibits high compatibility with diverse primary, secondary and tertiary acids, especially natural amino acids and drug-derived acids. Preliminary mechanistic investigations reveal that a radical pathway is involved in the catalytic cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed difunctionalization of olefins has attracted considerable attention as a method to construct carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;hetero bonds. Herein, the copper&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component radical cross&#8208;coupling of oxime esters, styrenes and AgSCF3 through a visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted iminyl radical&#8208;mediated carbon&#8208;carbon bond cleavage strategy has been described. Utilizing low&#8208;cost copper salt as both photosensitizers and cross&#8208;couplers, this protocol delivers diverse target products, providing a supplementary approach for cyanoalkylation and trifluoromethylthiolation of drug molecules.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Oxidation of Unprotected Aniline Derivatives for the Synthesis of Phenanthridines</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H oxidation of unprotected aniline derivatives under aerobic conditions, which enables the preparation of phenanthridine compounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the pioneering reaction of dehydrogenative C(sp3)&#8722;N bond formation from unprotected anilines under a Cu/O2 system. Notably, various anilines possessing alkyl, methoxy, halogen (fluoride, chloride, bromide, and iodide), trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, cyano, ester, and acetal groups can also participate in the reaction.

         <dc:description>A Mn&#8208;electrocatalytic ring&#8208;opening azidation of tert&#8208;cyclobutanols has been developed.

Abstract
We report a class of isolable bis&#8208;cyclometallated iridium precatalysts (ImIr) and their use in regioselective ortho&#8722;C&#8722;H borylation of aromatic, heteroaromatic, acrylic, and aliphatic systems. The catalysts consist of two imine ligands and an acetate coordinated to an iridium (III) center. The isolable character of ImIr warrants its compatibility with high&#8208;throughput experimentation, a prerequisite for applications in late&#8208;stage functionalization (LSF) of complex substrates. Initial mechanistic studies point towards an inner&#8208;sphere mechanism involving bis&#8208;cyclometallated species shedding light on the general mechanistic understanding of ortho&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylations.

Abstract
An easily scalable and highly diastereoselective synthesis of challenging 1,2,5,6,11,11b&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;3H&#8208;imidazo[1&#8242;,2&#8242;:1,2]pyrido[3,4&#8208;b]indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones is accomplished through divergent transformation of Ugi 4&#8208;CR products. The trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf) mediated intramolecular condensation of a series of Ugi 4&#8208;CR adducts generates a N&#8208;acylimidinium intermediate which undergoes ring closure to selectively afford the target title compounds in good to high yields.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Five to Eight&#8208;Membered P&#8208;Stereogenic Benzo&#8208;Fused Heterocycles via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
P&#8208;stereogenic benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles is a privileged skeleton due to their outstanding catalytic properties and bioactivities. However, their enantioselective synthesis is still underdeveloped. Here we demonstrate the use of easily accessible racemic H&#8722;P(O) compounds as starting materials and commercial chiral N1, N2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diphenylethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine ligand in combination with Cu(I) catalysts to enable an attractive dynamic kinetic C(sp2)&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reaction. This protocol not only exhibits a broad substrate scope but also provides general access to a diverse range of useful P&#8208;stereogenic five&#8208;, six&#8208;, seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered benzo&#8208;fused O, P&#8208; containing heterocycles with good to high yields and enantioselectivities.

Abstract
A range of densely functionalized ullazines have been synthesized by a one&#8208;pot Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed twofold C&#8722;H activation/oxidative annulation of N&#8208;arylpyrroles with alkynes. Electrophilic bromination at 5&#8208; or 5,7&#8208; positions of the EWG&#8208;substituted ullazine core offers an interesting single or double entry for further extended functionalization. Mechanistic considerations suggest two complementary paths, EWG&#8208;assisted and SEAr, for the C&#8722;H activations. All ullazines exhibit strong fluorescence emissions. Ullazines bearing thiophene and triarylamine units at 5&#8208; and 5,7&#8208; positions show a significant bathochromic shift in their emission spectra, attributed to the more extended electronic circuits present.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A range of densely functionalized ullazines have been synthesized by a one-pot Rh(III)-catalyzed twofold C&#8722;H activation/oxidative annulation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-arylpyrroles with alkynes. Electrophilic bromination at 5- or 5,7- positions of the EWG-substituted ullazine core offers an interesting single or double entry for further extended functionalization. Mechanistic considerations suggest two complementary paths, EWG-assisted and S&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;Ar, for the C&#8722;H activations. All ullazines exhibit strong fluorescence emissions. Ullazines bearing thiophene and triarylamine units at 5- and 5,7- positions show a significant bathochromic shift in their emission spectra, attributed to the more extended electronic circuits present.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This reaction offers a approach to generating alkylideneindolenine electrophiles via the oxidative decarboxylation of 3&#8208;indoleacetic acids. The developed reaction system demonstrates good versatility, extending beyond the indolmethylation of 2&#8208; pyridylacetates to include activated esters and nitroalkanes. Moreover, a biological evaluation revealed that several products exhibited antiproliferative activity against different cancer cell lines.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An organocatalyzed three&#8208;component protocol using diazoacetonitrile to access a wide range of cyanopyrazole derivatives has been reported herein. This strategy, which proceeds through a piperidine&#8208;catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation/formal [3+2] cycloaddition/dehydrocyanation sequence, provides an efficient route to construct dicyanopyrazoles from aldehydes, malononitrile, and diazoacetonitrile regioselectively. Interestingly, by engaging cyanoacetate and cyanoacetamide in this protocol, we could achieve cyanopyrazole esters and carboxamides.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Alkynylsilanes: A Review of the State of the Art</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This contribution offers a comprehensive overview of methods for forging sp C&#8211;Si bonds. Over time, alkynylsilanes (silylacetylenes), once considered mere byproducts of hydrosilylation processes, have become essential building blocks in organic synthesis. This literature review traces the evolution of their synthesis, from traditional methodologies relying on organolithium and organomagnesium compounds to more advanced cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving hydro&#8208; and carbosilanes. Focused primarily on the past 25 years (2000&#8208;2024), it also extensively references significant historical breakthroughs. By analyzing synthetic methodologies, the review not only offers a comprehensive survey of the current state of knowledge but also identifies areas for improvement. Furthermore, to emphasize the importance of 1&#8208;alkynylsilanes (1&#8208;silyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkynes), selected applications of these compounds are highlighted, confirming their significant potential in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic [1,5]&#8208;Aryl Migrations of Propargyl Benzyl Ethers &#8211; A Stereospecific Approach to E&#8208; and Z&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Olefins</title>

Abstract
Herein we report the discovery and development of the first example of a cationic [1,5]&#8208;aryl migration reaction, through an unprecedented phenonium ions. This reaction does not require any acid, base, transition metal&#8208;based catalyst or promoter, instead promoted by the water activated NXS reagents. It provides a highly diastereoselective and rapid access to the medicinally and biologically important tetra&#8208;substituted olefins (allyl alcohols). The involvement of an ipso&#8208;carbon, as well as the phenonium ion during this novel, cationic [1,5]&#8208;aryl migration was strongly supported by the isolation of 2&#8208;oxaspiro[5.5]undecane&#8208;9&#8208;ones. This methodology is highly tolerable for a wide range of propargyl&#8208;benzyl ethers, resulting in a selective construction of structurally divergent library of mono&#8208;halo&#8208;tricarbon&#8208;substituted alkenes. Synthetic application has also been demonstrated by converting two isomeric&#8208;iodo&#8208;olefins to respective E&#8208; and Z&#8208;isomers of tamoxifen in a stereospecific manner.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Di&#8208; and Mono&#8208;Alkylated Indoles via Tunable Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroarylation of Styrenes</title>

Abstract
We report an iron&#8208;catalyzed divergent synthesis of alkylated indoles based on precise control of the activation sites on indoles through the selection of catalysts. Using indoles and styrenes as starting materials, 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;alkylated indoles could be prepared selectively and directly for the first time by treating with a catalytic amount of Fe(OTf)3 and 3&#8208;alkylated indoles were achieved exclusively by adding a catalytic amount of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin as the cocatalyst with Fe(OTf)3. This simple method was demonstrated with 52 examples with high yields and broad functional group compatibilities.

         <title>Mechanochemical Mitsunobu Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A Mitsunobu process performed under neat grinding conditions, using a mixer mill, is reported. It proceeds in the absence of reaction solvent and in short reactions times (10&#8211;20&#8197;min). A broad substrate scope encompassing primary and secondary alcohols, as well as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon&#8208;centered nucleophiles is demonstrated. Application to the functionalization of a selection of APIs is shown, also. The developed process is amenable to scale up on a planetary ball&#8208;mill, yielding over 2 grams of product. Finally, a representative alcohol is inverted with excellent stereoselectivity.

Abstract
We report herein a palladium&#8208;catalyzed, site&#8208;selective cyclative annulation of o&#8208;alkynyl arylamides with maleimide for the stereoselective construction of succinimide&#8208;fused benzoxazine derivatives. This operationally simple and modular protocol provides access to polycyclic frameworks. The other associated features are high functional group compatibility, gram&#8208;scale synthetic potential, and downstream transformations. Control and labeling experiments were conducted to get insights into the mechanism.

Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic compounds, in particular, quinolines and quinazolines are frequently used in medicinal chemistry. Therefore, the direct and clean synthesis of these valuable scaffolds has been a great interest for many years. 2&#8208;Aminobenzyl alcohols as an alternative reactant instead of unstable and expensive 2&#8208;aminobenzaldehydes can be used in the construction of N&#8208;fused heterocycles including quinolines, quinazolines, oxazines, thiazines, selenazines, imidazoles, diazepines, etc. In this review article, we have discussed recent developments in the use of 2&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohols in the synthesis of diverse heterocycles.

         <title>Access to 3&#8208;Azetidines via Halogenation of Titanacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Azetidines are valuable nitrogenous heterocycles. Herein, we disclose a strategy for the modular assembly of 3&#8208;azetidines and related spirocyclic congeners featuring all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers. This approach leverages titanacyclobutanes generated from ketones or alkenes. Halogenation of these organotitanium species gives rise to functionalized alkyl dihalides that can be subsequently captured by amines to afford azetidine building blocks. This strategy facilitated the synthesis of a small molecule anti&#8208;tuberculosis drug. It also enabled access to carbon&#8208;13 isotopologs of diazaspiro[3.3]heptane fragments that are challenging to prepare by any other means.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azetidines are valuable nitrogenous heterocycles. Herein, we disclose a strategy for the modular assembly of 3-azetidines and related spirocyclic congeners featuring all-carbon quaternary centers. This approach leverages titanacyclobutanes generated from ketones or alkenes. Halogenation of these organotitanium species gives rise to functionalized alkyl dihalides that can be subsequently captured by amines to afford azetidine building blocks. This strategy facilitated the synthesis of a small molecule anti-tuberculosis drug. It also enabled access to carbon-13 isotopologs of diazaspiro[3.3]heptane fragments that are challenging to prepare by any other means.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed conditions for diazidation or acetoxy/hydroxylation of N&#8208;allyl sulfonamides by using Pd(OAc)2 as the catalyst combined with Mn(OAc)3&#183;2H2O have been developed. The 1,2&#8208;diazidation reaction of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond occurs in mild conditions (i.e. NaN3 as azide source in THF at room temperature), whereas the 1,2&#8208;acetoxy/hydroxylation requires an excess of Mn(OAc)3&#183;2H2O. The well&#8208;known ability of this reagent to act through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) makes plausible a radical mechanism involving high valent palladium complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;phase Synthesis of Peptidols via Reductive Cleavage through a Benzotriazole Linker</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptidols were prepared through the reductive cleavage of benzotriazole intermediates obtained from the on&#8208;bead activation of 3,4&#8208;diaminobenzoyl linkers. Remarkably, this method used commercially available amino acid residues and resins without further modification. Pure peptidols were collected with only filtration in 49%&#8211;87% yield. Only the derivatives with aspartic acid as the first C&#8208;terminal residue required sophisticated chromatography purification. Esters and carboxylic acids were identified as side products and were suppressed by additional reduction or reduction in DMF. Remarkably, the reduction of peptides with the first aspartic acid residue at the C&#8208;terminal afforded a C&#8208;terminal lactone, which could be reduced by deprotection at 0&#176;C. For the synthesis of branched peptidols, the bulky wedge structures of the branched peptides resulted in low total yields, which were improved to 23%&#8211;28% by using peripheral Boc groups and SPPS on the Tental gel resin. In addition, this method gave two peptaibols, SPF&#8208;5506&#8208;A4 and Ac&#8208;Gramicidin A, in 11% and 46% yields, respectively.</dc:description>

Abstract
A direct catalytic stereoselective synthesis of C4&#8217; functionalized furanoside and nucleoside derivatives with a tetrasubstituted stereocenter is disclosed. The amine&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective &#945;&#8208;aminomethylation reactions on furanoside&#8208;derived aldehyde derivatives gave the corresponding C4&#8217; functionalized D&#8208; or L&#8208;ribose derivatives in good to excellent yields (67&#8722;94%) with up to &gt;20:1 dr.

Abstract
Copper&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylation of peroxides in the presence of O&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;nitroisourea provides an access to O&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;alkylnitroisoureas, an underdeveloped class of nitrogenated compounds, which can be regarded as isocyanate surrogates and find useful as AB&#8208;type monomers, for polyurethane synthesis.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Ring&#8208;Opening Reactions of 2H&#8208;Indazoles with Alcohols to Obtain Ortho&#8208;alkoxycarbonylated Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A strategy for synthesis of azo&#8208;derived compounds by electrochemical oxidative ring&#8208;opening reactions of 2H&#8208;indazoles with alcohols is reported. The reactions are carried out under galvanostatic electrolysis conditions in an undivided cell without the use of transition metal catalysts. On the basis of cyclic voltammetry and control experiments, a plausible mechanism for this ring&#8208;opening reaction involving the radical pathway is proposed. Furthermore, various 2H&#8208;indazoles and alcohols are suitable in this system, giving the desired ortho&#8208;alkoxycarbonylated azobenzenes in 9&#8211;84% yields.

         <title>Photocatalyzed formation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes using oxime esters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this manuscript a general photocatalytic approach for the synthesis of alkyl&#8208;substituted gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes using readily&#8208;available oxime esters and 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoroprop&#8208;2&#8208;ene (BDFP) has been established. This strategy involving a radical bromo&#8208;elimination provides access to a large variety of value added fluorinated molecules. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with many functional groups including complex natural products or drug molecules. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic investigations indicate that the efficiency of the process relies on the crucial role of imine radical, which is formed after photoexcitation via EnT and decarboxylation of the oxime ester. Indeed, the imine radical would either behave as a bromine radical scavenger or an XAT promoter in this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral P,N,N&#8208;Ligands for Asymmetric Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chiral P,N,N&#8208;ligands represented a new type of tridentate ligand developed in recent years and displayed wide utilities in asymmetric catalysis. In the past decades, numerous chiral P,N,N&#8208;ligands with ferrocene, phenethylamine and spiro backbones were synthesized by addition of an aminopyridine, imidazole or diamines coordinating group. These chiral tridentate P,N,N&#8208;ligands showed excellent performance in the ruthenium, iridium, manganese, or cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenations. A wide range of substrates, including simple ketones, &#945;&#8208;halogenated ketones, &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones, &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;amino ketones, &#945;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, or &#948;&#8208;keto acids, &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;keto amides, &#946;&#8208; or &#948;&#8208;keto esters, &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;enones, olefins, imines, quinolines and indoles, could be hydrogenated to afford the corresponding chiral products with high yields and enantioselectivities. In this review, progress on the asymmetric hydrogenation of C=O, C=N, C=C bonds with chiral tridentate P,N,N&#8208;ligands was summarized.</dc:description>

Abstract
A synthetic protocol was developed to synthesize highly functionalized 3&#8208;furylmethyl chromones from enynones and o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl enaminones via silver&#8208;catalyzed cascade bis&#8208;heteroannulation reaction. This strategy features broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance. Furthermore, the 3&#8208;furylmethyl chromone skeleton shows the potential synthetic application value through further gram&#8208;scale synthesis and derivatization.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;arylindoles and their Fused Analogues via Intramolecular C&#8208;Arylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
2&#8208;Aminobenzyl cyanide was reacted with nitrobenzenesulfonyl chlorides and alkylated under Mitsunobu or Fukuyama conditions. The resulting intermediates were exposed to basic conditions, which triggered a Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement, leading to intramolecular C&#8208;arylation. This reaction was followed by spontaneous cycloaddition, which yielded 2&#8208;aminoindole derivatives. The developed synthetic route represents a metal&#8208;free approach for accessing 1&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;arylindoles. Furthermore, pyrimido[1,2&#8208;a]indoles and 7,8dihydrobenzo[6,7][1,3]diazepino[4,5&#8208;b]indoles were synthesized through the use of functionalized alcohols.

Furthermore, pyrimido[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]indoles and 7,8dihydrobenzo[6,7][1,3]diazepino[4,5-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]indoles were synthesized through the use of functionalized alcohols.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Progress in Haloalkene Synthesis by Hydrohalogenation (HX=HCl, HBr, HI) of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Hydrohalogenation of alkynes is one of the fundamental reactions in organic chemistry, as described in textbooks that begins from old time as Reppe's chemistry. This method, which directly affords haloalkenes in a single step, is attractive from both industrial and academic viewpoints. Despite the long history of this reaction, novel efficient catalysts and regioselective and/or stereoselective controlled reactions are still a challenging topic. This review addresses the recent (past decade) advances in this field of organic chemistry.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Functionally Rich Spirooctahydroquinoline Oxindoles via Enynamide Cycloisomerisation/[4+2]&#8208;Addition Sequence</title>

Abstract
Creating an expedient method for synthesizing biologically significant functionally rich octahydroquinoline is a highly sought&#8208;after yet challenging endeavour. In this report, we document an unprecedented approach to the construction of novel spirooctahydroquinoline oxindole architectures. The reaction proceeds through Pd (II) catalyzed cycloisomerisation and quinine catalyzed [4+2]&#8208;addition sequence to afford the desired adduct in moderate to excellent yield (up to 89%) in a single diastereomer with three contiguous stereocenters including one spirocenter. An overwhelming number of libraries were generated (35 examples) reflecting the synthetic versatility and functional groups/substituents tolerance. Further, the adduct is transformed into medicinally important fluoro&#8208;decahydroepoxyethanoquinoline spirooxindole scaffold with five contiguous stereocenters in excellent yield and selectivity (95% yield and &gt;99:1 dr) through a three steps sequence which signifies the synthetic utility of the developed methodology.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Arylations of Ketimines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Arylation of ketimines is the most straightforward strategy for constructing chiral &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines, important structural motifs found in natural products and biologically active compounds. This comprehensive review highlights the achievements in the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed and organocatalyzed asymmetric arylations of ketimines from the seminal report published in 2010 till November 2023. The review is divided into three chapters: (1) Arylation of diaryl ketimines, (2) Arylation of aryl&#8208;alkyl and aryl&#8208;acyl ketimines, and (3) Arylation of acyl&#8208;alkyl and dialkyl ketimines. Each chapter is further divided into transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions (grouped by individual metals) and organocatalyzed reactions. The covered literature includes emphasis on the advantages of the reported methodology, its scope and limitations, and the description of the transition state (where applicable).

Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric dearomative arylation of 2&#8208;naphthols enabled by the unconventional reactivity of o&#8208;quinone diimides, i.&#8201;e. the 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition on quinone sp2 hybridized carbon, has been established. Under the catalysis of chiral phosphoric acid, various cyclohexaenones bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter have been prepared with excellent yields and enantioselectivities.

         <dc:description>A process for the synthesis of aryl thioglycosides from the aryl thianthrenium salts and 1&#8208;thiosugars is achieved by copper(I)&#8208;mediated, photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reactions. The desired products could be obtained in 32% to 78% yield after irradiation with 34 W blue light at room temperature. Various functional groups, especially including halogen groups, were well tolerated under standard reaction conditions. This strategy differs conceptually from all previous S&#8208;glycosylations in that thiosugar functionality could be incorporated into complex natural products or drugs at a late stage site&#8208;selectively, which has not been shown via aryl halides and aryldiazonium salts.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208; or Acridinium&#8208;Catalyzed Electrophotosynthesis of Thiocyanato Heterocycles from Activated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While the emergence of electrophotochemistry provides opportunities, such a chemistry at this stage suffers from limited reaction types and high photocatalyst loadings. A self&#8208;catalyzed electrophotosynthesis as well as one with a low photocatalyst loading is presented. These external&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free cyclizations are enabling and applicable to a range of activated alkenes, affording a diverse array of thiocyanato heterocycles including 4&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones, isoquinoline&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones, indolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolin&#8208;6(5H)&#8208;ones, benzoimidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolin&#8208;6(5H)&#8208;ones and indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones, and the protocols are amenable to the late&#8208;stage diversification of complex molecular architectures as well as gram&#8208;scale syntheses. Sunlight could serve as the light source, and the reaction could be conducted in an all&#8208;solar&#8208;driven mode using a commercially available photovoltaic panel to produce electricity.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to 4&#8208;Membered Heterocycles via Visible&#8208;Light Triggered Intramolecular Cyclization from Alkynes: Bypassing Unfavorable 4&#8208;endo&#8208;dig Cyclization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a catalyst, oxidant, and coupling&#8208;reagent free strategy to access 4&#8208;membered heterocycle, representing a unique example of visible&#8208;light triggered intramolecular cyclization of propargylic alcohols and amines to access oxetanones and azetidinones respectively. Despite the direct 4&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization from these starting materials has proven to be unfavorable, the formation of key p&#8208;quinone methide intermediacy allows an efficient bypass for regioselective 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization, resulting in the formation of the desired 4&#8208;membered heterocycles. This mild and operationally simple protocol facilitates the synthesis of products with distinct substitution patterns such as quaternary &#945;&#8208;carbons, and enables late&#8208;stage functionalization.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Two N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin&#8208;phosphines and the corresponding ruthenium complexes were synthesized and structurally characterized. One of the cationic complexes [(BzIM)(NHOP)Ru(p&#8208;cymene)Cl2]I was employed as a catalyst in N&#8208;benzylbenzamides/alkyne coupling reactions. With this catalytic protocol a variety of substituted isoquinolones were synthesized through ortho&#8208;selective double C&#8208;H bond functionalization involving oxidative annulation followed by olefination reactions. All these products were achieved in one&#8208;pot manner without the use of additives.

         <title>Recent Advances in Radical Transformations of Propargylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Propargylic alcohols are regarded as a class of readily available and versatile synthons in organic synthesis. Due to their unique bifunctional character, the transformation of propargylic alcohols has been widely utilized as a powerful strategy for the construction of various functionalized frameworks over the past few decades. Recently, the radical transformation of propargylic alcohols has attracted considerable attention in synthetic chemistry. This review summarises recent progress in the radical transformation of propargylic alcohols. Based on the different mechanisms of radical formation underlying these transformations, this review has been divided into four parts: (1) transition&#8208;metal catalyzed radical transformation; (2) photo&#8208;induced radical transformation; (3) electroc&#8208;induced radical transformation; and (4) metal&#8208;free or oxidant&#8208;mediated radical transformation of propargylic alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvated Electrons: Dynamic Reductant in Visible Light Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Open shell species are alluring significant attention owing to their unique physiochemical properties in redox chemistry for activating remarkably stable bonds. Solvated electrons are one of them that have been extensively investigated due to their high reduction potential (Ered=&#8722;2.9&#8197;V vs SHE in CH3CN), diverse substrate activation, and promising applications. If the activating species have a larger redox potential with a longer lifetime, then the broader range of substrates will be activated. Hence, the solvated electron qualifies as a super&#8208;reductant with these qualities. However, due to safety issues, generating solvated electrons by dissolving alkali metals in an ammoniated solvent limits its use towards complicated organic transformations. Instead photochemically generated solvated electron overcome this limitation and is identified as a user&#8208;friendly, sustainable, and much safer alternative approach for producing solvated electrons. In this minireview, we have comprehensively highlighted the recent key methods to generate the solvated electron photochemically, characterization techniques, and its application in organic transformations with selected examples. The minireview provides new opportunities for chemists to understand the conceptual, physical, and mechanistic chemistry principle of this super reductant for exploiting a new photochemical route for the transformations that are difficult to achieve by other means.

         <title>Oxidative Alkenylation of (Hetero)aromatics with Unactivated Alkenes: Control of the Reaction Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Alkenylbenzene skeletons represent one of the most widely occurring structural motifs in pharmaceutical drugs, natural products, and advanced materials. The construction of alkenylbenzenes is promising through the use of a straightforward oxidative alkenylation protocol, particularly from unactivated alkenes. This is significant because unactivated alkenes are inexpensive raw materials that can be obtained in bulk quantities from petrochemical feedstocks and renewable resources. However, controlling the reactivity and regioselectivity of olefination with unbiased olefins remains a significant challenge, necessitating continuous efforts and potentially having a substantial impact on both organic synthesis and the industry. This review aims to provide an overview of the latest advances in regiocontrol strategies for oxidative alkenylation reactions with unactivated alkenes, which can be categorized into three types: 1) ligand&#8208;promoted/accelerated reactions; 2) prefunctionalized olefins&#8208;facilitated reactions; 3) directing group&#8208;induced reactions.

&lt;p&gt;Alkenylbenzene skeletons represent one of the most widely occurring structural motifs in pharmaceutical drugs, natural products, and advanced materials. The construction of alkenylbenzenes is promising through the use of a straightforward oxidative alkenylation protocol, particularly from unactivated alkenes. This is significant because unactivated alkenes are inexpensive raw materials that can be obtained in bulk quantities from petrochemical feedstocks and renewable resources. However, controlling the reactivity and regioselectivity of olefination with unbiased olefins remains a significant challenge, necessitating continuous efforts and potentially having a substantial impact on both organic synthesis and the industry. This review aims to provide an overview of the latest advances in regiocontrol strategies for oxidative alkenylation reactions with unactivated alkenes, which can be categorized into three types: 1) ligand-promoted/accelerated reactions; 2) prefunctionalized olefins-facilitated reactions; 3) directing group-induced reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
The direct diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective Ru(II)&#8208; catalyzed cyclopropanation reaction of alkenes with ((2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoroethyl)sulfinyl)benzene was described. The desired enantioenriched PhSO2CF2&#8208;cyclopropanes were obtained in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities in the presence of a chiral ruthenium complex Ru(II)&#8208;Pheox (17&#8211;94% yields, &gt;20:1 d.r. and 83:17&#8211;98:2 e.r.). The robustness of the approach was showcased and This methodology gave access to chiral 1,2&#8208;trans difluoro&#8208;methylcyclopropanes.

Abstract
A DBU&#8208;promoted [3+2] cyclization/retro&#8208;Mannich cascade reaction of N&#8208;aminoisoquinolinium and N&#8208;aminoquinolinium derivatives with para&#8208;quinone methides has been established, employing a C=C double bond cleavage. A broad range of N&#8208;aminoquinolinium salts, N&#8208;aminoisoquinolinium salts, and para&#8208;quinone methides are well tolerated, providing the corresponding rearrangement products. Moreover, scaled&#8208;up reactions and diverse derivatizations of the products were also investigated and discussed.

         <title>Electrochemical Hydroxylation of &#945;&#8208;Bromoacetophenones: Access to &#945;&#8208;Hydroxyacetophenones</title>

Abstract
Herein, a new method has been developed for the synthesis of various &#945;&#8208;hydroxyacetophenones via an electro&#8208;oxidation process. It involves electrocatalytic hydroxylation via debromination of C(sp3)&#8722;Br bond. Here, simultaneous breaking of carbon&#8208;bromine (C&#8722;Br) bond and formation of a new carbon&#8208;oxygen (C&#8722;O) bond has been achieved through electrolysis of H2O using binary mixture of water and DMSO. The protocol features easy performance, oxidant and base&#8208;free mild conditions and short reaction time.

         <dc:description>A new mode of reactivity of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;sulfonylhydrazones towards alkynes is described: ketone&#8208;derived N&#8208;tosylhydrazones (NTHs) bearing &#945;&#8208;H atoms behave as &lt;i&gt;[NN]&lt;/i&gt; synthons in their reactions with alkoxy alkynyl Fischer carbene complexes (FCCs) and only the two N atoms are incorporated into the newly formed pyrazole ring. The scope of the reaction, leading to 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;N&#8208;alkenyl pyrazoles, proved to be wide regarding both partners; thus, a variety of aryl and primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl substituents are tolerated within the FCC, while aryl alkyl NTHs, symmetric and asymmetric dialkyl NTHs and NTHs derived of cyclic ketones can be also employed. In addition, the reaction can be performed at large scale and applied for late&#8208;stage diversification of natural products. A reasonable reaction mechanism is also proposed, which is supported by deuteration experiments and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The CPAPhosAuCl bifunctional complexes catalyse the enantioselective tandem cycloisomerization&#8208;nucleophilic addition reactions between 2&#8208;alkynylenones and naphthols, where naphthols behave mainly as O&#8208;nucleophiles. The inherent acidity of the catalysts induces then the isomerization of the O&#8208;addition&#8208; into the C&#8208;addition products with concomitant decrease of their enantiomeric excesses. In depth mechanistic studies have provided insights into these processes. Subsequently, the undesired racemization pathways could be suppressed by using substituted naphthols as nucleophiles, which delivered a large series of chiral bicyclic furanes in high enantioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We described the protein engineering of the halohydrin dehalogenase HheG to enhance its R enantioselectivity for the synthesis of chiral 4&#8208;aryloxazolidinones via &#945;&#8208;regioselective ring&#8208;opening of aryl epoxides with cyanate. Additionally, we achieved the inversion of its regioselectivity and enantioselectivity, resulting in a HheG variant tailored for the synthesis of chiral 5&#8208;aryloxazolidinones via &#946;&#8208;regioselective and S&#8208;enantioselective ring&#8208;opening of aryl epoxides with cyanate. Leveraging these engineered mutants, we developed a biocatalytic platform capable of synthesis of both chiral 4&#8208;aryloxazolidinones (up to 47% yield, 98% ee, and 99% regioselectivity) and chiral 5&#8208;aryloxazolidinones (up to 46% yield, &gt;99% ee, and 98% regioselectivity). Furthermore, a collaborative approach utilizing two regio&#8208; and enantioselective HheG mutants has been demonstrated to enable the simultaneous synthesis of chiral 4&#8208;aryloxazolidinones and chiral 5&#8208;aryloxazolidinones.</dc:description>

Abstract
Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular dual annulation reaction of alkyl nitrile&#8208;containing 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones to synthesize polycyclic quinazolinones. This catalytic reaction can construct the core structure of polycyclic quinazolinone alkaloids; therefore, we also apply this reaction as the critical step to access fifteen relevant alkaloids to demonstrate efficacy.

Abstract
When a mixture containing 1&#8208;halo&#8208;1&#8208;alkyne, a dinucleophilic agent, and a base (Cs2CO3 or K3PO4) was heated in DMF, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective nucleophilic addition of the dinucleophilic agent to the acetylenes occurred. This reaction yielded (Z,Z)&#8208;bis(haloalkene), which subsequently underwent Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclization through C&#8722;H bond activation, resulting in the formation of two&#8208;oxygen&#8208; or &#8208;nitrogen&#8208;containing hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds. N&#8208;(5&#8208;Hydroxynaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methanesulfonamide was treated with 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;chloroethyne followed by 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;hexadecyne. After these reactions, Pd&#8208;catalyzed double C&#8722;H cyclization was employed to produce 1H&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;7&#8208;tetradecylbenzofuro[7,6&#8208;g]indole. Notably, this compound transformed into a fan&#8208;shaped structure at 86&#8201;&#176;C and transitioned into a smectic A phase characterized by a layered structure.

         <title>An Electrochemically Driven Oxidative Strecker Reaction via the Unique Hydroxymethyl Radical Intermediate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Alfa&#8208;aminonitriles are versatile and valuable intermediates in pharmaceutical chemistry. Until now, the Strecker reaction has remained the most efficient tool for synthesizing these compounds. Nevertheless, it is only applicable to aldehyde/imine systems and generally needs metal catalysts and external additives. Herein, an electrochemically driven oxidative Strecker reaction strategy was designed and accomplished for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles with alcohol as the alkylation reagent. The strategy is environmentally friendly, scalable, and compatible with a wide range of functional groups, encompassing aromatic primary amines, secondary amines, and even alkylamine. Utilizing the merits of electro&#8208;organic synthesis, it can be readily magnified from milligram to gram scale by simply adjusting the electrochemical parameters. Emphasized, it testified that a unique intermediate CH2*OH well&#8208;established in fuel cells was involved in the reaction.

Abstract
A Cp*Ir&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation of 1&#8208;isoquinolinone and 2&#8208;pyridones with N&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl as a directing group to afford 6&#8208;phenylpyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and 3&#8208;phenylisoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones by using arylsilanes is described in this paper. This method tolerates a series of functional groups, such as halide, trifluoromethyl, C=C double bond and offers a synthetic approach to the core structure of protoberberine alkaloids. Several experiments on mechanism studies were conducted to reveal the possible process of this Cp*Ir&#8208;catalytic cycle.

Abstract
A base&#8208;and&#8208;additive&#8208;free photo&#8208;induced radical&#8208;mediated cascade cyclization reaction of 1,6&#8208;enyne compounds was presented. In this study, C(sp3)&#8722;H hydrocarbons, including various alkanes and ethers, were activated via Fe&#8208;catalyzed photo&#8208;induced conditions, providing a bunch of &#947;&#8208;lactam products via hydrogen atom transfer and radical addition processes. Control experiments indicated that the reaction proceeded through photo&#8208;induced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) process. Gram scale experiment was also completed by using continuous&#8208;flow&#8208;photocatalytic&#8208;device.

Abstract
A phosphine&#8208;mediated cyclization of benzo[c][1,2]dithiol&#8208;3&#8208;ones and amidines is demonstrated herein. Triphenylphosphine was harnessed as the activating reagent to facilitate the ring&#8208;opening of benzo[c][1,2]dithiol&#8208;3&#8208;ones via S&#8722;S bond cleavage. This PPh3&#8208;Promoted cyclization reaction of benzo[c][1,2]dithiol&#8208;3&#8208;ones enabled to forge a diverse array of 1,3&#8208;benzothiazones in decent yields with wide substrate scope under mild conditions.

Abstract
A variety of functionalized 3&#8208;arylazoindoles were prepared in good to excellent yields through an iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H azolation of 2&#8208;substituted indoles with arylhydrazines under mild reaction conditions. The reaction underwent an initial TBN&#8208;mediated nitrosation, 1,5&#8208;hydrogen migration, intramolecular condensation, and 1,5&#8208;hydrogen migration over four steps in one pot. A paracyclophane&#8208;derived 3&#8208;phenylazoindole could be prepared in 25% yield over three steps and some prepared 3&#8208;arylazoindoles showed a different fluorescence emission wavelength and existed obvious pH conditions response. The present method highlights broad substrate scope of easily available starting materials, wide range of functional group compatibility, gram scalable preparations, high atom economy, avoidance of unstable and explosive azolation reagents, and simple purification operations by extraction, washing, and recrystallization without flash column chromatography.

Abstract
We report here a formal insertion of a metal carbene complex in a single carbon&#8208;carbon bond. This behavior occurs with the participation of an &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene complex, generated from benzofused triazapentalenes or, in a one&#8208;pot procedure, from their 1&#8208;propargyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzotriazole precursors, and gold&#8208;catalytically activated ynamides. As the result, 3H&#8208;indole derivatives were obtained, with formation of a quaternary center. A computational analysis carried out on the reaction mechanism indicates that the bulkiness of the gold ligand plays a key role forcing a conformation, which includes aromatic interactions, that favors the approximation of the carbenic carbon to the reactive site. In addition, a negative crossover experiment rules out a cationic arene migration pathway.

         <title>Tetrafluoropyridinyl Thiolate as a Tool for Enabling Photoredox Alkylation of 1,2,4&#8208;Oxadiazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A method for the radical functionalization of 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazoles using alkyl halides as precursors of radicals is described. The reaction efficiency is determined by potassium tetrafluoropyridinyl thiolate additive, which plays dual role. First, the thiolate converts alkyl halides into more reactive fluorinated aryl sulfides, which undergo photoredox activation of the C&#8722;S bond. Second, the thiolate decreases the unproductive loss of alkyl radicals by converting them back to the sulfides.

         <title>Electrochemical Site&#8208;Selective Alkylation of Tropones via Formal C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The first site&#8208;selective electrochemical alkylation of tropones is realized by reacting 2&#8208;acetoxytropones and redox&#8208;active&#8208;esters (RAEs). The electroreductive protocol enables the preparation of mono&#8208; and disubstituted tropones in high yields (up to 71%) under very mild conditions. Dedicated voltammetric measurements served for the identification of 2&#8208;acetoxytropones as a class of valuable trapping agents of nucleophilic radical species and shed light on the whole mechanistic profile. Wide tolerance towards functional groups (27 examples) and application to late&#8208;stage functionalization of a bioactive compound (i.&#8201;e. Colchicine analogue), emphasize the synthetic impact of the present methodology.

Abstract
A protocol for the synthesis of trisubstituted furans via phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed regioselective cascade cyclization/amination of para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) with &#946;&#8208;ketodinitriles has been disclosed for the first time. Various kinds of p&#8208;QMs and &#946;&#8208;ketodinitriles can effectively produce the desired polysubstituted furan derivatives in 64&#8211;95% yields, demonstrating high atomic economy and their application in the construction of polysubstituted furan heterocycles. Preliminary biological activity assay suggests that these furans have potential anticancer activities.

         <title>Ruppert&#8208;Prakash Reagent (TMSCF3)&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Esterification of Weinreb Amides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A straightforward TMSCF3&#8208;catalyzed conversion of Weinreb amides into esters through the treatment with sodium alkoxides is reported. The procedure documents a genuine selectivity for the esterification of primary alcohols with Weinreb amides featuring diverse substitution pattern. The constitutive N&#8208;methoxy fragment of these acylating agents is responsible for the unique reactivity they display, thus enabling to explore alkoxides as competent nucleophilic elements. The protocol is compatible with the fully transfer of stereochemical information embodied in the starting material, as well as, guarantees the preparation of pharmaceuticals. Mechanistic investigations revealed that under the adopted reaction conditions (NaOR, R primary) TMSCF3 does not release the trifluoromethyl (CF3&#8722;) anion &#8211; as occurs with tertiary alkoxides &#8211; but rather it catalytically activates the amidic bond.

Abstract
We describe the efficient synthesis of novel dehydroxyquinines by arylation of quincorine bromide using Ni&#8208;catalysed cross electrophile coupling. The method demonstrates robust compatibility with (hetero)aryl bromides bearing diverse functional groups. Oxidation at C&#8208;9 of the dehydroxyquinines expediently provided quinine&#8208;inspired pseudo&#8208;natural products (&#8216;quinalogs&#8217;). Investigation of the compound collection against Plasmodium falciparum revealed a new insight into the structure activity relationship of quinine. Analogs bearing specifically functionalised pyridines, in place of the 6&#8208;methoxyquinoline ring of quinine, retained activity at the same order of magnitude, albeit not exceeding the activity of the natural product. This synthetic strategy conveniently enables iteration of the aromatic component of quinine for the first time, and holds promise for the development of effective new antimalarials.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Succinimides Bearing All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Centers Using a Chiral Phenanthroline&#8208;Palladium Catalyst</title>

Abstract
The synthesis of chiral succinimides bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters at the C3 position is important, but remains challenging. The present work demonstrates conjugate additions with catalysis by a chiral 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;Pd complex (L1&#8208;PdCl2) that exhibit complete regioselectivity with a high degree of enantioselectivity. These reactions afford chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted succinimides having all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters with 40&#8211;99% ee. Importantly, chiral 3,3&#8208;diaryl succinimides could also be obtained in 35&#8211;98% yields and 40&#8211;99% ee. Moreover, the present L1&#8208;PdCl2&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition could be performed on the gram scale and was also used to introduce such stereocenters into bioactive molecules.

Abstract
2&#8208;Exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones are useful synthetic intermediates with a unique indole scaffold. However, their synthesis has not yet been reported owing to their reactivity and instability. In this study, a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed method for generating 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivatives via the 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#8208;selective cyclization of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;amino)phenyl alkynyl ketones with an alkyne terminus was developed. The subsequent pseudo&#8208;dimerization of the generated 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones and their [4+2] cyclization reactions with 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes afforded spiropseudoindoxyl and pyranoindole derivatives, respectively, in 21% to quantitative yields. Density functional theory calculations of the gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization provided insights into the 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig selectivity. Furthermore, the reactive 2&#8208;exomethylene indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one was isolated for the first time based on the results from 1H NMR spectroscopic monitoring. The isolated product was applied to various transformations. Our synthesis method promotes the development of bioactive agents and functional materials with complex cyclic structures.

         <title>Rhodium(I) Catalyzed Hydroacylation Reactions of Alkenyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroacylation of unsaturated substrates with aldehydes involving the formyl C(sp2)&#8722;H bond activation provides an expedient and efficient access to the carbonyl compounds such as ketones and esters, which are a class of important scaffolds in natural products and in drug development. Recently, extensive attention has been paid to the hydroacylation reactions of the components containing an alkenyl moiety that can trigger a regioselective transformation in the presence of a transition metal catalyst. In this review, we summarize the constructive endeavors in rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed (formal) hydroacylation reactions from 2018, and the plausible pathway is also dissected to offer some insights into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>A Solely Fe&#8208;Catalyzed Sonogashira&#8208;Type Coupling of non&#8208;Activated Secondary Alkyl Iodides with Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An iron&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling of non&#8208;activated secondary alkyl iodides with terminal alkynes is described. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions in N&#8208;MethylPyrrolidone without auxiliary ligand or co&#8208;catalyst. This procedure allowed the obtention of 28 coupling products. Moreover, slow addition of LiHMDS base allows to achieve up to 89% yields. This method enables the conversion of non&#8208;activated alkyl iodides in a Fe&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling, which was so far not achievable with iron catalysts. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest the implication of a key single electron transfer in the catalytic process.

Abstract
We herein successfully demonstrate the use of chiral isochalcogenoureas as Lewis Base catalysts for a variety of (4+2)&#8208;cycloaddition reactions of allenoates and different Michael acceptors. In all cases the same structural key&#8208;motive, a dihydropyran with a (Z)&#8208;configurated exocyclic double bond could be accessed as the major regio&#8208; and diastereoisomer in an enantioselective manner. Furthermore, these chiral dihydropyrans were successfully engaged in different follow&#8208;up transformations.

         <dc:description>An iodine/DMSO&#8208;promoted metal&#8208;free approach has been developed for the synthesis of indoloquinolines via a sequential sp3 C&#8208;H oxidation/intramolecular cyclization using 2&#8208;(1H&#8208;indol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)anilines and aryl methyl ketones. A wide range of aryl methyl ketones, including drugs and complex bioactive molecule&#8208;derived substrates were compatible in the present reaction with yields in the range of 30&#8208;96%. This protocol proceeds through sp3 C&#8208;H oxidation of aryl methyl ketones to phenylglyoxals, subsequent imine formation, and cyclization to furnish the indoloquinolines. Further, the reaction is applicable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis and is operationally simple.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Trifluoromethylalkoxylation of Endocyclic Enamides in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A regioselective electrochemical oxytrifluoromethylation of endocyclic enamides is reported. The 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization proceeds under mild conditions and employs the inexpensive bench stable Langlois&#8217; reagent. This multicomponent strategy gives access to a wide range of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;substituted amines by means of various alcohols as nucleophiles in high yields and with good functional group tolerance. In addition, an electrochemically induced C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of enamides has been developed. A continuous flow protocol using a commercial microflow electrochemical reactor was also developed with improved reaction performance and efficiency over traditional batch versions without any supporting electrolyte.

         <title>Photoredox Radical Cascade Cyclization of 2&#8208;Alkynylarylnitriles in Visible Light: Direct Access to 3&#8208;Amino&#8208;1&#8208;indenones</title>

Abstract
A photoinduced direct synthesis of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;indenones via radical cascade cyclization strategy is demonstrated. The methodology involves a domino reaction between 2&#8208;alkynylarylnitrile and N&#8208;aminopyridinium salt and captures the reactivity of in&#8208;situ generated nitrogen&#8208;centered radical (NCR) in visible light. Multiple bond&#8208;forming events including C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C, and C&#8722;O take place sequentially on 2&#8208;alkynylarylnitrile enabling construction of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;indenone core at room temperature in 35&#8211;76% yield. A preliminary biological screening of synthesized compounds is indicative of their potent anti&#8208;cancer property.

Abstract
We report herein an enantioselective [3+3] annulation of indoline&#8208;2&#8208;thiones with yne&#8211;enones by chiral dinuclear zinc catalysts via a Br&#248;nsted base and Lewis acid cooperative activation model. This transformation proceeded through sequential conjugate addition, allenyl ketone formation and intramolecular sulfa&#8208;Michael 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization. A range of enantioenriched tetrahydrothiopyrano[2,3&#8208;b]indole derivatives bearing an exocyclic double bond were obtained in moderate yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 20 : 1 dr, 20:1 Z/E ratio and 95% ee). Late&#8208;stage functionalization, large&#8208;scale experiment and further derivatizations were also explored.

         <title>Ball&#8208;Milling to Access Dinucleoside Polyphosphates and Analogues</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Dinucleoside 5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;polyphosphates (NpnNs) play essential roles in various biological processes. Access to these high value&#8208;added compounds, while avoiding the many drawbacks of solution phase synthesis, is a challenge that has been overcome thanks to mechanochemistry. A straightforward solid&#8208;state synthesis based on activation of phosphate or pyrophosphate sodium salts to their diimidazolides, followed by coupling with commercially available nucleotides, under air conditions, gave symmetrical NpnNs. The scope ranged from Np3Ns to highly challenging Np6Ns. The methodology has also been implemented using medronic acid and imidodiphosphate to obtain NpnNs analogues, some of which are unprecedented.

Abstract
We described a base&#8208;promoted O&#8208;arylation of N3&#8208;hydroxyl quinazolinones with diaryliodonium salts and sequential BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 and visible light&#8208;controlled [3,3]&#8208; or [1,3]&#8208;rearrangements of quinazolinone N&#8722;O aryl moieties to prepare a variety of 2&#8208;(quinazolin&#8208;4&#8208;yloxy)phenols and atropisomeric 3&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)quinazolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones in 44%&#8208;75% yields and 28%&#8208;70% yields, respectively. Mechanistic studies showed that HBF4 generated in&#8197;situ from BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O and water served as the catalyst in this process and aryloxyquinazolinium salts are vital intermediates promoting the [3,3]&#8208; or [1,3]&#8208;rearrangements. The N&#8722;O aryl moieties of aryloxyquinazolinium salts were found to undergo solely [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement with heating whereas [1,3]&#8208;rearrangement occurred via a radical process under irradiation of visible light. This method highlights the formation of aryloxyquinazolinium salts based on the use of BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 and visible light to prompt [1,3]&#8208;rearrangement generating atropisomeric quinazolinones.

Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate that carbamoyl radicals generated through an organophotocatalytic protocol from 4&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;dihydropyridines (carbamoyl&#8208;DHPs) can be incorporated into Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) carbonates, affording a range of polyfunctionalized scaffolds with yields ranging from 63&#8211;98%. Reaction monitoring experiments, scale&#8208;up, reuse of the organophotocatalyst, and the hydrogenation of the succinamic ester's alkene moiety was also conducted, in order to showcase the mechanistic features and the robustness of this photochemical protocol.

         <title>Visible Light Catalyzed Stannylation of Aryl Halides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A visible light&#8208;mediated strategy for the preparation of aromatic stannanes from aryl halides (mostly aryl bromides) is presented herein. The reaction proceeds under metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions and exhibits a broad substrate scope. The products obtained have been employed in the C&#8722;C bond formation via Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Mechanistic investigation evidenced the key role of both aryl radical and trimethylstannyl radical in Ar&#8722;Sn bond formation.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Oxidation&#8208;Migration of 3&#8208;Propargyl Indoles: Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyls</title>

Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds are synthesized from 3&#8208;propargyl indoles, obtained by direct propargylation of indoles, via a gold&#8208;catalyzed tandem oxidation&#8208;1,2&#8208;indole migration reaction in the presence of pyridine N&#8208;oxides. Fine&#8208;tuning of the catalyst and oxidant enables the reaction of 3&#8208;propargyl indoles bearing different substituents. The order of oxidation and indole migration is determined by the terminal or internal nature of the alkyne moiety. In addition, the process can be coupled with additional reactions, allowing an increase in molecular complexity or the design of more elaborated tandem reactions. In this sense, indole derivatives bearing an alkenyl substituent at the alkyne position evolve through a gold&#8208;catalyzed tandem oxidation&#8208;1,2&#8208;indole migration&#8208;Nazarov cyclization producing &#945;&#8208;indolyl cyclopentenones.

         <title>Catalytic Synthesis of Atropoisomers via Non&#8208;Canonical Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reactions</title>

Abstract
The Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction stands as a powerful synthetic tool for C&#8722;H functionalization of aromatic feedstocks, which is conventionally realized through electrophilic alkylation and acylation. The burgeoning interests in axially chiral compounds across diverse fields have spurred extensive exploration of this classic transformation for catalytic atroposelective synthesis. Consequently, the past decade has witnessed the rapid expansion of various non&#8208;canonical Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions, including electrophilic arylation, alkenylation, halogenation, sulfenylation, and amination of aryl C&#8722;H bonds, thereby delving into new chemical spaces. A range of catalytic atroposelective synthetic methods have been devised for these significant arene C&#8722;H functionalization. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the cutting&#8208;edge catalytic synthesis of atropoisomers through non&#8208;canonical Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions, categorized into three parts based on the type of bond formation on the aromatics: C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formations, C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) bond formations and C(sp2)&#8722;heteroatom bond formations. The richness of electrophiles and the modulation of atroposelectivity by diverse chiral organocatalysts, particularly chiral Br&#248;nsted acids, are elucidated. We anticipate that the repertoire of asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction will continue to flourish and to be demonstrated in not only scientific researches but also industrial organic synthesis.
