Abstract
Biomass has been identified as the ultimate sustainable resource for all carbon&#8208;based consumer products of the chemical industries in the future. Its catalytic conversion leads to the formation of various platform chemicals that could partially or even fully replace the fossil&#8208;based building blocks that have been currently used in synthetic chemical processes. Among these compounds, levulinic acid (LA) has been recognized as a member of the &#8220;Top Value Added Chemicals from Biomass&#8221; and has attracted significant attention since the seminal paper reported by Werpy and Petersen in 2004. This review summarizes the properties, recent advances, and developments in the chemistry of levulinic acid. The production of LA from both plant and animal&#8208;based carbohydrate feedstocks via 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural or furfuryl alcohol is discussed from a mechanistic perspective, highlighting intrinsic molecular&#8208;level limitations to LA formation. The efficiencies of recently developed catalytic systems are also summarized and compared. Furthermore, the conversion of LA into high&#8208;value&#8208;added downstream chemicals, including its role in the synthesis of complex molecular structures, is overviewed. This section discussed the reactions of LA in the points of view of its various transformations on carbonyl&#8208;, carboxy&#8208;, methyl&#8208;, and methylene functional groups. The reactions of these functionalities with C&#8722;, N&#8722;, O&#8722;, and S&#8208;nucleophiles, alcohols, amines, organometallic reagents, oxygen etc. were thematically summarized. Our review also outlooks to highlight the challenges and opportunities associated with the extensive research area of organic chemistry of levulinic acid.

         <title>Diastereoselective Intramolecular Spirocyclization via C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Functionalization Towards the Synthesis of 2,7&#8208;Diazaspiro[4.5]decane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones</title>

Abstract
The C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization via intramolecular hydride transfer initiated cascade annulation for the synthesis of spiro&#8208;fused succinimide&#8208;containing tetrahydroquinolines induced by iminium intermediates is described. A series of diastereoselective 2,7&#8208;diazaspiro[4.5]decanes&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones were achieved using ortho&#8208;amino&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;succinimide using Lewis acid catalysis. This scandium triflate Sc(OTf)3 catalysed, oxidant&#8208;free protocol leads to the diastereoselective synthesis of a class of 2,7&#8208;diazaspiro[4.5]decanes&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones derivatives with 48&#8211;98% yield in a single step.

         <title>Generation of Sulfamoyl Radicals via Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Fixation of Sulfur Dioxide for the Synthesis of Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Herein, we report a new approach for the light&#8208;mediated generation of sulfamoyl radicals using sulfur dioxide as key building block and the direct application of these radicals in the synthesis of sulfonamides. In the presence of different photoredox catalysts, sulfamoyl radicals can be generated directly from SO2 or the SO2 surrogate DABSO (1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane&#8901;bis (sulfur dioxide) adduct) and N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts as nitrogen radical precursors. Trapping of the in&#8197;situ generated sulfamoyl radicals with selected electron&#8208;rich olefins affords different sulfonamides in up to 86% yield in a three&#8208;component procedure. This transformation provides a complementary approach for the in&#8197;situ generation of sulfamoyl radicals as synthetic intermediates for the assembly of the sulfonamide functionality, a privileged motif in active pharmaceutical ingredients.

         <title>Methodology to Control the Regioselective Installation of a Carboxylic Acid for the Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Diarylpropionic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A stepwise copper&#8208;catalyzed boracarboxylation then palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling methodology was developed to access 2,3&#8208;diarylpropionic acid derivatives regioselectively by pre&#8208;setting the position of the carboxylic acid in the boracarboxylation reaction. This method provides access to a wide range of aryl and heteroaryl products in up to 80% isolated yield. Pharmaceutical potential was demonstrated by synthesizing a glucagon receptor antagonist drug in three steps (31% overall yield) from commercially available 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylstyrene.

         <title>Unsupported Nanoporous Copper Catalyzed Insertion of Carbenes from &#945;&#8208;Diazo Compounds into Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The insertion of diazo carbene into Si&#8722;H bonds with unsupported nanoporous copper (CuNPore) catalyst has been developed. &#945;&#8208;Aryl diazoesters, diazophosphonates, and unstable aryl diazoalkyls can be used as carbene precursors to exquisitely insert into the Si&#8722;H bond of silanes. A variety of &#945;&#8208;silylesters, silylphosphonate, and functionalized arylsilane were obtained in 35&#8211;82% yields. The reusability feature of the CuNPore catalyst for this insertion reaction demonstrated its high heterogeneous catalytic activity and practicality. Further, mechanistic studies revealed that the insertion of carbene from diazo compounds into the Si&#8722;H bond may include a three&#8208;center concerted transition state on CuNPore.

         <title>Trifluoroacetic Acid Promotes Umpolung of 2&#8208;Methylindole to Achieve C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An umpolung strategy for the C(sp3)&#8722;H aminomethylation of 2&#8208;methylindole has been developed using trifluoroacetic acid to induce the transformation, with aminals serving as precursors of iminium ion. Mechanistic studies have clearly shown that trifluoroacetic acid may play a pivotal role in this strategy. The utilization of readily available starting materials, mild reaction conditions, tolerance to complex functional groups, combine with yields of up to 98% and potential biological applications render this protocol applicable and useful for organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry.

Abstract
A series of 4&#8208;sulfoximinocyclopent&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones was prepared in 35 to 99% yield through a calcium(II)&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;Piancatelli reaction, including in enantioenriched form. Depending on their substitution pattern, diverse diastereoselective chemical transformations can be applied to these scaffolds, allowing access to cyclopentane derivatives. This study opens synthetic routes to cyclopentane&#8208;based scaffolds and also paves the way for the exploration of the associated chemical space in drug discovery.

         <title>Dual Lewis Acid Promoted/Visible Light Driven Preparation of Aryl Diazenyl Oxazoles from Isocyanoacetamides and Arylazo Sulfones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
While arylazo sulfones have been widely applied as arylating agents, their exploitation for diazenylation reactions has been previously limited to electron&#8208;rich alkenes such as styrenes and silyl enol ethers. Herein we optimized a synthetic one&#8208;pot protocol to access oxazolyl azo compounds via a selective domino ring&#8208;closing/aryldiazenylation sequence by starting from arylazo sulfones and isocyanoacetamides in the presence of Sm(OTf)3 as the Lewis acid. The substrate scope, along with scale&#8208;up reaction both in batch and under continuous flow conditions provide a valuable approach to such a class of heteroaryl azo compounds.

         <title>Direct Access to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated &#947;&#8208;Lactams via Palladium&#8208;Catalysed Carbonylation of Propargylic Ureas.</title>

Abstract
Additive carbonylations typically necessitate strong nucleophiles, such as alcohols or amines. In this study, we carbonylated a poorly nucleophilic urea, under oxidant&#8208;free conditions. Our straightforward carbonylative strategy enables access to versatile &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams featuring an aminocarbonyl fragment, utilizing readily available propargylic ureas as starting materials. The employment of the PdI2/KI catalytic system allowed complete regioselectivity (5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig), high functional group tolerance, broad substrate scope as well as operational simplicity (oxidant&#8208;free, organic ligand&#8208;free and base&#8208;free protocol). The synthetic utility of these &#947;&#8208;lactams is showcased through late&#8208;stage functionalizations, such as Giese reactions and peptide couplings.

Abstract
Deuterated hydroxyl acids and amino acids have been widely utilized in life science, biochemistry and drug development. Site&#8208;selective and stereoselective synthesis of deuterated hydroxyl acids and amino acids remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the development of a robust whole&#8208;cell&#8208;based chemoenzymatic platform for the synthesis of deuterated hydroxyl acids and amino acids from off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf aldehydes in high yields with excellent selectivities and levels of deuteration. The platform delivers products with diverse scaffolds and deuteration patterns, as well as broad scopes with both aromatic and aliphatic side chains. The application of the platform was demonstrated by the concise synthesis of a deuterium&#8208;containing antiparkinson's disease candidate. This platform provides a concrete foundation for accessing amino acid isotopologs for potential applications in research and drug discovery and development.

Abstract
The selective N&#8722;C bond cleavage of amides to create value&#8208;added products through a transition metal&#8208;free approach has become a significant challenge. Here, we present a method to convert amides into N&#8208;(3&#8208;acylamidopropyl)lactams through sequential amide chemoselective N&#8722;C bond cleavage and amidine ring opening under mild conditions, applicable in batch and continuous flow processes. These methods utilize bench&#8208;stable reagents and are operationally straightforward and mild, enabling synthesis on a gram scale with excellent functional group tolerance. Additionally, the synthetic feasibility of these reactions under flow conditions has proven to be highly efficient, providing N&#8208;(3&#8208;acylamidopropyl)lactam derivatives with improved yields and shorter reaction time.

Abstract
This work discloses a strategy for the implementation of ON&#8208;ON organometallic catalytic processes using photoresponsive phosphine ligands. The approach leverages on the regiodivergent reactivity of mono&#8208; and bimetallic gold complexes that results from &#960;&#8208; vs &#963;,&#960;&#8208;activations of alkynyl&#8208;substituted urea substrates, for the selective formation of either dihydroquinazolinone or indole&#8208;carboxamide products, via intramolecular hydroamidation.

         <title>Carboxylate&#8208;Directed Oxidative Annulation via C(Alkenyl)&#8722;H Activation/Double Alkyne Insertion/1,4&#8208;Pd Migration: Synthesis of Functionalized Naphthalenes</title>

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed double consecutive C(alkenyl)&#8722;H activation/alkyne insertion method utilizing a free carboxylic acid as a directing group in the preparation of functionalized naphthalenes is reported. The reaction mechanism involves a sequence of the C (alkenyl)&#8722;H activation/alkyne insertion/1,4&#8208;palladium migration/reductive elimination steps. The second alkyne insertion occurred at the phenyl ring of the intermediate generated from the first alkyne insertion via 1,4&#8208;palladium migration, which is an uncommon case in typical C&#8722;H activation/alkyne insertion chemistry, providing functionalized naphthalene products. Additionally, the kinetic studies and control experiments as well as density functional theory (DFT) studies are also investigated to elucidate the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Improving the Photochemical Skeletal Enlargement of Pyridines to 1,2&#8208;Diazepines with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
In this work, we extend the one&#8208;pot protocol to synthesize 1,2&#8208;diazepines from commercially available and cheap starting materials. Capitalizing on isocyanate derivatives as activating agents, the photochemical skeletal enlargement occurs, while preserving key functional groups embedded in more than 30 substrates. We also demonstrated that isocyanates can be generated in&#8197;situ exploiting the wealth of methods starting from bench stable resources. Compare to previous strategies, the use of these precursors prevents the presence of deleterious HCl traces in the system, thus enabling the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;diazepines in high yields over up to 5 sequential steps.

Abstract
A six&#8208;membered ring bromo&#8208;etherification of &#1013;&#8208;alkenyl alcohols using an N&#8208;oxide catalyst was developed to furnish 2&#8208;bromomethyl&#8208;6&#8208;substituted tetrahydropyrans with cis&#8208;selectivity and 3&#8208;bromomethyl isochromans in high yields. DFT calculations indicate that the NMO catalyst enhances the electrophilicity of the bromine atom on NBS via two hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions after the formation of the NMO&#8208;NBS complex.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation for Facile Access to Optically Active Dihydrodibenzo&#8208;Fused Azepines</title>

Abstract
The asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of various dibenzo&#8208;fused azepines including 5H&#8208;dibenzo[b,e][1,4]diazepines, dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepines and 11H&#8208;dibenzo[b,e]azepines using chiral iridium diamine catalysts and HCO2H/NEt3 as the hydrogen source has been accomplished. A range of chiral 10,11&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5H&#8208;dibenzo[b,e][1,4]diazepines, 10,11&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine and 6,11&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5H&#8208;dibenzo[b,e]azepines have been prepared in 82&#8211;94% yields with 82&#8211;99% ee. Diversely substituted substrates are suitable for this transformation, and a number of functional groups are tolerated. Enantiocontrol is achieved via judicious choice of catalyst, additive and hydrogen source. The synthetic potential of this reaction is explored through gram&#8208;scale reactions without loss of reactivity and optical purity and further transformations on products.

Abstract
A photocatalytic methodology has been devised for the stereoselective construction of trisubstituted alkenes incorporating 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams in 17&#8211;93% yields via a radical cascade process utilizing MBH acetates and N&#8208;allylbromodifluoroacetamides as starting materials. The reaction mechanism involves single&#8208;electron transfer, 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization, radical addition, and elimination in a cascade fashion.

         <title>Thianthrenium Salts to Arynes: Base Promoted C&#8722;N Bond Construction</title>

Abstract
Amines are widely found in natural products, drugs and pesticides. We have proposed a base&#8208;promoted method for synthesizing polysubstituted aromatic amines. The reaction does not necessitate the involvement of transition metals, provided that an equivalent base is employed. In this process, aryl thianthrenium salt serves as the precursor to arynes, which are subsequently distorted by the induction effect of different substituents. The attack of amine nucleophiles results in the formation of a series of multi&#8208;substituted aromatic amine products.

Abstract
Herein, we report a multidimensional screening strategy to discover Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor (EDA) complex photochemical reactions using only simple photographic devices, such as webcams or cellphones, combined with TLC analysis. An algorithm was designed to automatically identify EDA&#8208;complex reactive mixtures in solution by processing digital images from a 96&#8208;well microplate, alongside TLC results. The code detects the absorption region of the mixture in the visible spectrum and quantifies color changes through grayscale values. Integrated automatic TLC analysis further classifies mixtures as colorimetric reactions, non&#8208;reactive, or potentially reactive EDA complexes. Leveraging this screening platform, we have developed a new EDA&#8208;mediated approach to synthesize iminophosphoranes in yields up to 90%.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Tandem Cycloisomerization/Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction of 1,7&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed methodology for regioselective cycloisomerization and tandem Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of 1,7&#8208;enynes has been described, enabling the versatile synthesis of diverse polycyclic heterocycles with four stereocenters. This stereoselective protocol demonstrates excellent compatibility with various substituted enynes and alkenes, yielding products in 46&#8211;90% yields while tolerating a wide range of functional groups, including esters, ketones, and halides. Notably, the reaction with naphthoquinones retains the moiety in the final product, which acts as essential core structures in various natural products and bioactive compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Substitutions Achieved by C&#8722;N Axially Chiral N&#8208;Arylpyrrole Derived Monophosphine Ligands</title>

Abstract
Monophosphine ligands based on C&#8722;N axially chiral N&#8208;Arylpyrrole backbones are prepared starting from amino acids and evaluated in Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitutions. 20.7&#8211;99.9% ees are achieved in the reactions of rac&#8208;1,3&#8208;diphenylallyl acetates with O&#8722;, N&#8722; and C&#8208;nucleophiles. Ligand screening revealed that the steric hindrance from 3&#8208; or 4&#8208; position of the pyrrole is crucial for the enantioselectivity of the reaction. The synthetic utilization of the products was demonstrated by the transformation of one product by a gold&#8208;catalyzed oxidative rearrangement reaction.

In the overall process, DMF takes up the role of one methyl group in the generation of &#945;&#8208;methyl &#946;&#8208;ketosulfones via single carbon&#8722;carbon (C&#8722;C) bond formation under reflux conditions.

Abstract
The aerobic ring&#8208;opening oxidation of cyclopropanols catalyzed by copper complexes was systematically investigated, with a focus on the effect of nitrogen ligands on the distribution of oxidation products. This study led to the development of a new synthesis of &#946;&#8208;aminoketones and &#946;&#8208;enaminones from cyclopropanols, where product specificity is tuned through ligand and solvent selection. &#946;&#8208;Aminoketones were prepared in 34&#8211;99% yields by copper(II) acetate&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation of cyclopropanols in the presence of nucleophilic secondary aliphatic amines. In contrast, bipyridine&#8208;ligated copper catalysts resulted in the generation of &#946;&#8208;enaminones in 36&#8211;86% yields, presumably via the Kornblum&#8208;DeLaMare rearrangement of intermediate 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes.

Abstract
Reported herein is a method for the construction of azepino[1,2&#8208;a]indoles via an intramolecular aldehyde&#8211;alkyne metathesis of 1&#8208;(5&#8208;aryl&#8208;4&#8208;pentynyl)indole&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehydes. This Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed reaction has several remarkable features, such as ready accessibility of the starting materials, broad substrate scope, operational simplicity, and high yields. The practicality of the process and the synthetic potential of the products were demonstrated with an upscaling experiment and downstream synthetic derivatizations of the obtained products. We have also extended this methodology to synthesize a 6,7&#8208;dihydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indole derivative.

Abstract
A route for the construction of benzofulvenes derivatives through 4&#8208;Aminobenzotriazole (ABTA) directed Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions of amides with inner alkynes was developed. This method afforded a diverse array of benzofulvene derivatives in yields ranging from 34% to 91%. The control experiments indicated that the substrate reacts with alkynes in tandem to synthesize 1,3&#8208;diene intermediates, and ultimately 1,3&#8208;diene underwent intramolecular cyclization to produce benzofulvene derivatives. Furthermore, the directing group can be removed.

Abstract
The study introduces a method for achieving a selective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;glycosyl esters through the reaction of glycals with carboxylic acids. This process is characterized by stereoselectivity, operating under mild reaction conditions and in an open&#8208;air environment mediated by an aldehyde. Detailed investigations and control experiments indicate the significance of benzaldehyde in conjunction with atmospheric air in facilitating this transformation. The method's versatility is evident in its broad substrate scope, accommodating various carboxylic acid derivatives with electron&#8208;releasing and electron&#8208;neutral functional groups. The practical applicability of the protocol is demonstrated by successfully esterifying different drugs, including indomethacin, tolmetin, and stearic acid, resulting in the production of novel compounds with excellent yields. Mechanistic studies, supported by controlled experiments, highlight the formation of glycal epoxide as an intermediate in the reactions.

Abstract
A class of cyclohexenone(aryl)iodonium salts was readily prepared from 2&#8208;iodocyclohexenones and arenes under mild conditions. This novel series of hypervalent iodonium building blocks exhibits dual characteristics of hyperiodonium salts and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated cyclic ketones, enabling access to intricate aza&#8208;heterocycles. The reaction of these cyclohexenone(aryl)iodonium salts with arylamines or aryl sulfonamides affords 2&#8208;acylaziridines, while with 2&#8208;aminobenzimidazoles or 2&#8208;aminoimidazoles leads to the formation of the 1H&#8208;imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]imidazole&#8208;fused compounds. The transformation is postulated to proceed through an exclusive hyperiodonium&#8208;mediated N&#8208;Michael addition followed by N&#8208;annulation cascade.

Abstract
The development of synthetic methods for the synthesis of organic azides is highly important, given their critical role in advancing click chemistry over the last twenty years. We report a reagent&#8208;economical, reliable, and scalable synthesis of alkyl azides from primary and secondary alcohols. This robust click method capitalizes on the synergistic interaction between Sulfur Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) reagents &#8211; specifically, benzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;disulfonyl fluoride (BDSF) or benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trisulfonyl fluoride (BTSF) &#8211; and trimethylsilyl azide (TMSN3). The method offers procedural ease, accommodates a wide array of substrates, and enables late&#8208;stage functionalization. Additionally, we demonstrate the protocol&#8216;s adaptability by validating a straightforward one&#8208;pot deoxyazidation&#8208;CuAAC sequence for drug discovery applications.

         <title>Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Wavelength&#8208;Dependant Sequential Ring Transformations of Pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazolones</title>

Abstract
We report sequential wavelength&#8208;selective photochemical transformations of 1&#8208;alkenylpyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazolones to pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a][1,2]diazepines or cyclobuta[c]pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazolones. Irradiation of 1&#8208;alkenylpyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazolones with visible&#8208;light (blue LED, 457&#8197;nm) induced selective &#8216;ring switching&#8217; transformation into pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a][1,2]diazepines, which underwent electrocyclisation yielding cyclobuta[c]pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazolones upon irradiation with UV&#8722;A light (black LED, 365&#8197;nm). Due to the very narrow irradiation wavelength now available from OLED sources, the selective formation of either 5,7&#8208;bicyclic or 5,5,4&#8208;tricyclic ring systems from the 5,5&#8208;bicyclic starting material is possible by changing the wavelength of the irradiation source. The transformations took place under mild conditions in the absence of additives or photocatalysts. Mechanistic studies indicate that these transformations proceed through the formation of an excited triplet state of the substrate, followed by selective homolytic C(1)&#8722;N(8) bond cleavage, intersystem crossing, and cyclization of the zwitterionic intermediate on the ground potential energy surface. The subsequent photoinduced disrotatory stereospecific 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization of the 5,7&#8208;bicyclic systems leads to 3D&#8208;rich 5,5,4&#8208;tricyclic products.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report sequential wavelength-selective photochemical transformations of 1-alkenylpyrazolo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyrazolones to pyrazolo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;][1,2]diazepines or cyclobuta[&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]pyrazolo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyrazolones. Irradiation of 1-alkenylpyrazolo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyrazolones with visible-light (blue LED, 457&#8197;nm) induced selective &#8216;ring switching&#8217; transformation into pyrazolo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;][1,2]diazepines, which underwent electrocyclisation yielding cyclobuta[&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]pyrazolo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyrazolones upon irradiation with UV&#8722;A light (black LED, 365&#8197;nm). Due to the very narrow irradiation wavelength now available from OLED sources, the selective formation of either 5,7-bicyclic or 5,5,4-tricyclic ring systems from the 5,5-bicyclic starting material is possible by changing the wavelength of the irradiation source. The transformations took place under mild conditions in the absence of additives or photocatalysts. Mechanistic studies indicate that these transformations proceed through the formation of an excited triplet state of the substrate, followed by selective homolytic C(1)&#8722;N(8) bond cleavage, intersystem crossing, and cyclization of the zwitterionic intermediate on the ground potential energy surface. The subsequent photoinduced disrotatory stereospecific 4&#960;-electrocyclization of the 5,7-bicyclic systems leads to 3D-rich 5,5,4-tricyclic products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Alkyl Selenides with Aryl Bromides: Cross&#8208;Coupling Between Two Electrophiles</title>

Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction has been developed using two distinct electrophiles: an aryl alkyl selenide and an aryl bromide. The organoselenium compound, due to the lower bond dissociation energy of the C&#8722;Se bond, acts as a pseudohalide. This one&#8208;pot reaction proceeds by cleaving the C&#8722;Se bond, producing the desired biaryls in moderate to good yields. The use of commercially available aryl bromides eliminates the handling of pre&#8208;formed organomagnesium reagents, enhancing the practicality and applicability of this approach.

Abstract
Catalyst&#8208;controlled switchable (4+3) and (4+2) annulation reactions of Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates with benzofuran&#8208;derived azadienes have been established. Employing PCy3 as the catalyst, the reaction could provide a variety of synthetically useful benzofuro[3,2&#8208;b]azepines in good yields (80&#8211;92%) with excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities via (4+3) cycloaddition reactions. Whereas changing the catalyst from PCy3 to DMAP, the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities were switched to construct highly substituted spirotetrahydroquinoline scaffolds with three sequential stereocenters containing all&#8208;carbon spiro&#8208;quaternary stereocenters in excellent efficiency and diastereoselectivities (92&#8211;96% yields with all cases&gt;25:1 dr) via (4+2) annulations. In addition, the synthetic utility of this method was further showcased by gram&#8208;scale reactions and synthetic transformations of the product.

Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective olefinic C&#8722;H alkynylation of gem&#8208;diarylsubstituted ethylenes with propargylic alcohols was achieved to access diverse unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;enynes. The regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities were established through a 1,4&#8208;palladium migration from aryl to vinyl in the presence of 2&#8208;FC6H4OH as additive. Mechanistic investigations suggest that cleavage of the olefinic C&#8722;H bond might not be involved in the rate&#8208;determining step of the catalytic process.

The inside cover picture illustrates novel wavelength&#8208;dependent transformations of pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazolones into 3D&#8208;rich heterocyclic systems. The robot with flashlights represents how two distinct products can be easily obtained by simply adjusting the irradiation wavelength, leading to either 1,2&#8208;diazepines through ring expansion or tricyclic product via consecutive 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization. These transformations are highly stereoselective, do not require photocatalysts or additives, and can be easily scaled up. For more details, see the Research Article by I.

Abstract
Optically active molecule architectures stand as an important class of organic compounds and occupy a key role in academic and industrial communities. Particularly, the molecules bearing quaternary carbon are of vital importance because of its favorable conformation and valuable three&#8208;dimensional molecules, which frequently play a key role in a broad spectrum of functional materials, pharmaceutical relevant natural molecules, and agrochemicals. Over the past few decades, a large number of synthetic strategies for the enantioselective construction of compounds with chiral quaternary carbon centers have been the focus of a number of research initiatives. In this review, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art toward the synthesis of enantioenriched molecules bearing quaternary stereocenters are summarized, which could be segmented into four categories: 1) Construction of optically active quaternary carbon centers by addition to prochiral sp2 carbon; 2) Construction of optically active all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via substitution at non&#8208;chiral tetra&#8208;substituted carbon; 3) Construction of optically active all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via kinetic resolution; 4) Construction of optically active all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via desymmetrization reactions.

Abstract
Since the review of Yorimitsu and Oshima in 2010, the past 15&#8197;years have witnessed significant progresses in the application of 1&#8208;alkynylphosphorus compounds in organic synthesis. Owing to the reactive carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond in association with the electron&#8208;withdrawing phosphoryl group, they easily undergo transition metal&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic addition reactions at the &#946;&#8208;position with carbon&#8208; and heteroatom&#8208;based nucleophiles to afford structurally diverse 1&#8208;alkenyl phosphorus compounds. Especially, when 1&#8208;alkynylphosphonates or phosphinates are used, intramolecular substitution reactions on P&#8208;atom might occur in some cases, which would result in the formation of P&#8208;based heterocycles. In addition, the existing triple bond makes them prone to go through addition reaction initiated cyclization reactions and [2+2], [2+3], [2+4], [2+5] and [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions with other unsaturated bonds, which provides an efficient access to various P&#8208;based heterocycles and phosphorylated carbon&#8208; and heterocycles.

Abstract
Biphenolic compounds serve as important scaffolds for the development of biologically active molecules. Among the methods for the synthesis of biarenols, oxidative coupling, which directly forms a C&#8722;C bond, has been extensively explored in various metal&#8208;catalyzed (V, Cr, Co, Fe, Cu, etc.) reactions, electrochemical reactions, and photochemical reactions over the decades. While the exact mechanisms remain elusive in many cases, numerous mechanistic studies have provided valuable insights. This review focuses on the mechanistic details of the oxidative coupling of phenols or naphthols, involving at least one radical intermediate. Additionally, the factors governing chemoselectivity (homo&#8208; and cross&#8208;coupling), regioselectivity (ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; and para&#8722;), and enantioselectivity (R and S configuration) are discussed, with a particular emphasis on intermediates and transition states, encompassing various oxidation sites for phenols and potential coupling sites.

Abstract
Aryl radicals are important intermediates in organic synthesis. The generation of these reactive species via direct decarboxylation of inexpensive and readily available aromatic carboxylic acids is an attractive goal. However, such a process intrinsically exhibits high energy barriers to overcome, which in consequence usually require precious metal catalysis, stoichiometric oxidants and harsh conditions, suffering from limitations such as poor functional group tolerance and low atom economy. In recent years, photochemical reactions have provided new approaches to address this challenge. Three major strategies have been introduced in this emerging field: 1) one&#8208;pot in&#8208;situ activation of benzoic acids to generate intermediates such as benzoyl hypobromites or hypoiodites; 2) the use of specialized photocatalysts like biphenyl/1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene to promote decarboxylation through photo&#8208;induced electron transfer or charge transfer processes; 3) photo&#8208;induced LMCT (Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer) strategy where copper or iron salts coordinate to the carboxylate anion and generate aromatic radicals upon visible light excitation. On the basis of these three strategies, this review will systematically summarize the development of visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced direct decarboxylative functionalization of aromatic carboxylic acids, focusing on the reaction mechanism and substrate scope, and discuss their prospects in organic synthesis.

Abstract
Formates are abundantly available and inexpensive commodity chemical, widely used in laboratory and industrial organic synthesis. Formates are promising hydrogen carrier and green C1 source, and have also been a subject of research as SET reductants in recent years. Compared to the toxic and flammable gas carbon monoxide, which also serves as a C1 source, formates are easier to handle, store, and transport, and are more environmentally friendly. Therefore, in recent studies of radical reactions, formate is not only as an ideal source of green carbonyl, which is of great significance to synthesize carboxyl compounds with various structures, but also as a SET reductant for editing organic molecules either in scientific research or industrial production. The activation and conversion of formate, as a source of C1 or a SET reductant, is a very challenging and hot research field in organic synthesis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formates are abundantly available and inexpensive commodity chemical, widely used in laboratory and industrial organic synthesis. Formates are promising hydrogen carrier and green C1 source, and have also been a subject of research as SET reductants in recent years. Compared to the toxic and flammable gas carbon monoxide, which also serves as a C1 source, formates are easier to handle, store, and transport, and are more environmentally friendly. Therefore, in recent studies of radical reactions, formate is not only as an ideal source of green carbonyl, which is of great significance to synthesize carboxyl compounds with various structures, but also as a SET reductant for editing organic molecules either in scientific research or industrial production. The activation and conversion of formate, as a source of C1 or a SET reductant, is a very challenging and hot research field in organic synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A multicomponent cascade cyclization reaction using aryl methyl ketones, aryl amines, and enaminamide reagents to construct 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;1&#8208;one skeleton with good substrate compatibility (50 examples) has been reported. The one&#8208;pot, metal&#8208;free process formed two C&#8722;C bonds, two C&#8722;N bonds, and a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter containing a hydroxyl group. The reaction enabled modified transformation of drug molecules and derivatization of products.

Abstract
A variety of &#945;&#8208;benzotriazinium ketones were prepared in 38%&#8211;89% yields through a copper(II)&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam reaction and [2,3]&#8208;rearrangement in a one pot reaction open to air from N&#8208;hydroxybenzotriazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones and alkenyl boronic acids at room temperature. Experimental results showed that the copper catalyst not only played as cross&#8208;coupling catalyst but also served as Lewis acid catalyst to control the chemoselectivity of [2,3]&#8208;rearrangement. The reaction tolerated various linear and cyclic disubstituted alkenyl boronic acids. Moreover, &#945;&#8208;benzotriazinium ketone could be easily prepared in gram scales. The present method highlights dual roles of copper catalyst and [2,3]&#8208;rearrangement of N,O&#8208;vinyl moiety.

Abstract
Here we reported the photo&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkylation of pyridyl&#8208;substituted N&#8208;benzyl anilines through nitrogen&#8208;centred radical 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer. A broad range of methylpyridyl&#8208;substituted aniline and hydroxylamine acid derivatives were successfully transformed into the corresponding products in moderate yields without adding any base and metal. This protocol features mild reaction conditions, a broad range of substrates, remarkable functional group tolerance and simple operation procedure.

Abstract
Rieske dioxygenase enzymes can perform the cis&#8208;dihydroxylation of aliphatic olefins, representing a potential green alternative to established methods of performing this important transformation. However, the activity of the natural enzymes in this context is low relative to their more well&#8208;known activity in the cis&#8208;dihydroxylation of aromatics. To enable the engineering of dioxygenase enzymes for improved activity in the dihydroxylation of aliphatic olefins, we have developed an assay system to detect the relevant diol metabolites produced from whole&#8208;cell fermentation cultures. Optimization studies were carried out to maximize the sensitivity of the assay system, and its utility in the in&#8197;vitro screening of enzyme variant libraries was demonstrated. The assay system was utilized in screening studies that identified Rieske dioxygenase variants with significantly improved activity in the dihydroxylation of aliphatic olefins relative to the wild&#8208;type enzyme.

         <title>Enzymatic Dimerization of Fungal Natural Products Through Intermolecular Disulfide Bridges</title>

Abstract
The biosynthetic pathway for the production of natural products from various species often include a dimerization step which increases the structural variability and range of biological activities. These dimerization reactions are highly interesting for biocatalytic applications. Epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) are an important class of natural products whose potent bioactivities rely on disulfide bridges. ETPs often carry a transannular disulfide bridge and can be linked through C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds to form dimers. In this study, we shed light on the mechanism of disulfide formation in the case of the dimeric vertihemiptellides (vhe) produced by the fungus Verticillium hemipterigenum BCC1449. These compounds feature a unique intermolecular disulfide bridge which links two monomers together. Using comparative genomics, we identified the 12&#8208;membered vhe gene cluster. In vitro assays, kinetic analysis, and protein mutagenesis, enabled us to characterize VheT, the oxidase catalyzing an intermolecular disulfide bond formation resulting in ETP dimers. We showed that the CxxC motif of VheT plays a crucial role in catalyzing this reaction. VheT is an oxidase linking natural product monomers through intermolecular S&#8722;S bridges and could be developed into a biocatalyst for thiol specific dimerization reactions.

Abstract
The first enantioselective reaction of acyclic &#945;&#8208;ketiminoesters with thiols has been developed. Good yields and enantioselectivities were obtained using our original cinchona alkaloid amide/zinc(II) catalysts. The obtained products were converted into useful chiral thiazolidines. Based on experimental results and DFT calculation, transition states were proposed to explain the stereoselectivity of the reaction.

Abstract
A Palladium catalyzed C4&#8208; alkylation of indoles using epoxide as an alkylating agent and pivaloyl as a weak chelating group has been demonstrated. A variety of substituted epoxides and indoles furnished the desired &#946;&#8208;indolylethyl alcohols in 38%&#8211;87% yields. Control experiments indicate that the C&#8722;H cleavage step is irreversible. The resultant hydroxyl group has been converted to various functional groups to demonstrate the synthetic utility of this protocol.

         <title>Rapid (Deuterio)difluoromethylation of Heteroatoms Using R&#8208;22 Gas: A Demonstration of Flow Chemistry in Suppressing Intrinsic Reaction Pathways</title>

Abstract
R&#8208;22 gas (ClCF2H) is utilized in continuous flow for the installation of CF2H and CF2D groups on heteroatoms. A judiciously designed flow system suppresses the intrinsic SN2 reaction between heteroatom anions and ClCF2H, allowing for selective carbene&#8208;based fragment coupling to yield X&#8208;CF2D products with deuterium incorporation levels up to 96%. A broad scope of X&#8211;CF2H and X&#8211;CF2D products (X=S, O, N) is obtained with a short residence time of 5 minutes and scalability is demonstrated.

Abstract
An enzymatic method for the selective hydroxylation of phenols using a peroxygenase from Aspergillus brasiliensis (AbrUPO) is reported. A broad range of phenolic starting materials can be selectively transformed into the corresponding hydroquinones. Semi&#8208;preparative syntheses of several hydroquinones were realised without further optimization pointing out the applicability of this enzyme as biocatalyst.

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Benzo[f]chromanes and Hydroxyalkyl Naphthols: Catalytic Coupling of Naphthols and Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic dearomatization of arenols is an uphill task that can serve as a powerful method to construct C&#8208;C bonds with unsaturated coupling partners. Herein, a simple and efficient strategy for coupling naphthols with allylic alcohols is reported. A single Ru(II) pincer catalyzed coupling of naphthols with primary allylic alcohols led to the formation of benzo(f)chromanes, whereas the use of secondary alcohols delivered the hydroxyalkyl naphthols. Broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance are demonstrated. Notably, a high diastereoselectivity is attained on chromanes. Hydroxyalkyl naphthols are synthetically transformed into spiroethers, and dearomative bromination is achieved on chromanes. Mechanistic studies revealed the involvement of tandem reactions, a formal O&#8208;H bond activation of allylic alcohols by an active catalyst via amine&#8208;amide metal&#8208;ligand cooperation provided &#945;&#8208;&#946;, unsaturated carbonyl intermediates, which further underwent 1,4 conjugate addition with dearomatized naphthols. One of the crucial intermediates, naphthyl radical, is elucidated by EPR studies and trapped using a radical scavenger. Liberated hydrogen and water molecules are the only byproducts in these transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrofluoroether Synthesis through One&#8208;Pot Anodic Iodoalkoxylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The incorporation of carbon&#8208;fluorine bonds can profoundly influence the chemical and physical properties of drugs, agrochemicals, and materials. Different methods allow the installation of CF3, CF2H units and C&#8722;F bonds including trifluoro&#8208; and difluoromethoxylations, reflecting the limited diversity of reactions available to synthetic chemists. We introduce the 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethoxy group through an electro&#8208;oxidative iodination of alkenes as a versatile substituent for fluorine chemists.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incorporation of carbon-fluorine bonds can profoundly influence the chemical and physical properties of drugs, agrochemicals, and materials. Different methods allow the installation of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H units and C&#8722;F bonds including trifluoro- and difluoromethoxylations, reflecting the limited diversity of reactions available to synthetic chemists. We introduce the 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy group through an electro-oxidative iodination of alkenes as a versatile substituent for fluorine chemists. An iodoarene serves as an unusual iodine source facilitating the 1,2-iodoalkoxylation of a broad range of industrially relevant aliphatic alkenes in high yields (31&#8211;98%) showing high Markovnikov regioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative Cyclization of Indolyl Ynamides for Synthesis of Pentacyclic Spiroindolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The dearomatization of indoles with ynamides is a convenient access towards polycyclic spiroindolines, which can be initiated by &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;additions of ynamides. Currently, the related &#946;&#8208;addition initiated dearomative cyclization requires noble&#8208;metal catalyst or stoichiometric oxidant. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed dearomative cyclization of aryl&#8208;substituted indolyl ynamides through regioselective &#946;&#8208;addition onto ynamides, providing pentacyclic spiroindolines in 81&#8211;97% yields with &gt;25:1 diastereoselectivities. Moreover, preliminary success has been obtained for the catalytic enantioselective dearomative cyclization.

Abstract
A ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H acylmethylation of Trp&#8208;containing peptides with &#945;&#8208;chloro ketones is reported here. This reaction features good C&#8208;2 selectivity and chemoselectivity, making it suitable for late&#8208;stage modification of Trp&#8208;containing peptides. Low&#8208;cost metal ruthenium as a catalyst enables the reaction to be conducted on a gram scale. This report also discusses the synthetic applications and presents a method to remove the pyridine directing group. In addition, a plausible mechanism of the C(2)&#8722;H acylmethylation reaction is proposed in this article.

         <title>Arylation of Secondary Phosphines with Diaryliodonium Salts under Metal&#8208;Free and Non&#8208;Photochemical Conditions</title>

Abstract
A metal&#8208; and irradiation&#8208;free approach for the direct arylation of secondary phosphines has been developed. The reaction employs diaryliodonium salts as electrophilic aryl&#8208;transfer reagents, effecting the P&#8722;Ar bond&#8208;formation in a single step, under mild conditions, using t&#8208;BuOK as a base and DMSO as a solvent. The protocol furnishes expedient access to diverse unsymmetrical triarylphosphines and, upon a one&#8208;pot oxidation, the corresponding triarylphosphine oxides. Experimental and computational studies support the inner sphere aryl&#8208;transfer mechanism through a reductive coupling at the hypervalent iodine center. The calculations also point to a key role played by potassium ions, providing extra stabilization to the P&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming transition state by binding the reactants via cation&#8208;&#960; interactions.

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Synthesis of Pyrroles from Nitroarenes with Glycols as Reductants</title>

Abstract
A molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of N&#8208;(hetero)aryl pyrroles directly from inexpensive and commonly available (hetero)nitroarenes via reduction with pinacol and annulation with 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyls or cyclobutane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols has been described. The process does not require an inert atmosphere and tolerates the presence of air and water. This non&#8208;noble catalytic system shows high chemoselectivity, allowing a diverse range of potentially reducible functional groups such as alkynes, alkenes, halogens, cyano, and carbonyls. Moreover, this strategy enables the reuse of a waste byproduct as reactant, facilitating the formation of challenging 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyls from accessible cyclobutane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols used as reducing agents.

Abstract
This opinionated review underlines the increasing production of 1,3&#8208;propanediol (1,3&#8208;PDO) by whole cell biocatalytic fermentation of biomass and highlights how production has transitioned from petrochemicals to bio&#8208;renewables. Current uses of 1,3&#8208;PDO are listed. Some future prospects for evolving the current technology and expanding the chemical uses of 1,3&#8208;PDO are discussed, with emphasis on catalytic and atom efficient chemistries. Lessons from the success of biomass derived 1,3&#8208;PDO are noted that may be applied to other bio&#8208;based organic platform chemicals.

         <title>Combined Gold and Photoredox Catalysis: Synthesis of 3&#8208;Alkenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;Indazoles from 2&#8208;Alkynylazobenzenes</title>

Abstract
We disclose the intramolecular synthesis of 3&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;indazoles from 2&#8208;alkynylazobenzenes, promoted by a dual catalysis using AuCl3 and a ruthenium photocatalyst under visible light irradiation. This reaction proceeds through hydroamination of the alkynyl fragment. The yields are influenced by electronic factors. Control experiments suggest that both radical and polar mechanisms operate in parallel. This transformation involves C&#8722;N bond formation and a 1,2&#8208;hydride shift. Additionally, derivatization was performed to demonstrate the versatility of this methodology.

Abstract
Herein, we present a protocol starting from styrene oxide reacting with o&#8208;acylaniline and o&#8208;alkenylaniline derivatives to obtain 3,4&#8208;disubstituted quinoline and 2&#8208;acylquinoline derivatives, respectively, in 32&#8211;92% yields under specific conditions. Preliminary research outcomes underscore the versatility of our approach, as exemplified by its scalability for large&#8208;scale synthesis, downstream derivatization, and the characteristic properties manifested by the modified molecules.

         <title>Synergistic Palladium/Silver/Ligand Catalysis for C&#8722;H Alkenylation of 2,1,3&#8208;Benzofused Heterodiazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The combination of palladium and silver complexes has emerged as a bimetallic catalytic system in C&#8722;H activation, frequently outperforming palladium&#8208;only systems. Beyond the conventional roles of silver (I) salts serving as oxidants, halide scavengers, and Lewis acids, Pd&#8722;Ag bimetallic synergism has been shown to facilitate C&#8722;H cleavage. In this study, we explore the incorporation of a pyrazolopyridone (PzPyOH) ligand into a Pd&#8722;Ag bimetallic catalytic system, which together promote both C&#8722;H cleavage and migratory insertion processes. This synergistic approach enables dehydrogenative C&#8722;H alkenylations at the C4 position of 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole, 2,1,3&#8208;benzoxadiazole, and 2,1,3&#8208;benzotriazole with alkenes. These results demonstrate the potential of combining novel ligands with heterobimetallic systems to facilitate other elementary steps beyond C&#8722;H cleavage, suggesting their broader applicability in C&#8722;H functionalization.

Abstract
Difuropyridines have been prepared from aldehydes and chitin&#8208;derived 3&#8208;acetamidofuran (3AF) under acid&#8208;catalyzed conditions. Difuropyridines were comprehensively synthesized for the first time. The synthesized difuropyridines can be applied to prepare fluorescent probe analogs or catalyze decarboxylative reactions as photocatalysts.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Nitro Compounds with Grignard and Organozinc Reagents for Synthesis of Functionalized Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The treatment of nitro compounds with Grignard reagents in the presence of a catalytic amount of FeCl2/t&#8208;BuMgCl produced various types of secondary amines in good yields. This reductive coupling most likely involves the compatibility of functional groups such as chlorine, benzyl ether, olefin, and acetylene. Moreover, the corresponding poly&#8208;substituted amines were not observed under these conditions. When the Grignard reagents were replaced with organozinc reagents, functionalized secondary amines containing ester and nitrile groups were obtained in good yields.

         <title>Recent Advances in Organocatalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring represents an attractive yet challenging synthetic targets in the field of organic synthesis, especially in a stereocontrolled fashion. Over the past two decades, organocatalysis has emerged as an enabling technology for the facile construction of enantioenriched molecules with remarkably increasing complexity and diversity, and a myriad of chiral architectures containing bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane units were elegantly assembled through organocatalytic asymmetric transformations. This review summarizes recent advancements on this topic (mainly from 2010 to 2023),    emphasizing the reaction types such as desymmetrization  and cascade reactions of different prochiral starting materials toward various chiral bicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes as well as their aza, oxa and thio derivatives.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring represents an attractive yet challenging synthetic targets in the field of organic synthesis, especially in a stereocontrolled fashion. Over the past two decades, organocatalysis has emerged as an enabling technology for the facile construction of enantioenriched molecules with remarkably increasing complexity and diversity, and a myriad of chiral architectures containing bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane units were elegantly assembled through organocatalytic asymmetric transformations. This review summarizes recent advancements on this topic (mainly from 2010 to 2023),    emphasizing the reaction types such as desymmetrization  and cascade reactions of different prochiral starting materials toward various chiral bicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes as well as their aza, oxa and thio derivatives. Meanwhile, the synthetic strategy, reaction mechanism, substrate scope and synthetic applications of these catalytic reactions are also discussed. We hope that this review will motivate further development and application of organocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>A concise and practical sustainable strategy for modular access to isoquinoline&#8208;fused benzo[f][1,3]oxazepine derivatives through a formal [4+3] annulation of commercially available salicyaldehydes with isoquinolinium salts has been developed. The reactions proceeded through the formation of two new bonds (C=C and C&#8208;O) and a seven&#8208;membered heterocyclic ring in one pot. Remarkably, use of simple NaHCO3 as a mild base, open atmosphere, nonhazardous reagents, nice functional group tolerance, and easily scale up are added characteristics to this approach. A wide range of substrates are compatible with this mild reaction system, thereby proving a facile and reliable protocol for constructing a benzo[f][1,3]oxazepine skeletons.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of AMA Synthase from Pyrenophora teres f. teres 0&#8211;1&#8201;for the Synthesis of Aspergillomarasmine A Analogues and Non&#8208;Canonical Amino Acids</title>

Abstract
The fungal natural product aspergillomarasmine A (AMA) is an inhibitor of metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamases and a promising co&#8208;drug candidate for reversing bacterial &#946;&#8208;lactam resistance. The biosynthesis of AMA from L&#8208;Asp and O&#8208;phospho&#8208;L&#8208;serine is catalyzed by AMA synthase, which possesses high synthetic potential for the biocatalytic preparation of AMA and related aminopolycarboxylic acids. Here, we identified and structurally characterized an AMA synthase from Pyrenophora teres f. teres 0&#8211;1 (PteAMAS). Crystallographic analysis revealed a unique homotetrameric fold and a highly hydrophilic active site, which supports the PLP&#8208;dependent &#946;&#8208;replacement catalytic mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of PteAMAS for the biocatalytic synthesis of AMA and its analogues, achieving structural diversification of the APA1 moiety through a modular two&#8208;enzyme system involving PteAMAS and a selective C&#8722;N lyase, namely EDDS lyase or 3&#8208;methylaspartate ammonia lyase variant MAL&#8722;Q73&#8197;A. In addition, we exhibited the usefulness of PteAMAS for convenient synthesis of various S&#8208;alkyl, &#8208;aryl, and &#8208;arylalkyl substituted L&#8208;cysteines, which are valuable non&#8208;canonical amino acids with broad pharmaceutical applications. The present study has not only provided the structural basis for catalysis and substrate recognition by PteAMAS, but also paved the way for biocatalytic preparation of structurally complex AMA analogues and various non&#8208;canonical amino acids.

&lt;p&gt;The fungal natural product aspergillomarasmine A (AMA) is an inhibitor of metallo-&#946;-lactamases and a promising co-drug candidate for reversing bacterial &#946;-lactam resistance. The biosynthesis of AMA from L-A&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-phospho-L-serine is catalyzed by AMA synthase, which possesses high synthetic potential for the biocatalytic preparation of AMA and related aminopolycarboxylic acids. Here, we identified and structurally characterized an AMA synthase from &lt;i&gt;Pyrenophora teres&lt;/i&gt; f. &lt;i&gt;teres&lt;/i&gt; 0&#8211;1 (PteAMAS). Crystallographic analysis revealed a unique homotetrameric fold and a highly hydrophilic active site, which supports the PLP-dependent &#946;-replacement catalytic mechanism.

In addition, we exhibited the usefulness of PteAMAS for convenient synthesis of various &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl, -aryl, and -arylalkyl substituted L-cysteines, which are valuable non-canonical amino acids with broad pharmaceutical applications. The present study has not only provided the structural basis for catalysis and substrate recognition by PteAMAS, but also paved the way for biocatalytic preparation of structurally complex AMA analogues and various non-canonical amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Borane&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Transformation of Levulinic Acid and Hydrazines into Hexahydropyridazines and Tetrahydropyridazin&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones Using Hydrosilane</title>

Abstract
Borane&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation of levulinic acid and other &#947;&#8208;keto acids with hydrazines for selective access to hexahydropyridazines and tetrahydropyridazin&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones has been developed. The combination of B(C6F5)3 and Et3SiH allows for synthesis of various hexahydropyridazines and tetrahydropyridazin&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones in 67&#8211;97% yields with tolerance towards various functional groups and easy scale&#8208;up. This reaction can be rendered enantioselective by using a chiral borane catalyst generated in&#8197;situ from HB(C6F5)2 and a binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral diene and PhMe2SiH, affording the target products in 70&#8211;92% yields with up to &gt;99% ee. The judicious choice of borane catalyst and hydrosilane reductant proves to be critical for catalysis. Mechanistic investigations elucidate the catalytic pathway.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Benzylation and Allylation of Six&#8208;Membered Endocyclic Enecarbamates</title>

Abstract
Six&#8208;membered endocyclic benzyl/allyl enecarbamates undergo a Pd&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylation process to generate endocyclic 1&#8208;azaallyl anions and Pd&#8211;benzyl/allyl cations. The ion pair then react with each other followed by reduction to ultimately give unprotected 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl&#8208;3&#8208;benzylpiperidines and 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl&#8208;3&#8208;allylpiperidines in 31&#8211;91% yields as single cis&#8208;diastereomers. These reactions represent a strategy to form unprotected &#946;&#8208;substituted piperidines, which generates elusive endocyclic 1&#8208;azaallyl anion intermediates by introducing the negative charge from the N&#8208;terminal.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Electrochemical Functionalization of Imidazoheterocycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Imidazoheterocycles have extensive applications in the pharmaceutical industry and agrochemicals. A comprehensive overview has been provided on the current advancements in the electrochemical functionalization of imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycles, which have been classified into ten different types of reactions. Electrochemical synthesis has emerged as a highly effective method for producing organic molecules, especially in the context of sustainable development. Employing electrons as the traceless oxidant, several C&#8722;H functionalization reactions of imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycles have been achieved at either the C3 or C5 positions. Electrons may serve as the reducing agent to synthesize pyridine rings that are either partially or fully saturated in imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines. The purpose of the review is to attract the interest of the scientific community and promote additional research on the functionalization of imidazoheterocycles using electrochemical methods.

Abstract
An efficient and operationally simple protocol to access N&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)amides/propiolamides and acrylamides via direct conversion of easily accessible nitriles (aryl/alkyl/alkynyl/vinyl) and in&#8197;situ generated CF3CHN2 as trifluoroethylating reagent has been developed. The protocol offers broad functional group tolerance under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, the conversion of trifluoroethylated propiolamide into its triazole analog via Ru&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloadditions using BnN3 clearly indicates its versatility in the synthetic applications.

         <title>Revisiting the Synthetic Utility of 4,5&#8208;Dehydro[2.2]paracyclophane</title>

Abstract
4,5&#8208;Dehydro[2.2]paracyclophane, an aryne species of [2.2]paracyclophane ([2.2]PCP) was reported more than half a century ago. However, despite its potential usefulness for preparing [2.2]PCP derivatives, this species is rarely considered in synthetic applications, probably because the efficiency of aryne generation and reaction with arynophiles are low under harsh reaction conditions of classical methods involving precursors. We have prepared o&#8208;iodoaryl triflate&#8208; and o&#8208;silylaryl triflate&#8208;type precursors and achieved generation of 4,5&#8208;dehydro[2.2]PCP, which reacted with a diverse range of arynophiles to afford functionalized [2.2]PCP derivatives, including [2.2]PCP&#8208;fused &#960;&#8208;extended polyaromatics. Our results highlight the synthetic utility of the historically overlooked 4,5&#8208;dehydro[2.2]PCP intermediate.

         <title>Introduction of Phosphinine Ring into Aromatic Systems via Alkyne Cyclization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Recently developed synthetic protocols for the preparation of &#955;3&#8208;phosphanaphthalenes have broadened the general scope of organophosphorus chemistry, but a versatile protocol is still missing. Here, we describe a scalable synthetic approach for the construction of various substituted phosphanaphthalenes. We have obtained 11 derivatives through rigorous study and have demonstrated the robustness of this method. The optical properties of these phosphorus compounds and their aza and carbo analogues have been experimentally compared. Here, we show the power of the method in extending the synthesis to even larger polycyclic aromatic systems with embedded phosphine rings toward its potential applicability to materials science.

         <title>Dual C2 Synthon Strategy for the Synthesis of Pyrimidines: Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Difunctionalization of Tertiary Alkylamines</title>

Abstract
Herein, we describe a two&#8208;component methodology developed for the synthesis of pyrimidine derivatives using tertiary alkylamines and amidines. Tertiary alkylamines serve as dual C2 synthons through copper&#8208;catalyzed aerobic difunctionalization of the &#945;,&#946;&#8722;C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. The process operates under mild conditions and uses atmospheric oxygen as the oxidant. Notably, by this methodology yields up to 85% yields are obtained and a broad substrate scope is shown. Mechanistic studies indicate that the annulation proceeds via a radical&#8208;mediated oxidation and C&#8722;N bond coupling process. This approach provides a pathway for synthesizing various heterocycles by employing tertiary alkylamines as dual C2 synthons.

         <title>Stereodivergent Synthesis of Chiral Hydrobenzofuranpyrrolidines by Catalytic Asymmetric Dearomative Cyclization and Controlled Epimerization</title>

Abstract
A methodology to access stereoisomeric sets of products bearing multiple stereogenic centers is still a significant challenge in asymmetric catalysis. We present herein our experimental studies on the stereodivergent synthesis of chiral hydrobenzofuran&#8208;fused pyrrolidines with three stereogenic centers via organocatalytic asymmetric dearomative cyclization and epimerization process. Chiral bifunctional thiourea catalyst could successfully promote the enantioselective dearomatization cyclization of 2&#8208;nitrobenzofurans with o&#8208;hydroxy aromatic aldimines, which enabled the synthesis of (3S,3aR,8bR)&#8208;hydrobenzofuran[3.2]pyrrolidines in 79&#8211;92% yields with &gt;20:1 stereoselectivities and 93&#8211;&gt;99% enantio&#8208;selectivities. While catalytic amount of DBU could induce the direct intramolecular epimerization of (3S,3aR,8bR)&#8208;hydrobenzofuran[3.2] pyrrolidines to its diastereomers (3R,3aR,8bR)&#8208;hydrobenzofuran[3.2] pyrrolidines in 72&#8211;87% yields without loss of stereoselectivities. The mechanistic pathways of the epimerization process were investigated by a series of control experiments study. This work provides an alternative and forward solution for the stereodivergent preparation of functionalized pyrrolidines with potential bioactivities.

         <dc:description>








Abstract
Electrosynthesis of selenylated&#8208;oxazolone derivatives via cascade selenylation/cyclization of ynamides was disclosed. A series of diaryl diselenides, dialkyl diselenides, and heteroaryl&#8208;substituted ynamides was tolerated in this protocol and delivered 4&#8208;selenyloxazolones in 28&#8211;83% yields. The scale&#8208;up reaction and the oxidation of selenylated&#8208;oxazolone was performed to showcase the practicability of this method. Furthermore, mechanistic experiments indicated that a cationic pathway instead of a radical pathway was probably involved.

Abstract
&#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Functionalized amines are two classes of important compounds, whose structural units are widely present in approved drugs. The hydrofunctionalization of enamides is the most direct and efficient method for constructing these two types of compounds. Regioselectivity is the focus of this conversion, and is largely influenced by the catalytic mode. Therefore, to selectively synthesize &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;functionalized amines, the progress in the catalytic hydrofunctionalization of enamides over the past decade is reviewed, and the catalytic pathways for this process discussed in detail. This account aims to objectively evaluate the effects of various catalytic pathways on the regioselectivity of hydrofunctionalization, to provide a new perspective on the selection of catalytic methods and the design of catalytic pathways for the selective synthesis of &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;functionalized amines.

         <title>[(5+1)&#8722;1] Cyclization of Nitroepoxides to Pyridinium 1,4&#8208;Zwitterionic Thiolates for the Synthesis of Indolizine Derivatives</title>

Abstract
The synthesis of indolizine derivatives was achieved through the reaction of pyridinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates with a diverse array of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;nitro&#8208;3&#8208;aryloxiranes. Subsequent investigations unveiled a synthetic route to indolizines via a stepwise [(5+1)&#8722;1] pathway, with unstable pyridothiazines serving as transient intermediates. DFT calculations elucidated that this transformation entails sequential annulation, deacylation, desulfurization, and oxidation steps.

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidation of &#945;&#8208;Substituted Amines to Lactams/Amides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
We, herein, report a base free, photocatalytic decyanation of &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles. A range of amides and lactams were obtained in 52&#8211;95% yields. Control experiments indicate O2 as an amide/lactam oxygen source and the reaction (lactam formation) follows radical pathway via dioxetanimine species. This methodology also applied for &#945;&#8208;ester/aldehyde substituted pyrrolidines in the presence of a base, probably via decarboxylation pathway.

Abstract
Germanium (Ge), a congener of carbon, possesses unique properties that hold extensive potential for applications across multiple domains. Recent years have seen significant progress in the development of carbon&#8208;germanium bond formation strategies, particularly those for more challenging C(sp3)&#8722;Ge bonds. This review systematically summarizes the recent advances in C(sp3)&#8722;Ge bond forming methodologies, with particular emphasis on (1) the versatility of transition&#8208;metals, including iron, nickel, copper, rhodium and palladium, as catalysts in broadening reaction scope and controlling selectivity; (2) the powerfulness of organic photocatalysis in achieving mild and selective bond formation, and (3) the sustainability of catalytic electrosynthesis in facilitating chemical oxidant&#8208;/reductant&#8208; free conversions. Additionally, examples of (4) non&#8208;catalytic strategies are also discussed. The representative scopes, as well as mechanistic proposals, of these protocols are highlighted. Through an overview on the current state of research, this review aims to offer insights into the catalytic construction of C(sp3)&#8722;Ge bonds, and provide perspectives on future research directions to address the current challenges.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition of Alkynes To Form Arenes and Pyridines at Low Catalyst Loadings</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We report the Ni&#8208;catalyzed cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes at very low loadings of catalysts (0.05&#8197;mol% for all substrates). The nickel catalyst containing a terphenyl phosphine ligand allows carrying out the reactions at room temperature in only 30&#8197;min, providing the arene products as a single regioisomer in most cases. The Ni complex is also competent for the synthesis of polysubstituted pyridines through the cycloadditions of diynes and nitriles at mild temperatures (25&#8201;&#176; or 50&#8201;&#176;C) and low Ni loadings (1&#8197;mol%). Experimental data and computational studies support the involvement of monoligated PNi species in all fundamental steps of the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Photocatalytic Silylation of Aryl Alkynoates: Synthesis of Silylated Coumarins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we report the photocatalytic synthesis of 3&#8208;silyl coumarins using hydrosilanes as the silyl radical source with aryl alkynoates. Readily prepared N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts act as hydrogen atom transfer reagents for generating silyl radicals under photoredox catalysis. The reaction proceeds through a silyl radical addition to alkyne followed by radical cascade cyclization/migration with subsequent oxidation and aromatization to give the desired 3&#8208;silyl coumarins in 34&#8211;89% yield.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aroylchromones and Their Application in the Synthesis of Wrightiadione Analogues</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
With a number of biologically active members, 2&#8208;aroylchromones are valuable synthetic targets. A direct route towards 2&#8208;aroylchromones from 2&#8208;(methylsulfonyl)chromones and aldehydes via NHC&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond formation was developed. Yields of the synthesized 2&#8208;aroylchromones were up to 85%. Chromones with angioprotective or antibacterial properties were easily synthesized using the method developed. Additionally, the synthetic utility of the afforded chromones was demonstrated by using them to synthesize the anticancer compound wrightiadione and analogues of it.

A direct route towards 2-aroylchromones from 2-(methylsulfonyl)chromones and aldehydes via NHC-catalyzed C&#8722;C bond formation was developed. Yields of the synthesized 2-aroylchromones were up to 85%. Chromones with angioprotective or antibacterial properties were easily synthesized using the method developed. Additionally, the synthetic utility of the afforded chromones was demonstrated by using them to synthesize the anticancer compound wrightiadione and analogues of it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diaryliodonium Salt&#8208;Mediated Radical Transformation of Indoles with Alcohols for the Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Bis(indolyl)methanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A method for the synthesis of unsymmetrical bis(indolyl)methanes (BIMs) using simple indoles and readily available alcohols as the coupling partners under both heat and 390&#8211;400&#8197;nm light conditions was developed. Detailed research of the mechanism demonstrated that the diaryliodonium salt&#8208;mediated transformation undergoes a nucleophilic hydroxymethyl radical formation process. Moreover, the diaryliodonium salt&#8208;mediated method is also applicable for synthesizing symmetrical BIMs.

         <title>On the Functionalization of C60 with Vinylallenes Generated in&#8197;situ by Rhodium Catalysis</title>

Abstract
The functionalization of fullerenes is important for several reasons, primarily related to enhancing their chemical reactivity, solubility, and potential of applications in optoelectronics and biomedicine. In this study, we present a novel approach to functionalize C60 through a cascade process encompassing an unprecedented Rh&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1,6&#8208;allenynes to in&#8197;situ generate a vinylallene that is followed by a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with pristine fullerene, resulting in the formation of 6,6&#8208;fused bicyclic fullerene derivatives. The mechanism governing this process was elucidated by DFT calculations and confirmed by deuterium labelling and control experiments, demonstrating the critical role of traces of water in the reaction medium to mediate the observed reactivity.

Abstract
The iron (&#1030;&#1030;&#1030;)&#8208;promoted tandem cyclization of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;(allyloxy)aryl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles with diselenides has been developed for the preparation of seleno&#8208;benzo[2,3][1,4]oxazepino[4,5&#8208;a]indole derivatives. The investigation to determine the best reaction conditions indicated the use of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;(allyloxy)aryl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles (0.2&#8197;mmol) with diselenides (1.5&#8197;equiv.) and iron(III) chloride (1.5&#8197;equiv.) in acetonitrile at room temperature under air, and more than 48 examples were obtained. The reaction features access to selenized 7&#8208;membered containing nitrogen&#8208;oxygen heterocyclic skeleton, which also represents a 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization process of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;((2&#8208;methylallyl)oxy)aryl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles and diselenides.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a synthesis for tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines involving cascade sigmatropic rearrangements. The substrates were conveniently prepared from parent anilines via a [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement and cyanomethylation. Silver&#8208;mediated decyanation afforded the corresponding iminium cation, which underwent a cascade consisting of an aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement, an aza&#8208;oxa&#8208;Cope rearrangement, an aromatization, and a Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction, and tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines were obtained as the single product. The reaction involved seven bond scissions and four bond formations and was triggered by a single reagent.</dc:description>

Abstract
An asymmetric 1,4&#8208;reduction of exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, yielding diverse optically active &#945;&#8208;substituted tetralones, has been achieved using a chiral SPINOL&#8208;derived borophosphate catalyst. The enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step of the reaction involves the protonation of a highly active boron enolates intermediate. This catalytic reduction system, comprising chiral SPINOL&#8208;derived borophosphate and pinacolborane, has potential for broader application in other asymmetric reduction reactions.

         <title>DMSO/SOCl2&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Thiomethylnaphthalenes from Propargyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we reported the straightforward synthesis of thiomethylnaphthalenes via the reaction of propargyl alcohols with dimethyl sulfoxide/thionyl chloride (DMSO/SOCl2), which also provided easy access to deuterated thiomethyl and other thioalkyl scaffolds when deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide and dialkyl sulfoxides were used, respectively. In addition, the thiomethyl group can be readily derivatized to the corresponding sulfoxide, sulfone, and sulfoximine of interesting photophysical properties.

Abstract
An expedient strategy for the construction of trifluoromethylselenolated spiro[5.5]trienones/spiro[4.5]trienones through a cascade electrophilic trifluoromethylselenolation cyclization and dearomatization has been developed. This sequential process was induced by N&#8208;trifluoromethylselenophthalimide (Phth&#8208;SeCF3), which was an efficient electrophilic trifluoromethylselenolation reagent. This approach has the feature of mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and high functional group tolerance.

Abstract
Benzofluorenes are an important class of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are widely used in materials science for light&#8208;sensitive electronic components. In addition, the benzofluorene skeleton also serves as a key structural unit in various natural products. Therefore, the development of synthetic strategies for the construction of benzofluorenes has been a prominent research topic in synthetic chemistry. Over the past few decades, numerous efforts have been made for the construction of benzofluorenes via cascade cyclization of alkyne units. This review aims to summarize recent advances in the cascade cyclization of alkyne units for the construction of Based on the different reaction mechanisms underlying these transformations, this review can be divided into four categories: (1) thermal&#8208;induced cascade cyclization of alkyne units for the construction of benzofluorenes, (2) metal&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of alkyne units for the construction of benzofluorenes, (3) acid&#8208;promoted/catalyzed cyclization of alkyne units for the construction of benzofluorenes, and (4) base&#8208;promoted cascade cyclization of alkyne units for the construction of benzofluorenes.

Abstract
Organocatalytic dearomatization of &#946;&#8208;naphthols has been achieved via a 1,6&#8208;conjugated addition of 2&#8208;naphthols to alkynyl 7&#8208;methylene&#8208;7H&#8208;indoles in&#8197;situ generated from &#945;&#8208;(7&#8208;indolyl)methanols. In the presence of racemic phosphoric acid, a series of tetrasubstituted allenes was obtained in high yields. Particularly, with the aid of chiral phosphoric acid, asymmetric dearomatization of &#946;&#8208;naphthols was investigated, affording axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes with moderate enantioselectivity.

         <title>Tropone Hydrazides in [10+2]&#8208;Hetero&#8208;Higher&#8208;Order Cycloaddition for the Synthesis of Tetrahydropyridazine Derivatives</title>

Abstract
[10+2]&#8208;Hetero&#8208;higher&#8208;order cycloaddition between tropone hydrazides (acting as 10&#960;&#8208;components) and 3&#8208;alkylidene oxindoles (acting as 2&#960;&#8208;components) has been established. Under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis the reaction proceeded in a fully peri&#8208; and diastereoselective manner with the stereochemical outcome governed mainly by electronic interactions. Following such a strategy, a series of structurally diverse tetrahydropyridazines were prepared in 30&#8211;70% yields. Furthermore, the potential of the obtained cycloadducts has been confirmed in selected chemoselective transformations.

Abstract
This work describes gold&#8208;catalyzed annulations of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;(dimethoxymethyl)phenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;prop&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;yl acetate substrates with &#945;&#8208;diazo esters and anilines, respectively yielding substituted naphthoates and indeno[1,2&#8208;b]quinoline derivatives. Our mechanistic analysis indicates 1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indenes as their common intermediates. In the formation of naphthoates, &#945;&#8208;diazo ester attacks at gold&#8208;bound intermediate via an SN2 pathway to enable a allylic methoxy substitution. For indeno[1,2&#8208;b]quinoline derivatives, there are two main reactions, including (i) a reversible formation between intermediate and a double amine addition product and (ii) an arylation reaction of intermediate. Species N&#8208;(phenyl((2E)&#8208;1&#8208;(phenylimino)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;inden&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)methyl)aniline was converted to indeno[1,2&#8208;b]quinoline in the presence of gold catalyst.

         <title>Synthesis of Vinyl Sulfones and Benzoxathiins via Base&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions of o&#8208;Hydroxyaryl Thiosulfonates and Ynones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The cyclization reaction and hydrosulfonylation reaction of ynones have been simultaneously realized through a single operation. Under the mediation of cesium carbonate, different S&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;hydroxyaryl) aryl thiosulfonates reacted with various ynones to produce functionalized vinyl sulfones in 37%&#8211;83% yields with E&#8208;selectivity. At the same time, a variety of benzoxathiins were formed in 42%&#8211;97% yields.

         <title>Stereoconvergent Access to Z&#8208;Allylborons from E/Z&#8208;Mixed 1,3&#8208;Dienes via Cu&#8208;Guanidine Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Merging the stereoisomeric mixture of substrate into a single product through stereospecific transformation is a challenging but higher&#8208;order synthetic strategy, which perfectly meets the demand of cost control in the precise chemical production. In this work, the stereoconvergent synthesis of Z&#8208;allylic boronates was realized with protoborylation of E/Z&#8208;mixed 1,3&#8208;dienes catalyzed by a novel copper&#8208;guanidine complex. The reaction could proceed smoothly under very mild conditions with good functional group tolerance, and convert diverse aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes into the desired Z&#8208;1,4&#8208;addition products with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivities in minutes. Detailed mechanistic studies also helped to disclose the origin of stereoconvergency. Both E&#8208; and Z&#8208;diene were found directly undergoing a rapid borylation without E/Z isomerization of C=C bond, followed by a convergent formation of the same thermodynamically stable allylcopper intermediate before the slow protonation step occurred.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation of 3&#8208;Substituted 2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;Benzoxazines under Tethered Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;Diamine Catalysis with Unexpected Reversal of Enantioselectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of 3&#8208;substituted 2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazines with an azeotropic mixture of HCO2H/NEt3 (5/2) using tethered Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;diamine catalysis has been realized. This process allows access to a broad range of chiral 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazines in high yields with up to 99% ee, and tolerates a variety of functional groups. The enantiocontrol is achieved by the judicious choice of catalyst and hydrogen source. This reaction proceeds with unexpected reversal of enantioselectivity, which is attributed to the acidic reaction conditions and the hydrogen bond between the N&#8722;H of the rhodium species and the O atom in the substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>Bidentate NHC&#8208;Containing Ligands for Copper Catalysed Synthesis of Functionalised Diaryl Ethers</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diaryl and heteroaryl ethers are important and common motifs in drug discovery and agrochemicals. Here we present a catalytic system for the copper catalysed arylation of phenols with aryl halides. Bidentate N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands provide a well&#8208;defined catalytic system that enable low loading of copper in effective coupling reactions (0.5 mol% Cu or lower). The reaction scope of aryl iodides and aryl bromides is developed, that is tolerant of functional groups and a library of biaryl ethers with lead&#8208;like properties is prepared. The presence of excess ligand (in a 1:3 ratio) is shown to be optimal to prevent catalyst degradation, presumably by avoiding decomplexation of the ligand. This is also supported by the catalytic results obtained with pre&#8208;formed copper complexes. The kinetics of the reaction are examined and shown to be first order in copper, supportive of a well&#8208;defined catalyst species, first order in phenol and aryl iodide, and zero order in base under the developed conditions. Computational studies performed using Minnesota MN15&#8208;L parametrisation method support an oxidative addition&#8211;reductive elimination pathway. Reductive elimination would be turnover limiting and occurr through an intimate ion pair intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur (VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) via Glass&#8211;Assisted Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An environmentally benign route for the synthesis of sulfonamides via Sulfur (VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) chemistry utilizing N&#8208;methylimidazole, that simultaneously act as a base, precatalyst, HF by&#8208;product scavenger, as well as solvent, is described. This one&#8208;step sulfonamide synthesis exhibits excellent reactivity toward highly electron&#8208;deficient and less nucleophilic anilines as well as aminopyridines while tolerating a wide range of functional groups. In addition to the desired sulfonamide target, we also isolated an ionic salt as the sole side product from the reaction mixture that has been identified as bis[1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;3&#8208;ium] hexafluorosilicate (IV). The glass surface of reaction vessel is acting as the source of silicon present in the isolated side product. Formation of hexafluorosilicate salt is also facilitating the consumption of sulfonyl fluoride for sulfonamide synthesis. Optimization of the reaction under various conditions, as well as the isolation of the bis[1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;3&#8208;ium] hexafluorosilicate (IV) salt, highlight the crucial role of N&#8208;methylimidazole and support the glass&#8208;assisted approach. Besides the first example of glass&#8208;assisted SuFEx catalyzed by benign organic bases, this reaction also offers an alternative route for accessing protic hexafluorosilicate&#8208;based molten salts without employing external HF. The synthetic utility of this SuFEx route for late&#8208;stage functionalization is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Cascade Trifluoromethylation of Dienes and Enynes using a Perylene Diimide (PDI) Organophotocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Perylene diimide (PDI) is an underexplored synthetic organic dye with significant potential in photoredox catalysis. We have developed a good chemo&#8208; and regioselective, atom&#8208;economical methodology for synthesizing trifluoroethylated saturated heterocyclic derivatives and trifluoroethyl&#8208;containing cyclobutane derivatives. This process involves the generation of trifluoromethyl radical from the Langlois (CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Na) reagent under photoredox conditions, which selectively reacts with the electron&#8208;rich terminal double/triple bonds in the diene/enyne framework. The resulting intermediate undergoes a cascade cyclization, yielding the desired compounds in a redox&#8208;neutral manner. Our methodology operates under very mild conditions, eliminating the need for transition metals and external oxidizing agents. It is broadly applicable across various substrates and is supported by comprehensive mechanistic insights from regular photophysical experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective One&#8208;pot Double Cascade Hybrid Formation/[3+3] Spirocyclization for the Synthesis of 3&#8208;Spiropiperidines Under Phase Transfer Conditions.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report an efficient approach to synthesizing hybrid 3&#8208;spiropiperidines heterocycles that incorporate both 3&#8208;isochromanone and 3&#8208;isoindolinone units through a one&#8208;pot, double cascade reaction facilitated by an economical K&#8322;CO&#8323;/TBAB catalytic system. By examining the nucleophilicity of the lactone 3&#8208;isochromanone, we developed a cascade reaction pathway that first generates a bi&#8208;nucleophilic hybrid intermediate, which then undergoes [3+3] spirocyclization with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The regioselectivity of the spirocyclization strongly depends on the substitution pattern of lactam ring. The process exhibits high diastereoselectivity, even with the formation of three or four stereocenters, including two contiguous quaternary carbons. These sequential cascade reactions were successfully scaled up, and the subsequent reactivity was readily analyzed, enabling the transformation of existing functional groups into valuable new functionalities.

         <title>Selective 1,2&#8208;Carboimination of Isothiocyanates to Access S&#8208;Substituted Isothioureas via Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we introduce a novel method for the synthesis of S&#8208;substituted isothiourea compounds via the selective 1,2&#8208;carboimination between oxime esters as bifunctional reagents and the C=S bond of isothiocyanates under visible&#8208;light catalysis. This approach deviates from conventional methods by precisely modulating the substrate electronics to selectively functionalize the C=S bond of isothiocyanates over the C=N bond, eliminating the need for strong bases and high temperatures and bypassing the formation of thiourea intermediates. Consequently, this protocol enables the efficient one&#8208;step synthesis of S&#8208;alkyl isothioureas, with featuring mild reaction conditions, operational simplicity and broad substrate scope.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a novel and highly efficient method for synthesizing polyfunctionalized 1,2,4&#8208;triazoles. This approach leverages visible light and arylazo sulfones in combination with N&#8208;vinyl amides, in the environmentally friendly solvent ethyl acetate. Remarkably, the reaction proceeds without the need for (photo)catalysts, ensuring near&#8208;perfect atom economy and producing only water as a by&#8208;product. This method exhibits excellent functional group tolerance and can be scaled for both batch and continuous&#8208;flow processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Acid&#8208;Mediated Oxidative C&#8208;H Phosphorylation of Quinoxalines and Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quinoxaline is a chemical moiety known for its diverse physicochemical and biological properties, making it the focus of extensive research. Over the past few decades, quinoxaline scaffolds have been utilized in the design and development of various bioactive molecules, dyes, fluorescent materials, electroluminescent materials, organic sensitizers for solar cells, and polymeric optoelectronic materials. Herein, we present a metal&#8208;free and rapid protocol for the phosphorylation of quinoxalines and quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one. This method employs oxygen as an oxidant under ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, with experimental evidence indicating the absence of radical involvement. Our methodology provides range of phosphorylated quinoxalines and quinoxaline&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one in yields ranging from 47% to 99%.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual NHC/HAT&#8208;Promoted Esterification to Access &#945;&#8208;Aryl Glycines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Aryl glycines are among the more important carbonyl compounds, particularly as nonproteinogenic &#945;&#8208;amino acids present in many pharmacophores. As such, many strategies have been developed to access this motif, but direct carboxylation methods remain underdeveloped. Herein, we employ a dual NHC/HAT catalysis strategy to access 2&#8208;azaallyl radicals, which subsequently couple with in situ generated ester azolium radical intermediates. Base&#8208;mediated collapse of the ensuing tetrahedral intermediate liberates the NHC catalyst and benzophenone protected aryl glycine. This methodology was employed to esterify obtain a variety of aryl substituted glycine derivatives, as well as allylic and benzylic sites. Mechanistic studies reveal that this radical process operates under both oxidative and reductive quenching cycles, while preliminary experiments employing a chiral NHC and Lewis acid additive demonstrate modest enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstructive synthesis of fluorinated dihydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indolones by a cyclohexadione cut&#8208;to&#8208;fuse strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a fluorinative ring&#8208;cleavage reaction that breaks C&#8211;C bonds in cyclic &#946;&#8208;diketones bearing aryl moiety using N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) in the presence of inorganic carbonates (Cs2CO3 or K2CO3) in methanol at room temperature within one hour. Generated fluorinated keto acid esters bearing ortho&#8208;nitro aryl groups were transformed into fluorinated dihydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indolones (DHPIs) via reductive cyclization using B2(OH)4 followed by amidation in the presence of  K2CO3. This "cut&#8208;to&#8208;fuse" strategy enables the reconstructive synthesis of valuable fused heterocycles from relatively simple cyclohexadione.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a selective preparation of a variety of functionalized pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;c]tetrahydroquinolines and indolo[3,2&#8208;c]tetrahydroquinolines in 40&#8208;82% and 40&#8208;80% yields from alkynyl&#8208;tethered oximes with diaryliodonium triflates, respectively. The one&#8208;pot reaction underwent N&#8208;arylation, intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition, selective [1.3] or [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement of N&#8208;O bond in total three steps. Experimental studies revealed that EtOAc solvent and copper(II)&#8208;catalyst played crucial roles on the formation of these two tetrahydroquinoline scaffolds. Moreover, these two tetrahydroquinoline scaffolds could be converted into various tetrahydroquinoline building blocks by further transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioactive Molecules from Lignocellulose&#8208;derived Platform Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ever&#8208;increasing prevalence of diseases and inadequate resources on Earth are threats to society. Biomass is an abundant resource, and bioactive compounds produced from biomass are environmentally benign in contrast to conventional chemical synthesis methods, which frequently depend on non&#8208;renewable resources. In addition, the functionalized monomers from biomass allow the atom economical synthesis of bioactive molecules. This review aims to provide insight into the synthesis of bioactive molecules from the lignocellulose&#8208;derived platform chemicals. Existing methodology and catalytic systems are summarized for the synthesis of targeted bioactive molecules from cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin&#8208;derived platform chemicals. The biological activities of bioactive molecules obtained from biomass, such as antioxidant, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and anticancer properties, are discussed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The copper powder&#8208;mediated tandem hydroamination cyclization&#8208;hydrocyanation of alkyne&#8208;tethered ketoximes is described by using TMSCN as the commercially available cyanating reagent. This methodology provides an alternative strategy for the synthesis of a series of structurally important cyano&#8208;substituted cyclic nitrones. The hydrocyanation process exhibits distinct regioselectivity depending on the substituent pattern of the alkyne moiety. Moreover, the synthesized products were shown to be capable of undergoing various derivatization reactions.</dc:description>

The hydrocyanation process exhibits distinct regioselectivity depending on the substituent pattern of the alkyne moiety. Moreover, the synthesized products were shown to be capable of undergoing various derivatization reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Photochemical C&#8211;C coupling reactions can be tailored to environmentally benign industrial chemical processes and preparations of valuable pharmaceuticals. Yet, recent approaches in this area are limited to using precious transition metal coordination complexes that facilitate light absorption and redox processes with benchtop chemicals. Herein, we propose a new paradigm that involves all&#8208;in&#8208;one organo&#8208;photo&#8208;auxiliaries, thio&#8208;heteroarenes, which exhibit unique photophysical properties. These thio&#8208;heteroarenes were employed to prepare several all&#8208;in&#8208;one ionic photo&#8208;salts from commercially available alkyl/benzyl and heterocyclic halides via aromaticity&#8208;mediated nucleophilic substitution reactions. From the library of &gt; 30 salts, we performed on&#8208;demand photochemical C&#8211;C coupling reactions to isolate numerous symmetrical and unsymmetrical diary/alkyl&#8208;ethanes with yields up to 84% and mass balance as high as 96%. We also investigated the influence of structural features/properties on the outcomes of the photochemical C&#8211;C coupling reactions. The current photochemical C&#8211;C method was successful in the isolation of &gt;30 photoproducts, including the natural product Brittonin A, a precursor of Imipramine, and derivatives of the bioactive Honokiol Analogues. Furthermore, transient absorption spectroscopy and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations were used to decipher the nature of light&#8208;promoted electronic transitions. The present research opens new avenues in sustainable photochemical C&#8211;C coupling reactions to afford valuable compounds and bioactive systems while avoiding the use of precious metals&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>PTC in the polyenolate&#8208;mediated [10+2]&#8208;cycloaddition for the synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acid precursors</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. The manuscript describes a formal [10+2] higher&#8208;order cycloaddition between 2&#8208;benzylideneindan&#8208;1&#8208;ones and &#945;&#8208;alkilidene azlactones as higherene precursors and  higherenofiles respectively. The reaction is realized under Br&#248;nsted&#8208;base catalysis utilizing the phase transfer catalysis approach. The key intermediate is an isobenzofulvene&#8208;derived polyenolate which acts as a 10&#8208;electron component in the higher&#8208;order cycloaddition. By using this strategy, a series of structurally diverse compounds containing a polycyclic hydrocarbon scaffold was prepared in 79&#8208;99% yields. In addition, the potential of the obtained [10+2]&#8208;cycloadducts has been confirmed by transformations, including the synthesis of a highly&#8208;valuable alpha,alpha&#8208;disubstituted N&#8208;protected alpha&#8208;aminoester.</dc:description>

The manuscript describes a formal [10+2] higher-order cycloaddition between 2-benzylideneindan-1-ones and &#945;-alkilidene azlactones as higherene precursors and  higherenofiles respectively. The reaction is realized under Br&#248;nsted-base catalysis utilizing the phase transfer catalysis approach. The key intermediate is an isobenzofulvene-derived polyenolate which acts as a 10-electron component in the higher-order cycloaddition.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Initiated Uranyl&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation and Hydrosulfonylation of Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study investigates the visible&#8208;light&#8208;initiated uranyl(VI)&#8208;catalyzed activation of Si&#8208;H bonds through direct hydrogen atom transfer, which facilitates the formation of silyl radicals from silanes. The silyl radical can abstract a chlorine atom from the sulfonyl chloride, leading to the generation of sulfonyl radicals. These silyl radicals and sulfonyl radicals could react with alkenes and alkynes, achieving the first example of uranyl&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation and hydrosulfonylation of unsaturated C&#8208;C bonds. This method features mild reaction conditions and a broad substrate scope, and exhibiting exceptional functional&#8208;group tolerance. Consequently, it is suitable for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Raney Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Deuterium Labeling of Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Heterocycles and Pharmaceuticals under Continuous Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deuterium&#8208;labeled compounds play a pivotal role in physical organic chemistry, life sciences, and materials science. This has resulted in a surge of interest in deuterium&#8208;labeled active pharmaceutical ingredients in recent years. In this study, we present a continuous flow Raney nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange process that boasts compatibility with a wide spectrum of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles and pharmaceutical compounds. The broad applicability of the developed method was demonstrated through successful labeling of various purine bases, imidazoles, pyridines, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including complex structures like abacavir and remdesivir. Control experiments revealed Raney nickel's crucial role in the exchange process, showcasing the superiority of the continuous flow approach over batch reactions. Furthermore, a scaled&#8208;up experiment demonstrated the robustness of the catalyst.</dc:description>
