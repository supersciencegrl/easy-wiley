         <title>Electrocatalytic Dehydrogenative Lactonization of Benzylic Alcohols: A Sustainable Access to Phthalides via N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide Mediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, scalable electrocatalytic method for direct lactonization of benzylic alcohols to phthalides using N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide as a redox mediator is reported. This metal&#8208;free process proceeds via a phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer mechanism, shows broad scope with good to excellent yields, and enables late&#8208;stage functionalizations, including syntheses of talopram and a Y5 receptor antagonist intermediate.

A sustainable and efficient electrochemical method for the direct oxidative lactonization of benzylic alcohols, enabling rapid access to isobenzofuran&#8208;1(3H)&#8208;ones (phthalides) is presented. This electrocatalytic transformation leverages N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide as a redox mediator under mild, metal&#8208;free conditions, offering an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional oxidation protocols. The method demonstrates broad substrate scope and delivers phthalide derivatives consistently in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies, combining cyclic voltammetry and density functional theory calculations, support a radical&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer mechanism driven by phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl radicals. Importantly, the utility of the protocol extends beyond model substrates: it is successfully applied to the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant compounds, including talopram and a key intermediate for a neuropeptide Y5 receptor antagonist. Overall, this work underscores the power of electrosynthesis in modern organic chemistry, merging green chemistry principles with synthetic efficiency.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Conia&#8208;Ene Reaction of Malonate Derivatives Bearing An Alkyne Moiety by Using a Phosphine&#8211;Borane Ligand</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphine&#8211;borane gold complex can catalyze the cycloisomerization of malonates bearing an alkyne moiety. In the case of 2&#8208;(4&#8208;pentynyl)malonate, a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#8208;mode cyclization occurs, while 2&#8208;(3&#8208;butynyl)malonate gives cyclopentenes via a 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig mode cyclization.

A gold&#8208;catalyzed Conia&#8208;ene reaction of malonate derivatives is developed by using a phosphine&#8211;borane ligand. This catalyst system can be applicable not only for 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#8208;mode cyclization reactions but also for 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig&#8208;mode cyclizations. A variety of 2&#8208;(4&#8208;pentynyl)malonates and 2&#8208;(3&#8208;butynyl)malonates afford the corresponding cyclic compounds in moderate to high yields. The boryl enolate might be formed in situ and attacks intramolecularly an alkyne moiety, activated by a gold catalyst, is considered.

         <title>N&#8208;Containing Carbon Materials in Metal&#8208;Free and Non&#8208;Noble Metal Liquid Phase Heterogenous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over 100 examples of non&#8208;noble metal supported on N&#8208;containing and metal&#8208;free N&#8208;containing carbon catalysts are discussed. Particular emphasis is put on how different N&#8208;functionalities influence catalyst performance and stability. Preparation procedures are also examined, with a strong focus on how the heat treatment temperature influences N&#8208;functionalities distribution.

Non&#8208;noble metal and metal&#8208;free catalysts can be of great benefit for the development of economically and environmentally sustainable chemical processes. In this context, N&#8208;containing carbon materials serve both as effective catalyst supports and standalone catalysts, offering enhanced stability by mitigating deactivation mechanisms such as metal leaching and sintering. The review is primarily organized by non&#8208;noble metal, systematically covering each case in which their use as an active phase on N&#8208;containing carbon materials has been reported in literature. In parallel, cross&#8208;cutting aspects are examined throughout, including the role of different N&#8208;functionalities (graphitic, pyridinic, pyrrolic, and pyridinic&#8208;N&#8208;oxide) in active&#8208;phase stabilization mechanisms. Structurally diverse carbon materials&#8212;such as amorphous carbon, carbon nanotubes, carbon spheres, carbon nanofibers, and graphene&#8212;are also considered. Furthermore, the influence of preparation methods, including template&#8208;free, hard&#8208;templating and soft&#8208;templating techniques, is analyzed with emphasis on their role in tuning textural properties. Despite significant progress, uncertainties remain regarding the precise stabilization mechanisms and the relative contributions of different N&#8208;functionalities to catalytic activity and surface acid&#8211;base properties. Addressing these knowledge gaps will be essential for optimization of N&#8208;containing carbon materials and to drive the transition towards greener and more sustainable catalytic technologies.

The cascade reaction of cyclic 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diketones and diarylamines was efficiently developed, enabling straightforward access to a series of 2&#8208;aminocyclopentenones in good to excellent yields (71&#8211;90%).

The cascade reaction of cyclic 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diketones and diarylamines is efficiently developed, enabling straightforward access to a series of 2&#8208;aminocyclopentenones in good to excellent yields (71&#8211;90%). The procedure is proposed to go through a sequence of Wolff rearrangement via initial ketene formation, nucleophilic addition/keto&#8208;enol tautomerization, and Rh2(OAc)4&#8208;catalyzed decarbonylative amination followed by an oxidation process. A broad range of substrates are compatible with this mild reaction system, thereby providing a facile and practical approach for constructing important skeleton of aminocyclopentenone.

         <title>Light Mediated Sulfonylation/C&#8211;H Activation/Annulation of Benzimidazoles Derivatives Catalyzed by Diarylmethylium Tetrafluoroborate Salts: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the exploiting of visible&#8208;light, a key photoactive complex, and an acid&#8208;catalyzed proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, polycyclic sulfonylated benzimidazoles are obtained through a domino process including sulfonylation, C&#8211;H activation, and annulation. Diarylmethylium tetrafluoroborates are employed as inexpensive organocatalyst capable of forming a photoactive complex with sulfinates. Its interaction with light triggers the formation of the essential sulfonyl radical, which initiates the domino process.

In this article, diarylmethylium tetrafluoroborates are exploited as catalysts in a visible light promoted domino sulfonylation/C&#8211;H activation/annulation of N&#8208;alkynylbenzimidazoles producing polycyclic sulfonyl&#8208;benzimidazoles. Annulated benzimidazoles are important structures in pharmaceutical research and drug discovery known for their biological and medicinal properties. More than 20 polycyclic sulfonyl&#8208;benzimidazoles, including azepines, are obtained in good to excellent yields, in mild and metal free conditions. A mechanism proposal, based on both experimental and computational studies, establishes the role of the photoactive ion couple formed between the cation catalyst and the sulfinate in producing the key sulfonyl radical. The latter adds to the triple bond thus promoting a domino process in which the acid additive has a fundamental role in the hydrogen transfer. In addition, an acid&#8208;catalyzed proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer closes the catalytic cycle regenerating the diarylcarbenium salt thus yielding the desired product.

         <title>Merging Cu2O Photo&#8208;Thermo&#8208;Catalyst with Lignosulfonate&#8208;Supported Tempo for Aerobic Oxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural into 2,5&#8208;Diformylfuran</title>

GA: A highly efficient photo&#8208;thermo catalytic system for the selective oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran using O2 under purple light&#8208;emitting diode light (&#955;&#8201;=&#8201;400&#8201;nm) and heat irradiation without dye sensitizers. The surface of synthesized octahedral Cu2O particles acts as the photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;catalytic platform, facilitating O2 activation with conduction band electrons. Additionally, a novel series of 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl&#8208;lignosulfonate supported catalysts are explored, which, in combination with octahedral Cu2O particles, effectively catalyze HMF oxidation.

The selective oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF) represents a critical step in the sustainable synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals from renewable biomass. A significant challenge in achieving this transformation lies in developing an effective visible light&#8208;driven heterogeneous photocatalytic method that excludes the use of dye&#8208;based sensitizers. While solar energy presents an exceptionally promising renewable energy source for extensive future applications, its overall utilization remains suboptimal. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;catalyst system comprising octahedral Cu2O particles, which, when combined with lignosulfonate (LS)&#8208;supported 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO), demonstrates decent catalytic performance for the selective oxidation of HMF into DFF under the illumination of a 400&#8201;nm light&#8208;emitting diode light. This system achieves a remarkable 95% DFF yield at 60&#8201;&#176;C under ambient oxygen conditions. This study successfully demonstrates the effective integration of a non&#8208;noble metal photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;catalyst with a supported TEMPO system, which enables the efficient HMF&#8208;to&#8208;DFF transformation driven by visible light, eliminating the need for dye sensitizers in the process.

         <title>Engineering Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase with Improved Activity and Stability for High&#8208;Efficiency Carbon Dioxide Fixation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 17, September 26, 2025. </description>

A novel CO2&#8208;fixing enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from Cannabis sativa, shows 146.8&#8201;U&#8201;mg&#8211;1 activity. Protein engineering improves its activity twofold and stability 31&#8208;fold, yielding a total turnover number of 1.44&#8201;&#215;&#8201;105&#8201;mol&#8201;mol&#8211;1, making it a highly efficient CO2 fixation catalyst.

The extraction of excess CO2 from the environment requires favorable carbon sequestration methods, among which biochar sequestration is one of the most effective approaches. Therefore, to meet the growing demand for high&#8208;efficiency carbon fixation and enhanced metabolic flux in biological carbon sequestration, the development of high&#8208;performance phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is of significant importance. In this study, a high&#8208;activity PEPC from Cannabis sativa (CsPEPC) is identified. However, the enzyme exhibits poor thermal stability, with a half&#8208;life of only 13&#8201;min at 50&#8201;&#176;C. To improve CsPEPC performance, diverse strategies, including molecular dynamics, FoldX energy calculations, and PROSS&#8208;based prediction, are integrated to screen beneficial variants. The resulting mutant CsPEPCC886R shows a twofold increase in activity (249.2&#8201;U&#8201;mg&#8211;1 at 50&#8201;&#176;C) and fivefold greater stability. Furthermore, the addition of 25% glycerol as a protein stabilizer significantly extends the half&#8208;life of CsPEPCC886R by 31&#8208;fold, ultimately increasing the half&#8208;life to 2178&#8201;min. In&#8201;vitro production experiments show that the optimal mutant CsPEPCC886R generates 116.8&#8201;mM oxaloacetate within 270&#8201;min. This work provides a promising PEPC variant for biological CO2 fixation, which holds great potential for improving carbon assimilation and supports the development of efficient, carbon&#8208;neutral biosynthetic pathways.

         <title>Synthesis of Amidines Via P(III)/P(V)&#63742;O Redox Catalyzed In&#8201;Situ Formation of Imidoyl Chlorides From Amides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 17, September 26, 2025. </description>

A series of amidines are prepared via PIII/PV&#63742;O redox catalyzed in&#8201;situ formation of imidoyl chlorides from amides. The desired products are obtained in good to excellent yields. Moreover, the protocol is applied to the synthesis of Erlotinib.

Amidines are a ubiquitous class of bioactive compounds found in a wide variety of natural products; thus, efficient strategies for their preparation are in great demand. Herein, a novel protocol is reported for the synthesis of amidines based on PIII/PV&#63742;O redox catalysis. This two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot approach involves the activation of amides via PIII/PV&#63742;O catalyzed in situ formation of imidoyl chloride intermediates which are directly converted upon reaction with amines into the corresponding amidines. Instead of traditionally used toxic and corrosive chloride sources, hexachloroacetone (HCA) is successfully employed as a halide source. The reaction proceeds with low catalyst loading (2 mol%) in BuOAc as the solvent. Under the optimized conditions, 20 amidines are prepared in yields up to 99%. A feasible mechanism is proposed based on experimental results. The synthetic potential of this method is evaluated in the preparation of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) Erlotinib.

&lt;p&gt;A series of amidines are prepared via P&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;/P&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;&#63742;O redox catalyzed in&#8201;situ formation of imidoyl chlorides from amides. The desired products are obtained in good to excellent yields. Moreover, the protocol is applied to the synthesis of Erlotinib.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amidines are a ubiquitous class of bioactive compounds found in a wide variety of natural products; thus, efficient strategies for their preparation are in great demand. Herein, a novel protocol is reported for the synthesis of amidines based on P&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;/P&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;&#63742;O redox catalysis. This two-step, one-pot approach involves the activation of amides via P&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;/P&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;&#63742;O catalyzed in situ formation of imidoyl chloride intermediates which are directly converted upon reaction with amines into the corresponding amidines. Instead of traditionally used toxic and corrosive chloride sources, hexachloroacetone (HCA) is successfully employed as a halide source. The reaction proceeds with low catalyst loading (2 mol%) in BuOAc as the solvent. Under the optimized conditions, 20 amidines are prepared in yields up to 99%. A feasible mechanism is proposed based on experimental results. The synthetic potential of this method is evaluated in the preparation of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) Erlotinib.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Cyclizations of 1,2&#8208;Diarylalkenols</title>

         <dc:description>
Dehydrative cyclisation of alcohols with alkenes is employed to construct medium&#8208;sized carbocycles efficiently. Catalyzed by main&#8208;group or metal Lewis acids, these reactions proceed in the presence of water and extend to tandem sequences. The methodology furnishes 26 new polysubstituted carbocycles with excellent diastereoselectivity and up to 97% yield, providing a versatile strategy for building complex cyclic frameworks from simple linear precursors.

The synthesis of medium&#8208;sized carbocycles from linear chains is challenging in organic chemistry. Among the effective methods for the synthesis of polysubstituted carbocycles with contiguous stereogenic centers, the dehydrative cyclization of alcohols with alkenes is an attractive protocol as it uses readily available substrates, without requiring unnecessary prefunctionalization, and generates water as the sole byproduct. Herein, a dehydrative cyclization reaction is explored, as well as two tandem reactions initiated by this cyclization. These reactions are allowed by metal&#8208;based or organic Lewis acids as catalysts containing only main group elements, which proved compatible with the formation of water during the reaction. This approach allowed the synthesis of 26 new carbocycles with yields up to 97% and high diastereoselectivity.

         <title>DBU&#8208;Triggered One&#8208;Pot Domino Transformation of Trifluoromethyl Ketones and Dicyanoalkenes into gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenyl &#947;&#8208;Lactams</title>

A base&#8208;catalyzed, one&#8208;pot domino reaction of trifluoromethyl ketones with &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dicyanoalkenes has been developed to access gem&#8208;difluoroalkenyl unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams. The proposed mechanism involves sequential C&#8211;C, C&#8211;O, and C&#8211;N bond formation, followed by C&#8211;F bond cleavage.

The direct conversion of trifluoromethyl ketones to valuable gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes remains a synthetically useful but underexplored transformation. Herein, we report a base&#8208;catalyzed, one&#8208;pot domino reaction of trifluoromethyl ketones with dicyanoalkenes, enabling formal dual deoxygenation and defluorination. This protocol affords a diverse range of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenyl unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams in yields of 62&#8211;95% under mild and operationally simple conditions. A proposed mechanism involves a sequential vinylogous aldol reaction, cyclization, rearrangement, and defluorination.

         <title>Catalytic Hydroboration of Ketones Using Mn(CO)5Br and Mn2(CO)10</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 17, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commercially available Mn complexes Mn(CO)5Br and Mn2(CO)10 catalyze ketone hydroboration under mild conditions with excellent chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance. The method enables rapid, one&#8208;pot access to diverse alcohols from O&#8208;borylated intermediates, outperforming existing Mn systems that require elaborate ligands or stringent conditions.

The commercially available and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle manganese complexes Mn(CO)5Br and Mn2(CO)10 effectively catalyze the hydroboration of ketones under mild conditions, yielding secondary alcohols after hydrolysis. These simple catalysts exhibit broad tolerance to different functional groups including esters, halides, and nitroarenes. Moreover, the reaction proceeds with high chemoselectivity toward C&#63742;O bonds in the presence of esters, nitriles, nitro groups, or double C&#63742;C bond. The proposed procedure enables fast, efficient synthesis of O&#8208;borylated products, which are easily hydrolyzed in a one&#8208;pot manner to various aryl and alkyl alcohols (even unsaturated ones) in excellent yields. Thus, the developed procedure compares favorably with other Mn catalytic systems, which require lengthy preparation, the application of structurally and electronically advanced ligands, and oxygen&#8208; and moisture&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Facet&#8208;Engineered Cds with Cd Vacancies for High&#8208;Efficiency Photocatalytic Oxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;Diformylfuran</title>

Synergy of exposed (002) facet and Cd vacancy in CdS hollow spheres exhibits the highest selectivity toward DFF in the oxidation of HMF under solar light, outperforming flower&#8208;like and nanorod structures.

The photocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF) is a promising process with significant implications for sustainable energy and environmental applications. However, achieving highly selective DFF production from HMF remains a challenging task, particularly due to the dependency of molecular O2 activation on the composition and exposed facets of nanomaterials. This study investigates the impact of different preferential facets of hydrothermally synthesized cadmium sulfide (CdS) morphologies&#8212;including hollow spheres, nanorods, and flower&#8208;like structures&#8212;on the photocatalytic oxidation of HMF to DFF. The findings reveal that the preferential CdS (002) facet and Cd vacancies in the hollow sphere morphology significantly enhance photocatalytic activity, achieving 68% HMF conversion and 89% selectivity for DFF production within 12&#8201;h of reaction time. This work highlights the critical role of material composition and facet orientation in optimizing photocatalytic processes for selective oxidation reactions, offering a potential strategy for the design of advanced photocatalysts in sustainable chemical production.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Photoredox Carboarylation of N&#8208;Acryloyl Phosphinimides with Sulfoxonium Ylides</title>

Visible Light&#8208;Driven Photoredox Carboarylation/Cyclization of N&#8208;Acryloyl Phosphinimides with Sulfoxonium ylides.

A mild visible light&#8208;driven photoredox cascade radical cyclization of N&#8208;acryloyl phosphinamides with sulfoxonium ylides for the modular synthesis of value&#8208;added cyclic phosphinamides under additive&#8208;free conditions has been reported. This scalable protocol uses sulfoxonium ylides as novel carbon radical precursors in an eco&#8208;friendly MeCN/H2O solvent system, eliminating the need for stoichiometric oxidants or bases while maintaining broad functional group tolerance. The carboarylation reaction has been successfully implemented at ambient temperature, providing an efficient and viable access to P&#8211;N scaffolds bearing a quaternary carbon center.

&lt;p&gt;Visible Light-Driven Photoredox Carboarylation/Cyclization of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Acryloyl Phosphinimides with Sulfoxonium ylides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mild visible light-driven photoredox cascade radical cyclization of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acryloyl phosphinamides with sulfoxonium ylides for the modular synthesis of value-added cyclic phosphinamides under additive-free conditions has been reported. This scalable protocol uses sulfoxonium ylides as novel carbon radical precursors in an eco-friendly MeCN/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O solvent system, eliminating the need for stoichiometric oxidants or bases while maintaining broad functional group tolerance. The carboarylation reaction has been successfully implemented at ambient temperature, providing an efficient and viable access to P&#8211;N scaffolds bearing a quaternary carbon center. Mechanistic studies support a proton-coupled electron transfer pathway for radical generation from sulfoxonium ylides under visible-light irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zn&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerization/Methylenation of Enyone with Vinyl Azide: Assembly of Terminal and Deuterated Alkenyl Furan Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 17, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>


An unprecedented zinc&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization/methylenation reaction of enynone with vinyl azide is developed. Featuring inexpensive, less&#8208;toxic catalyst, high efficiency, and mild reaction conditions, this protocol provides a practical synthetic method to access various bioactivity&#8208;related terminal and deuterated alkenyl furans in up to 99% yield and 94% level of deuterium incorporation. The reaction is proposed to proceed through cycloisomerization, cyclopropanation, and ring fragmentation processes. Utility of this reaction is further demonstrated by transformation of the obtained molecules into selectively semi&#8208;deuterated and non&#8208;deuterated furan skeletons.

A series of 5,7&#8208;membered cyclometallated gold(III) complexes with N^C^N tridentate ligands are prepared via transmetalation of pyridine&#8208;phenyl&#8208;oxazoline ligand&#8208;containing organomercury compounds with potassium gold(III) chloride (KAuCl4) for catalysis.

A series of 5,7&#8208;membered cyclometallated gold(III) complexes with N^C^N tridentate ligands are developed as catalysts, which are prepared via transmetalation of pyridine&#8208;phenyl&#8208;oxazoline ligand&#8208;containing organomercury compounds with potassium gold(III) chloride (KAuCl4) with up to 86% yields. Investigation on the synthesis and catalytic activity of the newly developed gold(III) complexes under silver&#8208;free conditions results in &gt;90% conversion for propargylamines and up to &gt;99% conversion for bifunctional modification of oligosaccharides via three&#8208;component&#8201;(A3)&#8208;coupling reactions. Employment of the tridentate gold(III) complexes also successfully catalyzes the carboalkoxylation reaction of acetal alkynes. These results reveal potential applications of such 5,7&#8208;membered tridentate gold(III) complexes as catalysts for organic transformation reactions and modification of biomolecules.

         <title>Synthesis of 3,4&#8208;Dihydroquinazolinones via Base&#8208;Promoted Formal [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] Cycloadditions</title>

         <dc:description>
In this work a straightforward, metal&#8208;free and general protocol for the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydroquinazolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones is described. From 2&#8208;chloromethyl anilines upon treatment with a base an aza&#8208;o&#8208;quinone methide is in situ generated. This highly reactive intermediate readily reacts through [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition with isocyanates affording 32 derivatives in up 98% yields. Scale&#8208;up experiments and further derivatizations show the utility of this transformation.

3,4&#8208;dihydroquinazolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one (3,4&#8208;DHQ) is a key structural motif found in many biologically active molecules. Although several synthetic methods have been developed to date, harsh reaction conditions, and/or metal toxic reagents are often required. In this work, a general, metal&#8208;free methodology for the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;DHQs is described. This novel protocol relies on a formal [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition of in situ formed aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methides and isocyanates leading to a wide variety of 3,4&#8208;DHQs in yields up to 98%.

         <title>Barbier Reactions with Gaseous CO2 via Electromagnetic Milling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 17, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manuscript describes the gas&#8208;involved Barbier reaction (Grignard reaction is the Barbier variant) in one step to synthesize carboxylic acids under electromagnetic mill condition, which is a supplement to the classic Barbier reaction. This strategy allowed CO2 under ordinary pressure, which is more valuable for the labeling chemistry, and a variety of 13C labeled carboxylic acids are achieved efficiently.

The Barbier reaction has been utilized in the construction of C&#63743;X (X&#8201;=&#8201;C, Si, B, N, etc.)bondsin organic chemistry for over a century. However, all reported strategies have been carried out in organic solvents or solvent&#8208;free conditions involving solid&#8211;liquid or solid&#8211;solid phases, and gas&#8208;phase Barbier reactions in one step are rare. In this work, a one&#8208;step gas&#8208;involved Barbier reaction for the synthesis of carboxylic acids under electromagnetic mill conditions is presented. This approach utilizes gas CO2 at ambient pressure, which holds significant promise for isotope&#8208;labeling chemistry. A variety of 13C&#8208;labeled carboxylic acids is synthesized efficiently using this method. This gas&#8208;involved, liquid&#8208;assisted grinding transformation could accelerate the advancement of this field.

However, all reported strategies have been carried out in organic solvents or solvent-free conditions involving solid&#8211;liquid or solid&#8211;solid phases, and gas-phase Barbier reactions in one step are rare. In this work, a one-step gas-involved Barbier reaction for the synthesis of carboxylic acids under electromagnetic mill conditions is presented. This approach utilizes gas CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at ambient pressure, which holds significant promise for isotope-labeling chemistry. A variety of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-labeled carboxylic acids is synthesized efficiently using this method. This gas-involved, liquid-assisted grinding transformation could accelerate the advancement of this field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 17, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a next step to click chemistry, the current paper introduces solvent&#8208;free, mechanochemical SuFEx reactions. The reaction is shown to be highly effective, allows gram&#8208;scale syntheses, and works with a very wide scope of phenols, thus marking a significant advancement in green chemistry.

Click reactions display many of the goals desired for more sustainable chemical conversions. Yet, the solvent used is an often overlooked aspect in determining the environmental impact of reactions. In the current paper, the first mechanochemical method is developed for the efficient and solvent&#8208;free SuFEx reaction of sulfonyl fluorides with a wide range of phenols. After outlining the optimization process, which yields an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use and robust method. The broad scope of this approach is evidenced, and demonstrate this potential via the application to a range of natural phenols that also display other functionalities, and several gram&#8208;scale syntheses.

(Hetero)biaryls are crucial in pharmaceuticals and materials science. Existing aryl sulfonium salt methods require photocatalysts or transition metals. This work reports a mild, visible light&#8208;mediated, metal&#8208;and catalyst&#8208;free arylation using aryl phenothiazinium salts as dual&#8208;functional reagents, providing various biaryls and heterobiaryls in moderate to high yields.

The construction of (hetero)biaryls plays a crucial role in chemical science, with applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, natural products, and organic materials. While aryl sulfonium salts (aryl thianthrenium&#8208;salts and aryl DBT&#8208;salts) have provided access to (hetero)biaryls, these methods typically require photocatalysts or transition metals to activate the reagents. Herein, a mild, visible light&#8208;mediated, transition metal&#8208;free, and catalyst&#8208;free arylation of arenes using aryl phenothiazinium salts as dual functional reagents is reported. A variety of biaryls and heterobiaryls are obtained in moderate to high yields.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 17, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents recent breakthroughs in N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed amide bond formation, covering metal&#8211;NHC and metal&#8208;free NHC systems. It emphasizes sustainable, mild, and atom&#8208;economical strategies, offering new mechanistic insights and broad substrate scope for green and efficient amide synthesis.

Since the discovery of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), their role as ligands and organocatalysts has grown significantly due to their unique umpolung reactivity and strong &#963;&#8208;donor capabilities. In recent years, the field of amide bond formation has seen notable advancements through NHC catalysis. Given the wide application of amides in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science, several NHC&#8208;based strategies have emerged for synthesizing amides from substrates such as aldehydes, alcohols, esters, and nitriles. This review highlights the sustainable and efficient nature of NHC&#8208;catalyzed amide bond formation. Both metal&#8211;NHC complexes and metal&#8208;free NHCs offer diverse catalytic pathways, with Ru&#8211;NHC systems proving especially effective in redox&#8208;neutral amidations. NHCs promote reactions through mechanisms involving acyl azolium, hemiaminal, and Breslow intermediates, enabling high selectivity under mild conditions. Many of these methods align with green chemistry principles, featuring high atom economy and minimal waste generation. The versatility and tunability of NHC catalysts allow broad substrate compatibility, and recent innovations include metal&#8208;free organocatalysis, continuous flow processes, and electrochemical amidation strategies. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of NHC&#8208;catalyzed amide formation, summarizing key mechanisms, substrate scope, and catalyst design, emphasizing their dual role in metal&#8208;based and organocatalytic sustainable amidation methods.

A ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed annulative C&#63743;H activation of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl phosphoniums with CF3&#8208;imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides is reported, affording 3&#8208;CF3&#8208;isoquinolones in 44&#8211;98% yields. The reaction proceeds via a cascade of ruthenium(II)&#8208;carbenoid formation, migratory insertion, and aza&#8208;cyclization, exhibiting broad substrate scope and functional group tolerance.

Herein, ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H activation/annulation of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl phosphoniums with CF3&#8208;imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides is carried out to generate a series of 3&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;isoquinolones in 44&#8211;98% yields. A plausible mechanism involving a cascade C&#63743;H activation of arenes, formation of ruthenium(II) carbenoid, migratory insertion of the Ru&#8722;aryl bond, and intramolecular aza&#8208;cyclization is proposed. In addition, the reaction procedure features simple synthesis, wide substrate scope, and excellent functional group compatibility. Furthermore, the application potential of the developed protocol is demonstrated through successful scale&#8208;up experiments and subsequent transformations.

A plausible mechanism involving a cascade C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H activation of arenes, formation of ruthenium(II) carbenoid, migratory insertion of the Ru&#8722;aryl bond, and intramolecular aza-cyclization is proposed. In addition, the reaction procedure features simple synthesis, wide substrate scope, and excellent functional group compatibility. Furthermore, the application potential of the developed protocol is demonstrated through successful scale-up experiments and subsequent transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thiazolium Salts: From Thiamine to Cutting&#8208;Edge Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) in organocatalytic reactions is of paramount interest and has been the subject of numerous studies over the years. Indeed, this hot and vast topic has been covered and often updated in many excellent articles. In this review, this subject is approached by highlighting thiazolium salts from an evolutionary perspective over time. Indeed, the idea is to retrace the origins of thiazolium&#8208;based NHC by featuring the crucial role played by thiazolium salts as precatalysts: In other words, to provide an account from the umpolung&#8208;concept beginnings through thiamine biocatalytic crucial transformations to cutting&#8208;edge thiazolylidene organocatalysts.

In this comprehensive review, the history of thiazolium salts as N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes (NHC) in organocatalytic reactions is intended to be presented. Although the subject (i.e., NHC in organocatalysis) has been covered in several reviews in past years, the idea here stands on the exclusive use of thiazolium salts in such transformations. Indeed, thiazoliums and their related NHCs are the first identified as efficient mediators for the C&#63743;C bond formation through its peculiar ability to reverse the classical reactivity (umpolung) of carbonyl groups. However, they are relatively quickly overtaken by other classes of NHCs generated from imidazolium and triazolium salts. Even though, thiazolylidenes are still better catalysts in some particular reactions affording outstanding results in terms of conversion and selectivity. Owing to the remarkably high number of reactions that are made possible thanks to the very characteristic properties of such NHCs, the aim of this review is to provide a full account on the discovery and evolution of thiazolium salts and thiazolylidenes in NHC organocatalysis. Information is&#160;first&#160;provided on their synthesis, structural evolution, physicochemical and electronic properties, and then reactivity and application in various organocatalytic methodologies.

Cyclic ethers are prevalent structural motifs in natural products and pharmaceuticals, and their efficient synthesis has attracted significant attention in organic chemistry. An approach for the functionalization of cyclic ethers via gold&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization and rearrangement is developed. This transformation enabled the synthesis of C&#8208;glycoside derivatives from alkynyl compounds bearing O&#8208;glycosides.

A synthetic approach for the functionalization of cyclic ethers from ortho&#8208;alkynylarylmethanol derivatives protected by cyclic ethers via gold&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization and rearrangement is developed. The gold&#8208;catalyzed 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization yielded various functionalized cyclic ethers.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electro&#8208;oxidative protocol for the alkoxylation&#8208;thiolation of vinyl ethers is developed, employing nonvolatile diaryl disulfides as atom&#8208;economical arylthio sources under oxidant&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free conditions. 4&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)pyridine is used as a base additive to suppress side reactions and improve the yield. A wide range of substrates with diverse structures and functional groups are compatible with this protocol. Mechanism experiments show that the reaction involves a mechanism in which an arylthio radical is generated at the anode as the key intermediate.

         <title>Photoinduced Ligated Boryl Radical&#8208;Mediated Functionalization of Organic Halides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents the latest advancements in ligated boryl radical&#8208;mediated XAT chemistry, emphasizing the diversity of achievable reactions, the fundamental reaction pathways, and the valuable mechanistic insights uncovered.

Halogen atom transfers (XATs) represent a valuable class of reactions that facilitate the functionalization of C&#63743;X bonds in alkyl and aryl halides. Historically, these transformations relied on tin&#8208; or silicon&#8208;based reagents, which are plagued by several drawbacks, including toxicity, complex synthesis, and high costs. In response to these limitations, ligated boranes have recently emerged as a greener alternative, functioning as efficient halogen abstractors through the generation of reactive boryl radical species. This approach enables the selective and straightforward formation of alkyl and aryl radicals from their halide precursors, opening the door to a wide range of chemical transformations. This review highlights the most recent progress in ligated boryl radical&#8208;mediated XAT chemistry, focusing on the variety of accessible reactions, the underlying mechanisms, and the mechanistic insights gained. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review dedicated to boryl radical&#8208;mediated XAT processes. With growing interest in this area among synthetic chemists, the authors aim to provide both researchers and students with a clear overview of current advancements and inspire future exploration of ligated boryl radical chemistry.

Construction of meta&#8208;Disubstituted Triaryls via Iodine&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Aromatization Coupling of Cycloalkenes with Indoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxidative aromatization coupling strategy has been developed for the construction of meta&#8208;substituted unsymmetric triaryls using various substituted cyclohexenes and indoles. It is expected that this protocol may be of broad interest in chemistry community and constitutes a practical alternative to the synthesis of natural products, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials.

meta&#8208;Disubstituted triaryls are privileged scaffolds in bioactive molecules and functional materials, but their efficient synthesis remains challenging, due to limitations in regioselectivity and reliance on prefunctionalized substrates or transition metals. Herein, an iodine&#8208;catalyzed oxidative aromatization strategy is reported for the construction of meta&#8208;triaryls via direct coupling of readily available cycloalkenes with indoles. This protocol enables regioselective C&#63743;C bond formation at the indole C3&#8208;position and a subsequent dehydrogenative desaturation of the cycloalkene component to form the meta&#8208;substituted arene motif. The method features broad substrate scope, accommodating diverse substituted cycloalkenes and indoles. Key advantages include economical catalyst (HI as iodine source), avoidance of precious metals, and operational simplicity. Additionally, the products can undergo an array of synthetic transformations, including heterocycle skeleton editing to quinolines, halogenations, and photoredox functionalizations, which highlight the potential applications of this strategy.

         <title>Thioether Synthesis via the Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Cross Electrophile Coupling of Aryl/Alkyl Disulfides and Aryl/Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel catalyzed electrochemical cross&#8208;electrophile coupling approach for the base&#8208;free synthesis of (un)symmetric (hetero)aryl and alkyl sulfides from organic halides and disulfides is described. The reaction is broadly applicable and tolerates water and air atmosphere.

A formal cross&#8208;electrophile coupling approach enables the base&#8208;free synthesis of (un)symmetric (hetero)aryl and alkyl sulfides from organic halides and disulfides. This water and air&#8208;tolerant process utilizes the addition of electrochemically generated thiolate to an in situ&#8208;generated reactive nickel species.

Cu+&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly engineering narrows the bandgap of ZIF&#8208;67 while extending the light absorption range of CoCu&#8208;ZIF. The staggered energy levels in the resulting CoCu&#8208;ZIF/Cu3P&#8208;GDY composite generate a strong driving force. The formation of an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction between GDY and CoCu&#8208;ZIF. Cu3P acts as an electron bridge to promote the directional transfer of photogenerated carriers driven by interfacial electric fields.

Rational design of interfacial electric fields in nanostructures for accelerated photogenerated carrier transfer and separation. First, Cu+&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly engineering narrows the bandgap of ZIF&#8208;67 while extending the light absorption range of CoCu&#8208;ZIF. Furthermore, hierarchical architecture is constructed to incorporate the cocatalyst Cu3P&#8208;GDY. The staggered energy levels in the resulting CoCu&#8208;ZIF/Cu3P&#8208;GDY composite generate a strong driving force. Comprehensive characterization, including density functional theory calculations and Mott&#8211;Schottky analysis, confirm the formation of an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction between GDY and CoCu&#8208;ZIF. Cu3P acts as an electron bridge to promote the directional transfer of photogenerated carriers driven by interfacial electric fields. Differential surface photovoltage signals demonstrate that the robust interfacial electric field enables efficient carrier separation in the CoCu&#8208;ZIF/Cu3P&#8208;GDY composite. This work establishes a new paradigm for enhancing catalytic performance through broadened light absorption and rationally engineered interfacial electric fields.

         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in the cyclization chemistry of N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts and their derivatives, with a particular focus on transition&#8208;metal catalyzed, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free systems and visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced transformations. The scope, limitations, and synthetic applications of various cyclization strategies are critically discussed, aiming to reveal the innovative potential of N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts as nitrogen&#8208;based precursors in synthetic chemistry.

N&#8208;Aminopyridinium salts are readily available and bench&#8208;stable nitrogen&#8208;containing precursors that have demonstrated broad synthetic utility in diverse cyclization reactions. As practical 1,3&#8208;dipoles, N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts can engage with dipolarophiles in cycloaddition reactions to construct nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. Moreover, as a class of novel aminating or bifunctional aminating reagents, they are capable of generating nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals under visible&#8208;light irradiation, which can initiate amination&#8208;cyclization processes. In recent years, cyclization strategies involving N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts have made remarkable progress and garnered significant attention.

         <dc:description>
The oxidative acylation of dehydroalanine units with aldehydes toward the access to unnatural &#947;&#8208;carbonyl &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives is described. The use of mono N&#8208;protected amino esters ushers in the synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds in a predictable (Z) stereoselective fashion. Density functional theory studies provide insights into the stereodetermining step of the iron&#8208;catalyzed radical reaction pathway.

An iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidative acylation of acylamido acrylates with abundant aldehydes has been developed. The use of mono N&#8208;protected amino acids results in the unusual assembly of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds in a predictable (Z)&#8208;stereoselective fashion, thereby offering a complementary tool toward the synthesis of unnatural &#947;&#8208;carbonyl &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives.

Density functional theory&#160;studies provide insights into the stereodetermining step of the radical reaction pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A highly efficient gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cycloisomerization of readily available 1,6&#8208;oxygenated enynes, enabling direct access to valuable 3&#8208;oxabicyclo[4.1.0]hept&#8208;4&#8208;ene scaffolds with excellent enantiomeric excesses (up to &gt;99% ee, 35 derivatives), in the presence of a chiral cationic Au(I) catalyst ((S)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;MeOBIPHEP(AuCl)2 /AgOTf system) in toluene is described. The resulting chiral bicyclic ethers serve as versatile intermediates for the synthesis of novel hedonic derivatives.

A highly efficient gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cycloisomerization of readily available 1,6&#8208;oxygenated enynes is reported, enabling direct access to valuable 3&#8208;oxabicyclo[4.1.0]hept&#8208;4&#8208;ene scaffolds with excellent enantiomeric excesses (up to&#8201;&gt;99% ee, 35 derivatives), in the presence of a chiral cationic Au(I) catalyst ((S)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;MeOBIPHEP(AuCl)2 /AgOTf system) in toluene. This methodology uniquely combines high stereoselectivity with good to excellent yields for volatile substrates that have been challenging derivatives in the asymmetric cycloisomerization community. Notably, the resulting chiral bicyclic ethers serve as versatile intermediates for the synthesis of novel hedonic derivatives. A systematic investigation of their odor profiles reveals remarkable differences between enantiomers, demonstrating the profound impact of molecular chirality on olfactory perception.

         <title>A Versatile Route to 3,3&#8208;Disubstituded Phthalides Via Arylogous Michael Addition Catalyzed by Organic Base</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the 3,3&#8208;disubstituted phthalide synthesis. This phthalide expansion toolkit involves a mild and organocatalytic Michael addition protocol to couple 3&#8208;arylphthalides with Michael acceptors, demonstrating broad functional group tolerance, gram&#8208;scale feasibility, and utility for the preparation of spiro&#8208;phthalide scaffold. 

The 3,3&#8208;disubstituted phthalide scaffold, a privileged structure in medicinal chemistry and natural product synthesis, serves as a key motif in many bioactive compounds. Leveraging the solvent&#8208;dependent pKa modulation of organic bases, this study introduces a mild, organocatalytic Michael addition protocol for coupling diverse 3&#8208;arylphthalides with Michael acceptors. The method demonstrates broad functional group tolerance, accommodating electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents. The versatility of this methodology is highlighted by mild reaction conditions, short reaction times, and gram&#8208;scale feasibility. Finally, the approach may open the gate to asymmetric catalysis, offering access to enantiomerically enriched phthalides.

Chemodivergent Higher&#8208;Order Annulation of Azaheptafulvenes with Enals through N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis.

A base&#8208;directed, chemodivergent, higher&#8208;order annulation between azaheptafulvenes and enals has been developed through N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis. In the presence of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene organocatalyst, DBU promotes an [8&#8201;+&#8201;3] annulation with excellent chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivities, whereas the reaction proceeds via an [8&#8201;+&#8201;2] annulation when potassium carbonate is used as the base. In addition, the reaction can be carried out on a gram scale, and the products are efficiently converted into bicyclic derivatives.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalyzed Selective Synthesis of 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;Dithianes From Thietanes: An Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although this article formally presents a regioselective photochemical ring enlargement of thietanes into 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;dithianes, time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations have revealed that 1,3&#8208;dithianes are in fact formed thought photoinduced hydrogen atom transfers from 1,2&#8208;dithianes initially resulting from the ring enlargement using thioaldehyde substrates.

Unlike other sulfur&#8208;containing heterocycles, the potential applications of functionalized dithianes have been less explored to date due to their challenging synthesis. To address this issue, we herein leverage the straightforward access to functionalized thietanes and describe a selective photochemical ring enlargement of the latter to 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;dithianes using thiocarbonyl substrates, which are in&#8201;situ generated via a Norrish&#8208;type II fragmentation reaction. The library of dithianes obtained by this photocatalyzed domino sequence between diversely substituted thietanes and various thiocarbonyls revealed regioselectivity rules: excited thioketones lead exclusively to 1,2&#8208;dithianes, while excited thioaldehydes selectively yield 1,3&#8208;dithianes, where 1,2&#8208;dithianes serve as precursors to their regioisomers. The ring expansion reaction leading to 1,2&#8208;dithianes was also integrated into a triple photochemical cascade, where the thietane intermediates were obtained via a thia&#8208;Patern&#242;_B&#252;chi reaction between Norrish&#8208;II thiocarbonyl products and various alkene partners. These experimental results were complemented with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations, which support the complex chemical pathway, rationalize the observed regioselectivity, and further substantiate mechanistic proposals related to the photolysis of disulfide bridges in peptides.

         <title>Recent Advances in Ene Reactions with Carbon Enophiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the classical intra&#8208; and intermolecular ene nexus with carbon enophiles (alkenes, alkynes, arynes, and allenes) show a considerable increase in structural complexity and an enormous potential for functional applications in polymer science.

Ene reactions are inter&#8208; or intramolecular addition reactions between a four&#8208;electron "ene" component and a two&#8208;electron enophile functionality, in which two &#960;&#8208;bonds and a C&#8211;H (or metal&#8211;C) &#963;&#8208;bond are rearranged into one &#960;&#8208;bond and two &#963;&#8208;bonds. One of the newly formed &#963;&#8208;bonds is a carbon&#8211;carbon bond, while the other is the rearranged a C&#8211;H (or metal&#8211;C) bond. This transformation enables the formation of structurally and functionally complex ene products in a single step. Originally, ene reactions were discovered as concerted and stepwise pericyclic elementary processes. However, increasing mechanistic insight&#8212;gained through both experimental and computational studies&#8212;along with extensive empirical methodological work, has paved the way to a plethora of ene&#8208;type reactions involving carbon enophiles. Since 2012, the already well&#8208;established transition metal&#8208;catalyzed variants of ene reactions have significantly expanded. Moreover, highly reactive aryne intermediates&#8212;generated in&#8201;situ either by fluoride induced elimination from ortho&#8208;silyl aryltriflates at room temperature, or by hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of a 1,3&#8208;diyne with an alkyne (both inter&#8208; and intramolecularly)&#8212;find increasing application in novel ene&#8208;type sequences. Propargyl ene reactions also gain traction, particularly because the resulting ene&#8208;allenes serve as highly valuable intermediates in the design of domino sequences that lead to complex polycyclic fused structures. Finally, the implementation of ene reactions in polymer chemistry for the synthesis of functionalized polymers and renewable unsaturated raw materials has emerged as a promising alternative to the use of purely petrochemistry based substrates.

Finally, the implementation of ene reactions in polymer chemistry for the synthesis of functionalized polymers and renewable unsaturated raw materials has emerged as a promising alternative to the use of purely petrochemistry based substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Active&#8208;Site Microenvironments Design of Hydrogenation Catalysts for Enhanced Hydrocracking of Heavy Oil</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the regulation strategies of hydrogenation catalysts from the molecular scale to atomic scale for slurry phase hydrocracking (SPHC), proposes the design principles of active&#8208;site microenvironment for hydrogenation catalysts to enhance SPHC, and prospects the opportunities and challenges of hydrogenation catalysts for SPHC.

Slurry phase hydrocracking (SPHC) is one of the effective ways to achieve efficient conversion of low&#8208;quality heavy oil. The active&#8208;site structural design of catalysts is crucial to improve the performance but is still challenging. However, up to now, few reviews on the active&#8208;site microenvironments design of catalyst for enhancing SPHC performance have been reported. Herein, this review summarizes the research progress on the active&#8208;site microenvironments regulation strategies of hydrogenation catalysts at the molecular scale for SPHC systematically. Then, based on the problem of low hydrogenation efficiency due to the easy aggregation and low atomic utilization of molecular catalysts, the design strategies for catalysts on the atomic scale are proposed systematically. Subsequently, the design principles of active&#8208;site microenvironment for hydrogenation catalysts to enhance the SPHC are revealed. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of atomically dispersed catalyst for SPHC are prospected. This review provides an important reference for the design and development of high&#8208;performance hydrogenation catalysts for SPHC of heavy oil.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Application of Dioxazolones in Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroamidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the application of dioxazolones in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroamidation are studied.

In recent years, research on transition metal&#8208;catalyzed amide synthesis has increasingly emerged as a significant focus. Among the efficient amidation reagents, dioxazolones have demonstrated excellent utility in hydroamidation reactions, enabling the rapid conversion of substrates such as alkenes, alkynes, and enynes into enamine or aliphatic amine derivatives. This review summarizes recent advances in dioxazolone&#8208;enabled hydroamidation, with a detailed discussion of diverse substrate types, including various alkenes, alkynes, and enynes as starting materials. Furthermore, the performance and mechanisms of various transition metal catalysts in these processes have been explored. The synthetic strategies, reaction mechanisms, substrate scope, and practical applications of these transformations are comprehensively analyzed, highlighting the versatility and adaptability of dioxazolones in hydroamidation. We anticipate that this review will provide readers with a clearer understanding of this field, inspire further exploratory research, and advance the development and application of hydroamidations.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrative Decarboxylation of Nitroarenes with Alkynyl Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed denitrative decarboxylation protocol is developed, which couples nitroarenes with terminal alkynyl carboxylic acids bearing silyl, aliphatic, and aryl substituents. 48 aryl alkynes can be directly constructed from readily available nitro precursors and the yield is up to 85%. Significantly, the cost&#8208;effective and ecofriendly protocol permits efficient regiochemical synthesis of 3&#8208;substituted benzofuran or isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives.

A general approach for the decarboxylation of alkynyl carboxylic acids with nitroarenes via denitrative coupling is reported for the first time. The methodology demonstrates broad substrate generality, accommodating diverse nitroaromatics, including electron&#8208;deficient heteroarenes, to deliver aryl alkynes with high efficiency. Notably, this methodology enables the use of nitroarenes and aryl&#8208;substituted carboxylic acids to access diarylacetylene products. Furthermore, this protocol permits efficient synthesis of 3&#8208;substituted benzofuran or isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives, which is a challenging regiochemical outcome unattainable through conventional coupling strategies.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Photocatalyzed Decarboxylative Giese&#8208;Type Reaction of &#945;&#8208;N, O or S Carboxylic Acids: Insight into the Mechanism of the Radical Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;deficient alkenes can be functionalized with &#945;&#8208;amino, &#945;&#8208;alkoxy and &#945;&#8208;alkylthio radicals formed by Fe&#8208;photocatalyzed decarboxylation of the corresponding carboxylic acids. The reactions proceed under smooth ligandless conditions with inexpensive base and in the absence of oxidant. A mechanistic computational TD&#8208;DFT study supports the occurrence of homolytic Fe&#63743;O cleavage upon excitation of Fe(III)&#8208;carboxylate complexes by visible light.

Very simple conditions are described for the Fe&#8208;photocatalyzedaddition of &#945;&#8208;amino, &#945;&#8208;alkoxy, and &#945;&#8208;alkylthio radicals to electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. The reactions proceed under smooth ligandless conditions with inexpensive base and in the absence of oxidant. A mechanistic computational TD&#8208;DFT study on the formation and evolution of the electronic excited states supports for the first time that, after Fe(III)&#8208;carboxylate excitation by visible light, homolytic cleavage of the Fe&#63743;O actually takes place, leading to a carboxyl radical.

         <title>Photoinduced EDA Complex&#8208;Enabled Radical Alkylation/Cyclization Reaction of N&#8208;Arylacrylamides with Katritzky Salts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated radical alkylation/cyclization reaction is reported between N&#8208;Arylacrylamides and Katritzky salts for the efficient construction of phenanthridines under mild conditions. Triggered by photoexcitation of electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes formed between salts and N, N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine, this strategy circumvents the requirement for photocatalysts and transition&#8208;metal catalysts.

As important structural motifs among N&#8208;heterocycles, phenanthridines are ubiquitous in significant functional compounds. Herein, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated radical alkylation/cyclization reaction between N&#8208;Arylacrylamides and Katritzky salts for the efficient construction of phenanthridines under mild conditions is reported. Triggered by photoexcitation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor complexes formed between salts and N, N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine, this strategy circumvents the requirement for photocatalysts and transition&#8208;metal catalysts. A series of phenanthridine derivatives are smoothly synthesized in up to 86% yield, demonstrating excellent functional group compatibility.

Copper(II) Complex Dispersed in Imidazolium&#8208;Based Ionic Liquid: Recyclable Catalyst System for Regioselective and Chemoselective Hydrobromination and Hydrochlorination of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu(II)/4,7&#8208;(MeO)2phen complex dispersed in an [EMIM]&#8208;based ionic liquid as a catalyst system for the hydrohalogenation of alkynes is reported.

This mild, metal&#8208;free method shows a broad substrate scope, operates in batch and flow systems, and offers a sustainable approach to fluorinated heterocycles with potential applications in medicinal chemistry.

A photoredox&#8208;enabled strategy is developed for the regioselective synthesis of fluoroalkyl 2&#8208;pyrazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ones via radical addition&#8211;cyclization cascades. This metal&#8208;free approach enables the efficient incorporation of perfluoroalkyl and difluoromethylene groups into methacryloyl hydrazide under mild conditions. The protocol demonstrates broad substrate scope, functions in both batch and continuous flow systems, and proceeds through a photo&#8208;oxidative quenching mechanism.

         <title>Stereoselective Access to &#947;,&#947;&#8208;Dihalo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Enols From Alkynes Combining Visible Light and Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereoselective synthesis of optically active &#947;,&#947;&#8208;dihalo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;enols remains unexplored. In this study, efficient biocatalysts are identified to enable their synthesis with high conversion and excellent enantiomeric excess. A one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step sequential process is developed, combining a light&#8208;driven reaction followed by an alcohol dehydrogenase&#8208;catalyzed step. The absolute configuration is determined using Mosher ester analysis.

Merging different strategies in one&#8208;pot processes is attracting considerable attention due to their straightforward and sustainable potential for synthesizing novel organic compounds. In particular, the exquisite selectivity displayed by enzymes and the possibility of coupling biotransformations with metal&#8208;, photo and electrocatalytic processes open new avenues for stereoselective synthesis. Herein, the preparation of chiral (hetero)aryl&#8208;3,3&#8208;dihalopro&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ols is described for the first time. To achieve this, a photochemical and biocatalytic one&#8208;pot sequence is developed, employing visible light irradiation and stereoselective alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) for the transformation of commercially available alkynes into optically active compounds in an aqueous medium. The one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step sequential approach involves a photocatalyst&#8208;free reaction between terminal and internal alkynes with polyhalomethanes, leading to gem&#8208;dihaloenones, which are subsequently reduced using ADHs. After optimizing the individual steps and identifying suitable conditions for combining both processes, the use of complementary ADHs enables the synthesis of a novel family of optically active allylic alcohols with high stereoselectivity. Their chemical derivatization is further explored, allowing the stereoselective synthesis of a chiral propargylic alcohol from the corresponding &#947;,&#947;&#8208;dihalo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;enol.

         <dc:description>
This study explores stereoconvergent cross&#8208;electrophile couplings of &#945;&#8208;iodoboronic esters via iodine&#8208;metal exchange, enabling their &#945;&#8208;functionalization without the use of transition metals. Highlighted transformations include &#945;&#8208;silylation, &#945;&#8208;borylation, and &#945;&#8208;methylborylation using a common chiral auxiliary. The work broadens access to structurally diverse boronic esters which are key intermediates in drug discovery and synthetic chemistry.

Chiral boronic esters are highly valuable building blocks in organic chemistry and related fields, allowing access to structurally diverse libraries, including those of drug candidates. Herein, stereoselective cross couplings of &#945;&#8208;iodoboronic esters with various commercial electrophiles are reported. These stereoconvergent coupling reactions proceed via iodine&#8208;metal exchange and subsequent stereoselective capture of the generated &#945;&#8208;boryl organometallic species without the use of a transition metal catalyst. The presented reactions allow the &#945;&#8208;silylation, &#945;&#8208;borylation, and &#945;&#8208;methylborylation of boronic esters using a common chiral auxiliary.

Herein, stereoselective cross couplings of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-iodoboronic esters with various commercial electrophiles are reported. These stereoconvergent coupling reactions proceed via iodine-metal exchange and subsequent stereoselective capture of the generated &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-boryl organometallic species without the use of a transition metal catalyst. The presented reactions allow the &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-silylation, &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-borylation, and &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-methylborylation of boronic esters using a common chiral auxiliary.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mild Electrochemical Decarboxylative Giese Additions with Applications to 18F&#8208;Radiochemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular electrochemical platform is developed to access alkyl functionalization utilizing decarboxylative radical generation. This platform enables the mild late&#8208;stage modification of privileged saturated fragments which have seen interest in drug discovery. The conditions are translated to a radiochemical workflow to achieve the synthesis of an 18F&#8208;labeled PARP1 inhibitor with subsequent biodistribution imaging to showcase broad applicability toward radiochemistry.

The incorporation of privileged saturated fragments into pharmaceutically relevant scaffolds has seen increased prevalence in drug discovery. Electrochemistry, a single&#8208;electron enabling platform, has demonstrated remarkable synthetic potential, particularly in alkyl functionalizations. However, these two concepts have not yet been fully considered in 18F&#8208;radiochemistry workflows. This work presents the development of a practical late&#8208;stage electrochemical platform that utilizes mild conditions, low voltages, and applications toward the installation of rigid alkyl bioisosteres onto relevant drug scaffolds. The utility of this platform is further demonstrated in the electrochemical synthesis of a PARP1 radiotracer and its application in subsequent biodistribution studies.

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Arylation and Alkenylation of Pallada&#8208;Endocyclic Enamines Under Mild Conditions: Reaction Development and Computational Mechanistic Studies</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly enantioenriched, unprotected piperidines containing a &#946;&#8208;C(sp2) substituent are obtained from a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling reaction with a hemilabile bidentate BI&#8208;DIME&#8208;type ligand. The reaction occurs via a pallada&#8208;endocyclic enamine without the formation of an endocyclic 1&#8208;azaallyl anion intermediate. Stereo&#8208;selectivity of the reaction is determined in a concerted process involving substrate coordination and ligand rotation.

A highly enantioselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction between 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl&#8208;1&#8208;piperideines and C(sp2) electrophiles is developed. The reaction is performed with a modified BI&#8208;DIME&#8208;type ligand under mild conditions, and following reduction ultimately provides unprotected cis&#8208;2,3&#8208;di(hetero)arylpiperidines and 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl&#8208;3&#8208;alkenylpiperidines in generally above 95% ees. Based on combined experimental and computational studies, it is proposed that the dominant pathway of this reaction likely does not involve an endocyclic 1&#8208;azaallyl anion intermediate. Instead, the imine substrate coordinates to the Pd(II) first, followed by deprotonation to directly form a pallada&#8208;endocyclic enamine. Due to the rigid ring conformation and the steric effect of the imine, it can only bind to the Pd(II) while the BI&#8208;DIME changes from bidentate to monodentate via a ligand rotation. The imine binding and the ligand rotation are concerted in a way that leads to the favored enantiomer of the product. Formation of the other enantiomer requires the two processes to occur in a stepwise manner, which has a high energy barrier for the ligand rotation due to a steric interaction brought by the substituent between the phosphorus and the oxygen atoms of the ligand.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydration Reactions of Diynes to Access Tetrasubstituted Cyclohexenones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsymmetrical diynyl mono&#8208;ester or symmetrical diynyl di&#8208;ester substrates lead to tetrasubstituted cyclohexenones under gold(I)&#8208;catalysis. The cyclohexenone derivatives are cleanly produced without the formation of their dienol form under mild conditions, in green solvents, and do not require the use of other promoter.

Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;carboalkoxy&#8208;3&#8208;substituted&#8208;cyclohexenones are powerful building blocks for the synthesis of a variety of bioactive target molecules. Their preparations require multisteps sequence involving the use of stoichiometric quantities of various reagents, while the catalytic approaches are limited to trisubstituted cyclohexenones. Herein, an efficient catalytic approach based on gold(I)&#8208;catalysis starting from unsymmetrical diynyl mono&#8208;ester or symmetrical diynyl di&#8208;ester substrates is described. The carbon chain linking the two alkyne functions can bear two or one substituent, or evenbe unsubstituted. Regardless of the nature of the substrates and independently of its substitution, the cyclohexenone derivatives are cleanly produced.

         <title>Ligand Controlled Regio&#8208;Divergent [2+2+2] Cyclotrimerization of Alkynes by Merging Electrochemistry and Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By merging electrochemistry and Ni catalysis, we developed the ligand controlled regio&#8208;divergent [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of alkynes, and tributylphosphine, sterically hindered bipyridine or &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands generated 1,2,4&#8208; and 1,3,5&#8208;substituted aromatics with high regioselectivities respectively. Besides, the semi&#8208;intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between diynes and alkynes are also amenable under this catalytic system, demonstrating the broad applicability of the synthetic method.

Transition metal catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions between three alkynes, a diyne and an alkyne, or a triyne offer a straightforward and typical protocol toward all kinds of polysubstituted benzens. Herein, the synthesis of polysubstituted aromatics through electrochemical nickel catalyzed cyclotrimerization of alkynes is developed. The regio&#8208;divergent cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes is achieved by judicious choice of ligands, and tributylphosphine, sterically hindered bipyridine, or &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands delivered 1,2,4&#8208; and 1,3,5&#8208;substituted aromatics with high regioselectivities, respectively. Besides, the semi&#8208;intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between diynes and alkynes are also amenable under this catalytic system. This approach operates without metal reductant, exhibits wide functional groups tolerance, ease of scalability, and furnishes 75 examples with moderate to good yields, including some biorelevant compounds. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory calculation reveal the catalytic pathways of 1,3,5&#8208; and 1,2,4&#8208;cyclotrimerizations, and the origin of the ligand controlled regioselectivity.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Cascade Synthesis of Isoquinolinone&#8208;Fused Quinoxalines Through Sequential Rh(III)/Pd(II) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new one&#8208;pot, dual catalytic strategy for the synthesis of polycyclic isoquinolinone&#8208;fused quinoxalines from commercially available N&#8208;(2&#8208;acetamidophenyl)benzamides and 1,3&#8208;diynes is reported. This transformation proceeds via Rh(III)/Pd(II)&#8208;mediated sequential N&#63743;H/C&#63743;H activation/annulation. Detailed mechanistic studies elucidate the reaction pathway.

A sequential bimetallic Rh(III)/Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed reaction of N&#8208;(2&#8208;acetamidophenyl)benzamides with 1,3&#8208;diynes via an N&#63743;H/C&#63743;H activation and cyclization cascade is reported. The one&#8208;pot synthesis of isoquinolinone&#8208;fused quinoxalines is achieved through dual&#8208;metal catalysis. The reaction proceeds via Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed, amide&#8208;group&#8208;directed C&#63743;H activation and migratory insertion of 1,3&#8208;diyne, followed by cyclization to form an isoquinolinone intermediate. Subsequent Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed aminopalladation, intramolecular migratory insertion of the C&#63743;C triple bond into the C&#63743;Pd bond, and protodemetalation furnish the isoquinolinone&#8208;fused quinoxaline frameworks.

A practical method for the synthesis of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines from cyclopropanols and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoles is reported. This method features no acid or base conditions, but has a broad substrate scope, high regioselectivity, and good functional group tolerance. The utility of this approach is demonstrated via the late&#8208;stage modification of marketed drug molecules and natural products.

Although several synthetic approaches for constructing 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines have been established, their production from cyclopropanols and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoles remains unexplored. Herein, a general method for synthesizing 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines via iron&#8208;catalyzed [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] annulation of cyclopropanols and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoles is presented. This protocol features no acid or base conditions, but has a broad substrate scope, high regioselectivity, and good functional group tolerance. The utility of this approach is demonstrated via the late&#8208;stage modification of marketed drug molecules and natural products. Furthermore, the reaction mechanisms of iron&#8208;catalyzed [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] annulation of cyclopropanols with 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoles have been investigated using control experiments and density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Diboron Reagents in Modern Reduction Chemistry: A Versatile Tool for Reduction of Various Functional Groups</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of diboron compounds as new greener reducing agents in organic synthesis. It will cover their unique properties, mechanisms of action, and versatility in reducing various functional groups, such as carbonyls, nitro groups, alkenes, and alkynes. By highlighting their advantages over traditional hydride&#8208;based reagents and catalytic hydrogenation, the review emphasizes their role in advancing sustainable and safe chemical practices. Additionally, practical guidelines for employing diboron compounds in laboratory and industrial settings will be included, along with comparisons to alternative methodologies. This review intends to serve as an educational and practical resource for chemists, researchers, and industries adopting greener reduction strategies.

Reduction of various organic functionality including aldehyde, ketone, nitro, imine, and alkyne has gained noteworthy attention due to its vast application of products in organic transformation reactions. To attempt hydrogenation several approaches have been reported by using molecular hydrogen as a reducing source. Besides, this diboron (tetrahydroxy diboron, bispinacolato diboron, neoglycolato diboron) has shown a promising and alternative approach for the reduction of the reducible functional group without using any molecular hydrogen. The ligand&#8208;free reduction approach of commercially available diboron reduces the organic compound by using water or organic solvent and metal salt making it an attractive protocol in the recent era of reduction as well as hydrogenation. Herein, we provide an extensive and collective overview of the diboron&#8208;mediated reduction approach of various organic compounds.

         <title>Bifunctional Organocatalysts and Br&#248;nsted Bases in Cooperative Catalysis for the Asymmetric [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] Cycloaddition of In Situ&#8208;Generated Dienes from Isochromane&#8208;3,4&#8208;Diones with Nitroalkenes</title>

Herein, the first asymmetric [4+2] cycloaddition is reported, utilizing in&#8201;situ&#8208;generated dienes from isochromane&#8208;3,4&#8208;diones and nitroalkenes, catalyzed by a bifunctional thiourea organocatalyst and Br&#248;nsted base cocatalysts, yielding highly enantioselective bridged and spiro lactones, with further investigations into novel reactivity and product formation, offering a new approach to natural product synthesis.

Herein, the first asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reaction involving in&#8201;situ&#8208;generated dienes from readily available isochromane&#8208;3,4&#8208;diones is reported, using nitroalkenes as dienophilic counterparts. The reaction is catalyzed by a bifunctional thiourea&#8208;epi&#8208;quinine organocatalyst, cooperatively assisted by readily available Br&#248;nsted base cocatalysts. This strategy enables highly enantio&#8208; and exo&#8208;diastereo&#8208;selective [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition with a wide range of nitroalkenes, leading to the formation of valuable bridged lactones, a motif found in many natural products. The method applies not only to &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes, but also to aliphatic nitroalkenes such as (nitromethylene)cyclohexane, leading to an unusual bridged spiro lactone. The reaction proceeds with complete regioselectivity, furnishing the products in high yields and achieving enantiomeric ratios (e.r.) ranging from 90:10 to 98:2. The use of Br&#248;nsted base as a cocatalyst not only enhances the turnover and promotes diene formation by vinylogous dienolization, leading to a higher yield in shorter reaction times, but also improves the enantioselectivity. In addition, follow&#8208;up reactivity is investigated, furnishing interesting novel bridged amino ester and tetraline motifs.

The first chromium(VI)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroxylative dearomatization of axially chiral 2&#8208;naphthols has been developed, via an efficient axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality transfer. This method affords hydroxylative dearomatized products in good yields (up to 85%) with outstanding enantioselectivities (up to &gt; 99% ee) and enantiospecificity (up to &gt; 99% es) under mild reaction conditions.

Axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality transfer is an important strategy for the construction of chiral centers, where the axial chiral reagents are mostly limited to atropomerically stable ones. In this work, a Cr(VI)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroxylative dearomatization (via axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality transfer) of axially chiral 2&#8208;naphthols is presented. This transformation proceeds efficiently across a broad range of axially chiral 2&#8208;naphthols, yielding hydroxylative dearomatized products in good yields (up to 85%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to&#8201;&gt;&#8201;99% ee) and enantiospecificity (up to&#8201;&gt;&#8201;99% es).

         <title>CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Cyclic Carbonate Transformation at Ambient Pressure Using a Mechanochemically Prepared Ti(III) Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ti(III) complex synthesized mechanochemically catalyzes the cycloaddition of CO2 (1&#8201;bar) with terminal, internal, and trisubstituted epoxides. Mechanistic studies by density functional theory calculations reveal that the superior activity of Ti(III) compared to Ti(IV) arises from its lower oxophilicity, facilitating CO2 insertion into Ti&#8211;O bonds, as supported by EPR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography.

A readily accessible Ti(III) complex, [Li(thf)4][Ti(MesPDA)2] (4) (MesPDA = N, N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;o&#8208;phenylenediamide), has been synthesized mechanochemically, offering a sustainable route to Ti(III) species. Complex 4, combined with [NBu4I] (TBAI), efficiently catalyzes the cycloaddition of CO2 (1 bar) with terminal and internal epoxides, bio&#8208;resourced diepoxides, and the tri&#8208;substituted limonene oxide. This work represents the first example of a Ti(III)&#8208;based catalyst capable of efficiently synthesizing cyclic carbonates from CO2 and epoxides under atmospheric pressure, and demonstrates the superior catalytic activity of Ti(III) compared to its Ti(IV) analog [Ti(MesPDA)2] (3). A detailed mechanistic study is conducted through density functional theory analysis to explore the catalytic pathways mediated by Ti(III) and Ti(IV). Key steps include epoxide coordination to Ti, iodide&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening to form a Ti&#8208;alkoxide species, and CO2 insertion into the Ti&#8211;O bond. The superior performance of Ti(III) arises from its lower oxophilicity, which weakens Ti&#8211;O interactions, enhancing CO2 insertion. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy confirms epoxide coordination and supports the formation of a Ti(III)&#8208;alkoxide intermediate. Further evidence for the latter species comes from X&#8208;ray crystallography of the Ti(IV)&#8208;alkoxide analog [Li(4&#8208;crown&#8208;12)2][Ti(MesPDA)2(OiPr)] (17), providing indirect structural evidence. These findings advance the development of Ti(III) systems in CO2 valorization and highlight the key role of oxidation state in catalytic efficiency.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Dependent Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation of Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Carbonates with 3&#8208;Alkylidene Oxindoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A divergent enantioselective synthesis of chiral &#947;&#8208;substituted alkylidene oxindoles and 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles from 3&#8208;alkylidene oxindoles and racemic Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates has been achieved using chiral Lewis base catalysts.

A substrate&#8208;dependent, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;controlled asymmetric allylic alkylation of 3&#8208;alkylidene oxindoles and racemic Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates has been achieved using chiral cinchona alkaloid&#8208;derived catalysts. This present methodology enables the divergent synthesis of chiral &#947;&#8208;substituted alkylidene oxindoles and 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles in a highly selective manner. Plausible catalytic pathways for the formation of these biologically interesting compounds are proposed. Density functional theory calculations have clarified the high diastereoselectivity of allylic alkylation of 1a with 2a and have confirmed that the chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles 6 are from an asymmetric allylic alkylation/Cope rearrangement sequence.

         <title>Synthesis of Polycyclic Oxazolinium Compounds from Aryloxazolines and Alkynes via Dual Photoredox/Gold Catalysis and Rhodium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of polycyclic oxazolinium compounds is synthesized from various aryloxazolines with silyl&#8208;substituted alkynes and internal alkynes via dual photoredox/gold catalysis and Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H bond functionalization, and affords silyl&#8208;substituted polycyclic oxazoliniums and polycyclic oxazoliniums, respectively.

A series of polycyclic oxazolinium compounds is synthesized from various aryloxazolines with silyl&#8208;substituted alkynes and internal alkynes via two synthetic pathways. By using dual photoredox/gold catalysis, the coupling of 2&#8208;aryloxazoline diazonium compounds with silyl&#8208;substituted alkynes affords silyl&#8208;substituted polycyclic oxazoliniums in 20%&#8211;36% yield. The coupling of 2&#8208;aryloxazolines with internal alkynes affords polycyclic oxazoliniums with up to 81% yield by Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H bond functionalization. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and circular dichroism reveal the successful coupling of chiral (R)&#8208;2&#8208;aryloxazolines with internal alkynes and affording the corresponding chiral (R)&#8208;oxazoliniums. Cytotoxicity analysis of the polycyclic oxazolinium compounds reveals cytotoxic activity on cancerous HeLa cells in micromolar dosage, with the lowest IC50 of 6.4&#8201;&#956;M.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Dearomatization for The Construction of Imidazole Scaffolds</title>

Lighting up flat aromatics: a visible&#8208;light photocatalytic dearomative acylation of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines using &#945;&#8208;keto acids as sustainable acyl radical precursors is reported, leading to dual fluorescent imidazoles.

Dearomatization is a powerful strategy for constructing complex carbocycles and heterocycles, though it typically relies on harsh conditions due to aromatic stability. Herein, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic dearomatization strategy for electron&#8208;poor imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines is reported, addressing a key limitation of current methods, which predominantly target electron&#8208;rich aromatic systems. Using &#945;&#8208;keto acids as acyl radical precursors, this mild method enables the efficient synthesis of structurally diverse and functionalized imidazole derivatives, a privileged scaffold in pharmaceuticals and advanced materials. Some of the synthesized imidazoles display noteworthy photophysical properties. Some of the synthesized imidazoles show dual fluorescence from deep violet to greenish&#8208;cyan, highlighting potential as innovative fluorescent probes. This work expands the scope of dearomatization and provides a valuable tool for accessing new chemical space in drug discovery and materials science.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced Oxygen&#8208;Doped g&#8208;C3N4 Catalyzed Aryltrifluoromethylation of Unactivated Alkenes with CF3SO2Na: A Heterogeneous and Recyclable Approach Without Metals or Oxidants</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, by using low&#8208;cost and recyclable oxygen&#8208;doped graphitic carbon nitride (O&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4) as a heterogeneous photocatalyst, trifluoromethylated dihydroisoquinolinones and indolines are synthesized in good to excellent yields without the need for metals, strong oxidants, or additives under blue light irradiation at room temperature. Recycle tests and gram&#8208;scale experiments demonstrate the practicability of the heterogeneous O&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4 photoredox system.

Utilizing metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalysts to convert solar energy into chemical energy and achieve efficient organic transformations through redox processes remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. With visible light&#8208;responsive oxygen&#8208;doped g&#8208;C3N4 as a heterogeneous photocatalyst, a metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free trifluoromethylation/cyclization methodology has been developed to synthesize a series of new trifluoromethylated dihydroisoquinolinones and indolines. In this system, the aryltrifluoromethylation of N&#8208;allylbenzamides or N&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;allylamides with CF3SO2Na proceeds smoothly in one pot under blue light irradiation at room temperature, affording the desired products in moderate to good yields. This semiconductor&#8208;based photoredox system allows for trifluoromethylation/cyclization free of any metals, strong oxidants, and additives. It is applicable to gram&#8208;scale experiments and recyclability tests without significant loss of reactivity. This methodology demonstrates great potential for constructing CF3&#8208;containing heterocycles in a green and sustainable manner.

A highly atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic palladium&#8208;catalyzed sequential hydrofunctionalization of skipped enynes with phenolic compounds has been developed. This method provided an efficient protocol to construct chromans in good yields with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity, exhibiting good functional group compatibility and gram scalability.

         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot, sequence&#8208;controlled di&#8208;functionalization enables diverse sulfonamide synthesis under mild conditions using DABCO&#8226;(SO2)2 (1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane&#8208;(SO2)2) as a sulfur dioxide surrogate. Two amines, potassium iodide as reductant, and isoamyl nitrite under nitrogen in acetonitrile produce symmetrical or unsymmetrical sulfonamides. This scalable method delivers high yields, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance with operational simplicity.

A streamlined one&#8208;pot, sequence&#8208;controlled di&#8208;functionalization strategy has been developed for the synthesis of structurally diverse sulfonamides under mild conditions. The reaction utilizes DABCO&#8226;(SO2)2 as an SO2&#8208;surrogate and engages two amines&#8212;either identical or different&#8212;in a stepwise manner. Potassium iodide (KI) acts as a stoichiometric reductant, while isoamyl nitrite facilitates the in situ generation of reactive intermediates under a nitrogen atmosphere in acetonitrile at room temperature. The transformation proceeds via a sulfinamide intermediate, enabling the efficient construction of sulfonamides with broad substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and excellent yields. The method features clean reaction profiles, operational simplicity, and scalability, making it a practical and mechanistically informed approach to sulfonamide synthesis.

         <title>Direct Photoinitiated Bromosulfonylation of Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct bromosulfonylation of alkynes and alkenes with sulfonyl bromides photoinitiated by 400 nm LED light proceeds under mild conditions, without transition metals and photocatalysts. The reaction is scalable, has good tolerance to functional groups and high yields of products. The use of bisimine additive allows to significantly increase the stereoselectivity of the alkyne bromosulfonylation reaction.

The reaction of direct photoinitiated bromosulfonylation of alkynes and alkenes with p&#8208;tolylsulfonyl bromide is reported. Low&#8208;power radiation with a maximum wavelength of 400&#8201;nm is used for the reaction. The reaction proceeds at room temperature under metal&#8208;free conditions. A photocatalytic bisimine additive is proposed that significantly increases the stereoselectivity of the alkyne bromosulfonylation reaction and increases the yield of products. The reaction scope is demonstrated with 49 examples. Methods for the subsequent functionalization of &#946;&#8208;bromovinylsulfones to obtain valuable products are proposed.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Mechanocatalytic Reduction of Nitro Compounds with Hydrogen Gas and its Application in the Synthesis of Drugs and their Intermediates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical reduction of nitro compounds using hydrogen gas is presented. In addition to enabling the synthesis of a variety of functionalized aniline derivatives, the method has been scaled up to gram quantities, evaluated for trace metal impurities, and applied to the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds and their precursors.

A solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical method for the catalytic hydrogenation of nitro compounds is reported, requiring only the substrate, low catalyst loading, and molecular hydrogen.

A simple and effective synthesis of sulfone&#8208;functionalized 6H&#8208;benzo[c]chromenes and 6H&#8208;benzo[c]thiochromenes via photo&#8208;induced triarylamine EDA complexes catalyzed sulfonylation/cyclization of biaryl vinyl ethers using inexpensive and readily available sulfonyl chlorides has been described.

An EDA complex using 4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;N&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;N&#8208;phenylaniline as the catalytic donor for the photo&#8208;induced sulfonylation/cyclization of biaryl vinyl ethers using inexpensive and readily available sulfonyl chlorides has been described. Applying this operationally simple and visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated general platform, 6H&#8208;benzo[c]chromene and 6H&#8208;benzo[c]thiochromene scaffolds can be easily constructed. This protocol tolerated a wide range of functional groups and provided the desired products in 33&#8211;86% yields.

         <title>Redrawing the Mannich&#8208;Type Reaction through Carbonyl Umpolung Reactivity</title>

GA: Herein, a conceptually novel one&#8208;pot multicomponent strategy is reported for the streamlined construction of five&#8208;membered imidazolidines from 1,2&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes (onefold), amines (twofold), and formaldehyde (twofold). This redesigned Mannich&#8208;type reaction that exploits a carbene&#8208;like activity of 1,2&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes (realized by &#8220;umpolung&#8221; reactivity of carbonyl compound) occurs readily under mild reaction conditions, exhibits broad functional group tolerance, and provides flexible access to valuable N&#8208;heterocyclic scaffolds.

Herein, the development of an effective 3 starting materials&#8211;5 component reaction (3SM&#8208;5CR) strategy is reported to assemble imidazolidine motifs from 1,2&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes, amines, and formaldehyde. In comparison with the classical Mannich&#8208;type reactions (3SM&#8208;6CR) for the construction of hexahydropyrimidines, this approach that uses azoalkene substrate (umpolung of carbonyl compound) as a donor/acceptor C1 synthon (carbene equivalent) enables practical construction of a library of previously inaccessible, structurally diverse imidazolidine derivatives with unprecedented ease. Inexpensive and easily available Lewis acid ZnCl2 is an effective catalyst for these transformations, making this methodology flexible for the guided introduction of the amine components into the final N&#8208;heterocycles.

The iridium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular &#945;&#8208;C&#8211;H addition to alkynes gives enamines. The intramolecular cyclization also proceeds to give cyclic enamines, which can be converted into cyclic ketones by hydrolysis.

The iridium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular &#945;&#8208;C&#8211;H alkenylation of N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;aminopyridine derivatives proceeds via alkene isomerization to give the corresponding enamines. The reaction is efficiently catalyzed by a cationic iridium catalyst under mild reaction conditions. The same catalytic system can also be applied to the intramolecular C&#8211;H addition to alkynes to give cyclic ketones after hydrolysis of the corresponding enamines.

The photochemical approach for [4+2] annulation of 1,6&#8208;dieneynes to 3,4&#8208;disubstituted fluorenones via triplet states by energy transfer (EnT) process under visible light irradiation is presented. These EnT process and radical pathway process are confirmed by Stern&#8211;Volmer experiments, and radical scavenging studies to understand the reaction mechanism. This mild photochemical methodology showed high functional group tolerance and high atom economy.

The method of photochemical [4+2] annulation of triplet states 1,6&#8208;dieneynes to fluorenones via energy transfer (EnT) process under visible light irradiation is introduced. The EnT process between rose bengal and substrate is well supported by Stern&#8211;Volmer experiments. Control experiments and radical scavenging studies are well supported to rationale the reaction mechanism. This protocol showed high functional group tolerance and high atom economy.

         <dc:description>The hitherto few explored &#945;&#8208;halomethyl amidine motif has been assembled through the addition of a lithiated (di)&#8208;halomethane (i.e. carbenoid) to easily accessible N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl substituted carbodiimides. Despite the inherent low electrophilicity of these heterocumulenes &#8211; as quantitatively determined in Mayr&#8217;s previous studies &#8211; their sp&#8208;hybridized carbon atom acts as a competent site of attack for these tamed nucleophiles. The overall high&#8208;yielding transformation featuring a genuine chemoselective profile &#8211; as documented by employing variously functionalized materials &#8211; is adaptable to the addition of dihalogenated carbenoids. Reaction products could be advantageously employed in nucleophilic substitution sequences, as well as, in further functionalization of the nitrogen atoms due to the constitutive heteroallyl&#8208;type skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>eAmidation: An Electrochemical Amidation of Aldehydes via the Oxidation of N&#8208;Aryl Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the use of electrochemistry has emerged as a powerful yet sustainable means of enabling key transformations. Amidation is one of the most frequently executed transformations in synthetic chemistry, and using an electrochemical approach, the current study has demonstrated the synthesis of amides from aldehydes and amines. Mechanistic work indicates that the reaction proceeds via the oxidation of an intermediate hydrazone to generate an acyl diazene as the acylating species. The protocol developed has enabled the synthesis of a broad range of amides, including access to pharmaceutically relevant products, directly from aldehydes without recourse for hazardous chemical oxidants and activating agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand controlled regio&#8208;divergent [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of alkynes by merging electrochemistry and nickel catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions between three alkynes, a diyne and an alkyne, or a triyne offer a straightforward and typical protocol toward all kinds of polysubstituted benzens. Herein, the synthesis of polysubstituted aromatics through electrochemical nickel catalyzed cyclotrimerization of alkynes is developed. The regio&#8208;divergent cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes was achieved by judicious choice of ligands. And tributylphosphine, sterically hindered bipyridine or &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands delivered 1,2,4&#8208; and 1,3,5&#8208;substituted aromatics with high regioselectivities respectively. Besides, the semi&#8208;intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between	diynes and alkynes are also amenable under this catalytic system. This approach operates without metal reductant, exhibits wide functional groups tolerance, ease of scalability and furnishes 75 examples with moderate to good yields, including some biorelevant compounds. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculation revealed the catalytic pathways of 1,3,5&#8208; and 1,2,4&#8208;cyclotrimerizations, and the origin of the ligand controlled regioselectivity.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydration reactions of diynes to access tetrasubstituted cyclohexenones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;carboalkoxy&#8208;3&#8208;substituted&#8208;cyclohexenones are powerful building blocks for the synthesis of a variety of bioactive target molecules. Their preparations requires multi&#8208;steps sequence involving the use of stoichiometric quantities of various reagents, while the catalytic approaches are limitited to trisubstituted cyclohexenones. We describe here an efficient catalytic approach based on gold(I)&#8208;catalysis starting from unsymmetrical diynyl mono&#8208;ester or symmetrical diynyl di&#8208;ester substrates. The carbon chain linking the two alkyne functions can bear two or one substituent, or even be unsubstituted. Regardless of the nature of the substrates and independently of its substitution, the cyclohexenone derivatives are cleanly produced.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(II) complex dispersed in imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid: Recyclable catalyst system for regioselective and chemoselective hydrobromination and hydrochlorination of alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a recyclable catalyst system combining Cu(II)O and 4,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline in a 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid for the hydrohalogenation of alkynes. The reaction efficiently yields alkenyl bromides and chlorides with good functional group tolerance and regioselectivity across a range of functionalized alkynes. Remarkably, the reaction exhibits unprecedented chemoselectivity for alkyne over alkenes in polyenynes and enables late&#8208;stage modifications to rapidly synthesize brominated polyenes. The catalyst system could be recycled for up to six runs without significant reduction of the reaction yield.</dc:description>

         <title>SuFEx reactions when shaken not stirred
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Click reactions display many of the goals desired for more sustainable chemical
conversions.  Yet, the solvent used is an often overlooked aspect in determining the
environmental impact of reactions. In the current paper we develop the first
mechanochemical method for the efficient and solvent&#8208;free SuFEx reaction of sulfonyl
fluorides with a wide range of phenols.  After outlining the optimization process, which
yields an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use and robust method, we provide indications of the very wide
scope of this approach, and demonstrate this potential via the application to a range of
natural phenols that also display other functionalities, and several gram&#8208;scale
syntheses.</dc:description>
