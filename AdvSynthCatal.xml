      <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated S&#8722;H Bond Insertion Reactions of Diazoalkanes with Cysteine Residues in Batch and Flow</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract: We describe the application of S&#8722;H bond insertion reactions of aryl diazoacetates with cysteine residues that enabled metal&#8208;free, S&#8722;H functionalization under visible&#8208;light conditions. Moreover, this process could be intensified by a continuous&#8208;flow photomicroreactor on the acceleration of the reaction (6.5 min residence time). The batch and flow protocols described were applied to obtain a wide range of functionalized cysteine derivatives and cysteine&#8208;containing dipeptides, thus providing a straightforward and general platform for their functionalizations in mild conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Reprogramming epoxide hydrolase  to improve enantioconvergence in hydrolysis of styrene oxide scaffolds</title>
      <dc:description>Enantioconvergent hydrolysis by epoxide hydrolase is a promising method for the synthesis of important vicinal diols. However, the poor regioselectivity of the naturally occurring enzymes results in low enantioconvergence in the enzymatic hydrolysis of styrene oxides. Herein, modulated residue No. 263 was redesigned based on structural information and a smart variant library was constructed by site&#8208;directed modification using an &#8220;optimized amino acid alphabet&#8221; to improve the regioselectivity of epoxide hydrolase from Vigna radiata (VrEH2). The regioselectivity coefficient (r) of variant M263Q for the R&#8208;isomer of meta&#8208;substituted styrene oxides was improved 40&#8211;63&#8208;fold, and variant M263V also exhibited higher regioselectivity towards the R&#8208;isomer of para&#8208;substituted styrene oxides compared with the wild type, which resulted in improved enantioconvergence in hydrolysis of styrene oxide scaffolds. Structural insight showed the crucial role of residue No. 263 in modulating the substrate binding conformation by altering the binding surroundings. Furthermore, increased differences in the attacking distance between nucleophilic residue Asp101 and the two carbon atoms of the epoxide ring provided evidence for improved regioselectivity. Several high&#8208;value vicinal diols were readily synthesized (&gt;88% yield, 90%&#8211;98% ee) by enantioconvergent hydrolysis using the reprogrammed variants. These findings provide a successful strategy for enhancing the enantioconvergence of native epoxide hydrolases through key single&#8208;site mutation and more powerful enzyme tools for the enantioconvergent hydrolysis of styrene oxide scaffolds into single (R)&#8208;enantiomers of chiral vicinal diols.</dc:description>

      <title>Advances in Asymmetric Amino Acid Synthesis Enabled by Radical Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral amino acids (AAs), being the main &#8220;building&#8221; blocks of the living organisms, are also an important class of organic compounds which broadly applied in synthetic chemistry, biochemistry, catalysis and the designing of new drugs. According to the industrial&#8208;commodity market, chiral non&#8208;proteinogenic AAs containing various functional groups come to the fore. To date, radical cross&#8208;coupling reactions are becoming an option as an attractive powerful tool for AA syntheses. Owing to mild reaction conditions and high functional&#8208;group tolerance, radical chemistry represents an ideal strategy for the synthesis of challenging complex non&#8208;proteinogenic AAs. Moreover, the radical cross&#8208;coupling allows introducing AA residue into drug scaffolds and natural compounds. In the present review, we wish to summarize and discuss all the reported to date methods of the asymmetric synthesis of AAs using radical chemistry by presenting a comprehensive account of the literature in this &#64257;eld going back to 1990. We especially emphasize on a radical chemistry approach and, exclusively, on stereoselective synthesis of various &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;AAs and derivatives employing a different type of radical initiators starting from AIBN and organostannes and ending with powerful photoredox catalysis. Furthermore, the mechanism of the reported reactions will be discussed.</dc:description>
