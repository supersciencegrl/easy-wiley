      <title>Engineering an Alcohol Dehydrogenase from Kluyveromyces polyspora for Efficient Synthesis of Ibrutinib Intermediate</title>
      <dc:description>(S)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypiperidine [(S)&#8208;NBHP] is a key intermediate for the synthesis of mantle cell lymphoma drug, ibrutinib. Here, KpADH, an alcohol dehydrogenase from Kluyveromyces polyspora, exhibits evolutionary potential in the asymmetric reduction of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;3&#8208;piperidone (NBPO) to (S)&#8208;NBHP. By screening key resi&#8208;dues in substrate binding pocket of KpADH, an excellent variant Y127W was obtained with 6&#8208;fold improved activity of 119.3 U&#183;mg&#8208;1, 1.8&#8208;fold enhanced half&#8208;life of 147 h and strict S&#8208;stereoselectivity (&gt;99% ee). When catalyzed by Y127W, a complete conversion of 600 g&#183;L&#8208;1 NBPO was achieved at a substrate to catalyst ratio (S/C) of 30 in 10 h. Based on crystal&#8208;structure of Y127W, molecular docking and dynamic simulations reveal hydrogen bonds formed between W127 and Boc group of NBPO, as well as improved structural stability mainly contribute to the increased catalytic activity and stereoselectivity of Y127W. This study offers guidance for engineering ADHs for biosynthesis of chiral hetero&#8208;cyclic alcohols, and provides insights into mechanisms in catalytic activity and stereoselectivity toward car&#8208;bonyl&#8208;containing heterocyclic substrates.</dc:description>

      <title>The synthesis of pyridyl[2.2]paracyclophanes by palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of pyridine sulfinates</title>
      <dc:description>Substituted planar chiral pyridyl[2.2]paracyclophanes were prepared by the palladium&#8208;catalyzed desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling of bromo[2.2]paracyclophanes and pyridine sulfinate salts. Pyridine&#8208;substituted [2.2]paracyclophanes are useful building blocks in the preparation of catalysts, functionalized materials, and luminescent molecules. Yet the synthesis of many pyridine&#8208;substituted [2.2]paracyclophanes is more challenging than expected due to the instability of traditional coupling partners. Pyridine sulfinates offer a solution to this 	shortcoming, permitting pyridyl[2.2]paracyclophanes to be prepared from readily available bromo[2.2]paracyclophanes. Our preliminary results indicate the potential of this chemistry. Amine, bromine and ester substituted planar chiral pyridines that are hard to synthesize by other methods were formed but formation of (bis)pyridines is still problematic.</dc:description>

Amine, bromine and ester substituted planar chiral pyridines that are hard to synthesize by other methods were formed but formation of (bis)pyridines is still problematic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Synthesis of Hydrophilic Phosphorus Ligands and Their Application in Aqueous&#8208;Phase Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions in aqueous media are experiencing a constant increase in interest. In homogenous catalysis the use of water as a solvent offers advantages in cost, safety, the possibility of two&#8208;phase catalysis and simplified separation strategies. In the life sciences, transition metal catalysis in aqueous systems enables the ligation or modification of biopolymers in buffer systems or even in their cellular environment. In biocatalysis, aqueous systems allow the simultaneous use of enzymes and transition metal catalysts in cascade reactions. The use of water&#8208;soluble phosphine ligands still represents the most reliable and popular strategy for transferring metal catalysts into the aqueous phase. This review summarizes the recent advancements in this field since 2009 and describes current synthetic strategies for the preparation of hydrophilic phosphines and phosphites. In addition, recent applications of transition metal catalysis in aqueous solvents using these hydrophilic ligands are presented.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Enantiopure (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylglycinols are important chiral building blocks for pharmaceutical manufacturing. Several chemical and enzymatic methods for their synthesis were reported, either involving multi&#8208;step synthesis or starting from a relatively complex chemical. Here, we developed one&#8208;pot simple syntheses of enantiopure (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylglycinols from cheap starting materials and renewable feedstocks. Enzyme cascades consisting of epoxidation&#8208;hydrolysis&#8208;oxidation&#8208;transamination were developed to convert styrene 2a to (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylglycinol 1a, with butanediol dehydrogenase for alcohol oxidation as well as BmTA and NfTA for (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;enantioselective transamination, respectively. The engineered E. coli strains expressing the cascades produced 1015 mg/L (R)&#8208;1a in &gt;99% ee and 315 mg/L (S)&#8208;1a in 91% ee, respectively, from styrene 2a. The same cascade also converted substituted styrenes 2b&#8208;k and indene 2l into substituted (R)&#8208;phenylglycinols 1b&#8208;k and (1R, 2R)&#8208;1&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;indanol 1l in 95&#8208;&gt;99% ee. To transform bio&#8208;based L&#8208;phenylalanine 6 to (R)&#8208;1a and (S)&#8208;1a, (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;enantioselective enzyme cascades for decarboxylation&#8208;deamination&#8208;epoxidation&#8208;hydrolysis&#8208;oxidation&#8208;transamination were developed. The engineered E. coli strains produced (R)&#8208;1a and (S)&#8208;1a in high ee at 576 mg/L and 356 mg/L, respectively, from L&#8208;phenylalanine 6, as the first synthesis of these compounds from a bio&#8208;based chemical. Finally, L&#8208;phenylalanine biosynthesis pathway was combined with (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;enantioselective cascade in one strain or coupled strains, to achieve the first synthesis of (R)&#8208;1a and (S)&#8208;1a from a renewable feedstock.

      <title>Catalytic Photoredox Allylation of Aldehydes Promoted by a Cobalt Complex</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. The preparation of homoallylic alcohols by addition organometallic allyl compounds to carbonyls is an important strategy in organic chemistry. Allylating organometallic cobalt species can be generated employing stoichiometric quantities of Zn acting as reductant. To avoid the employment of stoichiometric amount of Zn, we have developed an allylation reaction of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes promoted by photoredox catalysis in the presence of a cobalt complex, and we present herein a full account of our research.

      <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed tandem trifluoromethylation/cyclization/remote oxidation of 1,6&#8208;dienes has been achieved. A broad range of trifluoromethyl group&#8208;containing tetrahydrofurans or tetrahydropyrroles could be generated in good yields and with excellent diastereoselectivity by using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as oxidant. The mild and facile protocol affords direct access to trifluoromethyl group&#8208;bearing tetrahydrofurans and tetrahydropyrroles via difunctionalization of olefins.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Saturated heterocycles are found widely in biologically active compounds such as medicinal drugs and agrochemicals.

      <title>Electrochemical Regioselective Phosphorylation of Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Heterocycles and Related Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>The site&#8208;selective functionalization of biologically important nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles and related derivatives remains a challenging and important task.

      <title>Selective Construction of C&#8211;C and C=C Bonds by Manganese Catalyzed Coupling of Alcohols with Phosphorus Ylides</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report the manganese catalyzed coupling of alcohols with phosphorus ylides. The selectivity in the coupling of primary alcohols with phosphorus ylides to form carbon&#8211;carbon single (C&#8211;C) and carbon&#8211;carbon double (C=C) bonds can be controlled by the ligands. In the conversion of more challenging secondary alcohols with phosphorus ylides the selectivity towards the formation of C&#8211;C vs. C=C bonds can be controlled by the reaction conditions, namely the amount of base. The scope and limitations of the coupling reactions were thoroughly evaluated by the conversion of 21 alcohols and 15 ylides. Notably, compared to existing methods, which are based on precious metal complexes as catalysts, the present catalytic system is based on earth abundant manganese catalysts.The reaction can also be performed in a sequential one&#8208;pot reaction generating the phosphorus ylide in situ followed manganese catalyzed C&#8211;C and C=C bond formation. Mechanistic studies suggest that the C&#8211;C bond was generated via a borrowing hydrogen pathway and the C=C bond formation followed an acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling pathway.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A method for Beckmann rearrangement (BKR) using ethyl 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfonyloxyimino) acetate (o&#8208;NosylOXY) under microwave irradiation is reported. Ketoximes (19 examples) are converted to the corresponding amides/lactams with 69&#8208;97% yields in ~10 minutes without any Lewis acid or co&#8208;catalyst. This is an example of halogen&#8208;free organocatalytic BKR. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)&#8208; and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)&#8208;based detailed mechanistic investigation suggest that o&#8208;NosylOXY acts as an initiator. Such initiators are reported before based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, we report here the HRMS signatures of two transient intermediates, the nitrilium ion and the nitrilium ion's dimeric species. Rigorous NMR&#8208;based investigation of the reaction mechanism is performed. Our results indicate that the reported BKR proceeds via two consecutive rearrangements.</dc:description>

There is a famous sentence in Tao Te Ching: &#8220;The Tao produced one. One produced two. Two produced three. Three produced all things.&#8221; In this front cover picture, Tai Chi stands for Tao, and &#8220;N&#8221; and &#8220;O&#8221; in the two circles represent N&#8208;oxides of this paper. Thunder and lightning stimulate Tai Chi to produce everything, which is represented by the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Therefore, this picture indicates that pyridine N&#8208;oxides can produce numerous nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds under the action of activating reagent.

      <title>Utilizing Alcohols for Cross&#8208;Coupling with Alkenyl Bromides</title>
      <dc:description>
The inside cover picture, designed by Takuya Suga, illustrates the merger of titanium&#8208;mediated homolytic C&#8211;OH bond cleavage and nickel catalysis that realizes a cross&#8208;coupling reaction between benzyl alcohols and alkenyl bromides. The direct application of alcohols to cross&#8208;coupling may set us free from tedious preparations of halides and homolysis&#8208;active esters. Manganese powder was used to reduce titanium(IV) and nickel(II) to their active low&#8208;valent forms that can cleave C&#8211;OH and C&#8211;Br bonds, respectively. More information can be found in the Communication by Suga, Takahashi, and Ukaii. (T. Suga, Y. Takahashi, Y. Ukaji, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2020, 362, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202000945).

     alt="Utilizing Alcohols for Cross&#8208;Coupling with Alkenyl Bromides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inside cover picture, designed by Takuya Suga, illustrates the merger of titanium&#8208;mediated homolytic C&#8211;OH bond cleavage and nickel catalysis that realizes a cross&#8208;coupling reaction between benzyl alcohols and alkenyl bromides. The direct application of alcohols to cross&#8208;coupling may set us free from tedious preparations of halides and homolysis&#8208;active esters. Manganese powder was used to reduce titanium(IV) and nickel(II) to their active low&#8208;valent forms that can cleave C&#8211;OH and C&#8211;Br bonds, respectively. More information can be found in the Communication by Suga, Takahashi, and Ukaii. (T. Suga, Y. Takahashi, Y. Ukaji, &lt;i&gt;Adv. Synth. Catal&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;b&gt;2020&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;362&lt;/i&gt;, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adsc.202000945"&gt;10.1002/adsc.202000945&lt;/a&gt;).

      <title>Organic Azides: Versatile Synthons in Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;H Amination/Annulation for N&#8208;Heterocycle Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Organic azides are highly reactive, which have long established as versatile building blocks in the assembly of structurally diverse N&#8208;containing heterocycles. The conversion of organic azides into high&#8208;value compounds is of great importance and a subject of enormous current interest. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;H amination/annulation of organic azides provides a powerful tool for the transformation of organic azides into a wide range of biologically important heterocyclic frameworks. In this review, we aim to summarize the recent progress on organic azides&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8211;H amination/annulation for N&#8208;heterocycle synthesis enabled by transition metal catalysts. Representative strategies are discussed in detail, including catalytic systems, reaction scopes, limitations and mechanisms.</dc:description>

The inside cover picture shows the palladium&#8208;catalyzed selective carbofunctionalization of inert &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;O bonds of aliphatic amides by using the strategy of sp3 C&#8208;H activation/&#946;&#8208;O elimination/hydrocarbofunctionalization with the assistance of 8&#8208;aminoquinolyl directing group. Notable features of the strategy include (i) the use of hydroxypyridones and analogous hydroxypyrones as nucleophilic reagents for the first time to achieve carbofunctionalization of C(sp3)&#8208;O bonds, (ii) the realization of inert &#947;&#8208;methyl and methylene C(sp3)&#8208;O bonds cleavage, and (iii) high functional group tolerance. More information can be found in the Update by Lin et al. The cover artwork was composed by Cong Lin and Liang Shen. (Q. Guan, C. Lin, S. Chen, F. Gao, L. Shen, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2020, 362, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202001091).
