         <title>Minisci&#8208;type Alkylation of N&#8208;Heteroarenes by N&#8208;(Acyloxy)phthalimides Mediated by a Hantzsch Ester and Blue LED Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synthetic method that enables the Hantzsch ester&#8208;mediated Minisci&#8208;type C2&#8208;alkylation of quinolines, isoquinolines and pyridines by &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;(acyloxy)phthalimide esters (NHPI) under blue LED (light emitting diode) light (456 nm) is described. Achieved under mild reaction conditions at room temperature, the metal&#8208;free synthetic protocol was shown to be applicable to primary, secondary and tertiary NHPIs to give the alkylated &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;heterocyclic products in yields of 27&#8211;99%. On introducing a chiral phosphoric acid, an asymmetric version of the reaction was also realised and provided product enantiomeric excess (ee) values of 53&#8211;99%. The reaction mechanism was delineated to involve excitation of an electron&#8208;donor acceptor (EDA) complex, formed from weak electrostatic interactions between the Hantzsch ester and NHPI, that generates the posited radical species of the redox active ester that undergoes addition to the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;heterocycle.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract. An efficient and practical sulfa&#8208;Michael/Michael domino reaction of (E)&#8208;4&#8208;mercapto&#8208;2&#8208;butenoates with difluoromethyl&#8208;eneoxindoles by catalyzed a quinidine&#8208;derived ammonium salts as phase transfer catalyst has been disclosed. Under mild conditions, a broad range of CF2H&#8208; containing spiro[indoline&#8208;3,3'&#8208;thiophene]s catalysed by only 5 mol% PTC catalyst, bearing three adjacent chiral centers including two vicinal spiro quaternary stereocenters, were 	obtained in high yields (up to 98%) with excellent diastereoselectivities (&gt; 20:1 dr, in all cases) and high enantioselectivities (up to 98% ee) in short reaction times (almost less than 20 minutes).

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Carbamoyl&#8208;Carbamoylation/ Carboxylation/Thioesterification of Alkene&#8208;Tethered Carbamoyl Chlorides using Mo(CO)6 as the Carbonyl Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reported a palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbamoyl&#8208;carbamoylation/carboxylation/thioesterification of alkene&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides using Mo(CO)6 as the carbonyl source. The reactions were typically performed with good functional group compatibility and tolerated different nucleophiles (amines, alcohols, phenols, thiols and water), which provided a new access to amidated/esterificated/thioesterificated/carboxylated oxindoles or lactams bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter under CO gas&#8208;free conditions. Furthermore, natural product mutation and divergent late&#8208;stage derivatization are the important practical features.</dc:description>

         <title>BiCl3&#8208;Mediated Tandem Cyclization of Tryptamine&#8208;Derived Ynamide: Concise Synthesis of Pentacyclic Spiroindolines and Tricyclic Indole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic tandem cyclization of ynamides has attracted considerable interest in organic synthesis because of its atom economy in the rapid formation of polycyclic compounds. However, examples on the construction of pentacyclic spiroindolines are quite scarce. Herein, we described a BiCl3&#8208;catalyzed tandem cyclization reaction of tryptamine&#8208;ynamides, which led to the formation of appealing pentacyclic spiroindoline scaffolds in moderate to excellent yields. In addition, such a reaction can lead to the divergent synthesis of tricyclic indole derivatives with moderate yields by engineering substrate structures. The synthetic utility of this methodology has also been demonstrated by further interesting transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>H2O2&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of 1,2,4&#8208;Thiadiazole Derivatives in Ethanol at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the H2O2&#8208;mediated synthesis of 1,2,4&#8208;thiadiazole derivatives under metal&#8208;free conditions at room temperature with ethanol as the sole solvent. Various substrates could undergo the reaction smoothly, providing the expected yields of the desired products. Moreover, the target products were obtained by filtration or extraction instead of column chromatography, which  requires  a large amount of organic solution and silica gel during purification. The developed synthetic method can be potentially applied in the large&#8208;scale preparation of 1,2,4&#8208;thiadiazole derivatives as agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Combined Photoredox and Carbene Catalysis for the Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Aryloxy Ketones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have emerged as catalysts for the construction of C&#8722;C bonds in the synthesis of substituted ketones under single&#8208;electron processes. Despite these recent reports, there still remains a need to increase the utility and practicality of these reactions by exploring new radical coupling partners. Herein, we report the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;aryloxyketones via combined NHC/photoredox catalysis. In this reaction, an &#945;&#8208;aryloxymethyl radical is generated via oxidation of an aryloxymethyl potassium trifluoroborate salt, which is then added into styrene derivatives to provide a stabilized benzylic radical. Subsequent radical&#8208;radical coupling reaction with an azolium radical affords the &#947;&#8208;aryloxy ketone products.

Abstract
C&#8722;H arylation of 1&#8208;pyrenylphosphine derivatives catalyzed by rhodium and directed by a diphenylphosphino group is selectively achieved at the K&#8208;region, i.&#8201;e. 4&#8208;, 5&#8208;, 9&#8208;, or 10&#8208;position of the pyrene moiety. This peri C&#8722;H activation/arylation of pyrenes using (hetero)aryl bromide coupling partners tolerates both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the arene, and provides isolated yields of products between 25% to 90%, including from bulky polyaromatic bromoarene substrates. We achieved investigations directed at the formation and reactivity of pertinent intermediate species in this C&#8722;H arylation reaction. The P&#8208;ligand coordination at rhodium was established using 31P NMR and XRD analysis, and we isolated five&#8208;membered rhodacycles as intermediates to the directed C&#8722;H functionalization. The data obtained overall supported the occurrence of a cationic rhodium catalytic process. We further described the access to a large class of pyrenylphosphine ligands and their selenated derivatives. Phosphine selenation allows to rapidly estimate from 1JP=Se values the basic character of the ligand in the perspective of their use for coordination. Accordingly, linear P&#8208;coordinated Au(I) gold complexes were isolated, in addition to the variously coordinated Rh(III) complexes. The present methodology significantly extends the scope of polyaromatics that are functionalizable at the K&#8208;Region by direct C&#8722;H activation, beyond smaller&#8208;sized naphtalenes and aminopyrenes.

         <title>Borane Catalyzed Selective Diazo Cross&#8208;Coupling Towards Pyrazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Decomposition of donor&#8208;acceptor diazo compounds leads to the formation of reactive carbene intermediates. These can undergo a wide variety of carbene transfer reactions to yield synthetically useful products. Herein, we report a selective borane catalyzed cyclization reaction from the combination of two different diazo compounds to afford N&#8208;substituted pyrazoles. The selective decomposition of the more reactive &#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;diazoester and subsequent reaction with a vinyl diazoacetate produces N&#8208;alkylated pyrazoles in a regioselective manner. Catalytic amounts of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (10&#8197;mol%) were employed to afford the pyrazole products (36 examples) in yields from 59 to 80%. Extensive DFT studies have been undertaken to interpret the mechanism for this reaction which was found to go through two tandem catalytic cycles, both catalyzed by B(C6F5)3.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Cyclization and 1,2&#8208;Shift to Prepare Pseudorutaecarpine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A variety of pseudorutaecarpine derivatives were prepared in good to excellent yields through a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed selective cyclization and 1,2&#8208;shift of N&#8208;alkynyl quinazolinone&#8208;tethered indoles. Mechanistic study revealed that spiroindolenines generated in&#8197;situ by cyclization at the the indole C3 position underwent an alkenyl 1,2&#8208;shift to generate pseudorutaecarpine. The reaction proceeds under mild reaction conditions, has a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and gram&#8208;scalable application. Furthermore, biological evaluation showed that most of the pseudorutaecarpine scaffolds prepared exhibit anti&#8208;inflammatory activity.

         <title>A Diastereoselective Catalytic Approach to Pentasubstituted Pyrrolidines by Tandem Anionic&#8208;Radical Cross&#8208;Over Reactions</title>

Abstract
Pentasubstituted pyrrolidines are ubiquitous constituents of natural products and drugs, however the access options to them especially with respect to absolute and relative stereochemistry are not well developed. We report an asymmetric synthesis of N,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentasubstituted pyrrolidines by oxidative single&#8208;electron transfer&#8208;catalyzed tandem aza&#8208;Michael addition/radical 5&#8208;exo cyclization/oxygenation reactions. The absolute stereochemistry is set by applying readily accessible chiral allylamines in asymmetric conjugate additions to various &#946;&#8208;substituted&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, which dependent on the substituent R2 sets the configuration of the two stereocenters next to the amine function, whereas two more are diastereoselectively generated by the radical 5&#8208;exo cyclization step. This allows the diastereodivergent single&#8208;step synthesis of pyrrolidines with four contiguous stereogenic centers. The stereoselectivity is rationalized by a predictive model.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Difluorinated Architectures from Trifluoromethyl Groups</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;containing moieties are widely used in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and material fields. Thus, these structures are of immense interest in the fields of organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. Among various fluorinated groups, the difluoromethyl unit has drawn increasing attention due to its unique pharmaceutical properties. In recent years, several methods for the synthesis of difluoromethylated compounds have been rapidly developed. However, most of these methods treat aromatic compounds with excess difluoromethylating reagents, which often contain organometallic compounds, so these transformations are generally less environmentally friendly and atom&#8208;economical. In this review, we summarize the recent development of new methods for the synthesis of difluoromethyl motifs or difluoroalkenes from trifluoromethylated aromatic compounds or trifluoromethyl alkenes via single C(sp3)&#8722;F bond cleavage.

         <title>Acridine Orange Hemi(Zinc Chloride) Salt as a Lewis Acid&#8208;Photoredox Hybrid Catalyst for the Generation of &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl Radicals</title>

Abstract
A readily accessible organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid catalyst is reported for the reductive fragmentation of &#945;&#8208;halocarbonyl compounds. The robust hybrid catalyst is a self&#8208;stabilizing combination of ZnCl2 Lewis acid and acridine orange as the photoactive organic dye. Mechanistic specifics of this hybrid catalyst have been studied in detail using both photophysical and electrochemical experiments. A systematic study enabled the discovery of the appropriate Lewis acid for the effective LUMO stabilization of &#945;&#8208;halocarbonyl compounds and thereby lowering of reduction potential within the range of a standard organic dye. This strategy resolves the issues like dehalogenative hydrogenation or homo&#8208;coupling of alkyl radicals by guiding the photoredox cycle through an oxidative quenching pathway. The cooperativity between the photoactive organic dye and the Lewis acid counterparts empowers functionalization with a wide range of coupling partners through efficient and controlled generation of alkyl radicals and serves as an appropriate alternative to the expensive late transition metal&#8208;based photocatalysts. To demonstrate the application potential of this cooperative catalytic system, four different synthetic transformations of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl bromides were explored with broad substrate scopes.

Abstract
We have developed a simple, One&#8208;Pot, three&#8208;component reaction of tert&#8208;propargyl alcohols, primary amines and acyl ketones to synthesize fully substituted pyrroles and pyridine derivatives in good to excellent yields with large substrate diversity. An eco&#8208;friendly calcium catalyst catalyzes the reaction to form the key intermediate &#946;&#8208;amino allene that undergoes subsequent Thorpe&#8208;Ingold effect assisted hydroamination and aromaticity driven deacylation reaction to yield fully substituted five and six&#8208;membered azacyclic compounds.

Abstract
The rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation and vinylene transfer of enaminones with vinylene carbonate have been proposed for the synthesis of substituted 1&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;naphthaldehydes in 49&#8211;84% yields. Several preliminary mechanistic studies and hydroxyl&#8208;directed derivatization reactions of 1&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;naphthaldehydes were also performed. This method offers an alternative approach for the synthesis of 1&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;naphthaldehydes.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Enzyme Cascade Catalyzed Asymmetrization of Primary Alcohols: Synthesis of Enantiocomplementary Chiral &#946;&#8208;Nitroalcohols</title>

Abstract
Biocatalytic asymmetrization of inexpensive and stable primary alcohols to prepare enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols is an important development in green chemistry for the production of chiral pharmaceutical intermediates. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step cascade reaction sequence in which first benzylic alcohols were oxidized to produce corresponding benzaldehydes using horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH). The in&#8197;situ generated aldehydes were then reacted in a biphasic medium with nitromethane by Arabidopsis thaliana hydroxynitrile lyase (AtHNL) or Baliospermum montanum HNL (BmHNL) catalyzed Henry reaction to produce stereoselective &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols with (R) or (S) configuration, respectively. Using HLADH&#8208;AtHNL, (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols were obtained in up to 64% conversion, and HLADH&#8208;BmHNL, (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols in up to 70% conversion, while in both cases excellent stereoselectivity (up to &gt;99% ee) was achieved. The concept was proven by functionalization of sp3 C&#8722;H bond of ten simple achiral benzylic alcohols to enantiocomplementary chiral &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols.

Abstract
Here we reported a one&#8208;pot, metal&#8208;free B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed strategy for simultaneous synthesis of C3&#8208;regioselective functionalization of indoles and complete reduction of quinolines. It turned out that by sharing a quinolinium hydridoborate intermediate, the original determining steps with high energy barrier in both the convergent disproportionation of indole and reduction of quinoline could be realized at room temperature, thus furnishing both the C3&#8208;borylated (or silylated) indoles and N&#8208;borylated tetrahydroquinolines in up to 98% yields at room temperature. Mechanistic studies suggested that both reactions would consume a product generated from the other reaction such that they can mutually promote each other, thus producing desirable products in a high atom&#8208;economy and low energy&#8208;cost manner. This strategy opened the gate to introducing mutualism to the field of chemistry.

Abstract
A protocol for performing atom transfer radical addition of activated alkyl chlorides to alkenes is described. The reaction is promoted by blue light in the presence of an organic photocatalyst (3DPA2FBN), serving to generate free radicals, and a copper complex (IMesCuCl), which facilitates the chlorine transfer step. The reaction works efficiently with fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated &#945;&#8208;chloroesters.

Abstract
The reactions of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) and isomeric &#946;&#8208;styrylmalonates with conformationally non&#8208;rigid &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines in the presence of Lewis acids were studied. The effect of the structural features of starting compounds on the process course was determined. The main attention was focused to discover the reaction conditions for the formal (4+2)&#8208;cycloaddition pathway with the possibility of variation of the &#945;&#8208;substituent in azadiene instead of known (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition synthetic methodology. Based on the results obtained, a method for the diastereoselective synthesis of substituted trans,trans&#8208;tetrahydropyridines was developed. Three substrate&#8208;sensitive diverse Lewis acid catalytic systems have been employed based on Sc(OTf)3, Sn(OTf)2, and GaCl3. The use of GaCl3 as a Lewis acid allows to obtain a minor product of the formal (2+2+2)&#8208;cycloaddition, which represents a fully 1,2,3,4,5,6&#8208;hexasubstituted cyclohexane derivative produced with diastereoselectivity &gt;30:1. Appropriate mechanistic and stereochemical models have been suggested.

Abstract
A three&#8208;component thioamination reaction has been developed in the presence of phenyliodonium(III) diacetate (PIDA) leading to the formation of a thioaminated products. This catalytic approach represents a method for the metal&#8208;free thioamination of 1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone. It was observed that maleimides also work smoothly under this metal&#8208;free reaction condition. This present method implies the oxidative coupling reaction through a one&#8208;step process with the generation of C&#8722;N and C&#8722;S bonds. Various aromatic and aliphatic thiols and amines provided the corresponding thioaminated compounds in 62&#8211;88% yields. A plausible reaction pathway has been predicted according to few control experiments.

Abstract
Multi&#8208;functionalization of the pyridine motif of indolizine was achieved through [5+1] annulative construction of pyridine from 2&#8208;hydroxyacetophenone and pyrrole derivative in the presence of Cs2CO3. The reaction is proposed to take place via domino aldol&#8208;oxa Michael&#8208;Michael&#8208;elimination&#8208;oxidation procedure, leading to installation of three different functional groups at the C5, C6, and C7 positions of indolizines. Solvent (2&#8208;MeTHF) and the hydroxyl of 2&#8208;hydroxyacetophenones seemed to play crucial roles for this successful cyclization event. Further elaboration of the resulting scaffold and expansion of this protocol using other methyl ketones were demonstrated as well.

The front cover picture, designed by Pavel G. Sergeev and Daria I. Filina, illustrates the comparison between reactivities of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes and styrylmalonates in the Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed formal cycloadditions with conformationally non&#8208;rigid azadienes. On transition from one synthetic analogue to another, the regioselectivity of the addition can change dramatically from the (3+2)&#8208; to the (4+2)&#8208;pathway. The choice of styrylmalonates has been shown to be preferred in these reactions. The (4+2)&#8208;cycloaddition between styrylmalonates and azadienes was optimized to provide access to the diastereoselective synthesis of substituted tetrahydropyridines in high yields. Details can be found in the Research Article by P. G. Sergeev, R. A. Novikov and Y. V. Tomilov (P.&#8197;G. Sergeev, R.&#8197;A. Novikov, Y.&#8197;V. Tomilov, Adv. Synth.

Abstract
Oxazolidinone represents a class of most important five&#8208;membered cyclic carbamates. They are of great significance for modern organic synthesis and are widespread as pharmacologically active compounds. This review summarizes recent advances in the chemistry of 2&#8208;oxazolidinones, with an emphasis on their synthesis, employing different catalytic systems or catalyst&#8208;free conditions, as well as on their ring&#8208;opening transformations through decarboxylative coupling, covering the period from 2010 to early 2021. Detailed mechanistic aspects are highlighted, hoping to help researchers to explore the hidden opportunities for reaction discoveries.

         <title>Asymmetric Addition and Cycloaddition Reactions with Ylidene&#8208;Five&#8208;Membered Heterocycles</title>

Abstract
Five&#8208;membered heterocycles bearing an exocyclic double bond have been successfully used as substrates in asymmetric addition and cycloaddition reactions. Ylidene&#8208;heterocycles are attractive substrates due to their high functionalization and the presence of an electrophilic conjugated exocyclic double bound that can participate in nucleophilic addition reactions as well as cycloaddition reactions, which may be triggered by the formation of aromatic intermediates or products in many cases. During the last decades, catalytic methodologies have been developed using ylidene&#8208;heterocycles as substrates in order to synthesize useful optically active heterocyclic derivatives. 4&#8208;Ylidene&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones, isoxazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ones, 2,3&#8208;dioxopyrrolidines, rhodanines, oxazolidindiones, Erlenmeyer&#8208;Ploch azlactones and 5&#8208;ylidene&#8208;thiazolones have been successfully used as substrates in asymmetric reactions. This review collects the powerful research in asymmetric addition and cycloaddition reactions where ylidene&#8208;five&#8208;membered heterocycles have been used.

         <title>Update on the Synthesis of N&#8208;Heterocycles via Cyclization of Hydrazones (2017&#8211;2021)</title>

Abstract
Hydrazones, as universal structural units, are useful synthons for the formation of carbon&#8211;nitrogen and nitrogen&#8722;heteroatom bonds. Thus, they provide new methods of constructing nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. In recent years, especially between 2017 and 2021, many efforts have been made to exploit hydrazone&#8208;based reactions in efforts to develop more powerful and effective pathways towards the synthesis of various multifunctional heterocyclic compounds. However, despite the tremendous amount of work that has been published over the past five years, no review has been published that summarizes the significant progress in the preparation of nitrogen heterocycles via intramolecular cyclization of hydrazones with adjacent unsaturated bonds or intermolecular cyclization of hydrazones with unsaturated systems. Therefore, this review summarizes the hydrazone&#8208;based cyclization strategies used to synthesize nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles over the past five years. It discusses the corresponding reaction scopes, limitations, mechanisms, and problems.

Abstract
Aryl enol acetates and DMF could promote radical difluoroalkylation of aryl enol acetates to generate &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;ketoacetates without a catalyst, an oxidant, or a base. When using different bases, &#946;&#8208;fluoroenones and &#946;&#8208;enaminones were synthesized by controllable C&#8722;F bond activation. These transformations provide an alternative method for the cascade difluoroalkylation and C&#8722;F bonds activation of aryl enol acetates.

Abstract
The rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed aryl borrowing amination of various diaryl methanols with sulfonamides have been developed. The amination of alcohols via C&#8722;C bond activation is less developed and remains a challenge. These aryl borrowing reactions feature mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance, and compatibility with a wide range of alcohols, overall comprising an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic procedure. Mechanistic studies indicate that a rhodacycle complex exist during the aryl borrowing amination reaction.

Abstract
The Cu&#8208;catalyzed high&#8208;chemoselective trifluoromethylation reactions of unactivated cycloalkenes via the modulation of appropriate ligands have been explored. The Cu(I)/appropriate ligands&#8208;catalytic systems overcome the key challenge in differentiating two pathways involving radical intermediates and provide a ligand&#8208;controlled approach for site&#8208;specific spiro&#8208;aryltrifluoromethylation and chlorotrifluoromethylation to afford trifluoromethylated spiro&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline compounds and vicinal Cl&#8208;containing trifluoromethyl cycloalkanes. Moreover, compared with reported chlorine sources, 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane is used as more green and economical feedstock for chlorotrifluoromethylation.

Abstract
Here we report a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed and atom&#8208;economical ortho&#8208;N&#8208;indolyl&#8208;N&#8208;pyrazolylbenzene synthesis from 1,2,3&#8208;triazapentalenes and ynamides. The reaction occurs through the cleavage of the triazole ring and formation of a &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene intermediate. An aza&#8208;Nazarov&#8208;type cyclization with participation of an arene ring is involved. The reaction consists in a formal [4+1] heterocycloaddition where the four&#8208;carbon synthon is provided by the ynamide. Finally, indole synthesis could also be performed in a one&#8208;pot procedure from their 1&#8208;propargyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzotrizaole precursors.

Abstract
Dearomative ring expansion/spirocyclization of indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates with propargylic alcohols bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing aromatic groups in the presence of PTSA leading to spiro[benzo[b]oxazine&#8208;furans] via oxygen insertion along with dihydrocyclopenta[e]indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates is developed; the same reactants under moderately high temperatures, afford fused pyrano&#8208;indolones. In contrast, copper(II) catalyzed annulation of indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acids with propargylic alcohols at room temperature provides rapid access to a different class of pentacyclic indene fused pyrano&#8208;indolones.

         <title>Synthesis of Heterospirocycles through Gold&#8208;(I) Catalysis: Useful Building Blocks for Medicinal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Gold&#8208;(I) catalysis was used for the intramolecular cyclization of tertiary alcohols with terminal alkynes to form diverse aza&#8208;spirocycles. The reaction was carried out with low catalyst loading under microwave irradiation to give both sulfonylated and acylated spirocyclic nitrogen derivatives. Gram scale spirocyclization was carried out to demonstrate the robustness of the reaction. An intramolecular Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reaction was performed to give several tetracyclic spirocycles. Double bond reduction and selective protecting group manipulation gave spiropiperazine and spiromorpholine derivatives. These compounds were incorporated into biologically relevant scaffolds to give the first selective spirocyclic inhibitors of LIMK1.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Carboxylation of Aryl C&#8722;H Bonds in Benzamides with CO2</title>

Abstract
The direct carboxylation of inert aryl C&#8722;H bond catalyzed by abundant and cheap nickel is still facing challenge. Herein, we report the Ni&#8208;catalyzed direct carboxylation of aryl C&#8722;H bonds in benzamides under 1&#8197;atm of CO2 to afford various methyl carboxylates or phthalimides, dealing with different post&#8208;processing. The reaction displays excellent functional group tolerance and affords moderate to high carboxylation yields under mild conditions. Detail mechanistic studies suggest that a Ni(0)&#8722;Ni(II)&#8722;Ni(I) catalytic cycle may be involved in this reaction.

Abstract
A variety of chiral nine&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles were prepared in moderate to good yields with high diastereoselectivity through a silver(I)&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition and [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement of N&#8208;vinyl&#8208;&#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitrones and chiral 3&#8208;propioloyloxazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones. Experimental studies showed that silver catalyst promoted the cycloaddition and rearrangement process, and the stereochemistry of the nine&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles was controlled via [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement by chiral oxazolidinone&#8208;auxiliary through a boat&#8208;like transition state. Moreover, the obtained nine&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycle diastereomers were converted to chiral pyrrolizines with high diastereoselectivity and pyrrolizine carboxylate was obtained in 54% yield with 90% ee by the removal of chiral auxiliary.

         <title>All&#8208;Carbon Tetrasubstituted Olefins Synthesis from Diazo Compounds and Iodonium Ylides under Blue LED Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A route for the construction of all&#8208;carbon tetra&#8208;substituted olefins through visible&#8208;light promoted coupling of diazo compounds with iodonium ylides was developed. A wide range of all&#8208;carbon tetra&#8208;substituted olefins was obtained in moderate to good yields. The synthetic values of the current method were further approved by the synthesis of natural isolates modified alkenes and the successful transformation of final olefins into important heterocycles.

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot protocol for constructing 1,4&#8208;difunctionalized quinoline/pyridine derivatives via the reaction of N&#8208;heteroaromatics, alkyl halides, and active methylene/methyl compounds was developed. The transformation involves dearomative functionalization of an in&#8197;situ&#8208;activated N&#8208;heteroaromatic to construct new C&#8722;N and C=C bonds. This reaction has a broad substrate scope and functional group tolerance.

         <title>Transketolase Catalyzed Synthesis of N&#8208;Aryl Hydroxamic Acids</title>

Abstract
Hydroxamic acids are metal&#8208;chelating compounds that show important biological activity including anti&#8208;tumor effects. We have recently engineered the transketolase from Geobacillus stearothermopilus (TKgst) to convert benzaldehyde as a non&#8208;natural acceptor substrate. Realizing the structural and electronic similarity to nitrosobenzene, we studied the TK&#8208;catalyzed conversion of nitrosoarenes to yield N&#8208;arylated hydroxamic acids. Here we demonstrate that wild&#8208;type and variants of this versatile TKgst enzyme indeed induce the rapid biocatalytic conversion of variously p&#8208;, m&#8208; and o&#8208;substituted nitrosoarenes to produce a variety of corresponding N&#8208;aryl hydroxamic acids via creation of a carbon&#8208;nitrogen instead of a carbon&#8208;carbon bond. Further structural modifications can be introduced by varying the donor component, such as hydroxypyruvate or pyruvate.

         <title>Enantiodivergent Reaction of Ketimines with Malononitriles Using Single Cinchona Alkaloid Sulfonamide Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
We report the enantiodivergent reaction of ketimines derived from &#945;&#8208;ketoesters with malononitriles using a single chiral source. The reactions using an 8&#8208;quinolinesulfonyl cinchona alkaloid catalyst in the presence and absence of Et2Zn gave both enantiomers in high yields with high enantioselectivities (53&#8764;99% yield, 99:1&#8764;3:97 er). The obtained malononitrile&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;amino acids were converted into various optically active compounds. A reaction mechanism is proposed to explain the observed enantiodivergency.

Abstract
Employing anilines as nucleophiles in double carbonylation is a longstanding challenge. In this communication, a Mn(III)&#8208;promoted double carbonylation of alkylborates or Hantzsch esters with anilines toward the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;ketoamides has been developed. By using easily available potassium alkyltrifluoroborates or Hantzsch esters as the starting material, and cheap and non&#8208;toxic Mn(OAc)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O as the promotor, a broad range of alkyl &#945;&#8208;ketoamide derivatives were synthesized in moderate to good yields with excellent selectivity.

         <title>A Radical Chain: Mononuclear &#8220;Gold Only&#8221; Photocatalysis</title>

Abstract
We herein report an unprecedented reactivity of mononuclear gold catalysts acting as classical catalysts and at the same time as active partners in a radical chain mechanism, whereby gold is the only catalyst. The mechanism of the photo&#8208;induced photosensitizer&#8208;free &#8220;gold only&#8221;&#8208;catalyzed cross coupling was studied in detail &#8211; experimentally and theoretically &#8211; based on the reaction between arylboronic acids and aryldiazonium salts. With a systematic set of stoichiometric experiments under various conditions and analytic methods, we could show that this mechanism is initiated by an aryl radical formed in the presence of blue LEDs and MeOH. This aryl radical enters the catalytic cycle to oxidize gold(I) to gold(II). Single electron transfer from gold(II) to the aryldiazonium salt then gives the cationic gold(III) complex by formation of a chain&#8208;supporting aryl radical which then is enabled to start a new cycle by oxidation of gold(I) without the need for irradiation. At least every 432 cycles of the radical chain, a new chain&#8208;initiating radical has to restart the radical chain. Eventually, the boronic acid is activated by the BF4&#8722; anion to transmetalate to gold(III), and reductive elimination delivers the desired product.

         <title>Stereoselective Cyclopropanation of BODIPY Derivatives by an Organocascade Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of enantiopure chiral BODIPYs is of paramount importance due the intrinsic properties of BODIPYs as fluorophores that could be used as probes for molecular sensing. The present study reports an asymmetric organocatalytic cascade reaction of meso&#8208;chloromethyl BODIPY derivatives with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes catalyzed efficiently by a chiral secondary amine. The corresponding BODIPY&#8208;derived cyclopropanes were produced in isolated yields about 90% and with high stereochemical outcomes (dr &gt;20/1, and 99% ee).  The synthetic utility of the protocol was exemplified on a set of additional transformations of the corresponding optically pure compounds. In addition, a study explaining the reaction mechanism (DFT computations) and photophysical characterization of all enantioenriched products were accomplished.</dc:description>

Abstract
Herein, we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated hydroalkylation reaction of alkenes using easily available aldehydes as alkyl sources via bromo radical&#8208;promoted photoredox decarbonylation. This protocol provides an alternative entry to C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation and features considerable advantages including mild and clean reaction conditions, obviation for transition&#8208;metal catalyst, and good functional group compatibility.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling and Sequential Reactions of Azides with Isocyanides</title>

Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of azides with isocyanides, as a new type of nitrene transformation, has become an expeditious method to prepare carbodiimides. Considering the compatibility of this coupling process with other systems, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed sequential reactions have become more popular in recent years. These remarkable advances not only involve many interesting reaction processes, but also provide useful strategies for the construction of nitrogen&#8208;containing structures, such as guanidines, amidines, isoureas, and heterocyclic compounds. This review will present a comprehensive picture of the development of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling process of azides with isocyanides and their applications in the preparation of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds. Catalytic coupling reactions followed by nucleophilic additions will be briefly introduced here. Most recent advances in catalytic cascade reactions involving a coupling process will be highlighted and make up the main part of this review.

Abstract
A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed interrupted click&#8208;sulfenylation of O&#8208;/N&#8208;propargyl benzyl thiosulfonates with organic azides has been disclosed. The unified CuAAC&#8208;thiolation provides a wide range of triazole&#8208;fused eight&#8208;membered heterocycles in good to high (51&#8211;94%) yields under mild reaction conditions. Moreover, a three&#8208;component reaction is also achieved involving O&#8208;/N&#8208;propargyl benzyl thiosulfonates, benzyl bromide, and sodium azide to deliver fused&#8208;triazoles in 61&#8211;74% yields. From a synthetic point of view, the present protocol has been demonstrated at gram&#8208;scale reactions. A plausible mechanism is also proposed based on experimental results and control experiments.

         <title>A Chiral Copper Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective O&#8208;Alkylation of Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Highly regioselective alkylation of sugar hydroxyl groups has always been an important challenge in carbohydrate chemistry, especially for the selective alkylation of trans diols, there is no direct and efficient catalytic method so far. A chiral copper catalyzed universal highly site&#8208;selective alkylation of trans&#8208;diols method is realized. This reaction is performed under mild conditions and has broad substrate scope. The selectivity of the reactions can be controlled by adjusting the copper reagents and the chiral ligands. This method was also applied to the site&#8208;selective modification of drugs and natural products.

         <title>Synthesis of Organoselenium Compounds with Elemental Selenium</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
In the recent decade, growing efforts have been devoted to employing elemental selenium as a selenium source in organic synthesis. In contrast to unstable, smelly, and toxic previous selenium reagents, elemental selenium is readily available, cheap, bench&#8208;stable, and easy to handle. This review will mainly focus on the strategies for the activation of elemental selenium and the synthesis of organoselenium compounds including monoselenides, diselenides, selenium&#8208;containing heterocycles and so on.

Abstract
The synthesis and the study of organoselenium compounds have received much attention over the past decades. Selenium&#8208;containing organic molecules are widely used in organic synthesis, materials science, and medicinal chemistry. Selenium&#8197;&#8211; and more specifically the amino acid selenocysteine, bearing a selenol (SeH) moiety &#8211; is present in at least 25 human protein families, whose biological functions have not been completely identified. Amongst the variety of organoselenium compounds, selenols are a versatile class of molecules easily undergoing a broad array of useful transformations. Because of the unique properties of the SeH group, selenol chemistry has important applications in chemical sciences, spanning from organic synthesis to materials chemistry and biology. This review summarises currently available methodologies for the synthesis of selenols and highlights applications of selenols in chemical sciences and biology.

         <title>Auxiliary&#8208;Free Remote Dearomatizative Nitrenoid Transfer for Enantioselective Construction of Spirolactams</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An Ir&#8208;catalyzed remote dearomatizative amidation for the enantioselective construction of chiral spirolactams in 70&#8211;93% yield with 81&#8211;96% ee was developed. This protocol represented a more atom&#8208;economical approach to chiral spirolactams via Ir&#8208;catalyzed nitrenoid transfer without the introduction of a traceless O&#8208;silyl achiral auxiliary.

Abstract
Visible&#8208;light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed metal&#8208;free tandem one&#8208;pot synthesis of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted 3,4&#8208;dihydroquinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones from easily accessible 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes, &#945;&#8208;ketoesters and 4&#8208;alkyl Hantzsch esters has been described. This mild transformation affords the desired products in 47&#8211;93% yields for diversely decorated substrates, and can proceed on a gram&#8208;scale. The efficacy of the current catalysis arises from the use of organic 1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) as the photocatalyst and CF3CO2H as the additive.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Triggered Self&#8208;Induced Homolytic Dechlorinative Sulfonylation/Cyclization of Unactivated Alkenes: Synthesis of Quinazolinones Containing a Sulfonyl Group</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A self&#8208;photocatalyzed sulfonylation/cyclization of quinazolinones containing unactivated alkenes with various sulfonyl chlorides was developed.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenative Hydroboration of Nitro Compounds and Applications to One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Aldimines and Amides</title>

Abstract
The commercially available and bench&#8208;stable Co(acac)2 ligated with bis[(2&#8208;diphenylphosphino)phenyl] ether (dpephos) was employed for selective room temperature hydroboration of nitro compounds with HBPin (TOF up to 4615&#8197;h&#8722;1), tolerating halide, hydroxy, amino, ether, ester, lactone, amide and heteroaromatic functionalities. These reactions offered a direct access to a variety of N&#8208;borylamines RN(H)BPin, which were in&#8197;situ treated with aldehydes and carboxylic acids to produce a series of aldimines and secondary carboxamides without the need for dehydrating and/or coupling reagents. Combination of these transformations in a sequential one&#8208;pot manner allowed for direct and selective synthesis of aldimines and secondary carboxamides from readily available and inexpensive nitro compounds.

Abstract
Chiral imidodiphosphoric acid&#8208;catalysed asymmetric functionalization of 3&#8208;hydroxy bisindoles was established. Sulfur&#8208;containing groups could be successfully introduced into isatin frameworks using commercially available thiols. The transformation was compatible with substrates bearing distinct substituents, both aromatic and aliphatic thiols were amenable to afford the desired products. A total of 41 reactions furnished various chiral 3&#8208;thiooxindoles in 23%&#8211;99% yield, with 72%&#8211;99% enantioselectivity.

Abstract
A versatile and efficient method for the coupling of maleimides and indoles at the C7&#8208;position has been established under Rh(III) catalysis. The present protocol was compatible with various functional groups, diverse 3&#8208;(indol&#8208;7&#8208;yl)maleimides and 3&#8208;(indol&#8208;7&#8208;yl)succinimides were obtained in moderate to excellent yields by switching reaction conditions. Moreover, this method further highlights the unique practical application for the conjugation with pharmaceutically useful compounds and amino acid derivatives. To explore the mechanism of this transformation, deuteration studies and control experiments have been carried out.

The front cover picture, depicts Metalaxyl, an acylalanine fungicide, which was synthesized through catalytic continuous sequential&#8208;flow reactions. A halide&#8208;free approach including two continuous&#8208;flow catalytic processes, heterogeneous Pt&#8208;catalyzed reductive alkylation and homogeneous acid&#8208;catalyzed amidation with an acid anhydride, was developed to minimize waste and enhance efficiency. Systematic examination of the two reactions in flow mode enabled a high&#8208;yielding, two&#8208;step sequential continuous&#8208;flow process, achieving continuous synthesis of an agrochemical.

         <title>Pyrrolidine&#8208;Catalyzed Annulations of Quinone Monoacetals with Naphthols: Synthesis of 2&#8208;Oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane Skeletons, Transformations and Reaction Mechanism</title>

         <dc:description>









Abstract
Herein, we report the pyrrolidine&#8208;catalyzed annulation reaction of p&#8208;quinone monoacetals with naphthols at room temperature. The reaction is also extended to including 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin, 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;methylcarbostyril, 4&#8208;hydroxycarbostyril, and several &#946;&#8208;ketoesters as the nucleophiles, thereby providing a collection of bridged cyclic compounds bearing 2&#8208;oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeletons in 41&#8211;96% yields. The reaction can be adapted to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and several transformations of the obtained bridged cyclic products are demonstrated for the preparation of polycyclic compounds that may find utility in related fields. Mechanism studies indicate the engagement of iminium intermediate in the reaction, and a bridged ring enamine intermediate can be observed by NMR.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report the pyrrolidine-catalyzed annulation reaction of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-quinone monoacetals with naphthols at room temperature. The reaction is also extended to including 4-hydroxycoumarin, 4-hydroxy-1-methylcarbostyril, 4-hydroxycarbostyril, and several &#946;-ketoesters as the nucleophiles, thereby providing a collection of bridged cyclic compounds bearing 2-oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeletons in 41&#8211;96% yields. The reaction can be adapted to gram-scale synthesis, and several transformations of the obtained bridged cyclic products are demonstrated for the preparation of polycyclic compounds that may find utility in related fields. Mechanism studies indicate the engagement of iminium intermediate in the reaction, and a bridged ring enamine intermediate can be observed by NMR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Dieckmann Condensation towards Spirocyclic Oxindoles Catalyzed by Amino Acid&#8208;derived Phosphonium Salts</title>

Abstract
An asymmetric Dieckmann condensation towards spirocyclic oxindoles and aza&#8208;oxindoles catalyzed by amino acid&#8208;derived phosphonium salt has been developed, which expanded the applicability of asymmetric phosphonium salt catalysis in the production of 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. This reaction is distinguished by its mild conditions (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C), low catalyst loading (3&#8211;5&#8197;mol%), and broad substrate scope (25 examples). Control experiments revealed that both the catalyst&#8216;s phosphonium skeleton and H&#8208;bonding site were required. Product transformations and a gram scale experiment were also carried out.

         <title>Chiral Iron Complexes in Asymmetric Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Transition metal chiral catalysts can feature metal stereocenters in different coordination geometries. In the case of iron, both octahedral and tetrahedral geometries possessing a chirotopic iron atom have been synthesized and tested in stereoselective organic transformations. The configurational stability of these complexes, which in some cases is hampered by decomplexation and recomplexation of labile ligands, is achieved by the use of multidentate ligands in octahedral complexes, and of cyclopentadienyl anions (half sandwich complexes) in the case of tetrahedral structures. The use of octahedral iron complexes featuring configurationally stable iron stereocenters is reviewed in highly enantioselective reductions (hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation of ketones) and oxidations (cis&#8208;dihydroxylation of alkenes, epoxidation, sulfoxidation), while the use tetradentate iron complexes is described in C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions and reductions.

         <title>Advances in Electrochemical Hydrogenation Since 2010</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A commitment to developing a convenient, efficient, and safe hydrogenation strategy is one of the main focuses of industry and academia. Electrochemical hydrogenation brings greener and gentler opportunities for the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds and the incorporation of deuterium atoms to desired products with traceless electrons as redox reagents in the absence of high&#8208;pressure hydrogen. In this account, recent advances in electrochemical hydrogenation or transfer hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds since 2010 are summarized. The reaction features, limitations, substrates scopes, mechanism of these hydrogenation reactions are discussed in this review. We hope this account will contribute to future developments to broaden the scope of electrochemical hydrogenation or transfer hydrogenation.

         <title>Synthesis of Isoquinolylselenocyanates and Quinolylselenocyanates via Electrophilic Selenocyanogen Cyclization Induced by Pseudohalogen (SeCN)2 Generated in situ</title>

Abstract
A strategy for the synthesis of isoquinolylselenocyanates and quinolylselenocyanates through electrophilic selenocyanogen cyclization has been developed. The feature of this reaction is that the sequential process was induced directly by generated in&#8197;situ pseudohalogen (SeCN)2 generated in&#8197;situ. Additionally, the obtained selenocyanates allowed functional group diversification, which could be potential intermediates for valuable compounds.

         <title>Rh(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Arylation of Alkynyl Cyclic Carbonates: Divergent Access to Substituted &#945;&#8208;Allenols and 1,3&#8208;Butadienes</title>

Abstract
Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative arylation of alkynyl cyclic carbonates using commercially available and low&#8208;toxic aryl boronic acids has been disclosed. Depending on the nature of the cyclic carbonates, the methodology provides a straightforward platform to access either substituted 2,3&#8208;allenols or 1,3&#8208;butadiene derivatives. Internal alkynyl cyclic carbonates undergo monoarylation to conveniently afford 2,3&#8208;allenols with high syn&#8208;selectivity for the aryl and hydroxy groups. Whereas, terminal alkynyl carbonates led to the formation of diarylated 1,3&#8208;butadiene derivatives having cis&#8208;configuration for the two aryl groups via allenyl rhodium(I)alkoxide intermediate. The compatibility of various functional groups allowed to develop a library of diversely functionalized scaffolds with excellent regioselectivity in good yields. Late&#8208;stage transformation of a series of natural products highlights the wide applicability of the arylation process. Additionally, scale&#8208;up experiments and downstream transformations of &#945;&#8208;allenol derivatives into other valuable heterocycles illustrate the efficacy of the protocol.

Abstract
The cascade cyclization reactions of 1,5&#8208;bisallenes grant access to a great variety of products by precisely tuning the catalyst system and/or the reagents involved. Herein, we present our findings that 1,5&#8208;bisallenes react with two molecules of dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate to afford, in a completely diastereoselective manner, cis&#8208;3,4&#8208;arylvinyl pyrrolidines and cyclopentanes. DFT calculations have been used to postulate a mechanism for the developed reaction which encompasses a [2+2+2] cycloaddition reaction of the two alkynes and the external double bond of one allene, followed by a cycloisomerization involving the internal double bond of the second allene.

Herein, we present our findings that 1,5-bisallenes react with two molecules of dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate to afford, in a completely diastereoselective manner, &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-3,4-arylvinyl pyrrolidines and cyclopentanes. DFT calculations have been used to postulate a mechanism for the developed reaction which encompasses a [2+2+2] cycloaddition reaction of the two alkynes and the external double bond of one allene, followed by a cycloisomerization involving the internal double bond of the second allene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A family of manganese complexes [Mn(Rpeb)(OTf)2] (peb=1&#8208;(1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;N&#8208;((1&#8208;((1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl) pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)&#8208;N&#8208;methylmethanamine)) derived from L&#8208;proline has been synthesized and characterized, where R refers to the group at the diamine backbone. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses indicate that all the manganese complexes [Mn(Rpeb)(OTf)2] exhibit cis&#8208;&#945; topology. These types of complexes are shown to catalyze the asymmetric epoxidation of olefins employing H2O2 as a terminal oxidant with up to 96% ee. Obviously, the R group of the diamine backbone can influence the catalytic activity and enantioselectivity in the asymmetric epoxidation of olefins. In particular, Mn(i&#8208;Prpeb)(OTf)2 bearing an isopropyl arm, cannot catalyze the epoxidation reaction with H2O2 as the oxidant. However, when PhI(OAc)2 is used as the oxidant instead, all the manganese complexes including Mn(i&#8208;Prpeb)(OTf)2 can promote the epoxidation reactions efficiently. Taken together, these results indicate that isopropyl substitution on the Rpeb ligand inhibits the formation of active Mn(V)&#8208;oxo species in the H2O2/carboxylic acid system via an acid&#8208;assisted pathway.

         <title>Electrooxidative Dearomatization to Spiroisoxazolines: Application to Total Synthesis of Xanthoisoxazoline B</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The synthesis of spiroisoxazoline molecules has been developed via anodic oxidative dearomatization of 4&#8208;methoxybenzyl oximes. The reaction is thought to proceed through 5&#8208;exo C&#8722;O bond&#8208;forming cyclization of oxime radicals with arenes on the basis of cyclic voltammetry studies. Moreover, spiroisoxazolines can be built directly from readily available carbonyl tethered phenolics via an oximation/dearomatization cascade. Using this spiroisoxazolization as the key step, the first total synthesis of xanthoisoxazoline B has been achieved in three steps.

Abstract
We developed a cascade reaction of o&#8208;haloaryl ynone and 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;methylchromene under transition metal&#8208;free conditions. This strategy proceeds through double Michael addition and oxygen&#8208;migration, thus providing a straight way for the synthesis of chromone derivatives.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced dioxygenation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated oximes for the synthesis of diverse useful isoxazolines bearing a hydroxyl moiety was developed by employing graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) as a heterogeneous photocatalyst under an air atmosphere. Noted that, the eminent advantages of this metal&#8208;free protocol include step economy, easy operation, a recyclable photocatalyst, external reductant&#8208;/oxidant&#8208;free and mild reaction conditions. Additionally, mechanistic studies indicated hydroxyl radical was generated under the photocatalysis of g&#8208;C3N4.

Abstract
The [4+3] annulation of aza&#8208;o&#8208;quinone methides and pyridinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates has been developed for the one&#8208;step synthesis of functionalized 2,3&#8208;unsaturated 4,1&#8208;benzothiazepines under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions. The produced 4,1&#8208;benzothiazepines can easily be converted into biologically interesting sulfoxides and sulfones via selective oxidization with m&#8208;CPBA.

         <title>Synthesis of Bio&#8208;Based Silane Coupling Agents by the Modification of Eugenol</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A simple method for the synthesis of new bio&#8208;based silane coupling agents (SCAs) with a terpene aromatic core by the functionalization of cheap, natural eugenol and its sulfur derivatives using the hydrosilylation of the C=C bonds with HSi(OEt)3, followed by nucleophilic substitution reactions of OH/SH groups is presented. The obtained alkoxysilanes possess different polymer&#8208;reactive functionalities (alkenyl, epoxide, thiirane, thiocarbamoyl, thioester, thioether moieties). This new group of biogenic SCAs was fully characterized using 1H, 13C, 29Si NMR, FT&#8208;IR, GC&#8208;MS, and HRMS or elemental analysis. Examples of their application as additives to tire rubbers and their influence on several factors are also discussed.

         <title>Enzyme Access Tunnel Engineering in Baeyer&#8208;Villiger Monooxygenases to Improve Oxidative Stability and Biocatalyst Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide is involved in a variety of enzyme catalysis as an oxidant or toxic by&#8208;product. Thereby, attenuation of the H2O2&#8208;driven oxidative stress is one of the key issues for preparative biocatalysis. Here, a rational approach to improve the robustness of enzymes, in particular, Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) against H2O2 was investigated. The enzyme access tunnels, which may serve as exit paths for H2O2 from the active site to the bulk, were predicted by using the CAVER and/or protein energy landscape exploration (PELE) software for the phenylacetone monooxygenase variant (PAMO_C65D) from Thermobifida fusca and the BVMO from Pseudomonas putida KT2440. The amino acid residues, which are susceptible to oxidation by H2O2 (e.&#8201;g., methionine and tyrosine) and located in vicinity of the predicted H2O2 migration paths, were substituted with less reactive or inert amino acids (e.&#8201;g., leucine and isoleucine). This led to design of the H2O2&#8208;resistant enzyme variants, which became robust biocatalysts for synthetic applications. For instance, the H2O2&#8208;resistant P. putida BVMO reached turnover numbers of 4,100 for the BV oxygenation of 4&#8208;decanone, which is 2.8&#8208;fold greater than the parent enzyme. Moreover, the H2O2&#8208;resistant P. putida BVMO allowed 2&#8208;fold enhancement in titer of 9&#8208;(nonanoyloxy)nonanoic acid (8) formation in a cascade fatty acid biotransformation. Therefore, it was assumed that the CAVER/PELE&#8208;based H2O2 migration path engineering represents an efficient rational design approach to improve not only oxidative stability but also biotransformation performance of the H2O2&#8208;forming or utilizing enzymes (e.&#8201;g., BVMOs, oxidases, and peroxidases).

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Cyclic Acetals with Spirooxindole Skeleton</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An organocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of cyclic acetal with spirooxindole skeleton has been developed via a domino reaction between isatin and &#947;&#8208;hydroxy enones. Bifunctional squaramide catalyst with adamantyl motif was found to be the most effective for the cascade reaction. With 10&#8197;mol% of the catalyst, the desired products were obtained in 1.8:1 to 9:1 diastereo&#8208; and 86% to &gt;99% enantioselectivities from a range of substituted isatins and &#947;&#8208;hydroxy enones.

         <title>Fabrication of &#969;&#8208;Transaminase@Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Biocomposites for Efficiently Synthesizing Benzylamines and Pyridylmethylamines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
In this study, ten &#969;&#8208;transaminases (&#969;&#8208;TAs) have been investigated to efficiently catalyze the synthesis of twenty&#8208;four functionalized benzylamines and pyridylmethylamines. We optimized the reactions, screened suitable amino donors and compared &#969;&#8208;transaminases activities for all aromatic aldehyde substrates. Under the optimized conditions, eighteen aromatic amines have been obtained with 60.4%&#8211;96.6% conversions and isolated only via simple extraction and recrystallization with 18.5%&#8211;81% yields on a preparative scale. Furthermore, we first immobilized the Bm&#8208;STA onto the MOFs via the physical adsorption to overcome the limitation of free enzyme and improve their industrial applications. The obtained Bm&#8208;STA/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 composites exhibited not only high enzymes loading (80.4&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) and enzyme activity recovery (95.8%), but also the better reusability, storage stability, pH stability and the tolerance to acetone and DMF.

Abstract
We report the method for synthesis of indole&#8208; and pyrrole&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered nitrogen heterocycles by means of acid&#8208;base switchable cyclization reactions. The reactions involved cleavage of amide C&#8722;N bonds, chemoselective N&#8208;1 or C&#8208;3 acylation, and 1,4&#8208;Michael addition. This method could be used to construct two different kinds of seven&#8208;membered rings in one step from the same starting material without the need for a transition&#8208;metal catalyst.

Abstract
The direct and catalytic incorporation of fluorine containing molecular motifs into organic compounds resulting high&#8208;value added chemicals represents a rapidly evolving part of synthetic methodologies, thus this area is in the focus of pharmaceutical and agrochemical research.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direct and catalytic incorporation of fluorine containing molecular motifs into organic compounds resulting high-value added chemicals represents a rapidly evolving part of synthetic methodologies, thus this area is in the focus of pharmaceutical and agrochemical research. Herein we report a stereoselective procedure for direct fluorovinylation of aromatic and heteroaromatic scaffolds. This methodology development has been realized by palladium-catalyzed &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; C&#8722;H activation reaction of aniline derivatives featuring the regioselectivity via directing groups such as secondary of tertiary amides, ureas or ketones. The application of non-symmetrical aryl(fluoroalkenyl)-iodonium salts as fluoroalkenylating agents allowed mild reaction conditions in general for this transformation. The scope and limitations have been thoroughly investigated and the feasibility has been demonstrated by more than 50 examples.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
By using diaryliodonium salts, a cylization has been accomplished in the synthesis of N&#8208;aryl phenanthridinone derivatives via a cascade of ortho&#8208;arylation and Csp2&#8208;N bond formation in the presence of palladium catalyst. The reaction exhibits a broad compatibility of readily available N&#8208;arylnaphthamides.

Abstract
An enantioselective synthesis of unnatural pyrazole&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;chiral amino acid derivatives from the asymmetric reaction of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;5&#8208;aminopyrazoles with &#946;,&#947;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;imino esters using a chiral spirocyclic phosphoric acid catalyst was developed. Using the established methodology, various pyrazole&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives with tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenters were obtained in 67&#8211;98% yields and with 73&#8211;99% enantioselectivities. The NH2 functionality in the corresponding products enables further transformations to a chiral thiourea and a lactam.

Abstract
The readily scalable asymmetric synthesis of the chiral chromone derivatives functionalized at position 2 via electrophilic enantioselective olefination of the chromone core with nitroolefins and &#223;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;ketoesters in the presence of simple C2&#8208;symmetric tertiary amine&#8208;squaramide catalyst was developed. The reaction products were obtained in 80&#8211;99% yield with 89&#8211;99%&#8201;ee in 95% EtOH. The absolute configurations of the synthesized chromone derivatives were unambiguously established by transformation of compound (R)&#8208;3&#8201;aa to known methyl (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;phenylpropionate and by the single crystal XRD analysis of compounds (R,S)&#8208;5&#8201;aa and (R,S)&#8208;5&#8201;ab. Catalyst V poorly soluble in common organic solvents could be easily separated from the reaction mixture and reused up to 10 catalytic cycles. Catalytic hydrogenation and esterification reactions of the synthesized compounds were carried out to demonstrate synthetic potential of the developed procedure.

         <title>Recyclable, Immobilized Transition&#8208;Metal Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The use of transition&#8208;metal complexes as photocatalysts have allowed the performance of diverse organic transformations in an outstanding manner, characterized not only by high yields, TOF, and selectivity values, but also by modulating and providing access to novel molecular structures that, without them, would be difficult if not impossible. However, one of the biggest concerns regarding the use of these photocatalysts relies on the difficulties associated with their isolation from reaction media and reutilization once the chemical process ends. The above, besides contaminating reaction products and requiring out tedious purification processes, prompts the inevitable loss of the catalyst, directly affecting its recyclability. In addition, this situation results in negative outcomes from an economic and environmental perspective, since transition&#8208;metal complexes are usually expensive materials, and their unsuccessful recovery could result in leakage into the environment. These drawbacks served as inspiration for the elaboration of the present review focused on the development of novel strategies developed during the last decade for the successful recovery of these species. The strategies summarized herein, whether for homogeneous or heterogeneous systems, are based on the use of thermotropic solvents, changes in the hydrophilic balance of the catalyst, the employment of polymers, copolymers, porous macromolecular structures, and inorganic nanostructures as support of these entities. Moreover, the use of organized and confining media, such as micelles and gels in this context, is also discussed. We hope that this review will motivate the search for new strategies to develop novel catalytic systems, understanding that high performance is based not only on yields but also on recyclability, sustainability, and responsibility to the environment.

Abstract
Herein, Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C4&#8208;selective C&#8722;H allylation and prenylation of indoles by using a weak carbonyl coordination directing group have been reported. By employing 5&#8208;methylene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxan&#8208;2&#8208;ones, 4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolan&#8208;2&#8208;ones and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;butadiene as scalable cross&#8208;coupling partners, these divergent synthesis protocols proceed smoothly under redox&#8208;neutral reaction conditions, delivering various allylated and prenylated indoles in moderate to satisfied yields. This transformation exhibits high functional&#8208;groups compatibility and broad substrate scope. Scale&#8208;up experiment and mechanistic studies were also accomplished.

         <title>From Stoichiometric Reagents to Catalytic Partners: Selenonium Salts as Alkylating Agents for Nucleophilic Displacement Reactions in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The ability of chalcogenium salts to transfer an electrophilic moiety to a given nucleophile is well known. However, up to date, these reagents have been used in stoichiometric quantities, producing a substantial amount of waste as byproducts of the reaction. In this report, we disclose further investigation of selenonium salts as S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) surrogates for the alkylation of nucleophiles in aqueous solutions. Most importantly, we were able to convert the stoichiometric process to a catalytic system employing as little as 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% of selenides to accelerate the reaction between benzyl bromide and other alkylating agents with sodium cyanide in water. Probe experiments including 77Se NMR and HRMS of the reaction mixture have unequivocally shown the presence of the selenonium salt in the reaction mixture.

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyzed (3+2)&#8208;Cycloaddition of Thioketones and Indole&#8208;2&#8208;Carbinols Toward Thiazolo[3,4&#8208;a]indoles</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed approach to access the yet unknown heterocyclic motif of thiazolo[3,4&#8208;a]indoles in a one&#8208;pot reaction under very mild conditions. A broad range of thiazolo[3,4&#8208;a]indoles was generated from indole&#8208;2&#8208;methanols and thioketones with 45&#8211;99% yield and good functional group tolerance. The practicality of the process and the synthetic potential of the products were demonstrated with an upscaling experiment and further transformations. Additional control experiments provided mechanistic insights into this cycloaddition.

Abstract
A microwave&#8208;assisted, base&#8208;promoted, tandem cyclization reaction strategy has been developed for the synthesis of cyclohepta[b]chromones and spiro cyclohepta[b]chromones. Readily accessible &#947;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;diketones undergo intramolecular cyclization and 7&#8208;endo&#8208;trig carbocyclization to afford various cycloheptane&#8208;annelated chromones in one&#8208;pot reactions. This metal&#8208;free protocol also led to the generation of polycyclic ring with a new C&#8722;C bond and a new C&#8722;O bond.

         <title>Enantioselective Nitro&#8208;Michael Addition Catalyzed by N&#8208;Terminal Guanidinylated Helical Peptide</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Enantioselective Michael addition of &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds toward nitroalkenes were realized by using an immobilized, N&#8208;terminal&#8208;guanidinylated peptide, H2N&#8722;C(=NH)&#8722;Trp&#8722;Trp&#8722;(Leu&#8722;Leu&#8722;Aib)3&#8722;PEG&#8722;PS&#8208;resin (Aib=2&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid), as catalyst. Viable nucleophiles were acetylacetone, dimethyl malonate, and &#946;&#8208;ketoesters. The electrophiles include the &#946;&#8208;nitrostryrenes with various substituents on the benzene ring and the aliphatic nitroalkenes. Sterically congested &#945;&#8208;ethoxycarbonyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostryrene also successfully reacted. The resin&#8208;supported catalyst could be recycled for five times.
