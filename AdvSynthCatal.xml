         <title>Synthesis and Application of &#946;&#8208;Alkynyl&#8208;&#947;,&#947;&#8208;Difluoroallylboronates for Metal&#8208;Free Allylation of Aldehydes in Water</title>

Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Alkynyl substituted &#947;,&#947;&#8208;difluoroallyl&#8208;boronates were prepared via defluorination under basic condition. Allylation reaction of aldehydes with gem&#8208;difluoroallylboronates under metal&#8208;free condition in water was developed. As the sole solvent, water dramatically improved the efficiency of the reaction, and afforded the desired products in 48&#8211;92% yields. The corresponding difluorinated alcohols were smoothly transformed into the 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;methylene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran derivatives in the presence of gold catalyst.

         <title>&#8220;Urea to Urea&#8221; Approach: Access to Unsymmetrical Ureas Bearing Pyridyl Substituents</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A protocol for the synthesis of unsymmetrical ureas substituted by pyridyl/quinolinyl moiety has been developed. This method concluded in metal&#8208; and base&#8208;free reamination of N,N&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N&#8216;&#8208;hetaryl ureas with a wide range of aryl and alkyl amines. The isolated yields vary from 40 to 96% depending on the nucleophilicity of the amines. The scope of this method includes more than 50 examples. The reaction is not hindered by either donor or acceptor groups as well as diverse functionalities. The synthesis can be easily scaled to gram quantities. Theoretical calculations supported by experimental data allowed us to propose a plausible mechanism for the process. This reaction takes place through the intermediate formation of hetaryl isocyanate.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling Reactions between Phenols and Hetarenes: Modern Trends in Cross&#8208;Coupling Chemistry of Phenols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Phenol derivatives are widespread as important building blocks in various pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials. Modern economy requires development of &#8220;green&#8221; methodologies that improve the efficiency of their use and reduction of waste. One such method is the C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling, also known as the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction. In this review article, we have summarised the C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reactions of phenols with five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered heterocyclic compounds, systemised methods of activation of phenol or coupling partner. We discuss these advances with the goal of motivating increased interest to develop novel methodologies in this field of organic chemistry.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free TFA&#8208;Promoted Regioselective (Hetero)Arylation: Synthesis of (Hetero)Aryl Substituted and Carbazole/Oxepine Fused N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>

Abstract
Metal&#8208;free TFA promoted arylation/heteroarylation was achieved under mild conditions via the reaction of chloro&#8208;derivatives of nitrogen heterocycles [e.&#8201;g., =C&#8722;C(Cl)=N&#8722;] with electron rich arenes/heteroarenes. It was also observed that apart from participating in the heteroarylation step, TFA was able to facilitate the hydroarylation/o&#8208;arylation process in the same pot affording the carbazole/oxepine fused N&#8208;heterocycles. The reaction proceeded with similar efficiency on gram scale.

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot approach for the asymmetric synthesis of C2&#8208;tetrasubstituted indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones from 2&#8208;substituted indoles was developed via merging transition metal catalysis with organocatalysis. This strategy involves two processes, including CuI catalyzed oxidative dearomatization of 2&#8208;substituted indoles using O2 as green oxidant, and followed by an proline&#8208;promoted asymmetric Mannich reaction with ketones or aldehydes. A series of C2&#8208;tetrasubstituted indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones were obtained in 35&#8211;86% yields, 2:1&#8208;&gt;20:1 dr and 48&#8211;99% ee. Moreover, the synthetic 2&#8208;tetrasubstituted indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones could be easily transformed into 1H&#8208;[1,3] oxazino [3,4&#8208;a]indol&#8208;5(3H)&#8208;ones via a [4+1] cyclization process. In addition, the synthetic compound 3&#8201;s show certain antibacterial activity against S. aureus ATCC25923 and multi&#8208;drug resistance bacterial strain of S. aureus (20151027077) and its MIC values up to 8 &#956;g/mL and 16 &#956;g/mL, respectively.

Abstract
A regioselective intermolecular carbohalogenation of alkynes with alkenyl bromides enabled by dual photoredox and nickel catalysis is described. This dual protocol enables an atom&#8208;economic access to a wide array of brominated 1,3&#8208;dienes from simple starting materials. Broad substrate scope and high regioselectivity are observed. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated and preliminary mechanistic studies have been performed to elucidate the reaction pathway.

         <title>Protecting Group&#8208;Controlled Regioselective Synthesis for Unsymmetrical 3,5&#8208;Disubstituted Pyridones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protecting group&#8208;controlled regioselective functionalization of 3,5&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2&#8208;pyridones has been studied for the preparation of unsymmetrical 3,5&#8208;disubstituted 2&#8208;pyridones. A bulky di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl(isobutyl)silyl (BIBS) group was utilized for C5 regioselective arylation in Suzuki&#8722;Miyaura reactions. Meanwhile, p&#8208;toluenesulfonyl (Ts) group was used to maximize C3 selective halogen&#8208;lithium exchange employing flow chemistry. Most of the reactions proceeded well with yields of 76 to 95% with excellent regioselectivity. A one&#8208;pot synthesis of unsymmetrical 3,5&#8208;diaryl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridones starting from 3,5&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2&#8208;silyloxypyridine was conducted to demonstrate the practical convenience.	Further functionalization onto the remaining bromine group such as transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond forming reactions and retro&#8208;Brook rearrangement for C&#8722;Si bond formation was accomplished for the synthesis of biologically relevant 3,5&#8208;disubstituted 2&#8208;pyridones. Finally, amrinone and milrinone, commonly used for congestive heart failure, were synthesized in 3 steps from 3,5&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2&#8208;pyridones in 41% and 56% overall yields, respectively.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We reported a method for the synthesis of 3,3&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted isobenzofuran&#8208;1(3H)&#8208;ones via the carbonyl difunctionalization of 2&#8208;acylbenzoic acids. A range of nucleophiles was reacted with 2&#8208;acylbenzoic acids to furnish the functionalized isobenzofuran&#8208;1(3H)&#8208;ones with the factual yield range of 61&#8208;96%. The reaction uses Cs0.5H2.5PW12O40 as a catalyst and produces water as the sole by&#8208;product. Various functional groups could be introduced to the isobenzofuran&#8208;1(3H)&#8208;one skeletons via the C&#8722;P/C&#8722;N/C&#8722;O/C&#8722;C bond formation, which would provide opportunities for the synthesis of potential biologically active molecules.

         <title>Development of an NAD(H)&#8208;Driven Biocatalytic System for Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral amino acids are extensively applied in the pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic, and agricultural industries. As a representative example, L&#8208;phosphinothricin (L&#8208;PPT, a chiral non&#8208;natural amino acid) is a broad&#8208;spectrum herbicide. An NAD(H)&#8208;driven biocatalytic system for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amino acids (focused on L&#8208;PPT) with high efficiency and low cost is highly desired. The key for the development of such biocatalytic system is to obtain an NADH&#8208;dependent biocatalyst with high catalytic performance toward L&#8208;PPT pro&#8208;ketone PPO. Herein, an engineered glutamate dehydrogenase from Lysinibacillus composti (LcGluDH) with desired activity was obtained by gene mining and protein engineering. In silico analyses suggested that the volume of substrate&#8208;binding pocket was substantially enlarged from 330.5 &#197;3 to 409.6 &#197;3. The stability of LcGluDH was increased (Tm value increased from 47.3 &#176;C to 65.3 &#176;C) by introducing positively charged amino acids or aromatic amino acids at position 375. The desired biocatalytic system was constructed by coupling the engineered LcGluDH and an NAD+&#8208;dependent FDH. Through this biocatalytic system, the batch production of L&#8208;PPT exhibited high space&#8211;time yield (207.3 g&#183;L&#8722;1&#183;day&#8722;1) with strict stereoselectivity (ee of L&#8208;PPT &gt; 99%). Furthermore, eight other chiral amino acids were synthesised by the developed NAD(H)&#8208;driven biocatalytic system with high ee values.</dc:description>

In silico analyses suggested that the volume of substrate-binding pocket was substantially enlarged from 330.5 &#197;3 to 409.6 &#197;3. The stability of LcGluDH was increased (Tm value increased from 47.3 &#176;C to 65.3 &#176;C) by introducing positively charged amino acids or aromatic amino acids at position 375. The desired biocatalytic system was constructed by coupling the engineered LcGluDH and an NAD+-dependent FDH. Through this biocatalytic system, the batch production of L-PPT exhibited high space&#8211;time yield (207.3 g&#183;L&#8722;1&#183;day&#8722;1) with strict stereoselectivity (ee of L-PPT &amp;gt; 99%). Furthermore, eight other chiral amino acids were synthesised by the developed NAD(H)-driven biocatalytic system with high ee values.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The C&#8211;F bond is the strongest single bond and it is one of the most challenging tasks to study the C&#8211;F bond functionalization. Here, we describe the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed selective defluorinative carboxylation of aryl C&#8722;F bonds with CO2. Various methyl carboxylates including partially fluorinated carboxylation compounds were obtained. Mechanistic studies reveal that the azanickelacycles might be vital intermediates in this transformation. This novel and straightforward carboxylation strategy will extend the scope of C&#8722;F bond functionalization and enhance the understanding of the reactivity of very stable bonds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The stereoselective photoisomerization of olefins via Energy Transfer (EnT) sensitization bears significant potential in the context of rational design of catalytic stereodivergent methodologies. Whereas approaches for controlling the access to E&#8208; and Z&#8208; isomers depend highly on the nature of the catalyst &#8208;and therefore are not easily implemented as a general strategy&#8208; EnT catalysis has emerged in recent years as an increasingly powerful tool for olefin geometry control in a nearly perfect step&#8208;economic fashion.

         <title>Asymmetric Tandem Conjugate Addition and Reaction with Carbocations on Unsaturated Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Heterocycles possessing multiple substituents and stereogenic centers are important structural motifs in many compounds of interest. We present here stereoselective tandem transformation based on Cu&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reagents to heterocyclic Michael acceptors, which is followed by one&#8208;pot trapping of in&#8197;situ formed enolates with stabilized carbocations or their equivalents. The transformations are highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective with Josiphos&#8208;type ferrocene ligand. The reaction of chiral metal enolates with onium compounds allows the installation of structurally attractive substituents on chromenone or piperidinone core. Moreover, cycloheptatrienyl and benzodithiolyl substituents can be further modified, thus expanding synthetic possibilities of this methodology.

         <title>Sterically and Temperature Controlled Divergent Cycloadditions of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Imines with Vinylethylene Carbonates: Insights from Experimental and DFT Studies</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Divergent synthesis of heterocycles with controllable ring sizes from the same starting materials is a long&#8208;standing challenge. We report herein the first example of controllable divergent [4+5] and [2+3] cycloadditions of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines and vinylethylene carbonates, which enables the selectively synthesis of nine&#8208;membered and different five&#8208;membered heterocycles by controlling the reaction temperature and the steric hindrance of substituent. This protocol features a broad substrate scope, wide functional group tolerance as well as operational simplicity. The reaction mechanism was investigated by con&#8208;ducting a series of control experiments as well as DFT calculations and the origins of the regioselectivities of the cycloaddition process were rationalized.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroborylative Polycyclization of Allenynes: an Atom&#8208;Economical and Diastereoselective Synthesis of Bicyclic 5&#8208;5 Fused Rings</title>

Abstract
A diastereoselective synthesis of borylated bicyclic 5&#8208;5 fused ring systems by a domino Ni&#8208;catalyzed hydroborylative polycyclization of allenynes has been developed. The reaction provides two new C&#8722;C and one C&#8722;B bonds and constitutes an atom&#8208;economical method. It occurs rapidly, in absence of inert atmosphere, with an inexpensive Ni&#8208;based catalyst and HBpin as boron source. The procedure showed excellent tolerance to functional groups and a wide scope. Derivatization of the borylated bicycles has been performed to explore the synthetic utility of the products. Experimental and DFT&#8208;calculation results suggest that the process starts by an oxidative cyclometallation involving Ni(0) and both the allene and the alkyne moieties, followed by a stereoselective &#963;&#8208;metathesis with HBpin. Formation of the second ring takes place through a non&#8208;fully coplanar 1,2&#8208;insertion into the Ni&#8722;H bond to give a nickelacyclohexene which finally evolves by reductive elimination.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of CF3&#8208;Substituted Polycyclic Quinazolinones via Cascade Trifluoromethylation/Cyclization of Unactivated Alkene</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
An atom and step economy cascade trifluoromethylation/cyclization of unactivated alkene with Langlois reagent as a CF3 source is described. A variety of polycyclic quinazolinones were successfully synthesized in 52&#8211;81% yields under transition metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. The Langlois reagent used in this strategy as a CF3 reagent possesses the advantages of bench&#8208;stablity, cost&#8208;effectivity and high&#8208;efficiency. Additionally, gram&#8208;scale reaction, broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance demonstrated the synthetic usefulness of this protocol.

Abstract
A catalytic cycloisomerization of enyne diesters derived from 2&#8208;propargyloxyarylaldehydes is described. The cycloisomerization, catalyzed by 10&#8197;mol% In(OTf)3, provides access to 2H&#8208;chromenes bearing diethyl 2&#8208;(hetero)arylidene malonates at 3&#8208;position. This enyne metathesis&#8208;type reaction is also useful for the synthesis of thia&#8208;, aza&#8208; and quinoline analogs of the 3&#8208;substituted 2H&#8208;chromenes. DDQ mediated oxidative C&#8722;N bond formation and further synthetic manipulation enables the conversion of 3&#8208;substituted 2H&#8208;chromene into chromene&#8208;fused molecular scaffold. Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular Heck reaction on suitably substituted 2H&#8208;chromene provides indene&#8208;based molecular scaffold.

         <title>Amine Transaminase Mediated Synthesis of Optically Pure Piperazinones and 1,4&#8208;Diazepanones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A biocatalytic approach has been designed for the synthesis of optically active piperazinones and 1,4&#8208;diazepanones in aqueous medium under mild conditions. The method described herein is based on a biocatalytic transamination of an easily accessible N&#8208;(2&#8208;oxopropyl) amino acid ester and the subsequent spontaneous cyclization of the initially formed amine. Both enantiomers of the synthesized piperazinones can be prepared by the selection of amine transaminases of opposite selectivity. The reaction conditions were optimised and eight selected processes were performed on a preparative scale. Thus, seven optically active piperazinones were synthesized in high isolated yields (70&#8211;90%) and a 1,4&#8208;diazepanone in a moderate yield (51%), being the ee &#8805;99% in all the cases.

         <title>Highly Substrate&#8208;Selective Macrocyclic Ring Closing Metathesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A selective ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) reaction for the formation of large macrocycles by using latent sulfur chelated ruthenium iodide benzylidenes, readily activated by thermal and photochemical (UV&#8208;A and visible light) stimuli, is reported. For dienes having one terminal alkene and one internal double bond, the specific affinity of diiodo ruthenium alkylidenes for the unhindered terminus, combined with their reluctance to react with internal olefins, favors RCM over oligomerization, providing high macrocyclic yields even at relatively high concentrations. Alternatively, for substrates containing two internal double bonds, a sacrificial methylene donor can be used to obtain the desired products. With this methodology, lactones, lactams, and macrocyclic ketones ranging from 13&#8208; to 22&#8208;membered rings could be synthesized in moderate to high yields. In addition, synthetic applications for a one&#8208;pot cyclization/reduction sequence to produce Exaltolide, a natural macrolide (commercial musk), Dihydrocivetone, and other saturated macrocycles have been explored. Thus, we disclose herein an important advantage for diiodo ruthenium benzylidene catalysts over their less selective dichloro counterparts and provide a more profound understanding of the mechanisms that provide the enhanced cyclization outcome.

         <title>Photoredox Catalyzed Trifluoromethyl Radical&#8208;Triggered Trifunctionalization of 5&#8208;Hexenenitriles via Cyano Migration</title>

Abstract
A photoredox catalyzed trifluoromethyl radical&#8208;triggered trifunctionalization of 5&#8208;hexenenitriles via cyano group migration is reported. The cyano group migration is of high chemo&#8208;selectivity even in the presence of aryl or heteroaryl groups as competitors. This protocol provides a facile access to a broad scope of CF3&#8208;containing compounds with high molecular complexity and functional group diversity. The success of gram&#8208;scale reaction and the versatility of products in derivative synthesis illustrate the potential value of this transformation in synthetic chemistry.

Abstract
A synthetic method to prepare 11H&#8208;benzo[a]fluorenes and 13H&#8208;indeno[1,2&#8208;l]phenanthrenes that relies on the gold(I)&#8208; and Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;mediated deacyloxylative cycloaromatisation of 1,6&#8208;diyne esters under reaction conditions that did not require the exclusion of moisture or air is described. The reaction mechanism was delineated to involve an initial gold(I)&#8208;catalysed 1,2&#8208;acyloxy migration and 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclisation pathway. This was followed by 1,5&#8208;enyne rearrangement and Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;assisted deacyloxylative aromatisation to give the polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) product.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Borylation of (Poly)halogenated Aryl Triflates and Their Application in Consecutive Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
This study reports the palladium&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective borylation of (poly)halogenated aryl triflates with a reactivity order of C&#8722;Cl&gt;C&#8722;OTf. A catalyst system comprising Pd(OAc)2 and SelectPhos (L1) enables a reaction with high reactivity and chemoselectivity. The consecutively chemoselective borylation reaction followed by the chemoselective intermolecular Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction can be performed using a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step approach to synthesize unsymmetrical biaryl compounds containing the triflate moiety. The reaction can be scaled up to the gram scale without diminishing the yield and chemoselectivity.

&lt;p&gt;This study reports the palladium-catalyzed chemoselective borylation of (poly)halogenated aryl triflates with a reactivity order of C&#8722;Cl&amp;gt;C&#8722;OTf. A catalyst system comprising Pd(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SelectPhos (&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;) enables a reaction with high reactivity and chemoselectivity. The consecutively chemoselective borylation reaction followed by the chemoselective intermolecular Suzuki-Miyaura reaction can be performed using a one-pot two-step approach to synthesize unsymmetrical biaryl compounds containing the triflate moiety. The reaction can be scaled up to the gram scale without diminishing the yield and chemoselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The gold&#8208;catalyzed regioselective formation of 3&#8208;hydroxyquinoline is accessed by combining anthranils and alkynyl sulfones. The selective scission of the epoxide intermediate stems from the thermodynamic stability difference of the resultant cation according to quantum chemical calculations. The subsequent semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement leads to the 1,2&#8208;shift of an aryl or alkyl group originating from the sulfone.

Abstract
The development of cooperative catalysis is of great significance for multi&#8208;step sequential enantioselective organic transformations. However, the complicated subtle environments and inherent mutual deactivations of chiral dual catalysts pose a great challenge in a single operation. To address these issues, we here report the rational design of an integrated Cu/bisoxazoline and Ru/diamine co&#8208;catalyst system, which enables a decarboxylative Mannich reaction/asymmetric transfer hydrogenation enantioselective cascade reaction for the direct preparation of 1,3&#8208;distereocentered &#946;&#8208;sulfonamido alcohols. Through this cascade process, an initial Cu/bisoxazoline&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative Mannich reaction of a cyclic aldimine and a &#946;&#8208;keto acid to afford a chiral &#946;&#8208;sulfonamido ketone, followed by asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of this in&#8197;situ generated ketone, produces a wide range of chiral &#946;&#8208;sulfonamido alcohols in 80&#8211;95% yields with 86&#8211;99% ee and 64:36&#8211;99:1 dr. Advantageous feature of this co&#8208;catalyst system lies in the cooperative catalytic process, which greatly enhances the catalytic efficiency compared with the single&#8208;step reactions, making it attractive for gaining direct access to the diastereoselective 1,3&#8208;distereocenter.

         <title>Generation of Dimethyl Sulfoxide Coordinated Thermally Stable Halogen Cation Pools for C&#8722;H Halogenation</title>

Abstract
A method to generate halogen cation pools from the reaction of 1,2&#8208;dihaloethanes (hal=Br, I) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for C&#8722;H halogenation of arenes and heteroarenes was reported. The initial reaction of DMSO and 1,2&#8208;dihaloethane generates the sulfur ylide, which undergoes pyrolytic elimination of ethylene by affording halonium ions. These ions were accumulated and stabilized by DMSO through coordination by forming halogen cation pools for the halogenation reaction. This protocol was selective for electrophilic monohalogenation of arenes at room temperature; however, polyhalogenated products were formed by raising the reaction temperature. Late&#8208;stage halogenation of heteroarenes and some commonly marketed drugs signifies the synthetic utility of this protocol in pharmaceutical chemistry. Unlike the classical methods, the in&#8208;situ generated electrophilic bromonium ion was further exploited for the direct synthesis of &#945;&#8208;diketones from the alkenes under base&#8208;free conditions.

Abstract
An electrochemical hydroxysulfonylation of &#945;&#8208;CF3 alkenes was accomplished in this work. By using easily available sodium sulfinates as the sulfonylating agents, a series of valuable &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl tertiary alcohols were synthesized under mild and environmentally friendly electrolysis conditions in moderate to good yields. The preliminary mechanistic investigation indicates that this difunctional reaction involves a radical process via a sulfonyl radical. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis shows the significant potential application of this protocol.

Abstract
In the manuscript an application of amino isobenzofulvene intermediates as pentaenamines undergoing 1,6&#8208;addition is described. As a result an alkylation of the indene ring of the starting indene&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehydes with para&#8208;quinone methides is achieved. Stereoselectivity of the process is controlled by C2&#8208;symmetric 2,5&#8208;diphenylpyrrolidine. The developed process exploits the reactivity of amino isobenzofulvene intermediates derived from indene&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehydes in a non&#8208;cycloadditive manner.

A copper&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular decarbonylative cyclization reaction of isatins and trifluoroacetimidohydrazides for the synthesis of 2&#8208;(5&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)aniline derivatives has been developed. This transformation proceeds through a cascade condensation, hydrolysis, decarboxylation, and intramolecular C&#8722;N bond formation sequence. The obtained 1,2,4&#8208;triazole products bearing a free amino group can be readily converted into other useful compounds.

Abstract
Site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8208;H alkenylation was achieved under photo&#8208;irradiation in the presence of a catalytic amount of decatungstate anion, W10O324&#8722;. In this reaction, the radical addition/&#946;&#8208;scission sequence is successfully combined with photocatalytic C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization. The reaction using weaker C&#8722;H bonds such as those in THF revealed that the benzenesulfonyl radical itself underwent HAT directly from the C&#8722;H bond, and a decatungstate anion participated in a chain&#8208;repairing step.

Abstract
The synthesis of enantiopure chiral boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs) is of importance due the intrinsic properties of BODIPYs as fluorophores that could be used as probes for molecular sensing. The present study reports an asymmetric organocatalytic cascade reaction of meso&#8208;chloromethyl BODIPY derivatives with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes catalyzed by a chiral secondary amine. The corresponding BODIPY&#8208;derived cyclopropanes were produced in isolated yields 66&#8211;98%, and with diastereomeric ratios 3/2&#8211;&gt;20/1, and 92&#8211;99% ee for major diastereomer. The synthetic utility of the protocol was exemplified on a set of additional transformations of the corresponding optically pure compounds. In addition, a study explaining the reaction mechanism (DFT computations) and photophysical characterization of all enantioenriched products were accomplished.

Abstract
Herein is reported a Rh2(OAc)4/IMes&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl system that promotes the chemoselective installation of aryl groups at the 2&#8208;position of furo[2,3&#8208;b]pyridine (53&#8211;94% yields). The method is applicable to the direct modification of the natural furoquinoline alkaloid dictamnine. The cardiac effects of the fluorinated analogues improved, compared to dictamnine at 160&#8197;&#956;g/mL. Preliminary mechanism of action studies indicate that the effects might be related to epinephrine &#945; receptors, M&#8208;receptor, and calcium channel receptor.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Isocyanide Insertion to o&#8208;Alkenylanilines: A Route to Isoindolinone Synthesis</title>

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated intermolecular radical insertion of isocyanides to electron&#8208;deficient o&#8208;alkenylanilines leading to isoindolinone is reported. Deuterium (D2O) and H2O18 labelling experiments suggest H and O incorporation in the product. The formation of an N&#8208;centered radical (NCR) via stepwise PT/ET process was confirmed by radical trapping experiments, photoluminescence, cyclic voltammetry and DFT studies. This photo cascade methodology is overall a redox neutral process featuring metal&#8208;free condition and broad substrate scope (32 examples). The synthesis of analogue of GABA receptor antagonist shows the practical utility of this method.

Abstract
Iron(III) chloride mediated para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H chlorination and subsequent annulation of 2&#8208;amidophenol to synthesize C5&#8208; and C5, C7&#8208;chlorinated benzoxazoles was developed. Further, the oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of amidophenol with anisole by ferric chloride was explored to achieve the remotely anisylated benzoxazoles.

Abstract
Arylidene&#8208;&#916;2&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones undergo organocatalyzed annulation with malononitrile, furnishing dihydropyrano[3,2&#8208;b]pyrroles (18 examples, 0&#8211;77% ee in dichloromethane, 11&#8211;44% ee in methanol). The products could be enantiomerically enriched by trituration (11 examples, 95&#8211;99% ee). Enantioselectivity was dependent on the nature of the substrate and the conformation of the catalyst, which in turn was solvent&#8208;controlled. The reaction mechanism, which included two pseudo&#8208;enantiomeric organocatalyst conformations, was investigated by experimental and quantum chemical methods. The reaction mechanism consists of Michael addition reaction step followed by 6&#8208;exo&#8208;dig annulation, which was found to be the rate determining step. Additionally, it was identified that the preferred reaction pathway follows the model originally proposed by P&#225;pai et&#8197;al.

Abstract
A rapid and scalable synthesis of supported NHC&#8722;Pd(II)&#8208;pyridine complexes on a benzyloxycalix[8]arene macrocycle is reported. Their subsequent use in Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura benchmark reactions led to the optimisation of the nature of the ligands around the metal centre, delivering two very active precatalysts. They both promote the cross&#8208;coupling of challenging API precursors at low catalytic loadings, when used as insoluble species in EtOH as a green reaction solvent. Moreover, their activity has been shown to be comparable or even superior to that of more conventional homogeneous catalysts. Of main importance, a simple filtration of the insoluble supported catalysts after reaction afforded the lowest Pd contamination values in the target products, in some cases directly approaching the levels authorised by the industrial regulations. Offering furthermore the possibility of easy palladium recovery in the current context of its overconsumption, we are convinced that these calixarene&#8208;supported NHC&#8208;PEPPSI Pd complexes are valuable tools for the fine chemical industry, to prepare metal&#8208;free functionalised biaryl compounds in high yields, ranging from 76 to 94%.

Abstract
The discovery and investigation of solvent dependency in stereoselective intramolecular amidation of chiral 5&#8208;aminofunctionalized&#8208;2&#8208;fluoromalonate ester derivatives, which gives access to highly functionalized &#948;&#8208;lactams with a quaternary fluorine&#8208;containing stereocenter, is disclosed. Experimental work together with density functional theory calculations led to understanding of how to direct and switch the stereochemical outcome of the stereoselective &#948;&#8208;lactam formation. The merging of this solvent&#8208;dependent stereoselective switch with asymmetric catalysis and cascade reactions gives access to an unprecedented strategy for stereodivergent synthesis of all possible stereoisomers of fluorine&#8208;containing stereocenters adjacent to tertiary stereocenters of a wide range of heterocyclic compounds with 95&#8208;&gt;99% ee in one&#8208;pot. It is also useful for application in total synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Flexible Construction of Functionalized&#8208;Pyrroles under Palladium or Copper Catalysis in the Presence of BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O</title>

Abstract
We have developed a flexible approach enabling the access to highly functionalized pyrroles under palladium or copper catalysis in the presence of BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O. This catalytic methodology utilizes commercially available amines as reaction partners, and features ample scope, scalable and friendly operations with the generation of only water as byproduct. The generality of this protocol is demonstrated by the successful preparation of a range of di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208; and pentasubstituted pyrroles. This methodology is amenable for the synthesis and derivatization of bioactive compounds.

         <title>Visible Light Induced Aerobic Coupling of Arylboronic Acids Promoted by Hydrazone</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Volume 364, Issue 5, Page 922-929, March 1, 2022. </description>

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced oxidative coupling of arylboronic acids has been developed for the synthesis of biaryls. The reaction that employs polydentate hydrazones as the bifunctional catalyst works smoothly under room temperature. It is compatible with a wide range of functional group. The study of UV&#8208;Vis spectrum indicated that hydrazone and its complex with CuI show major absorptions upon visible&#8208;light, which secures the dual role of hydrazone as both ligand and photocatalyst in this reaction. Hence, the reaction is proposed to involve stepwise transmetallations, photo&#8208;induced oxidations, and reductive elimination.

         <dc:description>A selective Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(3)&#8211;H cis&#8208;functionalization of piperidine and tetrahydropyran carboxylic acids is achieved using a C(4) aminoquinoline amide auxiliary. High mono&#8208; and cis&#8208;selectivity is attained by using mesityl carboxylic acid as an additive. Conditions are developed with significantly lower reaction temperatures (&#8804;50 &#176;C) than other reported heterocycle C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization reactions, which is facilitated by a DoE optimization. A one&#8208;pot C&#8211;H functionalization&#8208;epimerization procedure provides the trans&#8208;3,4&#8208;disubstituted isomers directly. Divergent aminoquinoline removal is accomplished with the installation of carboxylic acid, alcohol, amide and nitrile functional groups. Overall fragment compounds suitable for screening are generated in 3&#8208;4 steps from readily&#8208;available heterocyclic carboxylic acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective C&#8722;H Annulation and Alkenylation of 2&#8208;Pyridones with Terminal Alkynes</title>

Abstract
Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective C&#8722;H annulation and alkenylation of 2&#8208;pyridones with terminal alkynes have been developed. The cationic Cp*Rh(III) catalytic system containing FeCl3 additive enables annulation of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridones with terminal alkynes, providing efficient access to 5,7&#8208;diarylated 2&#8208;quinolinones. The reaction pathway can be switched to alkenylation with [Cp*RhCl2]2 as the catalyst, NaOAc as the additive and HOAc as the solvent, affording C6&#8208;alkenylated 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridones in high yields. These protocols accommodate a wide range of substrates with good functional group compatibility.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cp*Rh(III)-catalyzed regioselective C&#8722;H annulation and alkenylation of 2-pyridones with terminal alkynes have been developed. The cationic Cp*Rh(III) catalytic system containing FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; additive enables annulation of 1-(2-pyridyl)-2-pyridones with terminal alkynes, providing efficient access to 5,7-diarylated 2-quinolinones. The reaction pathway can be switched to alkenylation with [Cp*RhCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the catalyst, NaOAc as the additive and HOAc as the solvent, affording C6-alkenylated 1-(2-pyridyl)-2-pyridones in high yields. These protocols accommodate a wide range of substrates with good functional group compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lewis Acid Enhancement of Gold Catalytic Activity Through Counterion Coordination. Synthesis of Benzofulvenes from Progargylsilanes and Benzophenones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple, regioselective and high yielding gold&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of benzofulvenes, from progargylsilanes and benzophenones, is described. Initially, the carbonyl compound is synergistically activated by the silyl moiety and, for the cyclization step, the gold catalytic activity is clearly increased by the participation of aluminum trichloride, acting as a cocatalyst. Several mechanistic intermediates, such as enynes and silylbenzofulvenes, have been isolated. Different control experiments have been performed, indicating the participation of [LAu][NTf2AlCl3] complex as the true catalyst, and revealing a dramatic enhancement of the gold activity by coordination of the Lewis acid to the gold counterion.</dc:description>

Abstract
Relay rhodium(I)/Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis for tandem arylation&#8722;cyclization reaction was developed. Chemodivergent syntheses of benzo&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrans and benzofurans from propargyl alcohols and ortho&#8208;hydroxylated arylboronic acids were achieved under this relay catalysis system. An ortho&#8208;hydroxy effect on changing the chemoselectivity and reactivity was observed.

Abstract
Herein, we have established a method for the construction of &#946;&#8208;keto sulfones through aerobic oxy&#8208;sulfonylation of alkynes with sulfinates. The reaction performed employing air as the oxidant and oxygen source. Moreover, this protocol exhibits low consume of sulfinates, short reaction period, and minimal waste. Mechanism study and density functional theory (DFT) calculation showed that the solvent played a significant role in the transformation.

         <title>Photoinduced Annulation of N&#8208;Phenylbenzamides for the Synthesis of Phenanthridin&#8208;6(5H)&#8208;Ones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A general concise method for the synthesis phenanthridin&#8208;6(5H)&#8208;ones via photoinduced intramolecular annulation of N&#8208;phenylbenzamides was developed. Under argon atmosphere and room temperature, phenanthridin&#8208;6(5H)&#8208;ones were obtained via irradiation N&#8208;phenylbenzamides with a 280&#8197;nm UV lamp in the presence of methanesulfonic acid in toluene. The mechanism is illustrated and believed to proceed in the order of amides tautomerization, 6&#960;&#8208;electric cyclization, [1,5]&#8208;H shift, amide&#8208;imidine tautomerization, keto&#8208;enol tautomerism and evolution hydrogen.

The front cover picture, prepared by Dr Y. Yoshida, illustrates the asymmetric syntheses of N,S&#8208;acetals catalysed by their originally&#8208;designed chiral iodonium salts. The 1,2&#8208;addition reaction of bulky thiols to isatin&#8208;derived ketimines were catalysed by the chiral iodonium salts in excellent yields and enantioselectivities under neutral conditions. The reaction mechanism was studied using NMR experiments and DFT calculations of a plausible intermediate, which revealed that the imine substrate was activated by the catalyst in a hydrogen&#8208; and halogen&#8208;bonding bidentate activation manner. Details can be found in the Research Article by Yoshida and co&#8208;workers. (Y. Yoshida, T. Fujimura, T. Mino, M. Sakamoto, Adv. Synth.

         <title>C&#8722;H Silylation of 2&#8208;Arylpyridine Derivatives by Using Iridium Catalyst and Phosphine&#8208;Borane Ligand</title>

Abstract
Iridium&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8722;C&#8722;H silylation of 2&#8208;arylpyridine derivative with hydrosilane by using phosphine&#8208;borane ligand has been developed. A variety of 2&#8208;arylpyridines could be used for this reaction to give mono&#8208; and disilylated products in 81&#8211;99% yields. In this reaction, the length of linkage between phosphorus and boron plays an important role for the reaction to proceed. We consider that the nitrogen in 2&#8208;arylpyridine coordinates to Lewis acidic boron in the ligand and thus the iridium is led to an ortho&#8722;C&#8722;H bond to cleave it.

We consider that the nitrogen in 2-arylpyridine coordinates to Lewis acidic boron in the ligand and thus the iridium is led to an &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;C&#8722;H bond to cleave it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
A radical di&#8208; and trichloromethylation/cyclization of unactivated alkenes was developed with commercially available dichloromethane and chloroform as di&#8208;and trichloromethyl radical sources under metal&#8208;free conditions. Variously substituted di&#8208; and trichloromethylated pyrrolo&#8208; and piperidino&#8208;quinazolinones were obtained in 47&#8211;94% yields. Additionally, dibromomethylation/cyclization was also achieved under standard conditions when CH2Br2 was utilized. Moreover, the obtained dichloromethylated product can be transformed into 1&#8242;H&#8208;spiro[cyclopropane&#8208;1,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;b]quinazolin]&#8208;9&#8242;(2&#8242;H)&#8208;one after treating by KOH.

Abstract
A green synthesis strategy of 2&#8208;arylquinoxalines and 3&#8208;arylquinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones via ball milling, which could avoid copious solvent waste, was accomplished in this work. Aryl radicals were produced from aryldiazonium salts by using a solvent&#8208;free or catalyst&#8208;free single electron transfer process induced by mechanical force, affording a series of 2&#8208;arylquinoxalines and 3&#8208;arylquinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with 28%&#8211;85 yield.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Photoinduced Deformylative Minisci&#8208;Type Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A metal&#8208;free deformylative Minisci&#8208;type reaction is disclosed by using aliphatic aldehydes as alkyl radical precursors. The reaction proceeds via a sequence of hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) from aldehyde and decarbonylation under mild photochemical conditions. The transformation offers many advantages including good regioselectivity, broad substrate scope, and easy operation. The reaction is also amenable to late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex heteroarenes, and can be readily performed on gram scale.

         <title>Dehydrogenation of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Compounds Using H2O2 and Mediated by Polar Solvents</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The oxidative dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds by using H2O2 as oxidant in combination with polar solvents such as 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) and H2O is described. Among these two solvents, the best yields for the heteroaromatic compounds were generally achieved in HFIP. However, it is remarkable, that the use of a non toxic solvent such as H2O gave such good yields. Furthermore, the procedure was implemented in larger&#8208;scale and HFIP was distilled from the reaction mixture and reused (up to 5&#8197;cycles) without a significant detriment in the reaction outcome.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light (456&#8197;nm) promoted dual catalytic (cobalt&#8208;/photoredox) method for the direct synthesis of sulfonimidoyl guanidine via three&#8208;component reaction of aryl amine, isonitrile and sulfonimidoyl azide (as nitrene source) is developed. The protocol is fast, mild and provides products with a wide range of substrates in 56&#8211;86% yields. Additionally, the replacement of aryl amine with alcohol and thiol as nucleophile leads to the formation of sulfonimidoyl isourea and sulfonimidoyl isothiourea respectively, which are not yet reported in the literature.

         <title>Competing Intra&#8208; vs Intermolecular Nitrene Transfer in the [Au]&#8208;Catalysed Reaction of 2&#8208;Alkynylphenylazides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The possibility of interrupting the gold&#8208;catalysed intramolecular cyclization of 2&#8208;alkynylphenylazide derivatives, employing known nitrene transfer reagents such as anthranil and its isomer 1,2&#8208;benzisoxazole, has been attempted in search of developing simple tools for product diversification. With 1,2&#8208;benzisoxazoles, the intermolecular nitrene transfer leading to quinazoline is competitive with intramolecular azidoalkyne cyclization resulting in spiro indol&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene derivatives. However, in case of the reaction in the presence of anthranil, both intra&#8208; and intermolecular nitrene transfer processes result in the same product indol&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene.

Abstract
An elegant P(nBu)3&#8208;triggered synthetic approach has been developed towards multisubstituted 5,6&#8208;dihydropyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one and pyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives exploiting a domino process involving retro&#8208;Claisen/intra&#8208;MBH/Wittig/vinylogous aldol transformations as well as retro&#8208;Claisen/intra&#8208;MBH/ylide hydrolysis/oxidation sequences. This transformation demonstrates chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity as well as accessible high diversity enchancement in 17&#8211;90% isolated yield.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkynylation of Alkenes via C&#8722;H Activation for the Preparation of Conjugated 1,3&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A general palladium&#8208;catalyzed method for the direct alkynylation of unactivated alkenes via C&#8722;H activation, was successfully developed, with the assistance of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline. It is applicable to both internal and terminal unactivated alkenes with a broad functionality tolerance. This method shows good regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity and provides an alternative approach for directing construct of conjugated 1,3&#8208;enynes.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed monofluoroalkylation of aryl iodides and aryl bromides was developed using nucleophilic ethyl 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)acetate as a monofluoroalkyl source. The transformation proceeded with excellent substrate scope to afford a range of monofluoroalkylated products in good yields under mild conditions, and it proved feasible in a gram&#8208;scale reaction. This protocol was successfully used in late&#8208;stage modification of an estrone derivative, providing a facile route for research on the discovery of biologically active compounds and high&#8208;performance materials.

Abstract
A diastereoselective and enantioselective formal [4+1] ylide annulation of chiral sulfonium salts with various substituted &#945;&#8208;substituted nitroalkene leading to optically active isoxazoline N&#8208;oxides using CF3SO3&#8722; as a key anion has been explored. The salient features of this methodology include high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselecties, easily available starting materials, mild reaction conditions, simple procedure, broad substrate scope and the isoxazoline N&#8208;oxides are conveniently transformed into other functionalized compounds.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed tandem cyclization of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;ethynylphenyl)acetonitriles with isocyanides has been developed. Various indeno[2,1&#8208;b]pyrroles were prepared in 55%&#8211;82% yields under air atmosphere at 100&#8201;&#176;C. The key to the success of this protocol is construction of new C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds via the orderly insertion of isocyanides.

Abstract
A 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine&#8208;catalyzed (3+2) annulation of pyrazoledione&#8208;derived Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) carbonates with 2&#8208;arylideneindane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones has been developed to afford various multifunctional spiropyrazole derivatives in 16&#8211;99% yields with 3:2&#8211;&gt;20:1 diastereoselectivities. As a type of Lewis&#8208;base receptor, the pyrazoledione&#8208;derived MBH carbonates will function as a key substrate in organocatalyzed annulation reactions for diverse syntheses of pyrazolinone&#8208;containing dispirocyclic compounds.

         <title>Use of Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Vinylation for the Synthesis of Bio&#8208;Based (bis)&#8208;Vinyl Ethers</title>

Abstract
The iridium catalyzed transfer vinylation of bio&#8208;based polyols and of other alcohols and phenols with interesting structural motifs was accomplished with vinyl acetate in 2&#8208;MeTHF as a green solvent. The optimized synthetic procedure has as main advantages the use of catalytic instead of stoichiometric amounts of base and high selectivities towards the formation of bis&#8208;vinyl ethers as a result of the suppression of the acetal formation reaction that typically occurs in the vinylation of diols. In addition, the thermodynamically preferred transesterification reaction leading to the acetate esters and bis&#8208;esters was completely suppressed. DFT calculations revealed an iridium&#8208;acetate complex as the active catalytic species and they disclosed the importance of the carbonyl group of vinyl acetate for the formation of a six&#8208;membered cyclic intermediate.

         <title>Organic Photoredox Catalyzed Direct Hydroamination of Ynamides with Azoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Disclosed herein is a photoinduced selective hydroamination of ynamides with nitrogen heteroaromatic nucleophiles. By using an organocatalytic photoredox system, a direct method to construct a diverse of (Z)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;azole enamides from ynamides and pyrazoles, as well as triazoles, benzotriazoles, indazoles, and tetrazoles, is developed, thus providing a photocatalytically synthetic route to heterocyclic motifs common in medicinal agents. Based on the mechanistic studies, the hydroamination is postulated to operate via a mechanism in which the single&#8208;electron oxidation of ynamide and the intermediacy of an alkyne radical cation, is responsible for the observed reactivity.

Abstract
A dearomative formal (4+2)&#8208;cycloaddition reaction between 2&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;furaldehydes derivatives and isatins or &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluoroacetophenones as electrophiles has been established under NHC&#8208;catalysis. This approach utilizes the process of hydrogen chloride 1,4&#8208;elimination leading to a highly reactive NHC&#8208;bound heterocyclic o&#8208;QDM intermediates derived from 3&#8208;furaldehydes, which play a key role in the process. By using this strategy, a series of structurally diverse 6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;furo[3,2&#8208;c]pyran&#8208;4&#8208;ones was prepared in 41&#8211;85% yields. In addition, the potential of the obtained (4+2)&#8208;cycloadducts has been confirmed in the synthesis of interesting class of spirooxindole derivative containing 6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;furo[3,2&#8208;c]pyran scaffold.

         <title>Chiral Binaphthyl&#8208;Based Iodonium Salt (Hypervalent Iodine(III)) as Hydrogen&#8208; and Halogen&#8208;Bonding Bifunctional Catalyst: Insight into Abnormal Counteranion Effect and Asymmetric Synthesis of N,S&#8208;Acetals</title>

Abstract
Asymmetric construction of chiral N,S&#8208;acetal skeletons is important because they are widely present in natural products and pharmaceuticals. Halogen&#8208;bonding is a unique interaction that has been an organic synthesis focus, although research into chiral variants is limited. Halonium salts have been found to act as halogen&#8208;bonding catalysts and asymmetric catalysis using chiral bromonium salts under basic conditions was recently discovered by our group. Herein, we report the asymmetric syntheses of chiral N,S&#8208;acetals in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields and enantioselectivities (82&#8211;97% ee) through bulky thiol additions to imines catalysed by a chiral iodonium salt under neutral conditions. The reaction mechanism was studied using NMR experiments and DFT calculations of a plausible intermediate, which revealed that the imine substrate is activated by the catalyst in a bidentate manner. The abnormal counteranion effect observed for the tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate anion in the present system was examined by 1H NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Tetrahydroquinolines from Imines and Cyclic Ethers via Oxidation/Aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Cycloaddition</title>

Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis of cyclic ether&#8208;annulated tetrahydroquinolines from imines and cyclic ethers in an undivided cell under constant current conditions was developed. The electrosynthesis proceeds via the enol ether formation from ethers following the aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder [4+2] cycloaddition. The method is applicable to a wide range of imines and results in the desired products in yields of 23 to 75%. In situ preparation of imines from the corresponding anilines and aldehydes led to mostly the same yields of tetrahydroquinolines. No cycloaddition products were formed using the chemical oxidants. Synthesized cyclic ether&#8208;annulated tetrahydroquinolines exhibit high antifungal activity, which is superior to the commercial fungicide Triadimefon.
