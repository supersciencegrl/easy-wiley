      <dc:description>Synthesis of triazolo[1,5&#8208;a][1,4]diazepin&#8208;6&#8208;ones on solid support is reported in this article. Amino acids immobilized on Wang resin were nosylated and alkylated with propargyl alcohol or different 3&#8208;phenylprop&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ols using Mitsunobu alkylation conditions. After denosylation, acylation with Fmoc&#8208;azidoalanine yielded linear precursors that were thermally cyclized on resin to give immobilized triazolodiazepinones. After cleavage from the polymer support, the target compounds were obtained in high crude purities and good overall yields.

      <title>Uncatalyzed Formation of Polyaminoboranes from Diisopropylaminoborane and Primary Amines: a Kinetically Controlled Polymerization Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. Recently, we disclosed the uncatalyzed formation of polyaminoboranes (PABs) from monomeric diisopropylaminoborane (iPr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&#8208;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and primary amines (RNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Their structure is studied through a detailed multinuclear NMR study and their full spectroscopic characterization is presented revealing that N&#8208;alkyl substituted PABs exhibit magnetically non&#8208;equivalent methylenic protons in the close vicinity of the BN&#8208;backbone. We also performed an in&#8208;depth theoretical study of this global chemical process. The mechanism is fully apprehended and the strong influence of the temperature on the outcome of the reaction is unveiled. DFT&#8208;calculations clearly show that the formation of the polyaminoboranes (RNH&#8208;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; results from a kinetically controlled step&#8208;growth polymerization reaction that can be globally viewed as a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail association process of the in situ generated transient monomeric monoalkylamino&#8208;borane [RNH&#8208;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;].</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A method for the synthesis of allylboronates via Zweifel&#8208;type deprotonative olefination was demonstrated. Tetrasubstituted vinylboronates were used as the substrates. NCS (N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide) was used as a bifunctional additive, electrophile and base. This method exhibited a different elimination strategy in Zweifel type transformation to afford allylboronates.

      <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Ketothioesters undergo triphenylphosphine (PPh3)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization with acetylenedicarboxylate esters smoothly, in contrast to &#945;&#8208;ketooxoesters which require more drastic conditions with the limited substrate scope.

The higher reactivity of the thioester derivatives is seemingly due to a favourable intramolecular non&#8208;bonding electrostatic 1,4&#8208;interaction involving C&#8210;S &#963;* orbital on the sulphur atom and the lone pair of electrons in the electron&#8208;donating oxygen atom. This is apparent from the X&#8208;ray crystallographically determined internuclear distance between the sulphur and ketone (C=O) oxygen atoms (2.71&#8208;2.85 &#197;), which is significantly less than the sum of their van der Waals radii (3.25&#8208;3.30 &#197;). The substitution on the S atom is oriented diametrically away from the ketone O atom to maximize the interaction between them. The trend is also seen in the 1,4&#8208;S&#8230;.O contact between the S and furan O atoms (2.70 &#197;) in the &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone products.</dc:description>

      <title>Zwitterion&#8208;initiated Hydroboration of Alkynes and Styrene</title>
      <dc:description>The hydroboration of alkynes and styrene with HBpin has been developed using tris(pentaflurophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3) as the initiator of catalysis. The hydroboration is proposed to be initiated by Lewis acid activation of the alkyne by (B(C6F5)3) to form a highly reactive zwitterionic species which subsequently react with HBpin to give the alkenyl boronic ester. This zwitterion has also showed potential to be a competent catalyst for the hydroboration of styrene. The zwitterionic intermediate is analogous to that proposed in the Piers borane&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration and 1,1&#8208;carboboration of alkynes with B(C6F5)3.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The use of diazo compounds in the transition metal catalyzed coupling reaction to form C&#8208;C and C&#8208;X (X=O, S, N, Si, P etc.) bonds have been a well&#8208;established approach in organic synthesis.

However, the use of most abundant, cheaper and environmentally benign metal such as iron to catalyze carbene transfer reaction have attracted a great attention in the last few years. Iron is the second most abundant transition&#8208;metal in nature and also an integral part of various biological systems which made it highly valuable to use as a catalyst in organic chemistry.

      <title>Copper&#8208;catalyzed Reaction of Anthranils with Methyl Ketones: Site&#8208;Selective C5&#8208;Dicarbonylation of Anthranils</title>
      <dc:description>A copper&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective C5&#8208;dicarbonylation reaction of anthranils has been developed for synthesis of 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds using methyl ketone as a commercially available carbonylation reagent. This process represents the first example to implement the C5&#8208;dicarbonylation of anthranils, which involves an oxidative Csp3&#8211;H/Csp2&#8211;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction along with thermolytic N&#8211;O bond cleavage.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Development of Recoverable MacMillan Catalysts for Asymmetric Organic Transformations</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral imidazolidinone as an organocatalyst was developed by MacMillan and co&#8208;workers in 2000 and they evaluated this organocatalyst originally in the enantioselective Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. Later, this catalyst was used in a number of other asymmetric organic transformations. Chiral organocatalysts are expensive, therefore their recoverability and reusability are highly desirable to make the organic transformation economically viable for industrial application. Hence, the chiral imidazolidinone was modified and attached to different supports for its recoverability and reusability. A number of recoverable imidazolidinones have been reported in asymmetric Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. In this review, we have summarized the reports on reusable and recoverable imidazolidinones (MacMillan catalysts) as organocatalysts in asymmetric organic transformations.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>(S)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypiperidine [(S)&#8208;NBHP] is a key intermediate for the synthesis of mantle cell lymphoma drug, ibrutinib.

By screening key resi&#8208;dues in substrate binding pocket of KpADH, an excellent variant Y127W was obtained with 6&#8208;fold improved activity of 119.3 U&#183;mg&#8208;1, 1.8&#8208;fold enhanced half&#8208;life of 147 h and strict S&#8208;stereoselectivity (&gt;99% ee). When catalyzed by Y127W, a complete conversion of 600 g&#183;L&#8208;1 NBPO was achieved at a substrate to catalyst ratio (S/C) of 30 in 10 h. Based on crystal&#8208;structure of Y127W, molecular docking and dynamic simulations reveal hydrogen bonds formed between W127 and Boc group of NBPO, as well as improved structural stability mainly contribute to the increased catalytic activity and stereoselectivity of Y127W. This study offers guidance for engineering ADHs for biosynthesis of chiral hetero&#8208;cyclic alcohols, and provides insights into mechanisms in catalytic activity and stereoselectivity toward car&#8208;bonyl&#8208;containing heterocyclic substrates.</dc:description>

      <title>Catalytic Photoredox Allylation of Aldehydes Promoted by a Cobalt Complex</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. The preparation of homoallylic alcohols by addition organometallic allyl compounds to carbonyls is an important strategy in organic chemistry. Allylating organometallic cobalt species can be generated employing stoichiometric quantities of Zn acting as reductant. To avoid the employment of stoichiometric amount of Zn, we have developed an allylation reaction of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes promoted by photoredox catalysis in the presence of a cobalt complex, and we present herein a full account of our research. In the presence of the abundant CoBr2 (10 mol%), 4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl (dtbbpy, 10 mol%), allyl acetate (3 equiv),	[Ir(dtbbpy)(ppy)2]PF6 (ppy = 2&#8208;phenylpyridine, 2 mol%), and N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (4 equiv), an allylation of aldehydes is taking place, in moderate to good yields. Substrates scope, limitations, and photophysical investigations of this new process are reported.</dc:description>

The selectivity in the coupling of primary alcohols with phosphorus ylides to form carbon&#8211;carbon single (C&#8211;C) and carbon&#8211;carbon double (C=C) bonds can be controlled by the ligands. In the conversion of more challenging secondary alcohols with phosphorus ylides the selectivity towards the formation of C&#8211;C vs. C=C bonds can be controlled by the reaction conditions, namely the amount of base. The scope and limitations of the coupling reactions were thoroughly evaluated by the conversion of 21 alcohols and 15 ylides. Notably, compared to existing methods, which are based on precious metal complexes as catalysts, the present catalytic system is based on earth abundant manganese catalysts.The reaction can also be performed in a sequential one&#8208;pot reaction generating the phosphorus ylide in situ followed manganese catalyzed C&#8211;C and C=C bond formation. Mechanistic studies suggest that the C&#8211;C bond was generated via a borrowing hydrogen pathway and the C=C bond formation followed an acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling pathway.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A method for Beckmann rearrangement (BKR) using ethyl 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfonyloxyimino) acetate (o&#8208;NosylOXY) under microwave irradiation is reported. Ketoximes (19 examples) are converted to the corresponding amides/lactams with 69&#8208;97% yields in ~10 minutes without any Lewis acid or co&#8208;catalyst. This is an example of halogen&#8208;free organocatalytic BKR. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)&#8208; and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)&#8208;based detailed mechanistic investigation suggest that o&#8208;NosylOXY acts as an initiator. Such initiators are reported before based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, we report here the HRMS signatures of two transient intermediates, the nitrilium ion and the nitrilium ion's dimeric species. Rigorous NMR&#8208;based investigation of the reaction mechanism is performed. Our results indicate that the reported BKR proceeds via two consecutive rearrangements.</dc:description>

      <title>Site&#8208;Selective Pd&#8208;Catalysed Fujiwara&#8208;Moritani type Reaction of N,S&#8208;Heterocyclic Systems with Olefins</title>
      <dc:description>Dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;thiazine skeletons bearing olefin fragment at their &#945;&#8208;position were prepared through a robust Pd(OAc)2&#8211;catalysed Fujiwara&#8208;Moritani type reaction via C&#8211;H alkenylation with olefins. This approach is selective, generalizable to a wide range of olefins and requires only 1 eq. of Ag2CO3 without the need of co&#8208;oxidant. The C&#8211;H bond activation proved to be strongly dependent on the olefin&#8217;s substitution while unfused dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;thiazines seemed to be affected by the oxidation state of the sulfur atom. The utility of olefins obtained was demonstrated by their implication in the dipolar cycloaddition reaction with a non&#8208;stabilized azomethine ylide.</dc:description>

      <title>C2&#8208;Functionalization of Pyridines/Quinolines by N&#8208;Oxide Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
There is a famous sentence in Tao Te Ching: &#8220;The Tao produced one. One produced two. Two produced three. Three produced all things.&#8221; In this front cover picture, Tai Chi stands for Tao, and &#8220;N&#8221; and &#8220;O&#8221; in the two circles represent N&#8208;oxides of this paper. Thunder and lightning stimulate Tai Chi to produce everything, which is represented by the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Therefore, this picture indicates that pyridine N&#8208;oxides can produce numerous nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds under the action of activating reagent. Details can be found in the Review by Dong Wang and co&#8208;workers (L. D&#233;saubry, G. Li, M. Huang, S. Zheng), Adv. Synth. Catal. 2021, 363, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202000910).
