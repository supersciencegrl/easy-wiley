Abstract
A synthetic method is presented for S&#8722;N bond formation starting from cheap and affordable materials. We show that (un)substituted N&#8208;protected cyclic eight&#8208;membered C2&#8208;symmetric sulfenamides have been prepared in a few steps using this procedure. The synthetic utility of these ambipolar derivatives was demonstrated in a variety of synthetic transformations affording different S,N&#8208;heterocyles of pharmaceutical relevance in one or two steps from simple starting materials.

Abstract
A method to synthesize pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]cinnolines via rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation of pyrazolidinones and subsequent [4+2] annulation of sulfoxonium ylides was developed. 5&#8208;Substituted or 5,10&#8208;disubstituted pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]cinnolines could be obtained by slightly adjusting the reaction conditions. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and practical transformations proved the practicability of this method. The mechanism of this method was proposed in the article on the basis of preliminary mechanistic results and previous reports. This method features simplified operation, metal&#8208;oxidant free, and readily available reactants.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Functionalization of Selenocystine&#8208;Containing Peptides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A straightforward and atom&#8208;economic method for the functionalization of short selenocystine&#8208;containing peptides is presented. This method is shown to be tolerant to unprotected peptides. The detailed protocol is based on the generation of a selenium radical via visible light&#8208;initiated reaction in the presence of transition metal&#8208;free photocatalyst. The selenium radical is further oxidized to an electrophile and trapped by N&#8208;heterocycles. The mechanism is confirmed by NMR, HRMS, UV, EPR and cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments and photocatalyst emission quenching studies. A visible light&#8208;initiated reaction is employed for the synthesis of selenocysteine&#8208;containing indole&#8208;based macrocycles via intramolecular Se&#8722;C bond formation.

Abstract
A [4+3] annulation of 2&#8208;ylideneoxindoles with crotonate&#8208;derived sulfur ylides has been developed. A series of oxepino[3,2&#8208;b]indoles were prepared in moderate to excellent yields (62&#8208;93%) under mild conditions. Moreover, the synthetic oxepino[3,2&#8208;b] indoles can be further transformed into more complex cyclopropa[5,6]oxepino[3,2&#8208;b]indoles via a [2+1] cyclopropanation. In addition, the synthetic compounds show certain antiproliferative activity against K562 and MCF&#8208;7 cells, and its IC50 values for these two kinds of tumor cells up to 5.40&#177;0.88&#8197;&#956;M and 18.41&#177;0.50&#8197;&#956;M, respectively.

         <title>Enantioselective Catalyzed Synthesis of Amino Derivatives Using Electrophilic Open&#8208;Chain N&#8208;Activated Ketimines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
N&#8208;Activated ketimines are characterized by the presence of acyl, sulfonyl, and phosphinoyl groups linked to the nitrogen atom of the azomethine system. These electron&#8208;withdrawing groups enhance the electrophilic character of the imino moiety allowing the addition of even weak nucleophilic reagents. The presence of the oxygen atoms in these activating groups with its coordinating and Lewis or Br&#248;nsted properties is of paramount importance in asymmetric catalyzed reactions. This review collects the results that have appeared in the literature during the last two decades on the utilization of open&#8208;chain N&#8208;activated ketimines for the synthesis of optically active &#945;&#8208;disubstituted and &#945;&#8208;trisubstituted amino derivatives including nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds.

This review collects the results that have appeared in the literature during the last two decades on the utilization of open-chain &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-activated ketimines for the synthesis of optically active &#945;-disubstituted and &#945;-trisubstituted amino derivatives including nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
An iron&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component cyanoalkylsulfonylation of 2,3&#8208;allenoic acids, K2S2O5, and the ring&#8208;opening of cyclobutanone oxime esters is described. The radical tandem cyclization route allows access to diverse cyanoalkylsulfonylated butenolides in moderate to good yields under mild conditions. Moreover, the products are further converted, offering the corresponding derivatives.

         <dc:description>
The front cover picture, designed and donated by WesWizzArt and painted by the Mexican artist Way (Wayra Castillo&#8208;Guerrero), illustrates the toluene dioxygenase&#8208;catalyzed conversion of aromatics. The enzyme exhibits a high affinity for monocyclic, but only a low one for bicyclic substrates. A semi&#8208;rational designed mutant library opened the way for the conversion of the bicyclic substrates naphthalene, 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline and 2&#8208;phenylpyridine at unprecedented rates, enabling the biosynthesis of their products in substantial quantities. Variants at active site positions M220, A223 and F366 exhibited a major influence in product formation and selectivity. Details can be found in the Research Article by Bernhard Hauer and co&#8208;workers (J. L. Wissner, J. T. Schelle, W. Escobedo&#8208;Hinojosa, A. Vogel, B. Hauer, Adv. Synth.

         <title>Catalytic Formal Hydroamination of Allylic Alcohols Using Manganese PNP&#8208;Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture, designed by L. Duarte de Almeida et al. illustrates the successful application of a well&#8208;defined manganese PNP pincer complex in the formal hydroamination of allylic alcohols with primary and secondary amines as well as with N&#8208;heterocycles. The corresponding &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols were obtained in up to 94% yield in a tandem reaction combining dehydrogenation/Michael addition/hydrogenation sequence. The properties of these non&#8208;innocent pincer ligands allowed application of this non&#8208;noble metal catalyst in organic synthesis with a broad substrate scope. Details can be found in the communication by M. Beller, K. Junge and co&#8208;workers (L. Duarte de Almeida, F. Bourriquen, K. Junge, M. Beller, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2021, 363, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202100081).

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of alkynes and phosphorus&#8208;centered radicals is an important method for preparing organophosphorus compounds. However, the reaction is often limited to using activated alkynes or highly reactive phosphorus&#8208;centered radicals as raw materials due to the low reactivity of alkynes. Here, we describe an application of hydroazidation in the instant activation of alkynes for achieving the oxyphosphorylation of unactivated alkynes with diarylphosphinoyl radicals under mild reaction conditions. This reaction provides an efficient method for accessing &#946;&#8208;ketophosphine oxides and phosphorus&#8208;containing pyrroles.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation/Annulation Cascade of Aryl Oximes and Propargyl Alcohols to Isoquinoline N&#8208;Oxides</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
A &#946;&#8208;hydroxy elimination instead of common oxidization to carbonyl group in secondary propargyl alcohols was successfully developed to form 2&#8208;benzyl substituted isoquinoline N&#8208;oxides by a Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation and annulation cascade, in which moderate to excellent yields (up to 92%) could be obtained under mild reaction conditions, along with good regioselectivity, broad generality and applicability.

         <title>Utilization of C(sp3)&#8208;Carboxylic Acids and Their Redox&#8208;Active Esters in Decarboxylative Carbon&#8210;Carbon Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the last several years, radical&#8208;mediated decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reactions employing alkyl carboxylic acids have emerged as a powerful tool for the regio&#8208;specific construction of carbon&#8210;carbon bonds.  Under thermal or photocatalytic conditions, a wide variety of C(sp3)&#8208;carboxylic acids and their redox&#8208;active esters undergo decarboxylative C&#8211;C bond formation with suitable reactant partners, leading to complex chemical scaffolds with wide&#8208;ranging applications.  This synthetic strategy has several benefits over the more conventional organometallic reagents including abundant starting material availability, high functional group tolerance and mild reaction conditions. This review article highlights recent developments in the functionalization of &#945;&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted carboxylic acids as well as more challenging unactivated acids, with representative examples discussed against the backdrop of insightful comments on reaction mechanisms. In addition, examples of the synthesis of natural products, drug molecules and the late&#8208;stage modification of bioactive molecules employing this non&#8208;traditional C&#8211;C bond formation strategy are included. This review has been categorized into three main sections that are organized around the type of C&#8211;C bond being forged: C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2), C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) and C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp). Further, the reactions of carboxylic acids and their redox&#8208;active esters have been organized separately in each section.</dc:description>

Abstract
We developed a method for the preparation of (diacetoxyiodo)&#8208;2&#8208;(N&#8208;alkylamido)benzene as an aniline&#8208;type hypervalent iodine(III). We also achieved direct cyclizations via C&#8722;H bond abstraction, such as the Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag reaction, a direct amination, and a direct lactonization, using the aniline&#8208;type hypervalent iodine(III) to obtain corresponding products in high yields.

         <title>Chemoselective Peptide Backbone Diversification and Bioorthogonal Ligation by Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation/Annulation</title>

Abstract
The field of peptide derivatization by metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation has been mostly directed to modify the side chains, but poor attention has been given to the peptide backbone. Here we report a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation/annulation process that can chemoselectively modify the peptide backbone producing functionalized isoquinolone scaffolds with high regioselectivity in a rapid and step&#8208;economical manner. This strategy is characterized by racemization&#8208;free conditions and the production of fluorescent peptides, and peptide conjugates to drugs, natural products and other peptide fragments, providing a chemical approach for the construction of novel peptide&#8208;pharmacophore conjugates. Mechanistic studies suggest that amide bonds of peptide backbone act as the bidentate directing group to promote the C&#8722;H activation/annulation process. This report provides an unprecedented example of peptide backbone diversification and bioorthogonal ligation exploiting the power of ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation.

Abstract
Directing group&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H activation has been widely used to control regioselectivity in the field of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization. Common functionalities found in complex organic molecules and/or readily available reagents are the most appealing directing groups, as they circumvent the need to install/remove the directing group. The aldehyde group is an important functional group in many areas including pharmaceuticals and material science. In this review, we present the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in aldehyde&#8208;assisted, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed sp2 C&#8722;H functionalization of arenes.

Abstract
An organoselenium&#8208;enabled radical relay Azidation&#8208;carbocyclization reaction for the preparation of azide&#8208;substituted quinoline&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones was developed. A series of previously unknown structurally diverse azide&#8208; substituted quinoline&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones were obtained under metal&#8208;free and room&#8208;temperature conditions. The key features of this reaction are a broad substrate scope, amenability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and easy product derivatization. Preliminary mechanistic studies support participation of an organoselenium species in a radical relay pathway.

         <title>An Amphiphilic (salen)Co Complex &#8211; Utilizing Hydrophobic Interactions to Enhance the Efficiency of a Cooperative Catalyst
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An amphiphilic (salen)Co(III) complex is presented that accelerates the hydrolytic kinetic resolution (HKR) of epoxides almost 10 times faster than catalysts from commercially available sources. This was achieved by introducing hydrophobic chains that increase the rate of reaction in one of two ways &#8211; by enhancing cooperativity under homogeneous conditions, and increasing the interfacial area under biphasic reaction conditions. While numerous strategies have been employed to increase the efficiency of cooperative catalysts, the utilization of hydrophobic interactions is scarce. With the recent upsurge in green chemistry methods that conduct reactions &#8216;on water&#8217; and at the oil&#8208;water interface, the introduction of hydrophobic interactions has potential to become a general strategy for enhancing the catalytic efficiency of cooperative catalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective [3+1+1+1] Cycloaddition to Six&#8208;Membered Carbocycle Based on DMSO as Dual Carbon Synthon</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A [3+1+1+1] cycloaddition was developed among 2&#8208;arylpropene, ketone and DMSO in the presence of K2S2O8. 2&#8208;arylpropene provides three carbons, ketone offers one carbon, and DMSO as dual carbon donor contributes two carbons to the six&#8208;membered carbocycle. It gave the cyclohexene motif and spirocyclohexene skeleton. Four C&#8722;C bonds formed in this process. Both propylene and ketone could be well tolerated and give the corresponding cyclohexene or spirocyclohexene motif in useful yields. Based on the controlled experiments, a possible mechanism was proposed.

         <title>Alkene, Bromide, and ROH &#8211; How To Achieve Selectivity? Electrochemical Synthesis of Bromohydrins and Their Ethers</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Bromohydrins and their ethers were electrochemically synthesized via hydroxy&#8208; and alkoxybromination of alkenes using potassium bromide and water or alcohols. High selectivity of bromohydrins formation was achieved only with the use of DMSO as the solvent and an acid as the additive. The proposed combination of starting reagents, additives, and solvents allowed to form bromohydrins or their ethers selectively despite the variety of side&#8208;products (epoxides, dibromides, diols). Bromohydrins were obtained in high yields, up to 96%, with a broad substrate scope in an undivided electrochemical cell equipped with glassy carbon and platinum electrodes at high current density.

         <title>Ir(NHC)&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Alkylated Alcohols via Borrowing Hydrogen Strategy: Influence of Bimetallic Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Multi N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene(NHC)&#8208;modified iridium catalysts were employed in the &#946;&#8208;alkylation of alcohols; dimerization of primary alcohols (Guerbet reaction), cross&#8208;coupling of secondary and primary alcohols, and intramolecular cyclization of alcohols. Mechanistic studies of Guerbet reaction, including kinetic experiments, mass analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, were employed to explain the fast reaction promoted by bimetallic catalysts, and the dramatic reactivity increase of monometallic catalysts at the late stage of the reaction.

Abstract
Carbon bisnucleophiles are important building blocks in organic synthesis and have widespread applications in the construction of carbocyclic compounds. Among them, 1,2&#8208;carbon bisnucleophile has been much less explored. Herein, we developed a [2+3] annulation of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;oxoindolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)malononitrile with 2&#8208;nitroallylic acetates, where 2&#8208;(2&#8208;oxoindolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)malononitrile served as a new type of 1,2&#8208;carbon bisnucleophile. Remarkably, the annulation reaction exhibits exclusive chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. A Michael addition/SN2 mechanism was proposed to avoid the &#8220;anti&#8208;Baldwin&#8221; cyclization. This stereoselective strategy provides a facile synthetic route for a new series of spirocyclopentane oxindole derivatives containing three stereogenic centers.

Abstract
A metal&#8208;free approach for the synthesis of 5&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoles via I2&#8208;mediated [4+1] annulation of readily available trifluoroacetimidohydrazides and methyl ketones has been achieved. The transformation involves iodination/Kornblum oxidation, intermolecular dehydration condensation and an iodine&#8208;mediated intramolecular cyclization/aromatization sequence. The developed protocol can be easily scaled up to 3&#8197;mmol scale without obvious efficiency decrease and be implemented by a consecutive one&#8208;pot manner.

Abstract
2&#8208;(2&#8208;Oxoalkylidene)&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazolidine derivatives were synthesized in good to excellent yields regiospecifically through the catalyst&#8208;free electrophilic ring expansion of N&#8208;unprotected aziridines and the ketene C=O double bond of &#945;&#8208;oxoketenes, in&#8197;situ generated from the microwave&#8208;assisted Wolff rearrangement of 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diketones. The ring expansion predominantly underwent an SN1 process and the hydrogen bond decides the (E)&#8208;configuration of products.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Heck/Insertion/Decarboxylation Domino Sequence: Synthesis of Dihydrocyclohepta[de]naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization for the construction of fused dihydrocyclohepta[de]naphthalene skeletons was developed. The skeleton was assembled from 3&#8208;iodo&#8208;4H&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;one, norbornene and 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;naphthoic acid. Unlike the classic Catellani reaction, which involves the removal of norbornene, in the present system, norbornene acts as a building block for the construction of rigid nonplanar molecular architectures rather than as an ortho&#8208;directing transient mediator. This synthesis involves the formation of three C&#8208;C bonds via a one&#8208;pot process, and it is compatible of a series of substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208; and Substrate&#8208;Dependent Chemodivergent Reactivity of Stabilised Sulfur Ylides with Salicylaldehydes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Stabilised sulfur ylides are synthetically appealing compounds, which reactivity under Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis has been poorly explored. Herein, we report a new catalyst&#8208; and substrate&#8208; dependent chemodivergent reaction between stabilised sulfur ylides and salicylaldehydes, leading to the (suprising) formation of 2H&#8208;chromenes or dihydrobenzofurans products. Particular attention was set on the unusual mechanisms involved. Two unique reaction routes including two ylide units in the reactions are proposed. These pathways were validated by performing a selectivity switch in some cases, enabled by the modulation of the nucleophilicity of the sulfur ylide, and by the loading of the Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst in the reaction.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Phloretin &#945;&#8208;Glucosides Using a Sucrose Phosphorylase Mutant and its Effect on Solubility, Antioxidant Properties and Skin Absorption</title>

Abstract
Glycosylation of polyphenols may increase their aqueous solubility, stability, bioavailability and pharmacological activity. Herein, we used a mutant of sucrose phosphorylase from Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum engineered to accept large polyphenols (variant TtSPP_R134A) to produce phloretin glucosides. The reaction was performed using 10% (v/v) acetone as cosolvent. The selective formation of a monoglucoside or a diglucoside (53% and 73% maximum conversion percentage, respectively) can be kinetically controlled. MS and 2D&#8208;NMR determined that the monoglucoside was phloretin 4&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside and the diglucoside phloretin&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;[&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranosyl&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;O&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside], a novel compound. The molecular features that determine the specificity of this enzyme for 4&#8217;&#8208;OH phenolic group were analysed by induced&#8208;fit docking analysis of each putative derivative, using the crystal structure of TtSPP and changing the mutated residue. The mono&#8208; and diglucoside were, respectively, 71&#8208; and 1200&#8208;fold more soluble in water than phloretin at room temperature. The &#945;&#8208;glucosylation decreased the antioxidant capacity of phloretin, measured by DPPH and ABTS assays; however, this loss was moderate and the activity could be recovered upon deglycosylation in&#8197;vivo. Since phloretin attracts a great interest in dermocosmetic applications, we analyzed the percutaneous absorption of glucosides and the aglycon employing a pig skin model. Although the three compounds were detected in all skin layers (except the fluid receptor), the diglucoside was present mainly on superficial layers.

The effect of the structural features of starting compounds on the process course was determined. The main attention was focused to discover the reaction conditions for the formal (4+2)&#8208;cycloaddition pathway with the possibility of variation of the &#945;&#8208;substituent in azadiene instead of known (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition synthetic methodology.

Three substrate&#8208;sensitive diverse Lewis acid catalytic systems have been employed based on Sc(OTf)3, Sn(OTf)2, and GaCl3. The use of GaCl3 as a Lewis acid allows to obtain a minor product of the formal (2+2+2)&#8208;cycloaddition, which represents a fully 1,2,3,4,5,6&#8208;hexasubstituted cyclohexane derivative produced with diastereoselectivity &gt;30:1.

Abstract
The substrate scope of the asymmetric allylation with zinc organyls catalyzed by 3,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl)&#8208;1,1&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl hydrogenphosphate (TRIP) has been extended to non&#8208;cyclic ester organozinc reagents and ketones. Tertiary chiral alcohols are obtained with ee's up to 94% and two stereogenic centers can be created. Compared to the previous lactone reagent the stereopreference switches almost completely, proving the fact that the nature of the organometallic compound is of immense importance for the asymmetry of the product.

         <dc:description>Pseudocyclic &#946;&#8208;trifluorosulfonyloxy vinylbenziodoxolones were prepared starting from hydroxybenziodoxolones and alkynes in the presence of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid. The reaction of these compounds with azide anion leads to &#946;&#8208;azido vinylbenziodoxolones as products of vinylic nucleophilic substitution in which addition&#8208;elimination reactions occur and the double bond configuration is retained. The structures of &#946;&#8208;trifluorosulfonyloxy vinylbenziodoxolone and &#946;&#8208;azido vinylbenziodoxolone were established by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Fused Indolines via Copper (II)&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomatizing Cyclization of Indoles</title>

Abstract
Herein, a copper(II)&#8208;catalyzed dearomative cyclization amination of N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminobenzoyl) indoles is presented. Under mild reaction conditions, the cyclization proceeds to afford tetracyclic indolines by forming a new C&#8722;N bond in good yields. The tetracyclic 5a,6&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,1&#8208;b]quinazolin&#8208;12(5H)&#8208;ones are obtained in good to excellent yields (up to 99% yield) by using trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH) mediated N&#8722;Ts bond cleavage. The obtained compounds could be easily functionalized by simple synthetic methods.

         <title>Discovery of New Carbonyl Reductases Using Functional Metagenomics and Applications in Biocatalysis</title>

Abstract
Enzyme discovery for use in the manufacture of chemicals, requiring high stereoselectivities, continues to be an important avenue of research. Here, a sequence directed metagenomics approach is described to identify short chain carbonyl reductases. PCR from a metagenomic template generated 37 enzymes, with an average 25% sequence identity, twelve of which showed interesting activities in initial screens. Six of the most productive enzymes were then tested against a panel of 21 substrates, including bulkier substrates that have been noted as challenging in biocatalytic reductions. Two enzymes were selected for further studies with the Wieland Miescher ketone. Notably, enzyme SDR&#8208;17, when co&#8208;expressed with a co&#8208;factor recycling system produced the anti&#8208;(4aR,5S) isomer in excellent isolated yields of 89% and 99% e.e. These results demonstrate the viability of a sequence directed metagenomics approach for the identification of multiple homologous sequences with low similarity, that can yield highly stereoselective enzymes with applicability in industrial biocatalysis.

         <title>Decarboxylation&#8208;Initiated Intermolecular Carbon&#8208;Heteroatom Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Carboxylic acids are among the most used feedstock chemicals due to their great structural diversity and easy handling. The use of carboxylic acids and their derivatives in decarboxylative couplings has proven to be a valuable tool for the construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. This synthetic strategy provides a complementary bond disconnection to traditional cross&#8208;coupling methods. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of decarboxylation&#8208;initiated intermolecular C&#8208;heteroatom bond formation, outlining several main mechanistic concepts combined with early examples and highlighting the achievements made in the past decade until January 2021. In these reactions, carboxylic acids and their derivatives undergo initial decarboxylation and then react with other heteroatom electrophiles and nucleophiles, thus replacing the carboxylate group with a valuable and prevalent heteroatom functionality.

         <title>Chemodivergent Photocatalytic Synthesis of Dihydrofurans and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones</title>

Abstract
A synthetic procedure, catalysed by Ir(ppy)3 under visible&#8208;light irradiation, for the chemodivergent synthesis of 2,3&#8208;dihydrofurans (3) or &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones (7) starting from &#945;&#8208;halo ketones (1) and alkenes (2) has been developed. The mild reaction conditions and the redox&#8208;neutral nature of the process make it particularly sustainable avoiding the use of both sacrificial reactants and stoichiometric strong oxidants. Careful experimental investigations, supported by DFT calculations, allowed to disclose in details a possible mechanistic pathway and to direct the synthesis chemodivergently either toward 3 or 7, depending not only on the nature of the substrates, but also on the choice of the experimental conditions.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts Alkylation Reactions of Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Substituted and annulated pyrroles containing chiral centers are potentially accessible by means of an organocatalytic enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation (FCA) reaction. They are interesting compounds because of their abundant natural occurrence and their different biological activities. In comparison to indoles, for which a myriad of asymmetric procedures involving the FCA have been developed, pyrroles have been relatively less used as nucleophilic counterparts in this reaction. However, in the last two decades, huge synthetic efforts have been performed around this interesting asymmetric transformation and several methodologies have been devised. In this context, this review article provides a general overview of the organocatalytic enantioselective FCA chemistry of pyrroles, which has not been revised to date.

         <title>The Trityl&#8208;Cation Mediated Phosphine Oxides Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Reduction of phosphine oxides into the corresponding phosphines using PhSiH3 as a reducing agent and Ph3C+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; as an initiator is described. The process is highly efficient, reducing a broad range of secondary and tertiary alkyl and arylphosphines, bearing various functional groups in generally good yields. The reaction is believed to proceed through the generation of a silyl cation, which reaction with the phosphine oxide provides a phosphonium salt, further reduced by the silane to afford the desired phosphine along with siloxanes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduction of phosphine oxides into the corresponding phosphines using PhSiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a reducing agent and Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; as an initiator is described. The process is highly efficient, reducing a broad range of secondary and tertiary alkyl and arylphosphines, bearing various functional groups in generally good yields. The reaction is believed to proceed through the generation of a silyl cation, which reaction with the phosphine oxide provides a phosphonium salt, further reduced by the silane to afford the desired phosphine along with siloxanes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Copper(0) nanoparticle catalyzed Z&#8208;Selective Transfer Semihydrogenation of Internal Alkynes</title>

Abstract
The use of copper(0) nanoparticles in the transfer semihydrogenation of alkynes has been investigated as a lead&#8208;free alternative to Lindlar catalysts. A stereo&#8208;selective methodology for the hydrogenation of internal alkynes to the corresponding (Z)&#8208;alkenes in high isolated yields (86% average) has been developed. This green and sustainable transfer hydrogenation protocol relies on non&#8208;noble copper nanoparticles for reduction of both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient, aliphatic&#8208;substituted and aromatic&#8208; substituted internal alkynes. Polyols, such as ethylene glycol and glycerol, have been proven to act as hydrogen sources, and excellent stereo&#8208; and chemoselectivity have been observed. Enabling technologies, such as microwave and ultrasound irradiation are shown to enhance heat and mass transfer, whether used alone or in combination, resulting in a decrease in reaction time from hours to minutes.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkene Thioacylation: A C&#8722;S Bond Activation Approach for Accessing Indanone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular alkene thioacylation reaction initiated by the activation of thioester C(acyl)&#8722;S bonds is reported. This approach successfully suppressed decarbonylation and &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination with related acyl and alkyl metal thiolate intermediates, providing an efficient and atom&#8208;economical method to access indanone scaffolds. Mechanistic studies provide support for C(acyl)&#8722;Pd bond insertion of olefins. The synthetic utility of this protocol is demonstrated by the further conversion of the newly formed methylene sulfide substituent.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The electrochemical generation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) offers a mild and selective alternative to traditional synthetic methods that usually rely on strong bases and air&#8208;sensitive materials. The use of electrons as reagents results in an efficient and clean synthesis that enables the direct use of NHCs in various applications. Herein, the use of electrogenerated NHCs in organocatalysis, synthesis and organometallic chemistry is explored.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The review summarizes recent advances in the synthesis of C2&#8208;halogenated nitrogen heterocycles via nucleophilic halogenation of corresponding N&#8208;oxides as well as application of this methodology in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. Both scientific and patent literature is reviewed mostly over the period of the last ten years. The review contains a practical guide (typical procedures and infographic based on extensive literature analysis), which can help practitioners in choosing optimal reagents/conditions for nucleophilic halogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles of different types. The bibliography contains 199&#8197;references.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Chemoselective and Stereoselective Approach to Synthesis of Spiro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;Lactams with Potent Anticancer Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Chemoselective approaches were developed for derivatizing diastereoselective chromanone spiro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams through the Michael&#8208;type addition by using amide as a weak nucleophile to construct the spiro&#8208;carbon center under basic conditions. To expand the scope of this post&#8208;Ugi cascade reaction, a new series of oxidized chromone derivatives was synthesized by altering solvent from EtOH to DMF. Compounds 7&#8201;a and 7&#8201;b which could be synthesized in one day, demonstrated comparable anticancer activities with legendary anticancer drug paclitaxel in the PANC and U87&#8197;cell lines. This methodology offers a new approach to construct spiro&#8208;carbon centers with functionalized chromanones or chromones under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced Synthesis of Functionalized Coumarins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Functionalized coumarins are privileged scaffolds which display diverse pharmacological and physiological activities, and a myriad of applications in medical science and biomedical research. Owing to these multifarious activities of coumarins, synthetic chemists are actively engaged in developing new and superior methods for their synthesis. In the last decade, the synthesis of functionalized coumarins via visible light&#8208;induced methodologies has turned into one of the most significant and fundamental missions in organic synthesis. This review covers the literature on the synthesis of functionalized coumarins under visible light&#8208;assisted methodologies.

Abstract
Nano&#8208;ferrite&#8208;supported Cu nanoparticles (Fe&#8208;dopamine&#8208;Cu NPs) catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroboration of alkenes with B2pin2 is reported under mild reaction conditions. This protocol can be applied to a broad range of substrates with high functional group compatibility. In addition, we demonstrated the use of Fe&#8208;dopamine&#8208;Cu NPs as a catalyst for the &#946;&#8208;borylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones and ester, providing alkylboronate esters in up to 98% yield. Reuse of the magnetically recyclable catalyst resulted in no significant loss of activity in up to five reaction runs for both systems.

Abstract
Alkenes with three boryl groups of differing reactivities were synthesized and subsequently cross&#8208;coupled regioselectively with aryl halides in a stepwise manner to afford tetrasubstituted alkenes. The key triborylalkene is derived from the platinum&#8208;catalyzed diboration of alkynyl&#8722;B(dan)s with B2(pin)2. Due to excellent regioselectivity and reaction efficiency of each step starting with alkynyl&#8722;B(dan)s, tetrasubstituted alkenes with desired carbon frameworks at desired positions can be prepared in high yields. For example, an alkene with four distinct aryl groups, p&#8208;MeOC6H4, p&#8208;CF3C6H4, p&#8208;MeC6H4, and p&#8208;NCC6H4, was obtained in 71% overall yield via six steps, starting with the dehydrogenative borylation of p&#8208;MeC6H4C&#8801;CH with HB(dan). Moreover, a variety of tetrasubstituted alkenes, including regio&#8208; and stereoisomers of the above tetraarylalkene, AIE&#8208;active TPTPE and derivatives thereof, and (Z)&#8208;tamoxifen, a well&#8208;known breast cancer drug, were accessed via the developed strategy.

         <title>Uncatalyzed Formation of Polyaminoboranes from Diisopropylaminoborane and Primary Amines: a Kinetically Controlled Polymerization Reaction</title>

Abstract
Recently, we disclosed the uncatalyzed formation of polyaminoboranes (PABs) from monomeric diisopropylaminoborane (iPr2N&#8722;BH2) and primary amines (RNH2). Their structure is studied through a detailed multinuclear NMR study and their full spectroscopic characterization is presented revealing that N&#8208;alkyl substituted PABs exhibit magnetically non&#8208;equivalent methylenic protons in the close vicinity of the BN&#8208;backbone. We also performed an in&#8208;depth theoretical study of this global chemical process. The mechanism is fully apprehended and the strong influence of the temperature on the outcome of the reaction is unveiled. DFT&#8208;calculations clearly show that the formation of the polyaminoboranes (RNH&#8722;BH2)n results from a kinetically controlled step&#8208;growth polymerization reaction that can be globally viewed as a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail association process of the in&#8197;situ generated transient monomeric monoalkylamino&#8208;borane [RNH&#8722;BH2].

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, we disclosed the uncatalyzed formation of polyaminoboranes (PABs) from monomeric diisopropylaminoborane (&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&#8722;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and primary amines (RNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Their structure is studied through a detailed multinuclear NMR study and their full spectroscopic characterization is presented revealing that N-alkyl substituted PABs exhibit magnetically non-equivalent methylenic protons in the close vicinity of the BN-backbone. We also performed an in-depth theoretical study of this global chemical process. The mechanism is fully apprehended and the strong influence of the temperature on the outcome of the reaction is unveiled. DFT-calculations clearly show that the formation of the polyaminoboranes (RNH&#8722;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; results from a kinetically controlled step-growth polymerization reaction that can be globally viewed as a head-to-tail association process of the &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; generated transient monomeric monoalkylamino-borane [RNH&#8722;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The front cover picture, provided by Seung Hwan Cho and co&#8208;workers, illustrates (R)&#8208;TRIP&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution of &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allylboronate esters through chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective allylation of aldehydes. The reaction is proposed to proceed via a chair&#8208;like transition state by the double coordination of (R)&#8208;TRIP to the C&#8722;H bond of aldehydes and the oxygen atom of Bpin group, thus effectively resolving &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allylboronate esters with high enantiomeric ratios.

Abstract
Here, we review recent progress in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free inter&#8208;element boration reactions via Lewis&#8208;basic activation of various boron reagents, focusing mainly on the boration reactions of carbon&#8208;carbon multiple bonds without an electron&#8208;withdrawing (activating) group and those with an electron&#8208;withdrawing group where the polarity of the addition reaction is inverse to the &#8220;natural&#8221; reactivity.

Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Monoboryl anions show remarkable stability due to the valence deficiency of the adjacent three&#8208;coordinate boron center and can be expressed as its resonance form, the borata&#8208;alkene systems [R2B=CH2]&#8722;. The diversity of synthetic approaches as well as the properties of the C=B bond are disclosed in this review, dealing with both electronic and structural properties of the boryl moieties involved. Full characterization in solid state by X&#8208;ray diffraction demonstrated the short distances between B and C, as a consequence of the boron ylide character in the boron&#8208;stabilized carbanions. This review includes a collection of C&#8722;B length distances as well as 11B NMR data that can be useful for diagnostic evidence of the partial boron&#8208;carbon double&#8208;bond character. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis on DFT computed structures also supports and justifies the borata&#8208;alkene character.
The reactivity of the C=B bond acting as nucleophilic synthon is unveiled through extensive electrophilic trapping examples. The homologation protocols with diborylmethane, via single carbon chain extension, involves a facile introduction of the C(sp3)&#8722;B bonds, which can be subsequently transformed into functionalized target products, containing C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N or C&#8722;C bonds.

Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;containing compounds have a long history of utility in a broad range of fields, including agricultural, pharmaceutical, and metal&#8208;mediated reactions. In recent decades, numerous methods have been developed to streamline the synthesis of organophosphorus reagents based on these numerous applications. This review focuses upon the recent development of phosphorus(III)&#8208; and phosphorus(V)&#8208;directed C&#8722;H borylation reactions. This transformation has evolved significantly in the past two years, resulting in several new methods that provide access to organic substrates containing both phosphorus and boron. Further functionalization of the carbon&#8722;boron bond to provide functionalized organophosphorus products is discussed.

Abstract
The particular nature of boron compounds allows an ample modularity of their properties ranging from Lewis acids, C&#8208;nucleophiles, B&#8208;nucleophiles, or even conjunctive reagents for new synthetic manipulations. Moreover, the increasing demand for functionalized boron derivatives for pharmaceutical or material science applications requires the development of new synthetic methods for boron introduction in organic compounds. This review summarizes the possible combinations of boron derivatives with a variety of strained heterocycles reported in the most recent literature.

Abstract
This review describes recent advances in the synthesis of anthranilamide/1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene&#8208;substituted organoboron compounds with diminished boron Lewis acidity via catalytic B(aam)&#8208; and B(dan)&#8208;installing borylation reactions, which have attracted growing attention especially in the last five years owing to their unique reactivity, regioselectivity, and the outstanding stability toward air and moisture of organoboron compounds obtained therefrom. Direct Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings with R&#8211;B(aam)/B(dan), which were believed to be wholly unreactive until recently, are also discussed.

Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Aminoalkylboronic acids display a distinct role in medicinal chemistry, and their utility has been demonstrated by the successful commercialization of three drugs: bortezomib, ixazomib, and vaborbactam. Just as &#945;&#8208;aminoalkylboronic acids are a bioisostere of &#945;&#8208;amino acids, &#946;&#8208;aminoalkylboronates are a bona fide bioisostere of &#946;&#8208;amino acids, thus they also hold promising potential in drug discovery. Moreover, &#946;&#8208;aminoalkylboronates are versatile synthetic intermediates that are amenable to many of the established C&#8722;B bond derivatization reactions of chiral optically enriched alkylboronates, leading to the stereocontrolled preparation of valued classes of products such as &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols, 1,2&#8208;diamines, and hemiboronic acid heterocycles. In addition, &#946;&#8208;aminoalkylboronates were shown to act as catalysts in certain organic reactions. This review presents an overview of the strengths and limitations of current preparative methods to access &#946;&#8208;aminoalkylboronic acid derivatives stereoselectively with various substitution patterns. Strategically, several disconnections can be exploited to establish both functional groups. Some of the key methods include the classical Matteson asymmetric homologation chemistry, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed aminoboration of alkenes and formal hydroboration of enamine derivatives, nucleophilic additions of boryl&#8208;substituted carbanions onto N&#8208;functionalized imines, borylative ring openings of aziridines, and functionalization of alpha&#8208;boryl aldehydes.

Abstract
Certain electron&#8208;rich 1,4&#8208;diborabenzene derivatives efficiently activate single, double, and triple bonds and thereby increasingly compete with transition metals in homogeneous catalysis. This review compares the activation of three model substrates (H2, H2C=CH2, CO2) by (i) 9,10&#8208;dihydro&#8208;9,10&#8208;diboraanthracene dianions, (ii) their neutral carbene&#8208;stabilized congeners, (iii) 1,3,2,5&#8208;diazadiborinines, and (iv) 1,4,2,5&#8208;diazadiborinines. Distinct structure&#8208;properties relationships become apparent, the most influential factors being (i) the steric demands of the B&#8208;bonded substituents, (ii) the charges on the B&#8208;doped (hetero)arenes, (iii) charge polarization as a result of additional N&#8208;doping, and (iv) the energies and nodal structures of the frontier orbitals. The observed reactions are explained by a transition metal&#8208;like activation mechanism. If the two boron atoms are chemically inequivalent, contributions of a B(+I)/B(+III) mixed&#8208;valence state determine the observed regioselectivities when polar substrates are added. The lessons learned from the conversions of the model substrates are subsequently used to rationalize the behavior of the B2 heterocycles also toward more sophisticated substrate molecules. Finally, catalytic cycles based on H2&#8208; and H&#8722;&#8208;transfers, hydroboration reactions, and CO2 reductions will be covered.

         <title>Fluorinated Aryl Boronates as Building Blocks in Organic Synthesis</title>

Abstract
Organoboron compounds are well known building blocks for many organic reactions. However, under basic conditions, polyfluorinated aryl boronic acid derivatives suffer from instability issues that are accelerated in compounds containing an ortho&#8208;fluorine group, which result in the formation of the corresponding protodeboronation products. Therefore, a considerable amount of research has focused on novel methodologies to synthesize these valuable compounds while avoiding the protodeboronation issue. This review summarizes the latest developments in the synthesis of fluorinated aryl boronic acid derivatives and their applications in cross&#8208;coupling reactions and other transformations.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organoboron compounds are well known building blocks for many organic reactions. However, under basic conditions, polyfluorinated aryl boronic acid derivatives suffer from instability issues that are accelerated in compounds containing an &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-fluorine group, which result in the formation of the corresponding protodeboronation products. Therefore, a considerable amount of research has focused on novel methodologies to synthesize these valuable compounds while avoiding the protodeboronation issue. This review summarizes the latest developments in the synthesis of fluorinated aryl boronic acid derivatives and their applications in cross-coupling reactions and other transformations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
Among aromatic compounds, borazarenes represent a significant class of isosteres in which carbon&#8208;carbon bonds have been replaced by B&#8722;N bonds. Described herein is a summary of the selective reactions that have been developed for known systems, as well as a summary of computationally&#8208;based predictions of selectivities that might be anticipated in reactions of yet unrealized substructures.

Abstract
Saturated heterocycles are found widely in biologically active compounds such as medicinal drugs and agrochemicals. However, boronic acid&#8208;derived building blocks for these structures have limited availability, particularly in comparison to heteroaromatic boronic acids. We report the preparation of boronic ester &#947;&#8208;lactams through a Cu&#8208;catalysed conjugate borylation&#8208;cyclisation protocol. Using a chiral catalyst, this can be performed in high enantioselectivity. Exploration of the further transformations of these reagents suggest that the boronic esters have much potential as chemical building blocks.

Abstract
Boron&#8208;catalyzed environmentally benign dehydrative Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of indole/pyrrole and aniline derivatives with &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl ketones has been developed for the first time. This method provides an efficient and green replacement of toxic and unstable methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) by safer and cheaper &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl ketone. The reaction features easy operation, wide substrate scope and significantly, only water is formed as by&#8208;product.

Abstract
An intriguing pyridine&#8208;boryl radical&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H alkynylation reaction of inactivated alkanes was described. The reaction features mild operation condition and wide substrate scope, and affords the corresponding products in moderate to good yields. Notably, The presence of 4&#8208;cyanopyride N&#8208;oxide was key to the success of the reaction. Cyclohexane are more easily to be functionalized in this reaction than toluene, which could be rationally explained by polarity&#8208;match principle.

Abstract

         <title>Zwitterion&#8208;Initiated Hydroboration of Alkynes and Styrene</title>

Abstract
The hydroboration of alkynes and styrene with HBpin has been developed using tris(pentaflurophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3) as the initiator of catalysis. The hydroboration is proposed to be initiated by Lewis acid activation of the alkyne by (B(C6F5)3) to form a highly reactive zwitterionic species which subsequently react with HBpin to give the alkenyl boronic ester. This zwitterion has also showed potential to be a competent catalyst for the hydroboration of styrene. The zwitterionic intermediate is analogous to that proposed in the Piers borane&#8208;catalysed hydroboration and 1,1&#8208;carboboration of alkynes with B(C6F5)3.

The zwitterionic intermediate is analogous to that proposed in the Piers borane-catalysed hydroboration and 1,1-carboboration of alkynes with B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
A series of structurally diverse benzyl protected trifluoroborate&#8208;ammoniums were prepared in good to high yields by an efficient hydrogenation of corresponding trifluoroborate&#8208;iminiums using Crabtree's catalyst. Subsequent N&#8208; and B&#8208;deprotections were demonstrated on selected examples to provide several &#945;&#8208;aminoboronic acids. Preliminary experiments on asymmetric version of the reaction indicated a correlation between E/Z&#8208;ratio in the trifluoroborate&#8208;iminium substrate and enantioselectivity. The broad scope, operational simplicity and efficiency of the presented method imply its high potential for a facile access to libraries of &#945;&#8208;aminoboronic acid derivatives that can be used in medicinal chemistry applications and beyond.

Abstract
A method for the synthesis of allylboronates via Zweifel&#8208;type deprotonative olefination was demonstrated. Tetrasubstituted vinylboronates were used as the substrates. NCS (N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide) was used as a bifunctional additive, electrophile and base. This method exhibited a different elimination strategy in Zweifel type transformation to afford allylboronates. The homo&#8208;alcohols and alkenes were stereoselective synthesized from the obtained allylboronates, demonstrating the synthetic value of this methodology.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of &#945;&#8208;Silyl&#8208;Substituted Allylboronate Esters via Chemo&#8208; and Stereoselective Allylboration of Aldehydes</title>

Abstract
We describe the kinetic resolution of &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allylboronate esters via chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective allylboration of aldehydes. This process provides two synthetically versatile enantioenriched compounds, (Z)&#8208;&#948;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted anti&#8208;homoallylic alcohols and &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allylboronate esters, with a selectivity factor up to 328. We propose that the reaction proceeds through a closed chair&#8208;like transition state with the silane moiety occupying a pseudo&#8208;axial position, thus readily resolving &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allylboronate esters. The synthetic utility of the obtained enantioenriched compounds is highlighted by their further transformations to give a diverse set of enantioenriched molecules.

         <title>Recent Advances in Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Functionalization of Indoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Indole is one of the most important heterocycles in organic synthesis, natural products, and drug discovery. Recently, tremendous advances in the selective functionalization of indoles have been reported. Although the most important advances have been powered by transition metal catalysis, exceedingly useful methods in the absence of transition metals have also been reported. In this review, we provide an overview of functionalization reactions of indoles that have been published in the last years with a focus on the most recent advances, aims, and future trends. The review is organized by the positional selectivity and type of methods used for functionalization. In particular, we discuss major advances in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization at the classical C2/C3 positions, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization at the remote C4/C7 positions, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling, and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free functionalization.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Rational Engineering of Toluene Dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida F1 towards Oxyfunctionalization of Bicyclic Aromatics</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Toluene dioxygenase (TDO) from Pseudomonas putida F1 was engineered towards the oxyfunctionalization of bicyclic substrates. Single and double mutant libraries addressing 27 different positions, located at the active site and entrance channel were generated. In total, 176 different variants were tested employing the substrates naphthalene, 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline, and 2&#8208;phenylpyridine. Introduced mutations in positions M220, A223 and F366, exhibited major influences in terms of product formation, chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. By semi&#8208;rational evolution, we lighted up the TDO capability to convert bulkier substrates than its natural substrate, at unprecedented reported conversions. Thus, the most active TDO variants were applied to biocatalytic oxyfunctionalizations of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline, and 2&#8208;phenylpyridine, enabling the production of substantial amounts of (+)&#8208;(R)&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;4&#8208;ol (71% isolated yield, 94% ee) and (+)&#8208;(1S,2R)&#8208;3&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)cyclohexa&#8208;3,5&#8208;diene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diol (60% isolated yield, 98% ee), respectively. Here, we provide a set of novel TDO&#8208;based biocatalysts useful for the preparation of oxyfunctionalized bicyclic scaffolds, which are valuable to perform downstream synthetic processes.

Single and double mutant libraries addressing 27 different positions, located at the active site and entrance channel were generated. In total, 176 different variants were tested employing the substrates naphthalene, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline, and 2-phenylpyridine. Introduced mutations in positions M220, A223 and F366, exhibited major influences in terms of product formation, chemo-, regio- and enantioselectivity. By semi-rational evolution, we lighted up the TDO capability to convert bulkier substrates than its natural substrate, at unprecedented reported conversions. Thus, the most active TDO variants were applied to biocatalytic oxyfunctionalizations of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline, and 2-phenylpyridine, enabling the production of substantial amounts of (+)-(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline-4-ol (71% isolated yield, 94% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;) and (+)-(1&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,2&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-3-(pyridin-2-yl)cyclohexa-3,5-diene-1,2-diol (60% isolated yield, 98% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;), respectively.

         <title>Manganese Catalyzed Enantioselective Epoxidation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Amides with H2O2</title>

Abstract
Herewith, we report the enantioselective epoxidation of electron&#8208;deficient cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides with the environmentally benign oxidant H2O2. The catalysts &#8208; manganese complexes with bis&#8208;amino&#8208;bis&#8208;pyridine and structurally related ligands &#8208; exhibit reasonably high efficiency (up to 100&#8197;TON) and excellent chemo&#8208; and enantioselectivity (up to 100% and 99% ee, respectively). Crucially, the cis&#8208;enamides epoxidation enantioselectivity and yield are dramatically enhanced by the presence of NH&#8208;moiety, which effect can be explained by the hydrogen bonding interaction between the cis&#8208;enamide substrate and the manganese based oxygen transferring species.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Hydrogenative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Nitriles and Amines to Form Secondary Imines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Manganese complexes with tridentate PNN ligands have been synthesized as catalysts for hydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of nitriles and amines to form secondary imines. This reaction afforded a variety of unsymmetrical secondary imines in good yields with excellent selectivity. Investigation of catalyst intermediates indicated that an amido manganese complex may be the active catalyst species for this reaction.

Abstract
An efficient enantioselective dearomative cycloaddition reaction between either 2&#8208;nitroindoles or 2&#8208;nitrobenzofurans and N&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethylisatin ketimines by dipeptided phosphonium salt catalysis is firstly established. This protocol provides a new and facile synthetic approach to create a variety of CF3&#8208;containing polycyclic spirooxindole derivatives under mild reaction conditions with high yields in excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (all &gt;20:1 dr, up to 95% ee).

         <title>Biocatalytic Application of a Membrane&#8208;Bound Coumarin C&#8208;Glucosyltransferase in the Synthesis of Coumarin and Benzofuran C&#8208;Glucosides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A number of plant C&#8208;glycosyltransferases (CGTs) have been recently identified, whereas the coumarin CGTs have not been found. Here we reported the first identification of a coumarin C&#8208;glucosyltransferase MaCGT from Morus alba. The whole&#8208;cell biocatalyst harboring MaCGT was exploited and exhibited strictly and efficiently regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;specific C&#8208;glucosylation capacity toward structurally different coumarins. The whole&#8208;cell of MaCGT was further applied to chemo&#8208;enzymatically synthesize benzofuran C&#8208;glucosides. Moreover, MaCGT is reported as the first characterized membrane&#8208;bound CGT from plants, although sequence homology search has shown other potentially membrane&#8208;bound CGTs from M. notabilis; and the presence of the transmembrane domain is critical for its catalytic activity and stability as demonstrated by the C&#8208;glucosylation activity of truncated MaCGT proteins. In addition, the key residues involved in the C&#8208;glucosylation of MaCGT were explored. These findings suggest the diversity of CGTs in the plant kingdom and demonstrate the significant potential of biocatalytic approach to produce structurally diverse C&#8208;glycosides for drug discovery.

Abstract
A route to &#947;&#8208;keto sulfones through a metal&#8208;free reaction of cyclopropanols, DABCO&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(SO2)2 and alkyl halides is described. This reaction occurs under mild conditions in the absence of any catalysts, additives, or oxidants. Various functional groups including as ester, amino, methoxy, bromo, trifluoromethyl, nitro and carbonyl are tolerated well in this transformation, and the corresponding &#947;&#8208;keto sulfones are afforded in 35% to 95% yields. The proposed mechanism implies that this reaction proceeds through &#947;&#8208;keto sulfinate intermediate generated in&#8197;situ, which further undergoes nucleophilic substitution with alkyl halides leading to &#947;&#8208;keto sulfones.

         <title>Direct Amidation of Esters and Amines under Continuous&#8208;Flow Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates that N&#8208;hexylbenzamide is produced by flow.

Abstract
Chemists are generally familiar with polar reactions and radical reactions, in comparison, are underdeveloped. In the last few years, however, the novel concept of amalgamation of the above two in the form of radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPCO) and polar&#8208;radical crossover (PRCO) reactions has emerged as a valuable and powerful tool. This methodology tends to bridge the gap between the two as well as overcomes limitations of both radical and traditional polar chemistry. By bringing together the unorthodox chemistry of radicals with orthodox carbocations and carbanions, the green quotient of such reactions is significantly improved. The development and shaping up of this area in the last few years in the form of synthetically important transformations is summarised in this review.

Abstract
An environmentally&#8208;benign electrochemical approach for the construction of quinoline derivatives employing N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) as the methine source has been devised by cyclization of 4&#8208;(phenylamino)&#8208;2H&#8208;chromen&#8208;2&#8208;ones. In a user&#8208;friendly undivided cell, 6H&#8208;chromeno[4,3&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;6&#8208;ones were obtained under chemical oxidant&#8208;free and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions in 43&#8211;92% yields with high functional tolerance.

Abstract
A double&#8208;ligands enabled ruthenium catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H arylation of dialkyl phosphines is described, which provides a straight access to aryl&#8208;substituted dialkyl phosphine ligands. The combination of 1,3&#8208;diketone and amino acid ligands is essential for this transformation. An important six&#8208;membered cycloruthenium intermediate was successfully isolated and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Mechanistic studies showed that the 1,3&#8208;diketone promoted the process of oxidative addition of cycloruthenium intermediate. Some of modified CyJohnPhos ligands exhibited highly catalytic activity in palladium catalyzed C&#8722;N bond formation.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions: Present Approach and Future Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reactions have allowed researchers to attain unorthodox bond formation and elusive chemical processes under mild and inherently safe reaction conditions. However, these methods have relied heavily on Ru&#8208; and Ir&#8208;based complexes or metal&#8208;free chromophores. While the heavy transition metal complexes are limited by their high cost, toxicity, and adverse environmental effects. Metal&#8208;free photo&#8208;redox catalysts are restricted due to their poorer photo&#8208;stability. In order to overcome these shortcomings, extensive research aimed towards utilizing 3d&#8208;transition metals has come to the forefront. Manganese, in this regard, holds great promise as a versatile and economically sustainable 3d&#8208;transition metal catalyst. Hence, it is not surprising that recent years have witnessed several advances in visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated manganese catalysis in areas of organic, polymer, and materials chemistry. Manganese&#8208;based heterogeneous systems have also been utilized to effect dimerization and oxygenation reactions showcasing the versatility of manganese. Moreover, manganese has enabled late&#8208;stage functionalization of valuable medicinal compounds and natural products, which are all important from the viewpoint of medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry. In the present review, comprehensive discussions on the advances, significance, approaches, and mechanistic aspects have been added for each photochemical reaction process. Further, the reaction scope, limitations, and future prospects of visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced manganese catalysis have also been reviewed.

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step synthesis of isoquinoline&#8208;fused isoquinolines from &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters and 2&#8208;alkynyl benzaldehydes are reported. The strategy comprises an unconventional Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction between &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters and 2&#8208;alkynyl benzaldehydes to give isoquinoline intermediates. Subsequent gold&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroamination furnishes isoquinoline&#8208;fused isoquinolines. The scope of this strategy is further extended to prepare multisubstituted isoquinoline&#8208;fused isoquinolines via subjecting the N&#8208;allylated isoquinoline intermediates to gold&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroamination followed by aza&#8208;Claisen type rearrangement.

&lt;p&gt;A one-pot, two-step synthesis of isoquinoline-fused isoquinolines from &#945;-amino acid esters and 2-alkynyl benzaldehydes are reported. The strategy comprises an unconventional Pictet-Spengler reaction between &#945;-amino acid esters and 2-alkynyl benzaldehydes to give isoquinoline intermediates. Subsequent gold-catalyzed intramolecular hydroamination furnishes isoquinoline-fused isoquinolines.

Abstract
The analogous three&#8208;component synthesis strategy for substituted 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole and quinazoline derivatives from readily available benzaldehyde, benzylamine and hydroxylamine or aniline has been developed. Both the cascade reaction sequences involves nucleophilic addition of C&#8722;N bond, introduction a halogen donor, nucleophilic substitution and Cu(II)&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation. This synthesis methodology demonstrated good yields, broad substrate scope and oxygen as a green oxidant. Thus, this synthesis protocol provides strategies for the construction of substituted 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole and quinazolines from readily and simple starting materials.

         <title>Vinylogous Aza&#8208;Michael Addition of Urea Derivatives with p&#8208;Quinone Methides Followed by Oxidative Dearomative Cyclization: Approach to Spiroimidazolidinone Derivatives</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report an efficient protocol for the synthesis of spiro&#8208;imidazolidinone&#8208;cyclohexadienones from p&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) and dialkyloxy ureas under mild conditions. The strategy follows a two&#8208;step process involving an initial vinylogous conjugate addition of urea derivatives to p&#8208;QMs, followed by oxidative dearomative cyclization of open&#8208;chain product to the projected spiro&#8208;imidazolidinones. This protocol exhibits good functional group tolerance and provides a straightforward method to access spiro&#8208;imidazolidinone&#8208;cyclohexadienones. In follow&#8208;up chemistry, we have shown the debenzylation of spiroimidazolidinones to give N&#8208;hydroxycyclic ureas.

         <title>Base&#8208;Mediated Generation of Ketenimines from Ynamides: [3+2] Annulation with Azaallyl Anions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Under basic conditions and heat, ynamides can serve as precursors to ketenimines, whose synthetic potential is often hampered by their difficulty of access. Herein, we report that they can undergo a [3+2] cycloaddition with 2&#8208;azaallyl anions, obtained from benzylimines under the same reaction conditions. This reaction between two highly reactive intermediates, both generated in&#8197;situ from bench stable starting materials, gives access to various nitrogen&#8208;rich heterocycles. The reaction usually proceeds with excellent diastereoselectivity, in favor of the cis adduct. Deuteration experiments and DFT calculations helped rationalize the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the process as well as the formation of side products.

         <title>Assembly of 5&#8208;Aminoimidazoles via Palladium&#8208;Catalysed Double Isocyanide Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalysed tandem cyclisation reaction of amidoximes, isocyanides and amines to produce 5&#8208;aminoimidazoles was developed. Various 5&#8208;aminoimidazoles were prepared in good to excellent yields under mild conditions. This elegant domino process involves the effective cleavage of the N&#8722;O bond and the formation of new C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds in a single operation.

Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free approach to synthesize unsymmetrical disulfides is reported that relies on a K2CO3&#8208;promoted one&#8208;pot reaction of thiosulfonates, thiourea and alkyl halides under mild conditions. The protocol tolerates a wide range of substrates, leading to various types of unsymmetrical disulfides in moderate to excellent yields. More importantly, the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and drug molecules was also achieved.

         <title>Oxime&#8208;Derived Iminyl Radicals in Selective Processes of Hydrogen Atom Transfer and Addition to Carbon&#8208;Carbon &#960;&#8208;Bonds</title>

Abstract
Oximes represent one of the fundamental organic compound classes with a wide range of synthetic applications. In the last decade O&#8208;substituted oximes were recognized as the synthetically available and versatile precursors of iminyl radicals via one&#8208;electron oxidation or one&#8208;electron reduction employing visible light photoredox catalysts, salts of abundant metals (such as Cu or Fe), or other convenient reagents. Iminyl radicals are powerful synthons for various processes of cyclization, ring&#8208;opening, CH&#8208;functionalization, and coupling. The present review is focused on the synthetic methods based on oxime&#8208;derived iminyl radicals developed in the last few years excluding ring opening reactions of cyclic iminyl radicals that were summarized in recent publications. The review consists of two main parts: (1) reactions of iminyl radicals involving 1,n&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (n=5 in most cases) and (2) reactions involving the addition of iminyl radical to the carbon&#8208;carbon &#960;&#8208;bond.

         <title>Synthesis of Dibenzosiloles through Electrocatalytic Sila&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A novel electrocatalyzed method for the preparation of dibenzosiloles was developed through intramolecular C&#8722;H/Si&#8722;H dehydrogenative coupling strategy starting from biarylhydrosilanes. Both electro&#8208;donating and electro&#8208;withdrawing substitution groups were tolerated for this transformation, and the desired dibenzosilole products could be obtained in moderate to excellent yields. A sila&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction mechanism was proposed on the basis of previous literature and our controlled experiments.

&lt;p&gt;A novel electrocatalyzed method for the preparation of dibenzosiloles was developed through intramolecular C&#8722;H/Si&#8722;H dehydrogenative coupling strategy starting from biarylhydrosilanes. Both electro-donating and electro-withdrawing substitution groups were tolerated for this transformation, and the desired dibenzosilole products could be obtained in moderate to excellent yields. A sila-Friedel-Crafts reaction mechanism was proposed on the basis of previous literature and our controlled experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
Spirocyclic molecules are widely recognized for their complex three&#8208;dimensional features and structural rigidity. Among this class of molecules, the spiro&#8208;lactams subclass stands out, being extensively explored due to its bioactivity and utility in a variety of scientific fields such as drug design and organic synthesis. Given the recognition of spirocyclic lactams&#8217; broad potential, several efforts have been engaged on the pursuit of new synthetic strategies towards these molecules. The present review gathers advances on the synthesis of both spiro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams (spiroazetidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones) and spiro&#8208;&#948;&#8208;lactams (spiropiperidon&#8208;2&#8208;ones) reported since 2015. The work is divided into two distinct parts, each one dedicated to one of these types of spiro&#8208;lactam, with the approach used for building the spirocyclic system being extensively discussed, according to the method's scope, efficiency, selectivity, and reaction mechanism.

         <title>peri&#8208;Xanthenoxanthene (PXX): a Versatile Organic Photocatalyst in Organic Synthesis</title>

Abstract
Recent years have witnessed a continuous development of photocatalysts to satisfy the growing demand of photophysical and redox properties in photoredox catalysis, with complex structures or alternative strategies devised to access highly reducing or oxidising systems. We report herein the use of peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene (PXX), a simple and inexpensive dye, as an efficient photocatalyst. Its highly reducing excited state allows activation of a wide range of substrates, thus triggering useful radical reactions. Benchmark transformations such as the addition of organic radicals, generated by photoreduction of organic halides, to radical traps are initially demonstrated. More complex dual catalytic manifolds are also shown to be accessible: the &#946;&#8208;arylation of cyclic ketones is successful when using a secondary amine as organocatalyst, while cross&#8208;coupling reactions of aryl halides with amines and thiols are obtained when using a Ni co&#8208;catalyst. Application to the efficient two&#8208;step synthesis of the expensive fluoro&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrido[4,3&#8208;b]indole, a crucial synthetic intermediate for the investigational drug setipiprant, has been also demonstrated.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective and Stereospecific Ring&#8208;Opening Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Arylative Cross&#8208;Coupling of 2&#8208;Arylazetidines with Arylboronic Acids</title>

Abstract
We have developed a palladium&#8208;catalyzed regioselective and enantiospecific ring&#8208;opening Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura arylative cross&#8208;coupling of N&#8208;tosyl&#8208;2&#8208;arylazetidines to give enantioenriched 3,3&#8208;diarylpropylamines. This reaction represents an example of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening cross&#8208;coupling using azetidines as a non&#8208;classical alkyl electrophile. Density functional theory rationalized the mechanism of the full catalytic cycle, which consists of the selectivity&#8208;determining ring opening of the azetidine, reaction with water, rate&#8208;determining transmetalation, and reductive elimination. Transition states of the selectivity&#8208;determining ring&#8208;opening step were systematically determined by the multi&#8208;component artificial force induced reaction (MC&#8208;AFIR) method to explain the regioselectivity of the reaction.
