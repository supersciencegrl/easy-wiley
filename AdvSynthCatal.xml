         <title>TBHP/Ammonium/Iodide&#8208;Promoted Ring&#8208;Opening of Cyclobutanones toward &#947;&#8208;Iodo Nitriles</title>

         <dc:description>
A TBHP/ammonium/iodide&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;opening reaction of a variety of cyclobutanones is developed to access &#947;&#8208;iodo nitriles. The key intermediate of this transformation is a C&#8208;centered radical formed by undergoing &#946;&#8208;scission from iminyl radical. As such, this mild transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free procedure provides a direct, facile, and efficient pathway toward diverse &#947;&#8208;iodo functionalized nitriles.

A TBHP/ammonium/iodide&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;opening of a variety of cyclobutanones is developed to access &#947;&#8208;iodo nitriles in DCM under N2 at 40&#8201;&#176;C. This transformation initiated with in&#8201;situ imination, forming an iminyl radical that underwent &#946;&#8208;scission to yield a ring&#8208;opening C&#8208;centered radical. The latter successively underwent a single electron transfer followed by nucleophilic substitution, or alternatively proceeded via a halogen&#8208;atom transfer process to generate &#947;&#8208;iodo nitrile. As such, this mild transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free procedure provides a direct, facile, and efficient pathway toward diverse &#947;&#8208;iodo functionalized nitriles.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Radical Cyclization of Unactivated Olefins with Perfluoroalkyl Iodides to Access Perfluoroalkylated Ortho&#8208;Diazaheterocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical cascade cyclization method for unactivated olefins with perfluoroalkyl iodides (IRf), constructing diverse perfluoroalkylated ortho&#8208;diazaheterocyclic compounds was developed. This catalytic strategy demonstrates broad substrate scope and has been successfully applied to 34 examples. Moreover, the reaction is initiated through the formation of an electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex between IRf and TMEDA.

An efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven strategy for the radical perfluoroalkylation/tandem cyclization of unactivated alkenes with perfluoroalkyl iodides (IRf) has been developed, enabling efficient synthesis of perfluoroalkylated heterocyclic derivatives, including pyrazoles, pyridazines, and benzodiazepines. This methodology features broad substrate compatibility with 34 examples, affording the desired products in yields up to 81%. Results of mechanistic studies indicate that the formation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex between perfluoroalkyl iodides and TMEDA greatly initiates the reaction, avoiding the use of extra catalysts and oxidants.

         <title>Facile Access to 2&#8208;Substituted&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrahydroquinoxalines via Borane&#8208;Catalyzed One&#8208;Pot Tandem Cyclization/Hydrosilylation</title>

         <dc:description>
The B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation of 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes and glyoxals with PMHS affords 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines in high yields. The asymmetric variant can be achieved by using the chiral borane catalyst formed in&#8201;situ from HB(C6F5)2 and a binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral diene and PhSiH3, affording chiral products with excellent enantioselectivities.

Borane&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation of 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes and glyoxals for step&#8208;economic synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines has been developed. The use of B(C6F5)3 catalyst and polymethylhydrosiloxane provides convenient access to various 2&#8208;aryl&#8208; and 2&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxaline products in good to excellent yields with wide substrate scope and broad tolerance of functional groups. The asymmetric variant of this reaction can be achieved by using the enantioenriched borane catalyst generated in&#8201;situ from HB(C6F5)2 and a binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral diene and PhSiH3, affording a variety of chiral 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines with enantioselectivities ranging from 90% to &gt;99% ee. The judicious selection of borane catalyst and hydrosilane has been demonstrated to be crucial for catalysis. This cascade reaction proceeds with simple operation, and can be easily scaled up. Preliminary mechanistic studies have been performed to elucidate the catalytic pathway.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Fluorenones via Intramolecular C&#8211;H Arylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from 2&#8208;diazobenzophenones, a straightforward synthesis of valuable fluorenones via a gold&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot oxidation, C&#8211;H activation, and cyclization is described. The addition of ascorbic acid, the correct selection of the counteranion of the 2&#8208;diazobenzophenones, and the use of terpyridine as an auxiliary ligand are crucial for the reaction to proceed in good yields.

This study shows that aryldiazonium salts can participate as electrophiles in gold&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H arylation of arenes. Using 2&#8208;diazo benzophenones, a gold&#8208;catalyzed oxidation/C&#8211;H activation/cyclization sequence has been developed, leading to valuable fluorenones. Key parameters for the reaction to proceed in good yields are the introduction of electron&#8208;donating groups, the use of PF6&#8722; as counteranion, and terpyridine as an auxiliary ligand.

In the presence of a Pd0 catalyst, large &#960;&#8208;extended arynes trimerize in an unusual manner to forge extremely compact and strained chiral benzenoids. This new trimerization reaction involves a 1,7&#8208;Pd isomerization, a rare and poorly understood process that is elucidated.

The nickel(0)&#8208;catalyzed [2&#8201;+&#8201;2&#8201;+&#8201;2] cyclotrimerization of 13,14&#8208;picyne, a &#960;&#8208;extended aryne intermediate having bay regions at both sides of the aryne triple bond, has recently enabled the synthesis of an overcrowded triple [7]helicene. In contrast, it has now been found that under palladium(0) catalysis, the same &#960;&#8208;extended aryne intermediate trimerizes in a very different manner, notably featuring a formal 1,7&#8208;hydrogen shift coupled with a rare 1,7&#8208;palladium aryl&#8208;to&#8208;aryl migration. Remarkably, this new aryne trimerization reaction seems general and reveals possible using a further &#960;&#8208;extended analog of 13,14&#8208;picyne. The two chiral multi[5]helicenes thus obtained have, in addition to helical stereogenic elements, a profoundly hindered stereogenic biaryl axis located in the fjord region of a carbo[5]helicene fragment. Both compounds are characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, which reveals their remarkably compact and severely distorted structures. A thorough mechanistic study, combining experiments and DFT simulations, shows that the observed 1,7&#8208;Pd aryl&#8208;to&#8208;aryl migration is a two&#8208;step 1,4&#8208;to&#8208;1,4&#8217;&#8208;Pd isomerization process enabled by the presence of trace amounts of water, a proton shuttle, in the reaction mixture.

         <title>Synthesis of Spirolactones from Carbonyls via Carboborylation of N&#8208;Sulfonylhydrazones with Alkoxycarbonylalkylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spirolactones are readily prepared from carbonyls via their N&#8208;tosylhydrazones. The reaction involves carboborylation with ethoxycarbonyl&#8208;substituted boronic acids, followed by oxidation and lactonization. Thermal or photochemical protocols enable versatility. The approach is applicable to natural products and bioactive molecules, demonstrating broad substrate scope and synthetic utility.

A straightforward synthesis of spirolactones from carbonyls via N&#8208;tosylhydrazones is described. The process consists of a reaction between N&#8208;tosylhydrazones and ethoxycarbonylethylboronic acid or ethoxycarbonylpropylboronic acid, leading to spiro &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones or &#948;&#8208;valerolactones, respectively. The transformation takes place by carboborylation of the N&#8208;tosylhydrazone followed by oxidation of the homologated boronic acid that delivers a hydroxyester, which undergoes further lactonization to yield a spirocyclic lactone. Depending on the structure of the starting N&#8208;tosylhydrazone, thermal or photochemical protocols are applied for the key carboborylation reaction. The usefulness of the process is illustrated by the application in a variety of natural products and biologically relevant carbonyl&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Iterative Use of Regiocomplementary Flavin&#8208;Dependent Halogenases Gives Access to Unique Halogenation Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The halide motif is ubiquitous in organic synthesis, facilitating fine&#8208;tuning of molecular properties and functionalization using substitution and cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Combination of different flavin&#8208;dependent tryptophan halogenases enables the installation of novel halogenation patterns on l&#8208;tryptophan, which can be orthogonally addressed in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions, yielding a plethora of halogenated biaryl and triaryl building blocks for the synthesis offine chemicals.

Flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases provide an environmentally friendly, highly regioselective toolkit for the halogenation of various aryl compounds. While previous works characterize the substrate scope of many halogenases individually, exploration of their combinatorial use has thus far been at best superficial. In this study, combinations of the Trp&#8208;halogenases PyrH, Thal, RebH, and AetF are used to synthesize a range of novel di&#8208; and trihalogenated tryptophan derivatives. All tested enzymes accept some halotryptophan derivatives well, while others are mostly rejected. This behavior is rationalized using crystallographic data in conjunction with molecular docking. Upscaling using halogenase combiCLEAs provides facile access to nine novel di&#8208; and even trihalogenated tryptophan derivatives. The more reactive bromine and iodine substituents prove orthogonal to chlorine substituted positions during Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling, readily giving access to chlorinated biaryl scaffolds. Finally, the strategic selection of two different boronic acids enables the selective synthesis of indole&#8208;containing triaryl compounds.

An efficient and scalable metal&#8208;free protocol is developed for C3&#8208;alkylation of indoles employing alkylidene and arylidene malonates as alkyl surrogates, catalyzed by nontoxic and inexpensive iodine. The developed methodology is operationally simple and provides access to a diverse range of products in high yields, up to 95%. The method is further extended and developed into an one&#8208;pot stepwise synthesis strategy for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;(3&#8208;indolyl)carboxylic acid derivatives. Via product modifications, pharmaceutically relevant 5,10&#8208;dihydroindeno[1,2&#8208;b]indole (DHII) and carboline&#8208;based core for MK2 inhibitor analogues are synthesized.

&#947;&#8208;Amino acid derivatives with an &#945;&#8208;quaternary center are prevalent in medicinally important compounds. A dual N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene/photocatalytic pathway is developed for the three&#8208;component synthesis of &#945;, &#945; &#8208;disubstituted &#947;&#8208;amino esters. This methodology allows for the rapid synthesis of diverse libraries of &#947;&#8208;amino esters in good yields.

&#947;&#8208;Amino acid derivatives are important motifs in medicinal chemistry and have shown wide applicability as inhibitory neurotransmitters. An important class of these compounds feature &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstitution. However, established routes for the direct synthesis of &#947;&#8208;amino esters bearing &#945;&#8208;quaternary centers are severely limited in both number of available routes and scope of the transformation. Herein a method is presented for the three&#8208;component synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted &#947;&#8208;amino esters via N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene/photoredox dual catalysis. This reaction involves in&#8201;situ formation of an acyl azolium ester which undergoes photocatalytic reduction to the key stabilized alkoxycarbonyl radical. This methodology is shown to be capable of synthesizing a wide variety of &#947;&#8208;amino esters with various &#945;&#8208;quaternary centers in moderate to good yields, including a derivative of the drug loperamide. The diversity of products that can be synthesized facilitates the rapid generation of libraries of &#947;&#8208;amino acid derived compounds.

Abstract
A photocatalytic strategy for the radical alkenylation of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds with 2,3&#8208;allenoate esters is described. The protocol takes place upon irradiation of the reaction mixture in the presence of the decatungstate anion, which triggers C&#8722;H cleavage in the chosen aliphatic substrates. The photogenerated C&#8208;centered radicals add regioselectively to the central C(sp)&#8208;atom of the cumulenic structure, delivering an allyl&#8208;type radical adduct that finally leads to the &#946;&#8208;substituted alkenoate ester of interest. When an aliphatic allenoate is adopted, the protocol leads to the selective formation of a &#946;,&#947;&#8208;alkenoate, while the corresponding phenyl ester delivers a mixture of &#946;,&#947;&#8208; and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;alkenoates. Rationalization of the observed regioselectivity is supported by computational work, which highlights how the steric demand of the allenoate ester at the radical adduct level determines the reaction outcome. The versatility of the protocol, which can also take place under (telescoped) flow conditions, is further demonstrated by the possibility to divert the reaction outcome toward the selective formation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208; or &#945;,&#946;&#8208;alkenoate esters by performing the photocatalyzed process alone or in combination with a subsequent base&#8208;promoted C=C double bond migration, respectively.

Abstract
A highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of conjugated vinyl azides with &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;keto esters and amides was achieved. With C1&#8208;symmetric imidazolidine&#8208;pyrroloimidazolone pyridine as the tridentate ligand and Cu(OTf)2 as the Lewis acid, diverse chiral fused and spiro cyclohexenes with an azido group containing three continuous stereogenic centers were obtained in good yields (up to 92% yield), excellent diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). The developed method was applied to the derivatization of complex molecules including buspirone&#8208;derived ketoamide. The functional group vinyl azide was capable of participating in a subsequent click reaction.

Abstract
Herein, we report a silver&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cascade reaction of 2&#8208;alkynylaniline tethered heteroenone systems to achieve the synthesis of [6&#8211;5&#8211;7&#8211;6] heterotetracyclic indole fused benzoxepino&#8208; and benzoazepino scaffolds. The reaction proceeded through a silver(I)&#8208;initiation cascade intramolecular 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization followed by 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization to enable the structurally diverse [6&#8211;5&#8211;7&#8211;6] heterotetracyclic adducts in modest to good yields.

Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed reactions are among the most straightforward and efficient methods to proficiently build Csp2&#8208;Csp2 bonds. Nevertheless, thermal activation remains mandatory in most cases, which may decrease the compatibility with sensitive functional groups. In this context, improvements of conventional strategies must be an important source of research in order to enhance the applicability of such methods for building complex scaffolds. In this work, we contribute to this aim by implying visible&#8208;light as the sole energy source in a Pd&#8208;catalyzed rearrangement reaction involving N&#8208;tosylhydrazones and aryl halides. These mild reaction conditions efficiently allow oxidative addition, aryl migration and &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination at room temperature, allowing the construction of various 1,1&#8217; disubstituted olefins.

         <title>Pot&#8208;Economical Synthesis of Fluorinated Pyrrolizinone Derivatives</title>

Abstract
A new family of fluorinated dihydropyrrolizinones has been synthesized starting from fluorinated enamino amides and aliphatic conjugated ketones. The reaction comprises a cross metathesis reaction followed by a tandem cycloaromatization/ enamine hydrolysis/ intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation sequence. This pot&#8208;economical process takes place in good yields (35&#8208;67%), taking into account that it consists of four consecutive reactions. Aromatic enones are also good partners for this protocol although, in this case, the cross metathesis reaction has to be performed in a separated step.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new family of fluorinated dihydropyrrolizinones has been synthesized starting from fluorinated enamino amides and aliphatic conjugated ketones. The reaction comprises a cross metathesis reaction followed by a tandem cycloaromatization/ enamine hydrolysis/ intramolecular Friedel-Crafts alkylation sequence. This pot-economical process takes place in good yields (35-67%), taking into account that it consists of four consecutive reactions. Aromatic enones are also good partners for this protocol although, in this case, the cross metathesis reaction has to be performed in a separated step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Glycosyl furans represent versatile chiral platform molecules that can be readily accessed via the Garcia Gonzalez reaction. Herein, we report a dearomative, intramolecular bromoetherification of carbohydrate&#8208;derived glycosyl furans to generate enantiopure 6&#8208;bromo&#8208;furo[3,2&#8208;b]furans in up to 69% yield. The method employs N&#8208;Br aromatic amides as competent electrophilic halogenating agents that outpace other known reagents. The method works for glycosyl furans derived from the Garcia Gonzalez reactions of various active methylene compounds and unprotected sugars. Further functionalization of the C&#8722;Br bond of the 6&#8208;bromo&#8208;furo[3,2&#8208;b]furans is explored as well.

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of Quinazolinones Through Boiler Flue Gas CO2 Utilization Via Pd@POP&#8208;1 Catalyst Under Mild Conditions</title>

Abstract
A catalyst, Pd@POP&#8208;1, has been successfully synthesized by embedding palladium (Pd) nanoparticles into a nitrogen&#8208;rich porous organic polymer (POP) through the copolymerization of imidazole and triazine ionic salts with divinylbenzene. This catalyst features a unique imine (&#8722;C=N) structure within the triazine ring and multiple coupled imine groups, which significantly enhances CO2 adsorption efficiency and exhibits remarkable catalytic performance. At ambient pressure and mild temperatures, Pd@POP&#8208;1 effectively converts low&#8208;concentration CO2 (less than 15 vol.%) into quinazolinones, even in the presence of SO2 (up to 428&#8197;mg/m3) and NO2 (up to 221&#8197;mg/m3), achieving high yields. Remarkably, Pd@POP&#8208;1 also efficiently transforms CO2 from boiler flue gas, which contains 10 vol.% CO2, into quinazolinones with satisfactory yields. This approach not only provides an eco&#8208;friendly alternative for quinazolinone production by replacing phosgene with actual flue gas as a carbon source but also represents a promising strategy for the resource utilization of CO2 in flue gas.

         <title>Synthesis of Polysubstituted Naphthalenes via Metal&#8208;Free Borylative Cyclization of o&#8208;Alkynylstyrenes</title>

Abstract
A selective, metal&#8208;free method for the synthesis of boron&#8208;functionalized polysubstituted naphthalenes via BCl3&#8208;mediated cyclization of &#945;&#8208;substituted o&#8208;alkynylstyrenes is described. The reaction exhibits broad substrate scope, tolerating various groups such as ethers, sulfides and halogens, and delivers high yields under mild conditions, even at gram scale. The resulting Bpin&#8208;functionalized naphthalenes serve as versatile building blocks, facilitating further transformations of the C&#8722;B bond into C&#8722;H, C&#8722;C, C&#8722;I, C&#8722;O, and C&#8722;N bonds, thereby increasing molecular complexity and enabling the design of more functionalized products. Notably, this sustainable and straightforward protocol selectively introduces the Bpin group at the sterically hindered &#945;&#8208;carbon of the naphthalene framework, complementing C&#8211;H borylations of the naphthalene core, that preferentially occur at the &#946;&#8208;position. As a result, the developed approach significantly broadens the accessibility of B&#8208;functionalized naphthalene derivatives for synthetic and application&#8208;oriented purposes.

Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Chiral amines are versatile building blocks for the asymmetric synthesis of optically pure high&#8208;added&#8208;value chemicals, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural products. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step sequential deracemization of racemic sec&#8208;alcohols to optically enriched primary amines throught a photo&#8208;biocatalytic oxidation&#8208;reductive amination linear cascade. In the first step, near&#8208;to&#8208;quantitative oxidation of a set of racemic (hetero)benzylic alcohols into prochiral ketones was accomplished using visible light photoredox catalysis relying on 440&#8197;nm blue LEDs irradiation, 9&#8208;fluorenone as a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalyst, and O2&#8208;saturated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the reaction medium and a quencher of the in&#8197;situ generated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The intermediary ketones were further converted into the corresponding non&#8208;racemic amines with up to 99% conversion, high&#8208;to&#8208;excellent optical purity (90&#8211;99.9% ee), and complementary absolute configuration via a stereoselective reductive amination catalyzed by lyophilized E. coli cells containing the respective (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;selective recombinant transaminases (E. coli/TAs) in an aqueous KPi buffer in the presence of pyridoxal&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate (PLP) as cofactor and isopropylamine (iPrNH2) as an amino group donor. The developed photo&#8208;biocatalytic system was scaled up for racemic 1&#8208;phenylethanol (1.0&#8197;mmol), furnishing (S)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethylamine with 91% conv., 82% isolated yield and 99% ee. An exemplary functionalization of the obtained (S)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylamine with 6&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;isopropylpyrimidine&#8208;2,4(1H,3H)&#8208;dione led to afford an enantiomerically enriched newly launched cardiac&#8208;specific myosin inhibitor mavacamten in 76% yield and 99% ee. In addition, a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed, furnishing the first crystal structure for the titled API.

Abstract
An electrochemical benzylic C(sp3)&#8211;H amination reaction of amino group&#8208;substituted alkylarenes with benzimidazoles was developed. The reaction showed good selectivity, and C&#8722;H cleavage occurred selectively at the benzylic position other than the &#945;&#8208;position of the amino group. Atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic, catalyst&#8208;free, external oxidant&#8208;free, H2 as the only and clean byproduct are the additional characteristics of this electrochemical reaction.

Abstract
Methodology for direct fluoroalkenylation of phenolic OH function was developed using a fluorinated electrophilic reagent derived from HFO1234ze gas. Besides various functionalized phenols, tyrosine and tyrosine&#8208;based peptides were successfully conjugated under the optimized reaction conditions. Furthermore, the transformability of the fluoroalkenyl bromide motif was demonstrated to expand the space of bioconjugation via palladium catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

Abstract
Homogeneous transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed alkyne cascade cyclization reaction has attracted much attentions over the past decades. However, the relevant homogeneous transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of allenynes has seldom been explored probably due to noticeable chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity. Described herein is an efficient homogeneous copper&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization reaction of allenynes, thus leading to a practical and atom&#8208;economic access to an array of valuable functionalized pyrroles by formal [3 + 2] cycloaddition via Cu&#8208;containing all&#8208;carbon 1,4&#8208;dipoles.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Divergent Photocatalytic Cascade [4+2] Addition&#8208;Defluorinative Annulation of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes with Terminal Alkynes</title>

Abstract
A mild, metal&#8208;free protocol for cascade [4+2] addition&#8208;defluorinative annulation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes with alkynes was realized via photoredox catalysis. This method was feasible for a wide range of terminal alkynes, affording the 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene derivatives or fluoro&#8208;substituted arenes in moderate to good yields, respectively. The merit of this strategy was demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals and the synthesis of high&#8208;value&#8208;added complex molecules.

Abstract
The synthesis of quinolones is a key technology for the preparation of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Herein we present a step&#8208;economical methodology for streamlined synthesis of 4&#8208;quinolones from a tandem process involving a reduction of nitroarenes, an aza&#8208;Michael addition and an intramolecular Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination. This strategy uses synthetically upstream nitroarenes as viable aniline surrogates and B2(pin)2 as an enabling organic reductant, producing a wide range of 4&#8208;quinolones bearing different functional groups in a step&#8208;economical fashion. The potential value of this protocol is highlighted by late&#8208;stage installation of 4&#8208;quinolone moiety onto bioactive compounds.

Chiral AminesThe cover art (designed by Dr. Pawe&#322; Borowiecki and illustrated by Dr. Paulina Marek&#8208;Urban) depicts a light&#8208;driven biocatalytic cascade uniting photochemistry and enzymatic transformation in a single reaction vessel. Blue LED light initiates photooxidation, followed by asymmetric transamination&#8212;symbolized by the flow from light to enzyme. This seamless one&#8208;pot process enables the synthesis of enantiopure amines, exemplified by the chiral intermediate en route to the cardiomyopathy drug mavacamten.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Alkenylative Cyclization of 1,6&#8208;Allenynes&#8224;</title>

Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of allenynes is regarded as an efficient approach for the synthesis of versatile cyclic frameworks. However, catalytic asymmetric cascade cyclizations of allenynes are still uncommon. Herein, we present the first cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective alkenylative cyclization of 1,6&#8208;allenynes with readily available alkenylboronic acids, providing five&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles with high efficiency (up to 97% yield), broad substrate scope, and moderate to good enantioselectivities (up to 95:5 er).

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Carbonylation/Coupling Reaction using Anode to Oxidize the Trasition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyst and Substrate</title>

Abstract
We reported an electrochemical oxidative carbonylation of N&#8208;phenylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amine derivatives under mild condtions without an external oxidant. Our approach demonstrated a novel electrochemical oxidative carbonylation reaction mode in which the simultaneous reaction of catalyst and substrate with the anode has been developed. Furthermore, an electrochemical C&#8722;H activation for the synthesis of cyclized pyridinium ion has also been realized. Mechanistic investigations suggested that the process involved a &#8220;PdII/PdIII/PdI/PdII&#8221; catalytic cycle, and H2 was generated at the cathode.

         <title>Deazaflavin&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation of White Phosphorus with Aryl Bromides and Chlorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 5&#8208;aryldeazaflavin photocatalyst o&#8208;Me&#8208;dFl catalyzes the arylation of white phosphorus with aryl chlorides and bromides under near UV&#8208;LED irradiation, affording triarylphosphines and tetraarylphosphonium salts. Nuclear magnetic resonance&#160;studies and density functional theory&#160;calculations offer insights into the reaction pathway.

A substantial improvement in the challenging photocatalytic arylation of white phosphorus (P4) with aryl chlorides and bromides is reported. Using the readily accessible deazaflavin&#8208;based photocatalyst o&#8208;Me&#8208;dFl, valuable triarylphosphines (PAr3) and tetraarylphosphonium salts ([PAr4]X, X&#8201;=&#8201;Br, Cl) are synthesized from P4 under near UV&#8208;LED (365&#8201;nm) irradiation in up to 87% combined yield with drastically reduced reaction times compared to previous protocols. 31P nuclear magnetic resonance&#160;spectroscopic monitoring studies and density functional theory calculations provide insights into the reaction pathway. The results represent an important step toward more atom&#8208;efficient and economical photocatalytic P4 functionalization reactions.

A base&#8208;promoted domino reaction strategy has been developed for the synthesis of 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;phenylindenones through the nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening of 2,3&#8208;diphenylcyclopropenone by nitrogen atoms. This protocol encompasses a series of reactions, including Michael addition, ring&#8208;opening, intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts cyclization, and dehydrogenation, offering a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free pathway to efficiently access indenone scaffolds.

         <title>CO2 Conversion in Water Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water microdroplets significantly accelerate CO2 conversion reactions and enable otherwise unfavorable processes due to their unique physicochemical environment&#8212;characterized by strong interfacial effects, intrinsic electric fields, localized super acidic or basic conditions, radical formation, and enhanced reducing power.

Microdroplet chemistry is gaining recognition as a powerful tool and promising platform due to its unique physicochemical environment, suitable for a wide range of applications. When scaled down to the nano&#8208; or micrometer range, microdroplets possess a high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio and exhibit several distinctive properties, such as strong interfacial effects, electric fields, super acidic or basic environments, radical generation, and enhanced reducing power. These characteristics contribute to accelerated reaction rates and enable reactions that are otherwise unfavorable. This minireview explores and discusses the applications of microdroplet chemistry in CO2 conversion processes.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Directed Selectivity in Vinylcarbene Reactions: A Comparative Study of Ag, Rh, and Cu Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals that ligand stereoelectronic effects, rather than vinylogous electrophilicity, govern selectivity in Ag&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Cu&#8208;catalyzed vinylcarbene C(sp3)&#63743;H insertions. These insights guide the design of more selective catalysts for C&#63743;H functionalization.

A comprehensive mechanistic investigation is conducted to uncover the factors governing the selectivity of Ag, Rh, and Cu catalysts in vinylcarbene&#8208;mediated reactions. The study examines the preference for carbenic versus vinylogous C(sp3)&#63743;H bond insertion, highlighting the critical roles of the electronic and steric properties of transition metal catalysts. Contrary to previous assumptions that the enhanced electrophilic character of the vinylogous position in metal vinyl carbenes is the primary determinant, the findings demonstrate that the stereoelectronic effects of the ligand play a more dominant role. These insights inform the design of catalytic systems with tailored selectivity, advancing predictive catalysis and C&#63743;H bond functionalization.

A series of pharmacologically interesting isothiocyanate&#8208;containing amino acids and oligopeptides is obtained through the desulfurization strategy with the wide tolerance of protected groups and amino acid residues, which can be further converted into thiocitrulline derivatives.

A sustainable and mild approach for the synthesis of nonproteinogenic isothiocyanate&#8208;decorated amino acids from lysine residues and carbon disulfide via green&#8208;light photocatalysis is described. A series of pharmacologically interesting isothiocyanate&#8208;containing amino acids and oligopeptides are synthesized for the first time through the desulfurization method with the wide tolerance of protected groups and amino acid residues. The produced unnatural amino acids can be successfully converted into thioamide&#8208;containing amino acids such as thiocitrulline and its analogs. Mechanism studies support the dithiocarbamate radical coupling, deprotonation, and desulfurization processes. This approach expands the scope of nonproteinogenic amino acids and provides a new type of amino acid residues with a robust active site, which are significant organic building blocks and potential biological diagnostic markers.

         <title>Electrochemical [3+2] Cycloaddition to Access 5&#8208;Aryl(alkyl)thiotetrazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
5&#8208;Aryl(alkyl)thiotetrazoles were synthesized via an electrochemical three&#8208;component cascade reaction of thiophenols/thiols, isocyanides and azides.

An electrochemical three&#8208;component reaction of thiophenols/thiols, isocyanides and azides is developed. By using carbon felt (GF) as anode and platinum plate as cathode, a series of 5&#8208;aryl(alkyl)thiotetrazoles are obtained in moderate to good yields. The reaction is proposed to occur through cascade radical addition, oxidation, and [3+2] cycloaddition. The method could be further extended to the synthesis of 5&#8208;alkyl(aryl)selenyltetrazoles. The simple and mild reaction conditions, good substrate scope and scalability make this reaction have a good application prospect in organic synthesis.

The reaction is proposed to occur through cascade radical addition, oxidation, and [3+2] cycloaddition. The method could be further extended to the synthesis of 5-alkyl(aryl)selenyltetrazoles. The simple and mild reaction conditions, good substrate scope and scalability make this reaction have a good application prospect in organic synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and selective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed method for synthesizing primary amides directly from alcohols, with the concurrent release of molecular hydrogen, is reported.

A highly efficient and selective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed method for synthesizing primary amides directly from alcohols, with the concurrent release of molecular hydrogen, is reported. The reaction proceeds through tandem dehydrogenative coupling, oxime ether and nitrile as intermediate using methoxyamine as the amine source. The present strategy simplifies traditional processes, offering a more direct route to primary amides. Mechanistic investigations are conducted to elucidate and support the proposed reaction pathway.

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Chloro and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Dichloro Acetamidines via the Carbenoids Addition to Inherently Low Electrophilic Carbodiimides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbodiimides act as competent electrophilic synthons for the chemoselective addition of lithium mono&#8208; and di&#8208;halocarbenoids. The transformation is provided through a single synthetic operation&#8212;hitherto elusive&#8212;halogenated acetamidines. Interestingly, the constitutively tamed electrophilicity of the starting materials is effectively counterbalanced by the usage of the highly reactive halogenated organolithiums.

The hitherto few explored &#945;&#8208;halomethyl amidine motif has been assembled through the addition of a lithiated (di)&#8208;halomethane (i.e., carbenoid) to easily accessible N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl&#8208;substituted carbodiimides. Despite the inherent low electrophilicity of these heterocumulenes&#8212;as quantitatively determined in Mayr's previous studies&#8212;their sp&#8208;hybridized carbon atom acts as a competent site of attack for these tamed nucleophiles. The overall high&#8208;yielding transformation featuring a genuine chemoselective profile&#8212;as documented by using variously functionalized materials&#8212;is adaptable to the addition of dihalogenated carbenoids. Reaction products could be advantageously used in nucleophilic substitution sequences as well as in further functionalization of the nitrogen atoms due to the constitutive heteroallyl&#8208;type skeleton.

         <title>Electrolyte&#8208;Free Electrochemical C3&#8208;Arylmethylation of Indoles with Tertiary/Secondary N&#8208;Methyl Anilines using N&#8208;Methyl as the Methylene Source</title>

         <dc:description>
This study presents an electrochemical C3&#8208;arylmethylation of indoles with tertiary/secondary N&#8208;methyl anilines using the N&#8208;methyl as the methylene donor to link indoles and anilines under electrolyte&#8208;, oxidant&#8208;, and catalyst&#8208;free conditions, producing various C3&#8208;arylmethylated indoles in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields after the cleavage of the C&#63743;N bond in presumed C3&#8208;aminomethylated indoles.

An electrochemical approach devoid of electrolytes, oxidants, metals, and light is established for the C3&#8208;arylmethylation of indoles using tertiary/secondary N&#8208;methyl anilines, demonstrating a wide substrate scope, with N&#8208;methyl serving as the methylene donor. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the presumed C3&#8208;aminomethylated indole acts as a reactive intermediate, facilitating the formation of the arylmethylated product via radical/electrophilic addition, anodic oxidation/deprotonation, fragmentation, and cathodic reduction/protonation processes.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;H Activation and Cyclization with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations of isocyanates via C(sp2)&#8208;H activation (2006&#8211;2025). It categorizes advances by substrate type, and provides a concise analysis of substrate scopes, limitations, molecular modifiability, mechanistic studies, and their applications in the synthesis of diversely functionalized molecules. Future challenges are outlined.

Nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds represent the core structures of natural products and drugs, and their efficient synthesis is of great significance for the development of medicinal chemistry and functional materials. Isocyanates, owing to their high electrophilicity and multifunctionality, have become a universal building block for constructing complex nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles.

We report the diazo&#8208;transfer from Hypervalent Iodine Diazo Reagents to azocarboxylates under photocatalytic conditions. The subsequent intramolecular decarboxylative cyclization leads to the divergent access to 1&#8201;H&#8208;diazirines and 1H&#8208;tetrazoles depending upon the substituents in the azo&#8208;substrate. The control experiments suggested that the diazo&#8208;group transfer may take place through photocatalytically generated diazomethyl radical intermediate or through electrophilic diazomethylation of azocarboxylate radical anion

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Enantiopure (R)&#8208;Citronellal from Geraniol via a Short&#8208;Chain Dehydrogenase and Ene Reductase</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic cascade with two consecutive biocatalytic steps consisting of a short&#8208;chain alcohol dehydrogenase and an ene reductase in a biphasic system provides (R)&#8208;citronellal with &gt;90% conversion and &gt;99% enantiomeric excess from inexpensive geraniol.

The development of synthetic routes to produce enantiopure (R)&#8208;citronellal as a key intermediate for the synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;menthol and other valuable terpenoids is highly relevant in the pharmaceutical, flavor, and fragrance industries. Herein, we showcase a cascade with two consecutive biocatalytic steps performed separately using the inherent selectivity of a short&#8208;chain alcohol dehydrogenase (SDR) and an ene reductase (ERED) from the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) family. The first reaction involves the AaSDR1&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of relatively inexpensive geraniol in a biphasic system, providing geranial as an intermediate. The organic phase containing geranial is then extracted and transferred to the second step, where the ERED variant OYE2_Y83V catalyzes the asymmetric reduction of geranial to produce (R)&#8208;citronellal, achieving &gt;90% conversion and &gt;99% enantiomeric excess. The use of n&#8208;heptane in a two&#8208;liquid phase system not only facilitates substrate and product solubilization but also minimizes geranial isomerization. This biocatalytic cascade therefore enables the synthesis of enantiopure (R)&#8208;citronellal.

         <title>Oxidative Rearrangement of 3&#8208;Aryl Azo Indoles in Water: Synthesis of C3&#8208;Oxo&#8208;C2&#8208;Amino Indoles and their Application as Fluorophores for Lipid Droplet Detection</title>

         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free, sustainable oxidative rearrangement of 3&#8208;azo indoles in water is described to C3&#8208;oxo&#8208;C2&#8208;amino indoles, which are used as fluorescent probes to detect lipid droplets.

A novel oxidative rearrangement of the diazene moiety in 3&#8208;aryl azo indoles is reported, leading to the formation of C3&#8208;oxo&#8208;C2&#8208;amino indoles with excellent regioselectivity. This transformation, achieved using oxone in water at ambient temperature, proceeds in good yields with broad functional group tolerance, including toward azaindoles. Mechanistic insights are gained through control experiments, crystal structures, and density functional theory calculations. Experimental and theoretical photophysical studies, along with cellular uptake and colocalization experiments, demonstrate that the resulting compounds selectively bind to lipid droplets (LDs), highlighting their potential as fluoroprobes for LD detection.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple photoredox system comprising Hantzsch ester, Cs2CO3, and 4DPAIPN that enables direct and site&#8208;selective deoxygenation of benzyl alcohol derivatives is described. Mechanistic studies reveal that in&#8201;situ reversible acylative activation of hydroxy groups plays a pivotal role in achieving the unique selectivity, highlighting the importance of reversible activation strategies in selective molecular transformations.

A simple yet efficient method is presented for direct and site&#8208;selective deoxygenation of benzyl alcohol derivatives, including polyols, without requiring preactivation. This reaction system, consisting of Hantzsch ester, Cs2CO3, and a photocatalyst under photoirradiation, enables direct and site&#8208;selective deoxygenation. Mechanistic studies reveal that in&#8201;situ reversible acylative activation of hydroxy groups plays a pivotal role in achieving unique selectivity.

         <title>Integrating Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis and Enzymes for the Stereoselective Synthesis of Alcohols and Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration between visible&#8208;light photocatalysis and biocatalysis has the potential to greatly improve modern organic synthesis by combining the production of valuable synthetic intermediates under mild photochemical conditions with the high degree of stereoselectivity reached by enzymes. The review collects the recent efforts in the photoenzymatic asymmetric synthesis of alcohols and amines.

The stereocontrolled formation of C&#63743;O and C&#63743;N bonds is important for the preparation of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, fragrances, and flavors. In this field, enzymes have become a valid alternative to transition metal complexes and organocatalysts due to their high degree of stereoselectivity and desirable sustainability features. In this scenario, the increasing interest toward sustainable and efficient chemical processes has also led to the combination of complementary catalytic systems. The merge of biocatalysis and photocatalysis is among the most recent approaches. While photocatalysis allows the production of valuable synthetic intermediates and reactive species under mild conditions, biocatalysis exploits highly specific enzymes to catalyze reactions with high (stereo)&#8208;selectivity and minimal byproduct formation. This review summarizes the progress in photoenzymatic catalysis (also photobiocatalysis), emphasizing their complementary mechanisms in producing chiral alcohols and amines, and highlights how such integration not only enhances the sustainability of catalytic systems but also expands the scope of reactions accessible under milder and ultimately more sustainable conditions.

         <title>Borane&#8208;Catalyzed Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Ring Opening of 2&#8208;Substituted Aziridines with Phenols for Direct Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines</title>

Boron&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208; and ortho&#8208;selective C&#63743;H bond substitution of phenols with 2&#8208;alkyl/aryl aziridines to access the branched selective ortho&#8208;phenolic&#8208;&#946;&#8208;arylethylamines is achieved. N&#8208;heterocyclic arenes can also act as carbon nucleophiles to open the aziridine ring selectively to afford the branched products. This protocol is demonstrated for the synthesis of serotonin and tryptamine.

A metal&#8208;free chemo&#8208; and regioselective nucleophilic ring opening of 2&#8208;substituted aziridines with ortho&#8208;C(sp2) atom of phenols enables facile access to medicinally relevant &#946;&#8208;arylethylamine derivatives. In this approach, phenols act as aryl nucleophiles that favor C&#63743;C bond formation selectively at the ortho&#8208;C(sp2) position with the more substituted carbon of aziridines to generate branched, selective arylated products. Despite the significant advancement of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling and nucleophilic ring opening of 2&#8208;substituted azirines, only linear arylated products are widely demonstrated. The first metal&#8208;free branched selective nucleophilic ring opening of 2&#8208;alkyl and 2&#8208;aryl aziridines with phenols is reported to address this challenge. Furthermore, the diversity of the substrate scope by using N&#8208;heterocycles as nucleophiles empowers the generation of &#946;&#8208;heteroarylethylamine derivatives. A combination of computational and experimental investigation reveals that the reaction proceeds via a borane&#8208;promoted proton transfer, followed by aziridine ring opening and Fridel&#8211;Crafts alkylation involving a &#960;&#8208;complex of carbocation&#8208;anion ion pair. This protocol is further applicable for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant compounds like serotonin and tryptamine.

         <title>Noncovalent&#8208;Interaction&#8208;Dictated Product Selectivity in Intermolecular and Intramolecular Controllable Oxidation of Aromatic Amines Using 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Diperoxyphenic Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving controllable generation and effective interception of relevant intermediates during intermolecular and intramolecular oxidation of aromatic amines by noncovalent interactions is an attractive objective. It has been reported herein the means to enable a family of intermolecular and intramolecular controllable selective oxidation of aromatic amines that create opportunities for the synthesis of symmetric or unsymmetric nitrosobenzenes, nitrobenzenes, azoxybenzenes, and azobenzenes.


Selective oxidation of aromatic amines is a valuable transformation in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry as well as materials science. However, the efficient means to reach its full potential remain a formidable challenge because meticulous perturbations on the oxidation states can potentially lead to dramatically different product selectivity and efficacy profiles. Herein, by identifying bench&#8208;stable and easily prepared 2,2&#8242;&#8208;diperoxyphenic acid as oxidant and/or I2 as additive, a general and divergent oxidation is developed to reliably form a wide assortment of nitrosobenzenes, nitrobenzenes, azobenzenes, and azoxybenzenes in an intermolecular and intramolecular controllable manner, avoiding the use of stoichiometric metal oxidants and transition metal&#8208;based catalysts. Mechanistic studies reveal that the imposing of noncovalent interactions enables the achievement of reagent&#8208; and additive&#8208;dependent reordering of N&#63743;H bond reactivity and the rate of corresponding elementary steps.

         <title>Cu/Ru Sequential Catalysis via In Situ Directing Group Formation for Site&#8208;Selective C&#63743;H Arylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu/Ru sequential catalysis enables in situ formation of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles as directing groups for site&#8208;selective C&#63743;H arylation.Combining click chemistry with Ru&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H activation bypasses prefunctionalization, ensures high regioselectivity, and accommodates diverse substrates.Applications include late&#8208;stage drug modification and functional material synthesis.

A Cu/Ru bimetallic sequential catalytic strategy combining copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) with Ru&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H activation is developed, enabling the in&#8201;situ formation of nitrogen&#8208;containing triazoles and their ortho C&#63743;H arylation in a one&#8208;pot dual&#8208;functional transformation. This system innovatively employs the 1,2,3&#8208;triazole formed via CuAAC as an endogenous directing group, facilitating sequential [3+2] cycloaddition and Ru&#8208;mediated C&#63743;H functionalization through a stepwise catalytic approach. The strategy overcomes the limitations of traditional preactivation and exhibits excellent regioselectivity and broad substrate compatibility. This approach has been successfully applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceutical molecules, offering a new paradigm for the modular synthesis of complex compounds.

         <title>Electrochemically Driven Hydroxy&#8208;Thiocarbamation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces an electrochemical method for multi&#8208;component hydroxy&#8208;thiocarbamation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, using (hetero)aryl alkenes, KSCN, and H2O to produce &#946;&#8208;hydroxy primary S&#8208;thiocarbamates. The process is highly atom&#8208;economical, and demonstrates excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, enabling diverse product synthesis and late&#8208;stage natural product modification.

This article reports the first example of multi&#8208;component hydroxy&#8208;thiocarbamation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes in an electrochemical undivided cell. Simple and readily available electron&#8208;deficient (hetero)aryl alkenes, KSCN and H2O are used as starting materials to produce &#946;&#8208;hydroxy primary S&#8208;thiocarbamate derivatives in moderate to good yields. H2O is involved in the formation of carbamoyl and hydroxyl groups, making the method highly atom&#8208;economical. The reaction introduces multiple functional groups under mild and environmentally friendly conditions, without the need for metals or external oxidants. The reaction exhibits good functional&#8208;group tolerance and excellent product diversity. The procedure is operationally simple, and late&#8208;stage modification of natural products further demonstrates the practical application of the method.

         <title>Electrochemical Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Heterofunctionalization of Tropones via C(sp2)&#63743;H Derivatization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and selective. The electrochemical heterofunctionalization of activated tropones is achieved using readily available inorganic salts. A theoretical model, based on cyclic voltammetry and quantum chemistry calculations, predicts both reactivity trends and site selectivity. This model is supported by the rapid synthesis of densely functionalized tropones and tropolones (35 examples, with yields up to 95%).

A general electrochemical synthetic procedure for the site&#8208;selective heterofunctionalization of activated tropones is documented. Detailed voltametric analysis and quantum chemistry calculations enabled&#160;the development of a predictive model for the process efficiency, accounting for both reactivity and regioselectivity. Mono&#8208; and poly&#8208;halogenation, nitration, sulfonation, and thiocyanation protocols are successfully executed starting from inexpensive sodium salts under oxidative electrolytic conditions (35 examples, isolated yields up to 95%, faradaic efficiencies up to 95%). The implementation of an iterative electrochemical/metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling synthetic strategy, along with the adaptation of the protocol for the preparation of biologically relevant tropolone derivatives, underscores the generality and robustness of the methodology.

         <title>Electrochemically Driven Diastereoselective Dearomative 2,3&#8208;Diesterification of Indoles with Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein an electrochemical radical cation&#8208;mediated dearomative 2,3&#8208;difunctionalization of indoles with carboxylic acids for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;diesterified indolines with excellent trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity is reported.

An electrochemically driven radical cation&#8208;mediated dearomative 2,3&#8208;difunctionalization of indoles with carboxylic acids is described, which provides an efficient and straightforward route for the construction of a range of 2,3&#8208;diesterified indolines with excellent trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields. This metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free electrochemical protocol proceeds in an undivided cell, exhibiting broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies reveal that the anodic single&#8208;electron oxidation of indoles is the initial step and oxocarbenium ion formation is the key to controlling trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Solvent&#8208; and Transition Metal&#8208;Free Mechanochemical Synthesis of 2&#8208;Thiazolines and S&#8208;Thiocarbamates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent&#8208; and transition metal&#8208;free synthetic pathways for obtaining 2&#8208;thiazolines and S&#8208;thiocarbamates, based on the mechanochemical process of addition of chloroalkyl iso(thio)cyanates to thiols catalyzed by cheap and commercially available K2CO3, are designed and optimized. This approach has been successfully applied to obtain 39 materials with significant medicinal potential in yields above 95%.

For the first time, the mechanochemical synthesis of five&#8208;membered N,S&#8208;heterocyclic 1,3&#8208;thiazolines and S&#8208;thiocarbamates has been performed starting from chloroalkyl iso(thio)cyanates, thiols, as well as dithiols, in the presence of cheap and commercially available potassium carbonate (K2CO3) as a catalyst. The experimental conditions are optimized to allow the effective formation of attractive materials with significant medicinal potential in yields above 95% in transition metal&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free conditions. The reactions are efficient and easily scalable to gram quantities, offering substantial benefits for practical applications.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling Reaction of Diazo Reagent with Formamide for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Formyloxy Ketones and &#945;&#8208;Ketoamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct coupling reaction of diazo reagent with formamide has been developed to construct &#945;&#8208;formyloxy ketones and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides in moderate to excellent yields with a broad substrate scope. The synthetic protocol features mild reaction conditions and simple operation under air, which can enable the installation of aldehyde and amine group into the target molecule via C&#63743;N bond cleavage.

A copper&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction of diazo reagents with formamides is reported. Under the optimal reaction conditions, this reaction leads to a wide range of &#945;&#8208;formyloxy ketones and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides in moderate to good yields. This strategy enables the installation of two important functional groups, aldehyde and amine group, into the target molecule in the presence of formamide via C&#63743;N bond cleavage. Mechanism studies indicate that this conversion reaction may undergo a radical process.

Catalytic Diastereoselective Synthesis of Bicyclo[3.2.1]octanediones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unconventional annulations between pent&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones and vinyl diketones has been achieved to afford bicyclo[3.2.1]octanediones in high yields, which are ubiquitous in bioactive substances but are challenging to synthesize using traditional methods

The bicyclo[3.2.1]octanone and bicyclo[3.2.1]octanedione scaffolds, along with their derivatives, are ubiquitous in natural products and synthetic pharmaceuticals. However, the synthetic routes to access these scaffolds have been relatively underdeveloped. Herein, this study introduces a unique reaction between pent&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones and vinyl diketones, which serves as a versatile platform for the efficient synthesis of a wide array of bicyclo[3.2.1]octanediones in good to excellent yields. Furthermore, this study method facilitates diverse downstream transformations of these products, underscoring the versatility and potential of diketone&#8208;based chemistry in constructing complex molecules.

&lt;p&gt;The bicyclo[3.2.1]octanone and bicyclo[3.2.1]octanedione scaffolds, along with their derivatives, are ubiquitous in natural products and synthetic pharmaceuticals. However, the synthetic routes to access these scaffolds have been relatively underdeveloped. Herein, this study introduces a unique reaction between pent-4-ene-1,3-diones and vinyl diketones, which serves as a versatile platform for the efficient synthesis of a wide array of bicyclo[3.2.1]octanediones in good to excellent yields. Furthermore, this study method facilitates diverse downstream transformations of these products, underscoring the versatility and potential of diketone-based chemistry in constructing complex molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrosynthesis of 2,5&#8208;Disubstituted Furans through a C&#63742;C Double Bond Cleavage Radical Cascade</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic cyclization of two enaminone molecules is conducted to 2,5&#8208;disubstituted furans from a C&#63742;C double bond cleavage radical cascade under exogenous oxidation and transition metal free, mild, and practical conditions. The desired products are produced with the leaving of DMF and dimethylamine.

An electrochemically oxidative cyclization between two molecules of enaminones to give 2,5&#8208;disubstituted furans had been established through the leaving of DMF and dimethylamine under mild and practical reaction conditions. Attributing to the electrolysis process, the exogenous oxidation and transition metal are avoided. Moreover, this electrosynthesis is highlighted by good yields obtained, good functional group compatibility and high step economy. In addition, based on the intermediate monitoring, intermediate verification, radical&#8208;trapping, and cyclic voltammetry experiments, a possible mechanism is proposed.

         <title>Insights into Alkene Hydroselenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the hydroselenation reactions of alkenes with selenols or their surrogates for the synthesis of valuable organoselenium compounds, with a special emphasis on the mechanisms of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed and radical hydroselenation.

Selective hydrofunctionalization of alkenes enables the efficient construction of structurally diverse and value&#8208;added molecules with new functionalities. The past few decades have witnessed rapid applications of organoselenium compounds in pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and materials. Alkene hydroselenation represents one of the most promising strategies for the highly regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208;, and stereoselective synthesis of selenium&#8208;containing substances. This review outlines the hydroselenation reactions of alkenes with selenols or their surrogates developed over the past five decades and discusses the origin of selectivity based on representative examples. These developments are categorized according to the reactivity patterns exhibited by the selenium nucleophiles. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, light&#8208;induced, and electrocatalytic hydroselenation are highlighted to enhance the understanding of the mechanism.

         <dc:description>











A novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven iron&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative cyclization reaction of 2&#8208;carboxymethoxybenzaldehyde and aryl amines under mild conditions is developed. This highly efficient transformation enables the quick construction of various substituted 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran derivatives in one&#8208;pot operation with good to excellent yields as well as broad functional group tolerance and will provide versatile short approaches to motifs and/or analogues of numerous medicinally interesting 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran natural products. Preliminary mechanistic investigations show that iron catalyst can readily realize decarboxylation of alkyl carboxylic acids to alkyl radicals through a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven protocol, thus leading to one&#8208;pot decarboxylation and cyclization cascade reactions.

Visible light and hypervalent iodine&#8208;induced dual synthetic approach for carboaminated naphthoquinones has been developed via C(sp2)&#63743;H difunctionalization.

A dual synthetic approach of three&#8208;component carboamination reactions has been developed in the presence of visible&#8208;light photocatalysis as well as hypervalent iodine(III) reagent to afford the C(sp2)&#63743;H difunctionalization. The main keynote of our approaches is metal&#8208;free, base&#8208;free, mild reaction conditions, room temperature synthesis with high yields, and broad substrate scope. Apart from this, the protocols described herein are also helpful for constructing and transforming complex molecules.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Promoted Esterification of Carboxylic Acids via Photoacid Generation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel, environmentally friendly photochemical method for the esterification of carboxylic acids with alcohols using arylazo sulfones as photoacid generators was developed. This approach avoids traditional acidic catalysts, purification did not require chromatography and the method proved effective under continuous flow conditions for enhanced productivity.

The ester functionality is ubiquitously found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and perfumes. Among the various methods of ester synthesis, the acid&#8208;catalyzed coupling of carboxylic acids with alcohols is the most common approach. Herein, a mild photochemical method is introduced, leveraging a photoacid generation approach utilizing an arylazo sulfone as the sulfonic acid precursor. A broad substrate scope of carboxylic acids or alcohols is reported, while a continuous flow process has been also implemented.

         <title>Dual Photoredox/Cu&#8208;Catalysis Enables Diastereoselective Synthesis of 3&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Ethynyltropanes via Decarboxylative Alkynylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative alkynylation of tropanes is developed. This approach works under mild conditions and selectively produces a range of 3&#8208;&#946;&#8208;alkynylated tropanes. Moreover, it provides a versatile and convergent platform for further functionalization of the triple bond.

An efficient decarboxylative alkynylation of a tropane redox&#8208;active ester with terminal alkynes is described, yielding ethynyltropanes with exclusive &#946;&#8208;configuration. This cost&#8208;effective process utilizes mild, nontoxic copper&#8208;catalyzed, photoinduced reaction conditions. Beyond introducing a novel pathway for the catalytic alkynylation of nortropanes, this method offers a versatile and convergent approach for synthesizing complex nortropane derivatives through further functionalization of the triple bond, including reductions, and inverse demand Diels&#8211;Alder reactions.

         <title>Synergistic Visible Light Nanophotocatalysis and Asymmetric Organocatalysis for the Stereoselective &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedent dual catalytic nanophotocatalytic and asymmetric organocatalytic system for the &#945;&#8208;functionalization of aldehydes is developed using carbon nanodots as photosensitizers. The optimized methodology yields the alkylated products with up to 94% yield and up to 98:2 e.r., evidencing the possible recycling of the nanocatalysts. This procedure can serve as pivotal starting point for the use of carbon dots in asymmetric photocatalysis.

Carbon dots (CDs) are privileged carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials which they have been extensively studied in recent years in catalysis. In fact, their peculiar photoluminescence features have found applications in nanophotocatalysis as well as bioimaging and sensing. Nevertheless, their application as nanophotoredox catalysts in stereoselective transformations is still unexplored. Herein, this study reports the combination of carbon dots as nanophotocatalysts and asymmetric organocatalysis for the stereoselective &#945;&#8208;functionalization of aldehydes. Employing various bromo&#8208;derivatives as alkylating agents, it achieves the corresponding enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;alkylated derivatives with excellent yields (up to 94%) and enantioselectivities (up to 98:2 e.r.). With a series of control experiments, cyclic voltammetry and fluorescence quenching studies, it is possible to postulate a synergistic dual catalytic cycle that involves a photo&#8208;oxidative quenching of the excited stated of CDs paired with an enamine activation promoted by the MacMillan organocatalyst followed by radical alkylation. This study successfully demonstrates that carbon dots can efficiently replace metal&#8208;based photocatalysts, promoting photoredox catalytic stereoselective transformations even at low concentrations (down to 0.1&#8201;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1), paving the way to more sustainable and possibly recyclable catalytic systems.

         <title>Multiphoton Multicomponent Reactions: Discovery of the 2&#8208;Photon Ketene 4&#8208;Component Reaction (2P&#8208;K&#8208;4CR)</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent reactions triggered by multiple photons: complex heterocycles can be synthesized in a regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner via a double photoactivation using visible light from simple building blocks, exploiting the combination of ketene 3&#8208;component reaction and Patern&#242;&#8211;B&#252;chi cycloaddition.

Herein, the first multiphoton, multicomponent approach for synthesizing highly functionalized oxetanes using diazoketones, isocyanides, silanols (or carboxylic acids), and 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives (benzils) is presented as starting materials. Blue light irradiation initiates the Wolff rearrangement of diazoketones, generating ketenes that promptly react with isocyanides and silanols (or carboxylic acids) to afford captodative olefins. Concurrently, excitation of benzils promotes a [2&#8201;+&#8201;2] photocycloaddition between the activated carbonyl group and the captodative olefin. This newly developed two&#8208;photon ketene four&#8208;component reaction has been thoroughly investigated, also through chemometric analysis, including its substrates scope and the extension to mixed benzils. Furthermore, the observed stereochemical outcomes, validated by X&#8208;Ray diffraction analysis, are elucidated through detailed computational studies, providing insights into the underlying reaction mechanism.

An electrochemical oxidative [3 + 2] annulation of p&#8208;methoxy anilines with enaminones is reported for the synthesis of 3&#8208;acyl indoles in a moderate to good yields under mild conditions, which features excellent functional group tolerance, operational simplicity, and gram&#8208;scale scalability.

This protocol enables facile synthesis of 3&#8208;acyl indoles in moderate to good yields under mild conditions, featuring excellent functional group tolerance, operational simplicity, and gram&#8208;scale scalability.

         <title>B(C6F5)3&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive C&#63743;C Bond Cleavage of Bisindolylmethanes</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient, metal&#8208;free method for synthesizing C3&#8208;alkylated indoles via B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed reductive C&#63743;C bond cleavage of bisindolylmethanes (BIMs) under mild conditions is reported, offering broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance.

In this study, B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed reductive C&#63743;C bond cleavage of bisindolylmethanes (BIMs) is reported as an efficient strategy for preparing C3&#8208;alkylated indoles. In the presence of silane, B(C6F5)3 selectively activates Csp2&#8208;Csp3 bonds of BIMs under mild conditions. Moreover, this sustainable process exhibits a broad substrate scope, highly functional group tolerance, and excellent regioselectivity. Preliminary mechanistic studies disclose that the formation of stabilized ion&#8208;pair intermediates is crucial to achieving the desired transformation. Notably, the strategy provides a metal&#8208;free alternative to transition metal catalysis, enabling the sustainable synthesis of valuable indole derivatives.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Photoredox Synthesis of Sulfonylated Benzimidazoisoquinolines via 10 H&#8208;Phenothiazine&#8208;Catalyzed Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free photocatalytic strategy using unmodified 10 H&#8208;phenothiazine is presented for the synthesis of sulfonylated benzimidazoisoquinolines. Visible light activates catalytic electron donor&#8211;acceptor complexes between phenothiazine and sulfonyl chlorides, driving a sulfonation/cyclization cascade with broad substrate scope, high efficiency, and mild conditions.

An unmodified 10 H&#8208;phenothiazine is directly utilized as an efficient photocatalyst to enable ready access to sulfonylated benzo[4,5]imidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives from N&#8208;allyl benzimidazoles and sulfonyl chlorides. The reaction involves the formation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor complexes between phenothiazine and sulfonyl chloride, which, upon visible light irradiation, undergo single&#8208;electron transfer to generate sulfonyl radicals. The reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and high efficiency.

This article discusses the reports on DG&#8208;assisted site&#8208;selective di&#8208;ortho&#8208;arylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkenylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkynylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;cyanation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;amination, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;thiolation/selenation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;carbonylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;halogenation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;oxygenation, and unsymmetrical di&#8208;ortho C&#63743;H functionalization of inert aryl and heteroaryl C&#63743;H bonds. This unique approach has gotten tremendous attention over the last two decades for the synthesis of complex functionalized aryls.

The directing group (DG)&#8208;assisted transition metal (TM)&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective C&#63743;H activation and functionalization has become a popular approach in the synthesis of natural products, pharmaceuticals, and late&#8208;stage functionalization. In particular, the ortho&#8208;selective C&#63743;H functionalization is frequently addressed. One DG generally directs the mono&#8208;C&#63743;H functionalization. However, over the years, there are some exceptional reactions that have been reported where one DG directs di&#8208;ortho&#8208;C&#63743;H functionalization, offering extra functionalization in one pot. There is no generalization in this type of reaction. In this comprehensive report, the di&#8208;ortho&#8208;C&#63743;H functionalization reactions reported in the recent two decades (2004&#8211;2024) are summarized, and the current status and future perspective for further modifications are provided. This discussion covers DG&#8208;assisted site&#8208;selective di&#8208;ortho&#8208;arylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkenylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkynylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;cyanation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;amination, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;thiolation/selenation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;carbonylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;halogenation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;oxygenation, and unsymmetrical di&#8208;ortho C&#63743;H functionalization of inert aryl and heteroaryl C&#63743;H bonds.

A concise and effective synthesis of carbocycle&#8208;fused &#947;&#8208;carbolinone derivatives via the regio&#8208; and chemoselective cascade reactions of indole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxamides with cyclic diazo compounds is presented.

The formation of product is initiated by the regioselective C2&#63743;H bond metalation of the indole moiety and carbene formation with the diazo coupling partner (CP), followed by migratory insertion, protodemetallation, chemoselective intramolecular aza&#8208;nucleophilic addition, and water elimination.

         <title>eAmidation: An Electrochemical Amidation of Aldehydes via the Oxidation of N&#8208;Aryl Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The indirect electrochemical oxidation of N&#8208;aryl hydrazones offers an efficient approach to access amides from aldehydes and amines. The AZADO&#8208;mediated reaction enables the selective synthesis of a broad range of valuable amides using readily available aldehydes.

In recent years, the use of electrochemistry has emerged as a powerful yet sustainable means of enabling key transformations. Amidation is one of the most frequently executed transformations in synthetic chemistry, and using an electrochemical approach, the current study has demonstrated the synthesis of amides from aldehydes and amines. Mechanistic work indicates that the reaction proceeds via the oxidation of an intermediate hydrazone to generate an acyl diazene as the acylating species. The protocol developed has enabled the synthesis of a broad range of amides, including access to pharmaceutically relevant products, directly from aldehydes without recourse for hazardous chemical oxidants and activating agents.

         <title>Impact of the Substitution Pattern in N&#8211;heterocyclic Olefin&#8208;Substituted Phosphines on Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of olefin backbone substitution in N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin&#8208;substituted phosphines is investigated. While these ligands are highly electron&#8208;donating, their catalytic activity in Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions decreases as the size of the backbone substituent increases. Stoichiometric reactions reveal unfavorable side reactions that reduce steric congestion, explaining the observed differences in catalytic activities.

In recent years, N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) have been recognized for their strong electron&#8208;donating properties. These properties have been utilized in the design of phosphine ligands (NHOPs) to enhance the electron density in palladium complexes, thereby promoting palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. In this study, the impact of the substituent in the olefin backbone was investigated. NHOP ligands with methyl and phenyl moieties have been prepared and their catalytic performance compared with the hydrogen&#8208;substituted analogs. The increased ligand bulk in the backbone results in a reduced catalytic activity in selected Pd&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig aminations. The unfavorable steric profile, as revealed by the crystal structures of the ligands and the observation of various decomposition products, is proposed as the reason for the diminished activity.

         <title>Bifunctional Reagents for Photochemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively explores bifunctional reagents in photocatalysis, which integrate radical activation sites and coupling modules within a single molecule. It systematically categorizes them (radical precursor&#8208;radical precursor/nucleophile/electrophile/acceptor) based on reaction modes and active sites, detailing mechanisms like energy/electron transfer. Emphasis is placed on their advantages for precise, efficient, and selective molecular construction under mild conditions.

Bifunctional reagents in photochemistry integrate radical activation sites with coupling modules within a single molecular framework, enabling precise construction of sophisticated moleculars. This review systematically summarizes recent advancements and reaction mechanisms of these reagents in photocatalysis regulated by energy transfer or photoinduced electron transfer. It emphasizes how kinetic matching and electronic modulation achieve selective activation of radical precursors. Cutting&#8208;edge developments, including diverse metal&#8208;based and metal&#8208;free systems, and innovative mechanisms like strain&#8208;release and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, have expanded complex molecular synthesis. The review categorizes progress based on active sites and reaction modes into four classes: radical precursor&#8208;radical precursor, radical precursor&#8208;nucleophile, radical precursor&#8208;electrophile, and radical precursor&#8208;radical acceptor. Subclassifications are defined by the central atom type of radicals and transformation patterns, revealing intrinsic correlations between reagent parameters (e.g., bond dissociation energy, electronic distribution, steric effects) and reaction pathways. This review aims to establish precise yet universal methodologies for guiding drug synthesis and functional material development.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;Oxokolavenol: A Natural Neoclerodane Diterpene with Farnesoid X Receptor Transcriptional Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The natural neoclerodane diterpene (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol shows significant Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) transcriptional activity. Herein, the first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol is reported. The synthetic route takes a 15&#8208;step sequence from the known Wieland&#8211;Miescher ketone with 0.85% overall yield. In addition, the synthesis allows (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol with 12 synthetic intermediates for biological evaluations of FXR transcriptional activity.

The natural neoclerodane diterpene (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol is isolated from the twigs of Amoora stellato&#8208;squamosa, and exhibited significant Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) transcriptional activity with an EC50 value of 1.877 &#956;M. However, the scarcity of its natural sources poses a considerable challenge for further biological studies. To address this limitation, herein, the first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol is reported. This synthesis features stereoselective alkylation, regioselective redox transformations (including late&#8208;stage allylic oxidation), and strategic installation of methyl groups. The overall synthesis delivers (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol in 15 steps from the cheap and readily available Wieland&#8211;Miescher ketone. In addition, this approach allows (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol with 12 synthetic intermediates for biological evaluations by using dual&#8208;luciferase reporter assay. Preliminary investigations confirm the nuclear receptor selectivity of (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol as a FXR agonist, underscoring its potential for further bioactivity studies.

         <title>C&#8211;H Homocoupling of Arenes via Pd/S,O&#8208;Ligand Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient C&#8208;H homocoupling of arenes via Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand catalytic system is reported. This method can be applied to a series of arenes using O2 as oxidant under room temperature and is also applicable for late&#8208;stage homocoupling of pharmaceutical derivatives. Homocoupling of o&#8208;xyleneexhibits near&#8208;perfect chemoselectivity, offering an industrially favorable route to a Upilex&#174; monomer precursor .

Non&#8208;directed Pd&#8208;catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenative homocoupling of arenes is achieved in the presence of an S,O&#8208;ligand. The reaction proceeds under aerobic and mild reaction conditions with a wide range of anisole derivatives, providing direct access to symmetric biaryls with excellent ortho&#8208;ortho or para&#8208;para regioselectivity. Notably, the use of the arene as the limiting reagent enables late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex pharmaceutical molecules. The industrial applicability of this methodology is demonstrated through the synthesis of the Upilexmonomer via the homocoupling of unactivatedo&#8208;xylene.

         <title>High&#8208;Order Cascade Transformations on Tertiary &#946;&#8208;Enaminones for Step&#8208;Economical Construction of Molecular Diversity and Complexity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the recent development of enaminone&#8208;based high&#8208;order cascade single cyclization reaction and bicyclic annulation reaction via the formation of four or more new chemical bonds are summarized.

The generation of molecular diversity and complexity constitutes the major task of synthetic organic chemistry. In contrast, to achieve the maximum complexity and/or diversity of organic compound with minimum operational steps is of high significance by saving consumption of both the chemicals and the time for synthesis, enhancing the synthetic efficiency and sustainability. Based on our longstanding interest in the enaminone&#8208;based organic synthesis, herein, the research advances in high&#8208;order cascade reactions are reviewed, which involve in the formation of at least four new chemical bonds, including sigma&#8208;, pi&#8208;bonds and C&#63743;H bond, in one reaction of enaminones, showing how the high&#8208;step economy is achieved in the enaminone&#8208;based synthetic reactions. Since the known results all involves in the cyclization, the contents of the current manuscript are divided into two main sections: the single cyclization reaction and bicyclic annulation reaction.

         <dc:description>The hitherto few explored &#945;&#8208;halomethyl amidine motif has been assembled through the addition of a lithiated (di)&#8208;halomethane (i.e. carbenoid) to easily accessible N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl substituted carbodiimides. Despite the inherent low electrophilicity of these heterocumulenes &#8211; as quantitatively determined in Mayr&#8217;s previous studies &#8211; their sp&#8208;hybridized carbon atom acts as a competent site of attack for these tamed nucleophiles. The overall high&#8208;yielding transformation featuring a genuine chemoselective profile &#8211; as documented by employing variously functionalized materials &#8211; is adaptable to the addition of dihalogenated carbenoids. Reaction products could be advantageously employed in nucleophilic substitution sequences, as well as, in further functionalization of the nitrogen atoms due to the constitutive heteroallyl&#8208;type skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>eAmidation: An Electrochemical Amidation of Aldehydes via the Oxidation of N&#8208;Aryl Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the use of electrochemistry has emerged as a powerful yet sustainable means of enabling key transformations. Amidation is one of the most frequently executed transformations in synthetic chemistry, and using an electrochemical approach, the current study has demonstrated the synthesis of amides from aldehydes and amines. Mechanistic work indicates that the reaction proceeds via the oxidation of an intermediate hydrazone to generate an acyl diazene as the acylating species. The protocol developed has enabled the synthesis of a broad range of amides, including access to pharmaceutically relevant products, directly from aldehydes without recourse for hazardous chemical oxidants and activating agents.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the use of electrochemistry has emerged as a powerful yet sustainable means of enabling key transformations. Amidation is one of the most frequently executed transformations in synthetic chemistry, and using an electrochemical approach, the current study has demonstrated the synthesis of amides from aldehydes and amines. Mechanistic work indicates that the reaction proceeds via the oxidation of an intermediate hydrazone to generate an acyl diazene as the acylating species. The protocol developed has enabled the synthesis of a broad range of amides, including access to pharmaceutically relevant products, directly from aldehydes without recourse for hazardous chemical oxidants and activating agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand controlled regio&#8208;divergent [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of alkynes by merging electrochemistry and nickel catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions between three alkynes, a diyne and an alkyne, or a triyne offer a straightforward and typical protocol toward all kinds of polysubstituted benzens. Herein, the synthesis of polysubstituted aromatics through electrochemical nickel catalyzed cyclotrimerization of alkynes is developed. The regio&#8208;divergent cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes was achieved by judicious choice of ligands. And tributylphosphine, sterically hindered bipyridine or &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands delivered 1,2,4&#8208; and 1,3,5&#8208;substituted aromatics with high regioselectivities respectively. Besides, the semi&#8208;intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between	diynes and alkynes are also amenable under this catalytic system. This approach operates without metal reductant, exhibits wide functional groups tolerance, ease of scalability and furnishes 75 examples with moderate to good yields, including some biorelevant compounds. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculation revealed the catalytic pathways of 1,3,5&#8208; and 1,2,4&#8208;cyclotrimerizations, and the origin of the ligand controlled regioselectivity.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydration reactions of diynes to access tetrasubstituted cyclohexenones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;carboalkoxy&#8208;3&#8208;substituted&#8208;cyclohexenones are powerful building blocks for the synthesis of a variety of bioactive target molecules. Their preparations requires multi&#8208;steps sequence involving the use of stoichiometric quantities of various reagents, while the catalytic approaches are limitited to trisubstituted cyclohexenones. We describe here an efficient catalytic approach based on gold(I)&#8208;catalysis starting from unsymmetrical diynyl mono&#8208;ester or symmetrical diynyl di&#8208;ester substrates. The carbon chain linking the two alkyne functions can bear two or one substituent, or even be unsubstituted. Regardless of the nature of the substrates and independently of its substitution, the cyclohexenone derivatives are cleanly produced.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(II) complex dispersed in imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid: Recyclable catalyst system for regioselective and chemoselective hydrobromination and hydrochlorination of alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a recyclable catalyst system combining Cu(II)O and 4,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline in a 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid for the hydrohalogenation of alkynes. The reaction efficiently yields alkenyl bromides and chlorides with good functional group tolerance and regioselectivity across a range of functionalized alkynes. Remarkably, the reaction exhibits unprecedented chemoselectivity for alkyne over alkenes in polyenynes and enables late&#8208;stage modifications to rapidly synthesize brominated polyenes. The catalyst system could be recycled for up to six runs without significant reduction of the reaction yield.</dc:description>

         <title>SuFEx reactions when shaken not stirred
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Click reactions display many of the goals desired for more sustainable chemical
conversions.  Yet, the solvent used is an often overlooked aspect in determining the
environmental impact of reactions. In the current paper we develop the first
mechanochemical method for the efficient and solvent&#8208;free SuFEx reaction of sulfonyl
fluorides with a wide range of phenols.  After outlining the optimization process, which
yields an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use and robust method, we provide indications of the very wide
scope of this approach, and demonstrate this potential via the application to a range of
natural phenols that also display other functionalities, and several gram&#8208;scale
syntheses.</dc:description>
