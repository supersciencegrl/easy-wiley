         <title>Organophotocatalyzed C&#8722;Si Bond Fragmentation Using Silyl Ethers as Radical Precursors</title>

Abstract
In this work, silyl ethers of phenols and alcohols have been successfully prepared and tested as neutral carbon (silicon) centered radical precursors. The organophotocatalyzed oxidation (by the Fukuzumi catalyst) of these ethers caused the cleavage of a C&#8722;Si (or a Si&#8722;Si) bond for the release of the desired radical to be used for the forging of C(sp3) &#8722;C(sp3) (or C(sp3) &#8722;Si) bonds via a Giese reaction.

         <title>Biocatalytic Recycling Cascades Combining Aldolases and Transaminases for the Stereo&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>

Abstract
Recycling cascades combining aldolases and transaminases from biodiversity were designed for the stereoselective synthesis of various isomers of &#947;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids. Aldolases with opposite enantioselectivities were combined with a d&#8208;&#945;&#8208;transaminase to prepare in a single step, d&#8208;syn or d&#8208;anti&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyglutamic acid with high yield and stereoselectivity. Bioactive (2S,3R,4S)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;isoleucine was also efficiently prepared via an aldolase&#8208;transaminase recycling cascade. In that case, the unexpected high stereoselectivity was shown to result from the thermodynamically&#8208;driven formation of a stable derivative of the product. This novel approach was applied to the synthesis of l&#8208;syn and d&#8208;syn&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxynorvaline as well as for 3 new &#946;&#8208;branched&#8208;&#947;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids, analogues of 4&#8208;hydroxyisoleucine.

Abstract
It remains a challenge to achieve regioselectivity and stereoselectivity in the synthesis of dihydropyranone derivatives. Herein, an Ir/Pd&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative allylic (amino)ketalization was disclosed to prepare dihydropyranone derivatives in regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities under mild conditions, resulting in O&#8208; and N&#8208;allylative products. It provided a strategy for the post&#8208;modifications of dihydropyranone derivatives.

Abstract
Complexes cis&#8208;[Pd(ArF)2(NCMe)2] (A) and cis&#8208;[Pd(ArF)2(THF)2] (B) (ArF=C6F3H2) are fast general precursors easy to prepare, store and handle, which allow in&#8197;situ synthesis of tailor&#8208;made [Pd(Ar)(X)(L)] catalysts for chosen Ar&#8208;Nu couplings, provided that the L ligand (in this case PR2(2&#8208;biaryl)) induces (ArF)2 coupling. This fluorinated byproduct is inert in the reaction conditions, and no other byproduct is expected because the Ar and X groups are the same in the catalyst, the intermediates and the products. The application of A or B in catalysis (e.&#8201;g. with 1% catalyst) consists of a first step (formation of 1% tailor&#8208;made catalyst) where 100 ArX+1&#8197;A (or B)+1&#8197;L in THF gives a solution with 99 ArX+1 [Pd(Ar)(X)(L)]+(ArF)2. The only other byproduct is THF or NCMe. In the second step, addition of the nucleophile, 100 Q(Nu), triggers and completes the catalytic cycle yielding 100 Ar&#8208;Nu+100 Q(X)+1 [Pd0(L)]. The 100% yield is theoretical, but the tested catalysis (Ar&#8208;Me Negishi coupling, C6F5&#8208;alkynyl Stille coupling and Ar&#8208;naphthyl Suzuki coupling) using A as precursor, SPhos as ligand, and 1000:1 reagents:catalyst ratio, afford 95&#8211;99% yield. In contrast, aryl&#8208;amination requires 1000:5 ratio to give 96% yield (or 1000:50 for 99% yield) because PhNH2 eventually displaces the SPhos from Pd and blocks the catalyst. As a bonus, the presence of F in the precursors facilitates stepwise 19F NMR monitoring of the formation of [Pd(Ar)(X)(L)] with different phosphines, facilitating analysis of weaknesses or strengths of each of them to produce the catalyst, and helps in the choice of the most convenient one for the case. The in&#8197;situ catalyst formation is ideal for serial two&#8208;step catalysis with different phosphines or different nucleophiles.

Abstract
The biocatalytic oxidative deamination&#8208; reductive amination process for the production of L&#8208;phosphinothricin (L&#8208;PPT) from D,L&#8208;phosphinothricin (D,L&#8208;PPT) is a green and environmentally friendly approach with significant development potential. In this study, the adopted technological route involves the oxidative deamination of the D&#8208;PPT component in D,L&#8208;PPT to 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)butanoic acid (PPO) by utilizing D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAAO), followed by the catalytic reductive amination of PPO to L&#8208;PPT using phosphinothricin dehydrogenase (PpDH). In order to enhance the catalytic rate and reduce the inhibitory effect of the intermediate product PPO on the catalytic process, optimization of both oxidative deamination and reductive amination phases was conducted through separate strategies of constant&#8208;pressure oxygen supply and substrate feeding, respectively. A &#8220;two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot&#8221; method was employed to link the optimized reactions, significantly shortening the production time. Furthermore, the &#8220;two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot&#8221; catalytic strategy was optimized, ultimately achieving a high 97.7% yield of L&#8208;PPT with ee of L&#8208;PPT&gt;99.9% after 5.5&#8197;h of reaction under 800&#8197;mM D,L&#8208;PPT catalytic conditions, D&#8208;PPT and PPO could not bedetected in the reaction system, further enchanced the catalytic efficiency, production efficiency and product quality. The aforementioned results demonstrate that this proposed approach has great potential for industrial&#8208;scale production of L&#8208;PPT as well as significant competitive advantages in terms of economic feasibility.

Abstract
We disclose herein a triflic acid and silane&#8208;promoted reductive deoxygenative transformation of ketoacid/esters for the divergent synthesis of different&#8208;sized lactones, which hold substantial significance in pharmaceutical and natural product chemistry. Owing to the simple reaction conditions and setup, this protocol features broad substrate generality, scalability, and good functional group tolerance, including late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical compounds and natural products. The control experiments and detailed NMR study provide insight into the reaction mechanism.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed annulation of enaminones with maleimides was developed to synthesize various pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;e]isoindoles. In this strategy, 2&#8208;aminopyridine served as a traceless directing group, and target products were obtained in 54&#8211;72% yields. Moreover, a plausible mechanism for this reaction was proposed based on several control experiments, deuterium exchange experiments, and previous reports.

Abstract
Our study introduces a streamlined oxidative method for synthesizing 1,3&#8208;diarylphenanthro[9,10&#8208;c]thiophenes, and their subsequent oxidative cleavage to yield 9,10&#8208;diaroylphenanthrenes. Harnessing an optimized aerobic photochemical transformation, we showcase broad substrate scope and tolerance to various photosensitive functional groups. Our mechanistic investigations unveil the pivotal role of singlet oxygen, providing intriguing insights into the reaction pathway. The synthesized 9,10&#8208;diaroylphenanthrenes serve as versatile building blocks for nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, dibenzoannulated phthalazines, that are promising compounds with diverse functionalities. Offering mild conditions, and broad applicability, our synthetic strategy is useful for organic synthesis and chemical biology exploration.

Abstract
Here we report a transition metal&#8211; and oxidant&#8211;free annulation cascade method for the synthesis of chromeno&#8211;isoxazoles. The annulation reaction involves easily accessible starting materials, 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2H&#8208;chromene and &#945;&#8208;chloro aldehyde, yielding the structurally intriguing framework, chromeno[3,4&#8208;c]isoxazoles employed by tripotassium phosphate as a base. The isoxazole ring construction over the 2H&#8211;chromene unit is believed to occur via a series of multiple reaction sequences. Here, the enolate generation/Michael addition/C&#8722;Cl bond cleavage/oxy&#8211;anionic addition to reactive tethered&#8208;aldehyde/deformylation via retro&#8211;C&#8722;C and N&#8722;O bond cleavages are the most possible sequences which furnish the desired end&#8211;product in good chemical yields. The multiple reaction sequences occur in one&#8208;pot at mild conditions, supported by experimental results and a few control experiments including DFT studies. This process exhibits a broad substrates scope illustrating good functional group compatibility towards both the nitrochromenes and aldehydes, and thus prove to be a general and efficient protocol for the synthesis of chromeno[3,4&#8211;c]isoxazoles. Overall, the use of nitrochromene as the limiting reagent, noteworthy functional group tolerance, scalability including great applications like chiral pool strategy towards the synthesis of enantioenriched chromeno&#8208;isoxazole are the additional features.

Abstract
Site&#8208;selective amination of N&#8208;heterocycles is an interesting topic in organic synthesis and drug discovery. We herein present a method for the vicarious&#8208;type nucleophilic amination of azine N&#8208;oxides and cyclic iminoamides using iminyl anions, readily generated from organic azides under basic conditions. The plausible reaction mechanism involving nucleophilic aromatic substitution by iminyl anions is elucidated by a series of mechanistic investigations.

Abstract
Organic electrosynthesis has become a green, efficient and sustainable alternative to traditional organic transformation for the redox reactions. In this connection, indirect electrolysis employing redox mediators is attaining increasing significance as it offers a chance to improve reaction selectivity and avoids the over&#8208;oxidation/reduction issues encountered in direct electrolysis. Triarylamines and triarylimidazoles, as representative organic molecular mediators, have attracted widespread attention in recent years due to the advantages of well&#8208;defined easy structural modification and tunable redox ability. Hence, in this minireview, the recent growth of triarylamine and triarylimidazole derivatives mediated electrochemical oxidation reactions were presented, highlighting the structural optimization, electrochemical performance and reaction mechanism of these organic mediators. Moreover, the photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic cases with these molecular mediators were also highlighted. To conclude, the current challenges and future prospects of this field are also discussed.

Abstract
C&#8722;H activation represents an interesting alternative to conventional cross&#8208;coupling methods, avoiding the requirement of additional steps to introduce activating groups. Generally, Pd&#8208;catalyzed reactions have been extensively employed for C&#8722;H activation. The high cost and limited availability of resources of Pd have prompted us to explore alternative transition metals. In this context, researchers are turning to Earth Abundant Metals (EAMs) like manganese and iron for their potential in C&#8722;H activation. Significant progress has been made in manganese&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H activation in recent years, showcasing excellent specificity, environmental compatibility, and versatility across different substrates.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C&#8722;H activation represents an interesting alternative to conventional cross-coupling methods, avoiding the requirement of additional steps to introduce activating groups. Generally, Pd-catalyzed reactions have been extensively employed for C&#8722;H activation. The high cost and limited availability of resources of Pd have prompted us to explore alternative transition metals. In this context, researchers are turning to Earth Abundant Metals (EAMs) like manganese and iron for their potential in C&#8722;H activation. Significant progress has been made in manganese-catalysed C&#8722;H activation in recent years, showcasing excellent specificity, environmental compatibility, and versatility across different substrates. This review summarises approximately 50 recent publications highlighting significant advancements in this field from 2020 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
The rapid development of photo&#8208;synergistic transition metal catalytic systems has provided a green paradigm to complement thermal transition metal catalytic methods. However, the most commonly used iridium or ruthenium complexes involve expensive in nature, in contrast to the abundant copper elements in the earth's crust, which are highly valued for their unique electronic structure and light&#8208;absorbing properties. Recently, the application of copper and photocatalytic synergistic strategies in radical cyclization reactions has progressed considerably, leading to a renaissance in the synthesis of functional natural products, drugs and their analogues, but summary work addressing this aspect has not been reported. In this review, we briefly analyze the effect of ligand choice on copper complexes and some inorganic copper salts and even on light sources. We then summarize the copper and photocatalytic synergistic strategies in radical cyclization reactions and classify them into three categories, C, N and O radicals, according to the class of the central atom of the radical in each work, and in each category will be elaborated in turn from coordination cyclization via Cu catalysts, direct radical cyclization and other cyclization mode. For individual more complex reactions, the mechanisms are explored and briefly discussed.

Abstract
Chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds are key structures in natural compounds and pharmaceuticals, and they serve as essential building blocks of functional materials. Catalytic asymmetric cycloaddition reactions represent one of the most efficient synthetic strategies for constructing optically active heterocycles. Cyclic sulfamidate imines have recently come to be extensively studied and widely utilized in both organocatalytic and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions, where they have been shown to provide various N&#8208;fused&#8208;heterocycles and spiro&#8208;cycles exhibiting high efficiencies with excellent stereoselectivities. This review highlights recent advancements in catalytic asymmetric cycloadditions of cyclic sulfamidate imines for the stereoselective synthesis of biologically active sulfamidate&#8208;containing heterocycles since 2012 while focusing on the diverse reactivities of cyclic sulfamidate imines and the mechanisms of chiral induction in catalysis.

         <title>Emerging Advances of the Radical Pathway Glycosylation Enabled by Bench&#8208;Stable Glycosyl Donors: Glycosyl Sulfoxides, Glycosyl Sulfones, and Glycosyl Sulfinates</title>

Abstract
In synthetic carbohydrate chemistry, the modification of glycosyl radicals pathway stands as a central area of focus. The radical&#8208;based reactions often demonstrate remarkable compatibility with various functional groups owing to the mild initiation conditions. In particular, the identification of novel glycosyl radical precursors, combined with advanced reaction techniques, has substantially broadened the scope of glycosyl compound synthesis. Despite the presence of versatile donors, the synthesis of noble donors is still addressed as a synthetic need and challenges associated with sugar chemistry. Currently, a new class of glycosyl radical precursors has been developed which enables the production of C&#8208;, S&#8208;, O&#8208;, and N&#8208;glycosides efficiently. In this light, we highlight strategies towards bench&#8208;stable glycosyl sulfoxides, sulphone, and sulfite donors that can enable the site&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective transformation of protected or naked sugar synthons in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry. Here, this review article covers the recent developments in the selective glycosyl radical diversification such as glycosyl alkylation, arylation, alkenylation, sulfuration, C&#8722;H activation, and DNA conjugation via the bench&#8208;stable donors along with mechanistic aspects, challenges, and future directions.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed [4+4] cycloaddition of aryl&#8208;substituted &#947;&#8208;methylidene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactones (GMDVs) with divinylketones (DVKs) was developed, providing an approach to access various mono&#8208;cyclic tetrahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;oxocines with diverse substituents in 41% to 95% yield with 81:19 to &gt;20:1 dr. This reaction was facilitated by anchoring olefin (C=C), carbonyl (C=O), and arene (Ar) at the &#945;&#8208;position of carbonyls.

Abstract
A copper catalyzed aerobic formal addition of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds to alkenes via a phenyl radical mediated intermolecular HAT process is reported herein, in which the phenylhydrazine not only acts as a HAT reagent precursor, but also as a hydrogen atom donor. This reaction affords an alternative method for the direct formal addition of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds to alkenes utilizing air as the radical initiator without additional reductants at ambient temperature. A variety of alkanes and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes are successfully incorporated, furnishing a series of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H formal addition products in 20&#8211;93% yield. Preliminary mechanistic studies show that the 2&#8208;tetrahydrofuranyl and phenyl radical are formed in this reaction.

Abstract
We reported a one&#8208;pot photocyclization/ oxidation cascade of N&#8208;aryl acrylamides to afford quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones. Thioxanthone was used as a bifunctional energy transfer agent to mediate both photocyclization and generation of singlet oxygen, the latter facilitates the dehydrogenation of dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;one intermediate. This cascade strategy also supports the 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization to synthesize tetrahydrocarbazolones from phenylamino cyclohexenones.

Abstract
A catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free one&#8208;step protocol for synthesizing thiazolines and thiazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, utilizing the annulative coupling between &#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxonium ylides and &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides has been described. The dual functionalization of &#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxonium ylides through S&#8208;alkylation and intramolecular N&#8208;cyclization leads to the generation of both C&#8722;S and C&#8722;N bonds. The developed synthetic methods facilitate the synthesis of diverse functionalized thiazolines and thiazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives, validated through large&#8208;scale reactions.

Abstract
A domino sequence consisting of a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed Doyle&#8208;Kirmse rearrangement followed by a Claisen&#8208;thioimidate rearrangement has been developed. This type of thio&#8208;Claisen rearrangement represents the first example reported in the homoallenylsulfenyl series. The sequence involves 2&#8208;propargylsulfenyl benzazoles and diazoesters, affording N&#8208;butadienyl substituted benzazole&#8208;2&#8208;thiones as a mixture of Z and E isomers, in yields ranging from 12% to quantitative (32 examples). The method provides a rapid access to a new family of highly substituted polyfunctionalized 2&#8208;aminobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes with potential synthetic applications.

Abstract
The synthesis of substituted 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;b]indazoles from 3&#8208;aminoindazoles and ketones has been established. It involves one molecule of 3&#8208;aminoindazoles and two molecules of ketones via a [3+2+1] three&#8208;component annulation process. 3&#8208;Oxo&#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;b]indazoles exhibit strong yellow fluorescence in various solvents. A wide range of products have anti&#8208;oxidant activities. Cytotoxicity studies indicate that compounds 3&#8201;a, 3&#8201;aa and 3&#8201;ab have obvious effects on both HCT116 and A549 cancer cell lines.

Abstract
A synthesis of acyl halides from the corresponding carboxylic acid thioesters was achieved using commercially available Selectfluor or NCS, and the acyl fluoride or chloride intermediates were transformed to the corresponding esters, amides, and several carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation products. This approach can be applied to the peptide synthesis from functionalized amino acid thioesters.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrosynthesis of selenylated&#8208;oxazolone derivatives via cascade selenylation/cyclization of ynamides was disclosed. A series of diaryl diselenides, dialkyl diselenides, and heteroaryl&#8208;substituted ynamides was tolerated in this protocol and delivered 4&#8208;selenyloxazolones in 28&#8208;83% yield. The scale&#8208;up reaction and the oxidation of selenylated&#8208;oxazolones was performed to showcase the practicability of this method. Furthermore, mechanistic experiments indicated that a cationic pathway instead of aradical pathway was probably involved.</dc:description>

         <title>Introduction of Phosphinine Ring into Aromatic Systems via Alkyne Cyclization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently developed synthetic protocols for the preparation of &#955;3&#8208;phosphanaphthalenes have broadened the general scope of organophosphorus chemistry, but a versatile protocol is still missing. Here, we describe a scalable synthetic approach for the construction of various substituted phosphanaphthalenes. We have obtained 11 derivatives through rigorous study and have demonstrated the robustness of this method. The optical properties of these phosphorus compounds and their aza and carbo analogues have been experimentally compared. Here, we show the power of the method in extending the synthesis to even larger polycyclic aromatic systems with embedded phosphine rings toward its potential applicability to materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of Sulfamoyl Radicals via Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Fixation of Sulfur Dioxide for the Synthesis of Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Herein, we report a new approach for the light&#8208;mediated generation of sulfamoyl radicals using sulfur dioxide as key building block and the direct application of these radicals in the synthesis of sulfonamides. In the presence of different photoredox catalysts, sulfamoyl radicals can be generated directly from SO2 or the SO2 surrogate DABSO (1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane&#183;bis (sulfur dioxide) adduct) and N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts as nitrogen radical precursors. Trapping of the in situ generated sulfamoyl radicals with selected electron&#8208;rich olefins affords different sulfonamides in up to 86% yield in a three&#8208;component procedure. This transformation provides an attractive and complementary approach for the in situ generation of sulfamoyl radicals as synthetic intermediates for the assembly of the sulfonamide functionality, a motif in active pharmaceutical ingredients.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This opinionated review underlines the increasing production of 1,3&#8208;propanediol (1,3&#8208;PDO) by whole cell biocatalytic fermentation of biomass and highlights how production has transitioned from petrochemicals to bio&#8208;renewables. Current uses of 1,3&#8208;PDO are listed. Some future prospects for evolving the current technology and expanding the chemical uses of 1,3&#8208;PDO use are discussed, with emphasis on catalytic and atom efficient chemistries. Lessons from the success of biomass derived 1,3&#8208;PDO are noted that may be applied to other bio&#8208;based organic platform chemicals.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of indolizine derivatives was achieved through the reaction of pyridinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates with a diverse array of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;nitro&#8208;3&#8208;aryloxiranes. Subsequent investigations unveiled a synthetic route to indolizines via a stepwise [(5 + 1) &#8208; 1] pathway, with unstable pyridothiazines serving as transient intermediates. DFT calculations elucidated that this transformation entails sequential annulation, deacylation, desulfurization, and oxidation steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Electrochemical Functionalization of Imidazoheterocycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imidazoheterocycles have extensive applications in the pharmaceutical industry and agrochemicals. A comprehensive overview has been provided on the current advancements in electrochemical functionalization, which has been classified ten different types of reactions. Electrochemical synthesis has emerged as a highly effective method for producing organic molecules, especially in the context of sustainable development. Employing electrons as the traceless oxidant, several C&#8211;H functionalization reactions of imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycles have been achieved at either the C3 or C5 positions. Electrons may serve as the reducing agent to synthesize pyridine rings that are either partially or fully saturated in imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines. The purpose of the review is to attract the interest of the scientific community and promote additional research on the functionalization of imidazoheterocycles using electrochemical methods.</dc:description>

We propose a base&#8208;facilitated synthesis method of polysubstituted aromatic amines. A simple, rapid, plateau&#8208;utilization, and highly regioselective non&#8208;in&#8208;situ amination reaction was achieved by using aryl thianthrenium salt as the aryne precursor, and the arylynyl distortion induced by the substituents.

         <dc:description>The iron (&#1030;&#1030;&#1030;)&#8208;promoted tandem cyclization of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;(allyloxy)aryl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles with diselenides has been developed for the preparation of seleno&#8208;benzo[2,3][1,4]oxazepino[4,5&#8208;a]indole derivatives. The investigation to determine the best reaction conditions indicated the use of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;(allyloxy)aryl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles (0.2 mmol) with diselenides (1.5 equiv) and iron(III) chloride (1.5 equiv) in acetonitrile at room temperature under air, and more than 40 examples were obtained. The reaction features access to selenized 7&#8208;membered containing nitrogen&#8208;oxygen heterocyclic skeleton, which also represents a 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization process of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;((2&#8208;methylallyl)oxy)aryl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles and diselenides.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We disclose the intramolecular synthesis of 3&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;indazoles from 2&#8208;alkynylazobenzenes promoted by a dual catalysis using AuCl3 and a ruthenium photocatalyst under irradiation with visible light. This reaction goes through a hydroamination of the alkynyl fragment. The yields are governed by the electronic factors. Control experiments and DFT calculations suggest that a radical and polar mechanisms are operating in parallel. This transformation goes through first formation and C&#8208;N bond and 1,2&#8208;hydride shift. Derivatization was also carried out to extend the versatility of this methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Benzylation and Allylation of Six&#8208;Membered
Endocyclic Enecarbamates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Six&#8208;membered endocyclic benzyl/allyl enecarbamates undergo a Pd&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylation process to generate endocyclic 1&#8208;azaallyl anions and Pd&#8211;benzyl/allyl cations.  The ion pair then react with each other followed by reduction to ultimately give unprotected &#8208;2&#8208;(hetero)aryl&#8208;3&#8208;benzylpiperidines and 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl&#8208;3&#8208;allylpiperidines in 31&#8722;91% yields as single cis&#8208;diastereomers.  These reactions represent a strategy to form unprotected &#946;&#8208;substituted piperidines, which generates elusive endocyclic 1&#8208;azaallyl anion intermediates by introducing the negative charge from the N&#8208;terminal.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Construction of C(sp3)&#8208;Ge Bonds: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Germanium (Ge), a congener of carbon, possesses unique properties that hold extensive potential for applications across multiple domains. Recent years have seen significant progress in the development of carbon&#8208;germanium bond formation strategies, particularly those for more challenging C(sp3)&#8208;Ge bonds. This review systematically summarizes the recent advances in C(sp3)&#8208;Ge bond forming methodologies, with particular emphasis on (1) the versatility of transition&#8208;metals, including iron, nickel, copper, rhodium and palladium, as catalysts in broadening reaction scope and controlling selectivity; (2) the powerfulness of organic photocatalysis in achieving mild and selective bond formation, and (3) the sustainability of catalytic electrosynthesis in facilitating chemical oxidant&#8208;/reductant&#8208;free conversions. Additionally, examples of (4) non&#8208;catalytic strategies are also discussed. The representative scopes, as well as mechanistic proposals, of these protocols are highlighted. Through an overview on the current state of research, this review aims to offer insights into the catalytic construction of C(sp3)&#8208;Ge bonds, and provide perspectives on future research directions to address the current challenges.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Mediated Difluoroalkylation of Alkenes Using Mercaptobenzothiazole&#8208;Derived Sulfide Reagent</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A method for the reductive difluoromethylation of alkenes with 2&#8208;difluoromethylthio(benzothiazole) under photocatalytic conditions is described. The reaction involves the generation of the difluoromethyl radical by means of trimethyltriazinane, which serves as a precursor for the strongly reducing cyclic diaminoalkyl radical.

         <title>Radical Carbocyclization Intercepted Reductive C&#8722;C Bond Formation Between 1,n&#8208;Enynes or Dienes and Electron&#8208;Poor Olefins/Alkynes</title>

Abstract
Metal hydride catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) reaction of 1,6&#8208;enyne and electron&#8208;poor alkene progresses through a radical cascade, involving ene&#8208;yne cyclization and exocyclic C&#8722;C bond formation superseding the direct reductive olefin cross&#8208;coupling; which is realized in the current study. The generality of this reaction manifold is demonstrated with a range of functionalized 1,6&#8208;enyne and dienes and involving structurally distinct electron&#8208;poor olefins and alkynes as partners. Current work unveils a merger of MHAT&#8208;based olefin&#8208;hydro functionalization with radical ene&#8208;one cyclization.

Abstract
Formates are abundantly available and inexpensive commodity chemical, widely used in laboratory and industrial organic synthesis. Formates are promising hydrogen carrier and green C1 source, and have also been a subject of research as SET reductants in recent years. Compared to the toxic and flammable gas carbon monoxide, which also serves as a C1 source, formates are easier to handle, store, and transport, and are more environmentally friendly. Therefore, in recent studies of radical reactions, formate is not only as an ideal source of green carbonyl, which is of great significance to synthesize carboxyl compounds with various structures, but also as a SET reductant for editing organic molecules either in scientific research or industrial production. The activation and conversion of formate, as a source of C1 or a SET reductant, is a very challenging and hot research field in organic synthesis.

         <title>Shaking Up the Friedl&#228;nder Reaction: Rapid, Scalable Mechanochemical Synthesis of Polyaryl&#8208;Substituted Quinolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Quinolines are ubiquitous heterocyclic aromatic scaffolds, which can be found in many natural and synthetic products. They are highly valued for their pharmacological and electrochemical properties, encouraging the discovery of new routes for quinoline synthesis and diversification. In particular, polyaryl&#8208;substituted quinolines have recently surged as useful substrates for a wide variety of applications, yet their synthetic routes remain difficult and inefficient. Herein, we report a rapid and novel mechanochemical Friedl&#228;nder synthesis of polyaryl&#8208;substituted quinolines under basic conditions using ball milling. The optimized reaction conditions resulted in moderate to excellent yields ranging from 48% to &gt;95% and demonstrated broad functional group tolerance at 1&#8197;hour reaction times. We further show a new route for the synthesis of photocatalyst DPQN2,4&#8722;di&#8722;OMe and photo&#8208;ligand PPQN2,4&#8722;di&#8722;OMe as well as OLED donor&#8208;acceptor pCzPPQ, electron transport material oligoquinoline TQB and organic semiconductor DPA. A gram scale reaction was also achieved using Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM), providing an isolated yield of 87% after a simple recrystallization in ethanol.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling between Alkylidenecyclopropanes and Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The combination of a Pd(0) source and a phosphoramidite ligand promotes a formal allylic cross&#8208;coupling between alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) and boronic acids to yield synthetically appealing 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes. Remarkably, the reaction proceeds both under neutral and basic conditions, and works with both aryl&#8208; and alkenylboronic acids. DFT calculations suggest that the reaction entails a C&#8722;C activation/protonation mechanism instead of a hydropalladation pathway, which has been frequently proposed for other metal&#8208;promoted hydrofunctionalizations of ACPs.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Directing&#8208;Group&#8208;Mediated &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Glycosylation for Synthesis of C&#8208;Alkyl Glycosides</title>

Abstract
C&#8208;alkyl glycosides play a crucial role in various bioactive compounds. However, the synthesis of C&#8208;alkyl glycosides poses significant challenges, particularly through C(sp3)&#8722;H glycosylation. Here, we report a set of reactions for constructing C&#8208;alkyl glycosides through directing&#8208;group&#8208;mediated functionalization of unactivated &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds under mild conditions. These reactions not only achieve high regioselectivity and stereoselectivity in glycosylation, but also exhibit a wide substrate scope. They are compatible with both arene and alkane substrates, as well as natural and unnatural amino acid substrates. Mechanistic studies have shown that the directing&#8208;group 8&#8208;aminoquinoline (AQ) and picolinamide (PA) may affect the chirality of the &#946;&#8208;carbon of L&#8208;valine through a sterically favorable trans&#8208;palladacycle intermediate, resulting in (R) or (S) configuration of glycosylated amino acid, respectively. These reactions are promising to provide a convenient and powerful tool for constructing C&#8208;alkyl glycosides and carbohydrate&#8208;based drugs in the future.

Abstract
A copper or silver&#8208;catalyzed cascade addition/5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization/isomerization reaction of isothiocyanate with ynone has been developed. This strategy enables the synthesis of a variety of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene&#8208;5&#8208;aminothiophen&#8208;3&#8208;one derivatives with diverse substitutions in a single vessel. The method is featured with pot&#8208;economy as well as regio&#8208; and Z&#8208;selectivity. Several biologically active molecules could be modified using this strategy. Moreover, the relevant indole&#8208;fused and indole&#8208;substituted thiophenone derivatives were also assembled in one pot by merging this strategy with other bond formation methods. Based on the experiments and the related reports, a cascade pathway triggered by the addition of ynone&#8208;derived radical towards the C(sp)&#8208;atom of isothiocyanate was proposed to elucidate the probable process of the transformation.

         <dc:description>Organocatalytic dearomatization of &#946;&#8208;naphthols has been achieved via an 1,6&#8208;conjugated addition of 2&#8208;naphthols to alkynyl 7&#8208;methylene&#8208;7H&#8208;indoles in situ generated from &#945;&#8208;(7&#8208;indolyl)methanols. In the presence of racemic phosphoric acid, a series of tetrasubstituted allenes was obtained in high yields.

Abstract
Scarce dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazinoisoindole framework bearing two points of diversity was prepared through a cascade process based on concomitant Csp3&#8722;N and Csp2&#8722;N bond formation. This approach consists of an amidation in basic medium of a tosyl group by nucleophilic substitution followed by Cu&#8208;mediated Goldberg reaction in the same operation. The required &#946;&#8208;bromoenamide bearing a tosyl group was obtained by tosylation of fused brominated N,O&#8208;acetals for the first time in acidic medium using submolar amounts of PTSA. The obtained piperazines are useful building blocks as illustrated by the formation of a pentacyclic product via the intramolecular interception of the enamide function.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Synthesis of Substituted Azepines by Gold/Magnesium Orthogonal&#8208;Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A three&#8208;component one&#8208;pot synthesis of substituted azepines was realized by gold/magnesium orthogonal relay catalysis. The one&#8208;pot synthesis involves simply mixing and heating propiolates, imines, and activated cyclopropanes to initiate a gold&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;enyne metathesis between propiolates and imines, followed by a magnesium&#8208;catalyzed [4+3] cycloaddition reaction of the resultant 1&#8208;azabutadienes and the cyclopropanes, yielding substituted azepines. The substituted azepines including 22 derivatives could be successfully prepared in good to excellent yield (61&#8211;95%). The reaction was also conducted on one&#8208;gram scale.

         <title>1&#8208;Alkynylphosphorus Compounds in Organic Synthesis, 2010&#8211;2024</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Since the review of Yorimitsu and Oshima in 2010, the past 15&#8197;years have witnessed significant progresses in the application of 1&#8208;alkynylphosphorus compounds in organic synthesis. Owing to the reactive carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond in association with the electron&#8208;withdrawing phosphoryl group, they easily undergo transition metal&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic addition reactions at the &#946;&#8208;position with carbon&#8208; and heteroatom&#8208;based nucleophiles to afford structurally diverse 1&#8208;alkenyl phosphorus compounds. Especially, when 1&#8208;alkynylphosphonates or phosphinates are used, intramolecular substitution reactions on P&#8208;atom might occur in some cases, which would result in the formation of P&#8208;based heterocycles. In addition, the existing triple bond makes them prone to go through addition reaction initiated cyclization reactions and [2+2], [2+3], [2+4], [2+5] and [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions with other unsaturated bonds, which provides an efficient access to various P&#8208;based heterocycles and phosphorylated carbon&#8208; and heterocycles.

         <title>Synthesis and HHDH&#8208;Catalyzed Kinetic Resolution of Propargylic Epoxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The versatile reactivity of propargylic epoxides and alcohols, due to the presence of a triple bond, is used in the synthesis of various organic compounds and building blocks. However, there are not many known methods for the preparation of optically pure propargylic epoxides and alcohols, and the existing ones often require specific reagents. Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) can be used to obtain enantiomerically pure compounds from racemic epoxides. These important biocatalysts facilitate epoxide ring&#8208;opening reactions with unnatural nucleophiles such as azides. Here we report the biocatalytic transformation of propargylic epoxides using HHDHs. Six propargylic epoxides with different substituents were synthesized. Kinetic resolution reactions catalyzed by HHDHs in the presence of azide were performed. Two enzymes with opposite stereoselectivities, HheC and HheA2&#8208;N178A were used and yielded azido alcohols (98&#8211;&gt;99% ee, E&#8208;value &gt;200) and epoxides (29&#8211;88% ee). The best performing p&#8208;tolyl propargylic epoxide derivative was used in a sequence of two enzymatic reactions to obtain both enantiomers of the &#946;&#8208;azido alcohol and the (R)&#8208;enantiomer of the &#945;&#8208;azido alcohol, each in &gt;99% ee, through complete conversion of the starting epoxide. The obtained azido alcohols were used in further transformations. The click reactions with terminal acetylenes gave triazolyl propargylic alcohols (&gt;99% ee, 90&#8211;98% yield). In the case of the &#945;&#8208;azido alcohol, the click reaction was followed by intramolecular cyclization to form the dihydrofuranyl triazole motif that is found in biologically active compounds.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The versatile reactivity of propargylic epoxides and alcohols, due to the presence of a triple bond, is used in the synthesis of various organic compounds and building blocks. However, there are not many known methods for the preparation of optically pure propargylic epoxides and alcohols, and the existing ones often require specific reagents. Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) can be used to obtain enantiomerically pure compounds from racemic epoxides. These important biocatalysts facilitate epoxide ring-opening reactions with unnatural nucleophiles such as azides. Here we report the biocatalytic transformation of propargylic epoxides using HHDHs. Six propargylic epoxides with different substituents were synthesized. Kinetic resolution reactions catalyzed by HHDHs in the presence of azide were performed. Two enzymes with opposite stereoselectivities, HheC and HheA2-N178A were used and yielded azido alcohols (98&#8211;&amp;gt;99% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-value &amp;gt;200) and epoxides (29&#8211;88% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;). The best performing &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-tolyl propargylic epoxide derivative was used in a sequence of two enzymatic reactions to obtain both enantiomers of the &#946;-azido alcohol and the (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-enantiomer of the &#945;-azido alcohol, each in &amp;gt;99% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;, through complete conversion of the starting epoxide. The obtained azido alcohols were used in further transformations. The click reactions with terminal acetylenes gave triazolyl propargylic alcohols (&amp;gt;99% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;, 90&#8211;98% yield).

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Direct Decarboxylative Functionalization of Aromatic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Aryl radicals are important intermediates in organic synthesis. The generation of these reactive species via direct decarboxylation of inexpensive and readily available aromatic carboxylic acids is an attractive goal. However, such a process intrinsically exhibits high energy barriers to overcome, which in consequence usually require precious metal catalysis, stoichiometric oxidants and harsh conditions, suffering from limitations such as poor functional group tolerance and low atom economy. In recent years, photochemical reactions have provided new approaches to address this challenge. Three major strategies have been introduced in this emerging field: 1) one&#8208;pot in&#8208;situ activation of benzoic acids to generate intermediates such as benzoyl hypobromites or hypoiodites; 2) the use of specialized photocatalysts like biphenyl/1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene to promote decarboxylation through photo&#8208;induced electron transfer or charge transfer processes; 3) photo&#8208;induced LMCT (Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer) strategy where copper or iron salts coordinate to the carboxylate anion and generate aromatic radicals upon visible light excitation. On the basis of these three strategies, this review will systematically summarize the development of visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced direct decarboxylative functionalization of aromatic carboxylic acids, focusing on the reaction mechanism and substrate scope, and discuss their prospects in organic synthesis.

         <title>Construction of Spirocyclic Compounds via Electrochemical Intramolecular Dearomatization of Benzene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The spirocyclic framework is found in many natural products, some of which are biologically active. However, It remains a challenge to develop environmentally friendly and atom&#8208;economic synthetic methods. Herein, we report an intramolecular dearomatization reaction of benzene derivatives enabled by electrochemistry&#8208;mediated two successive single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer (SET) processes, providing an alternative method for the rapid construction of spirocyclic skeletons without using sacrificial reagents. A series of cyclohexadiene products were obtained in 25&#8211;81% yields. Furthermore, a proposed mechanism involving a sequential electron transfer event was supported by cyclic voltammetry experiments. This strategy features transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions and easy handling, which will greatly enhance its practical utility.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Multisubstituted Hydroindole Derivatives via [3+2] Annulations of p&#8208;Quinamines with Nitroalkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The synthesis of two stereoisomers of hydroindole derivatives was achieved through [3+2] annulations of p&#8208;quinamines with nitroalkenes. Catalyst&#8208;free or in the presence of DMAP, the annulation reactions were employed to produce the target products containing four contiguous stereogenic centers. This method enables the efficient construction of multisubstituted and functionalized hydroindole derivatives from readily accessible building blocks and reagents. Furthermore, the anti&#8208;inflammatory activity of some resulting hydroindoles was evaluated, with three derivative products showing effective inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

Abstract
A molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of N2,C3&#8208;disubstituted 2H&#8208;indazoles from readily available 2&#8208;acylazobenzenes via deoxygenation of C=O and annulation has been described. The non&#8208;noble metal catalytic system has good tolerance of functional groups, and various N2,C3&#8208;disubstituted 2H&#8208;indazoles have been constructed in 24% to 99% yield. This reaction is easy to scale&#8208;up and has shown its applications in deriving valuable fluorescent and bioactive compounds. The plausible mechanism shows the plausible processes of molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenative annulation.

         <title>Oxidation State and Halogen Influence on the NHC&#8208;Gold&#8208;Halide&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of Propargylic Amides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The homogeneously catalyzed cycloisomerization reaction of propargylic amides was tested as benchmark reaction for two homologous series of Au(I) and Au(III) complexes with NHC ligands. This reaction is known to afford either aromatic oxazoles or dihydrooxazoles, depending on the oxidation state of the applied gold catalysts. For this purpose, symmetric and unsymmetric NHC ligands with mixed alkyl or benzyl substituents (1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;imidazolyl&#8208;2yl or 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;imidazolyl&#8208;2&#8208;yl) and the corresponding Au(I) and Au(III) derivatives were prepared and characterized by analytical methods, IR and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies, and by X&#8208;ray diffraction methods. Ten NHC&#8208;gold(I) and NHC&#8208;gold(III) complexes were tested on the cyclization reactions by adding gold catalysts in the presence and absence of AgPF6. Noteworthy, only the 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;gold(III) trichloride was able to give selectively the aromatic oxazole without the addition of the silver salt. Interestingly, on contrary to what is reported in the literature, the use of gold(I) or gold(III) complexes does not influence the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reaction, while the halide bound to the metal does. In this regard, a mechanism purposing the dihydrooxazole as an intermediate for the formation of aromatic oxazole is proposed.

Abstract
Herein, we report a cost&#8208;effective synthesis of various multi&#8208;substituted pyridine derivatives, especially 2&#8208;aryl pyridines, using secondary alcohols and 1,3&#8208;diol as the primary feedstock with ammonium acetate serving as nitrogen donor, catalyzed by a new well&#8208;defined singlet mono&#8208;radical Ru(III)&#8208;catalyst featuring a cyclopentadienyl group, one PPh3, and a redox&#8208;active scaffold &#8722;N1&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine having a pendant &#8208;NH2 arm. The &#8208;NH2 arm of the catalyst facilitates the generation of the critical reactive intermediates by enhancing the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon center of the diols or diketones by forming hydrogen bonds, making it more catalytically effective over the similar other Ru&#8208;catalysts having no pendant &#8208;NH2 arm. The Ru&#8208;catalyst also functionalizes 2&#8208;aryl pyridine moieties with different coupling partners, such as aryl iodides, terminal alkynes, and styrene derivatives at the o&#8208;position of the phenyl ring.

Abstract
Photo&#8208;promoted cyanomethyl radical procedures for the preparation of 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;indenes and 2,8&#8208;dihydrocyclopenta[a]indenes from phenyl&#8208;linked 1,6&#8208;enynes with &#945;&#8208;halogenated acetonitriles are reported. The iodocyanomethylation/cyclization is performed via an atom&#8208;transfer radical addition (ATRA) strategy under photocatalyst&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. In particular, the photoinduced cyanomethylative cascade bicyclization is carried out under the fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3/Na2CO3 catalystic symtem and visible light irradiation. These methods offer a one&#8208;step and atom&#8208;economical access to diverse cyano&#8208;group containing five&#8208;membered rings with broad substrate scope and high selectivity. A plausible reaction mechanism is also proposed.

Abstract
Trimethyl phosphite promotes the synthesis of 2,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted 2H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. The protocol developed affords a two&#8208;step method towards triazoles from available reagents. 3,4&#8208;Disubstituted isoxazolones are initially coupled with diazonium tetrafluoroborates. The subsequent reaction is triggered by a single electron transfer from the phosphite to the diazenylisoxazolone under heating or blue LED irradiation at room temperature. The radical anion cascade proceeds via a ring opening/decarboxylation/cyclization sequence. The synthesized triazoles show promising fluorescence in the region from 340&#8197;nm to 450&#8197;nm with a quantum yield up to 81.6%. The emission energy depends slightly on the substituent nature at the triazole carbon atoms. If an electron&#8208;donor group is introduced into the N2 substituent of the triazole ring, it results in a bathochromic shift of the luminescence energy.

         <title>Tandem Electrochemical Redox/Condensation Reaction Between 2&#8208;Amino Nitrobenzenes and Aliphatic Alcohols: An Approach to Benzimidazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Tandem reactions via electrocatalytic annulations have emerged as a strategy for the construction of heterocycles. Herein, a two&#8208;component electrochemical annulation via sequential reduction, oxidation, and condensation steps to synthesize valuable benzimidazoles motifs is reported. This reaction, which utilizes electricity as both the oxidants and reductants, tolerates a broad range of functional groups. Detailed mechanistic studies including control experiments, cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis, and key reaction intermediate characterization, reveals an intermolecular electrochemical redox/cyclization pathway.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted site&#8208;selective difluoroalkoxylation of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines has been achieved using N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) as a fluorinating agent. This practical reaction has a wide range of substrate scope for both imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines and alcohols to give 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;arylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines in 65&#8211;93% yields. The reaction proceeded at room temperature, showed high functional group tolerance, and was amenable to scale&#8208;up. Based on mechanistic investigation, a radical pathway is proposed.

         <title>Enantiocomplementary Synthesis of Tetrahydrofurans by Engineered Halohydrin Dehalogenases</title>

Abstract
Chiral tetrahydrofurans are prevalent structural motifs in biologically active compounds, approved drugs and natural products, but relevant enantiocomplementary synthesis remains underdeveloped. In this study, wild type halohydrin dehalogenase HheC from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1, was first discovered to enable the intramolecular substitution of &#948;&#8208;halohydrins for the formation of tetrahydrofurans but with unsatisfied activity and stereoselectivity. Through structure&#8208;guided protein engineering, two completely enantiocomplementary variants T134M and P84L/W139A of HheC were obtained for the synthesis of tetrahydrofurans by the kinetic resolution of &#948;&#8208;halohydrins (both giving products with up to 99% e.e., E&gt;200). This research unveiled the halohydrin dehalogenases&#8217; catalytic ability to form chiral cyclic ethers larger ring size than three&#8208;membered epoxides, which has hitherto been unexplored, and provided an enzymatic synthesis access to valuably enantiocomplementary tetrahydrofurans.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral tetrahydrofurans are prevalent structural motifs in biologically active compounds, approved drugs and natural products, but relevant enantiocomplementary synthesis remains underdeveloped. In this study, wild type halohydrin dehalogenase HheC from &lt;i&gt;Agrobacterium radiobacter&lt;/i&gt; AD1, was first discovered to enable the intramolecular substitution of &#948;-halohydrins for the formation of tetrahydrofurans but with unsatisfied activity and stereoselectivity. Through structure-guided protein engineering, two completely enantiocomplementary variants T134M and P84L/W139A of HheC were obtained for the synthesis of tetrahydrofurans by the kinetic resolution of &#948;-halohydrins (both giving products with up to 99% e.e., E&amp;gt;200). This research unveiled the halohydrin dehalogenases&#8217; catalytic ability to form chiral cyclic ethers larger ring size than three-membered epoxides, which has hitherto been unexplored, and provided an enzymatic synthesis access to valuably enantiocomplementary tetrahydrofurans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrofluoroether Synthesis through One&#8208;Pot Anodic Iodoalkoxylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of carbon&#8208;fluorine bonds can profoundly influence the chemical and physical properties of drugs, agrochemicals, and materials. Different methods allow the installation of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H units and C&#8211;F bonds including trifluoro&#8208; and difluoromethoxylations, reflecting the limited diversity of reactions available to synthetic chemists. We introduce the trifluoroethoxy group through an electro&#8208;oxidative iodination of alkenes as a versatile substituent for fluorine chemists. An iodoarene serves as an unusual iodine source facilitating the 1,2&#8208;iodoalkoxylation of a broad range of industrially relevant aliphatic alkenes in high yields (31&#8211;98%) showing high Markovnikov regioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Fe(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Hydroamination of 1,3&#8208;Dienes Improved by Using Triphenylphosphate as an Additive</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report that the combination of Fe(OTf)3 and triphenylphosphate (TPP, (PhO)3PO) has proven to be an effective catalyst for the intramolecular hydroamination of amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes with an efficiency and scope superior to previously reported methods. This catalytic system demonstrated consistent performance with diverse aminodienes as well as aminoolefins, providing five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles. We propose a Lewis/Br&#248;nsted acid cocatalysis mechanism involving proton transfer through hydrogen bonding with TPP. Catalyst system consisting of inexpensive and nontoxic iron salt and phosphate additive, relatively low loading and recyclability of catalyst, and rapid and high&#8208;yielding reaction are the advantages of this protocol.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A stepwise copper&#8208;catalyzed boracarboxylation then palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling methodology was developed to access 2,3&#8208;diarylpropionic acid derivatives regioselectively by pre&#8208;setting the position of the carboxylic acid in the boracarboxylation reaction. This method provides access to a wide range of aryl and heteroaryl products in up to 80% isolated yield. Pharmaceutical potential was demonstrated by synthesizing a glucagon receptor antagonist drug in 3&#8208;steps (31% overall yield) from commercially available 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylstyrene.</dc:description>

Abstract
We have developed a method for the synthesis of thieno[3,2&#8208;b]furans on the basis of a strategy consisting of a formal [3+2] cycloaddition utilizing the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement and a subsequent Br&#248;nsted base&#8208;mediated cyclization. The method streamlines access to a wide range of well&#8208;organized 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted thieno[3,2&#8208;b]furans that are otherwise difficult to synthesize and is also applicable to the syntheses of 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted seleno[3,2&#8208;b]furans.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have developed a method for the synthesis of thieno[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]furans on the basis of a strategy consisting of a formal [3+2] cycloaddition utilizing the [1,2]-phospha-Brook rearrangement and a subsequent Br&#248;nsted base-mediated cyclization. The method streamlines access to a wide range of well-organized 2,3,5,6-tetrasubstituted thieno[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]furans that are otherwise difficult to synthesize and is also applicable to the syntheses of 2,3,5,6-tetrasubstituted seleno[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]furans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Ladderanes by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclodimerization of Allenynes: Scope and Mechanism</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
We have developed a Ni&#8208;catalyzed cyclodimerization of 1,6&#8208;allenyenes which affords pentacyclic derivatives containing a [3]&#8208;ladderane. Six new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds are formed in a single operation which is fully atom&#8208;economical. The reaction proceeds with an inexpensive catalyst and shows a broad scope in the alkyne, the allene and the tethering group. A computational and experimental study on the reaction mechanism suggests that this process proceeds by oxidative cyclometallation of the allenyne coordinated to Ni(0) followed by reductive elimination leading to cyclobutenes. Then, two of these molecules are coupled following a related cyclometallation&#8208;reductive elimination sequence, the latter being the rate&#8208;limiting step.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Mediated Carbamoyl Amination of Alkylidenecyclopropane&#8208;Tethered Carbamoyl Chlorides: Synthesis of Functionalized 2&#8208;Quinolones</title>

Abstract
The transition metal catalyzed cyclization of alkene&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chloride has emerged as a tool to construct oxindoles bearing quaternary centers. Most of these reactions proceed via carbometalation&#8208;initiated 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization followed by nucleophilic trapping of the resulting &#963; alkyl&#8208;metal species to achieve diverse functionalized oxindoles. The 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig type cyclization of alkene&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chloride has been rarely reported. Herein, a zinc&#8208;mediated carbamoyl amination of alkylidenecyclopropane&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides with anilines for the synthesis of functionalized 2&#8208;quinolones was developed. A range of different substituted 2&#8208;quinolones were prepared in 65&#8211;89% yield from alkylidenecyclopropane&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides and aniline derivatives using a Zn/TMSCl system.

         <title>Rhodium Catalysts Based on Phenyl Substituted Cp Ligands for Indole Synthesis via Oxidative Coupling of Acetanilides and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling of acetanilides and alkynes via C&#8722;H activation is the most powerful synthetic tool for producing the indole motif from commercially available precursors. However, this reaction usually requires large catalyst loadings (5&#8197;mol% of rhodium). In this study, a 1,2&#8208;diphenylcyclopentadienyl ligand&#8208;based catalyst was developed that works well at 1&#8197;mol% loading of rhodium. DFT calculations of the C&#8722;H activation step provided insight into its high catalytic activity. The catalyst efficiency was also demonstrated in the synthesis of naturally occurring isocoumarins, such as polygonolide, tubakialactone B and penicimarine F. The developed catalytic protocols tolerate a wide range of functional groups, for example, halide, nitro, hydroxy, and alkoxy.

Abstract
The combination of a gold(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complex and an ene&#8208;reductase (ERED) has made possible the synthesis of enantiopure &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones in a one&#8208;pot concurrent approach. The protocol consists of the Meyer&#8208;Schuster rearrangement of racemic propargylic tertiary alcohols using [1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene]&#8208;[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)&#8208;imide]gold(I) (IPrAuNTf2), followed by an asymmetric alkene reduction of the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone intermediate using the Zymomonas mobilis ERED (NCR&#8208;ERED). The chemoenzymatic cascade was optimised with a model substrate, where E/Z&#8208;isomers both generated the (R)&#8208;ketone, which was rationalised using in silico molecular docking experiments. The cascade was then applied towards the production of a series of (R)&#8208;4&#8208;substituted&#8208;alkan&#8208;2&#8208;ones in enantiopure form in a straightforward manner.

Abstract
Synthetic electrochemistry may establish direct routes to a preparation of a plethora of organic substances, which are hardly accessible by conventional experimental techniques. Herein, we present an electrochemically&#8208;driven method for an assembly of a broad range of rare heterocyclic mesoionic entities &#8211;1,2,3&#8208;triazole 1&#8208;imines. These nitrogen heterocycles were prepared through a transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and exogenous oxidant&#8208;free strategy using a C/Ni electrode pair. Over 30 examples of thus synthesized 1,2,3&#8208;triazole 1&#8208;imines illustrate selectivity and practical utility of this approach. Key solvent&#8208;controlled reactivity patterns for the formation of the triazole imine scaffold were revealed indicating a modulation ability of the developed approach. These experimental findings were additionally justified based on cyclic voltammetry (CV) data and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover, according to differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data, some of the prepared 1,2,3&#8208;triazole 1&#8208;imines correspond to the thermally stable species with an onset decomposition temperature up to 190&#8201;&#176;C.

Abstract
An enzymatic method for the selective hydroxylation of phenols using a peroxygenase from Aspergillus brasiliensis (AbrUPO) is reported. A broad range of phenolic starting materials can be selectively transformed into the corresponding hydroquinones. Semi&#8208;preparative syntheses of several hydroquinones were realised without further optimization pointing out the applicability of this enzyme as biocatalyst.

         <title>Two Photocatalytic Pathways for Reductive Dearomatizations of N&#8208;Arylformylindoles by a Visible&#8208;Light Triplet Organocatalyst</title>

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light triplet photocatalyst 5&#8208;acetyl&#8208;2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;benzoic acid methyl ester (AcBSH) was developed through introducing acetyl into benzenethiolate to improve the efficiency of intersystem crossing (ISC) and using o&#8208;methoxyformyl to increase the molar extinction coefficient. In the photocatalytic system of AcBSH, the reductive dearomatization of N&#8208;arylformylindoles is achieved to afford the desired indolines in moderate to excellent yields, including both indoles without (1) and with 2&#8208;substituent (2). The 2&#8208;substituent is a steric hindrance for the conjugation between benzoyl and indole moiety, and makes indole 2 and indole 1 exhibit different reduction potentials (Ered) and different triplet energy levels (&#916;ET). Thereby, two kinds of substrates undergo primarily two photocatalytic pathways: i) successive SET/protonation pathway, which merging photosensitization via triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (EnT) and photoinduced SET for substrates 1, and ii) single electron transfer (SET) from the triplet photocatalyst and a concerted hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process for substrates 2.

         <title>Direct C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage of CH3CN as a Single&#8208;Carbon Synthon: Synthesis of Pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxalines via Electrochemical Oxidation</title>

Abstract
A direct electrochemical redox reaction involving radical cross&#8208;coupling cyclization for the synthesis of pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxaline derivatives from 1&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrroles and CH3CN has been developed, which includes the functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds as well as the construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds. Notably, the control and deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments suggest that CH3CN in this reaction acts as both a carbon source via C&#8722;C cleavage and solvent. The reaction features metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions, and various substituted pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxaline derivatives were obtained.

         <title>Contrasting Facial Selectivity of a Squaramide&#8208;Tagged Proline in the Asymmetric Michael Addition of Ketones to Maleimides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A squaramide moiety was introduced at the C&#8208;4 position of proline to afford an organocatalyst that served as a stereocontrol element to promote the asymmetric Michael addition of cyclic ketones to maleimides. A variety of chiral succinimides were obtained by the conjugate addition in 84&#8211;98% yield accompanied by 58&#8211;96% enantioselectivity. The results also include an interesting contrast in the facial selectivity observed with cyclohexanones and cycloheptanones, whereas an asymmetric desymmetrization of 4&#8208;alkyl cyclohexanones was also achieved using the transformation.

Abstract
The replacement of benzene rings with saturated bioisosteric counterparts is a key priority in drug discovery programs, and disubstituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes have been recognized as flexible molecular scaffolds that could act as ortho&#8208;substituted benzene bioisosteres. In this study, we outline the synthesis of a wide range of 2&#8208;substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexan&#8208;1&#8208;ols, which have the potential to emulate ortho&#8208;phenolic derivatives, via SmI2&#8208;mediated reductive cyclization reactions. The synthetic utility of this methodology was exemplified by the preparation of several saturated analogs of pharmaceutically relevant compounds.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Borobenzylation of Vinyl Arenes</title>

Abstract
Herein, catalytic difunctionalization of vinyl arenes is reported using an iron salt as a catalyst without ligands. A series of substituted alkylboronic acid esters was obtained as a single regioisomer from vinyl arenes at 50&#8201;&#176;C. This multicomponent protocol enabled the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;B bonds to produce boroalkylated products in a single process. A non&#8208;radical pathway is proposed for the reaction in contrast to the radical pathways of iron&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation reactions. The organoboron compounds generated from this reaction were further utilized for diverse functional group conversions.

Abstract
Optically active molecule architectures stand as an important class of organic compounds and occupy a key role in academic and industrial communities. Particularly, the molecules bearing quaternary carbon are of vital importance because of its favorable conformation and valuable three&#8208;dimensional molecules, which frequently play a key role in a broad spectrum of functional materials, pharmaceutical relevant natural molecules, and agrochemicals. Over the past few decades, a large number of synthetic strategies for the enantioselective construction of compounds with chiral quaternary carbon centers have been the focus of a number of research initiatives. In this review, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art toward the synthesis of enantioenriched molecules bearing quaternary stereocenters are summarized, which could be segmented into four categories: 1) Construction of optically active quaternary carbon centers by addition to prochiral sp2 carbon; 2) Construction of optically active all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via substitution at non&#8208;chiral tetra&#8208;substituted carbon; 3) Construction of optically active all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via kinetic resolution; 4) Construction of optically active all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via desymmetrization reactions.

&lt;p&gt;Optically active molecule architectures stand as an important class of organic compounds and occupy a key role in academic and industrial communities. Particularly, the molecules bearing quaternary carbon are of vital importance because of its favorable conformation and valuable three-dimensional molecules, which frequently play a key role in a broad spectrum of functional materials, pharmaceutical relevant natural molecules, and agrochemicals. Over the past few decades, a large number of synthetic strategies for the enantioselective construction of compounds with chiral quaternary carbon centers have been the focus of a number of research initiatives. In this review, the state-of-the-art toward the synthesis of enantioenriched molecules bearing quaternary stereocenters are summarized, which could be segmented into four categories: 1) Construction of optically active quaternary carbon centers by addition to prochiral &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; carbon; 2) Construction of optically active all-carbon quaternary stereocenters &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; substitution at non-chiral tetra-substituted carbon; 3) Construction of optically active all-carbon quaternary stereocenters &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; kinetic resolution; 4) Construction of optically active all-carbon quaternary stereocenters &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; desymmetrization reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for the synthesis of unsymmetrical bis(indolyl)methanes (BIMs) using simple indoles and readily available alcohols as the coupling partners under both heat and 390&#8211;400 nm light conditions was developed. Detailed research of the mechanism demonstrated that the diaryliodonium salt&#8208;mediated transformation undergoes a nucleophilic hydroxymethyl radical formation process. Moreover, the diaryliodonium salt&#8208;mediated method is also applicable for synthesizing symmetrical BIMs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This work describes gold&#8208;catalyzed annulations of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;(dimethoxymethyl)phenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;prop&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;yl acetate substrates with &#945;&#8208;diazo esters and anilines, respectively yielding substituted naphthoates and indeno[1,2&#8208;b]quinoline derivatives. Our mechanistic analysis indicates 1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indenes as their common intermediates. In the formation of naphthoates, &#945;&#8208;diazo ester attacks at gold&#8208;bound intermediate via a SN2 pathway to enable a allylic methoxy substitution. For indeno[1,2&#8208;b]quinoline derivatives, there are two main reactions, including (i) a reversible formation between intermediate and a double amine addition product and (ii) an arylation reaction of intermediate. Species N&#8208;(phenyl((2E)&#8208;1&#8208;(phenylimino)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;inden&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)methyl)aniline was converted to indeno[1,2&#8208;b]quinoline in the presence of gold catalyst.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The copper powder&#8208;mediated tandem hydroamination cyclization&#8208;hydrocyanation of alkyne&#8208;tethered ketoximes is described by using TMSCN as the commercially available cyanating reagent. This methodology provides an alternative strategy for the synthesis of a series of structurally important cyano&#8208;substituted cyclic nitrones. The hydrocyanation process exhibits distinct regioselectivity depending on the substituent pattern of the alkyne moiety. Moreover, the synthesized products were shown to be capable of undergoing various derivatization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition of Alkynes to Form Arenes and Pyridines at Low Catalyst Loadings</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the Ni&#8208;catalyzed cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes at very low loadings of catalysts (0.05 mol% for all substrates). The nickel catalyst containing a terphenyl phosphine ligand allows carrying out the reactions at room temperature in only 30 min, providing the arene products as a single regioisomer in most cases The Ni complex is also competent for the synthesis of polysubstituted pyridines through the cycloadditions of diynes and nitriles at mild temperatures (25 &#186; or 50 &#186;C) and low Ni loadings (1 mol%). Experimental data and computational studies support the involvement of monoligated PNi species in all fundamental steps of the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemically Induced Approaches to the Syntheses of &#946;&#8208;Lactams</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactam scaffolds is of paramount importance due to their extensive applications in pharmaceuticals, particularly as antibiotics. Visible light photocatalysis has emerged as a revolutionary approach in this domain, providing a sustainable and efficient pathway for &#946;&#8208;lactam construction. In this review, we meticulously discuss the recent developments in the synthesis of photocatalysed &#946;&#8208;lactam frameworks.A key focus is the Staudinger reaction, traditionally a cornerstone in &#946;&#8208;lactam synthesis, and its adaptation to visible light photocatalysis. We explore the mechanistic intricacies of the Staudinger reaction under photochemical conditions, along with other pivotal cyclization strategies enabled by visible light. By illuminating the novel photocatalytic routes to &#946;&#8208;lactams, this review provides a thorough understanding of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques and sets the stage for future innovations in the green synthesis of these critical compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Mediated Cascade Reaction of CF3&#8208;Imidoyl Sulfoxonium Ylides and Diimides for the Synthesis of Functionalized Amidines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A base&#8208;mediated cascade reaction of CF3&#8208;imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides (TFISYs) and diimides has been developed for the preparation of functionalized amidines. In the transformation, a cascade nucleophilic addition and subsequent [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of sulfoxonium ylide occur to enable an intramolecular migration of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The unexpected result of the developed protocol demonstrates the chameleonic reactivity of TFISYs.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Functionalization of C60 with Vinylallenes Generated in situ by Rhodium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of fullerenes is important for several reasons, primarily related to enhancing their chemical reactivity, solubility, and potential of applications in optoelectronics and biomedicine. In this study, we present a novel approach to functionalize C60 through a cascade process encompassing an unprecedented Rh&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1,6&#8208;allenynes to in situ generate a vinylallene that is followed by a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with pristine fullerene, resulting in the formation of 6,6&#8208;fused bicyclic fullerene derivatives. The mechanism governing this process was elucidated by DFT calculations and confirmed by deuterium labelling and control experiments, demonstrating the critical role of traces of water in the reaction medium to mediate the observed reactivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>With a number of biologically active members, 2&#8208;aroylchromones are valuable synthetic targets. A direct route towards 2&#8208;aroylchromones from 2&#8208;(methylsulfonyl)chromones and aldehydes via NHC&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;C bond formation was developed. Yields of the synthesized 2&#8208;aroylchromones were up to 85%. Chromones with angioprotective or antibacterial properties were easily synthesized using the method developed. Additionally, the synthetic utility of the afforded chromones was demonstrated by using them to synthesize the anticancer compound wrightiadione and analogues of it.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergent C&#8211;H Alkynylation of 2&#8208;Pyridylthiophenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Di&#64256;erent catalysts are presented to overcome or augment a substrate&#8217;s innate regioselectivity. Rhodium was found to overcome the innate C3&#8208;selectivity &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; chelation&#8208;assisted rhodation. Conversely, palladium was found to enhance the innate C5&#8208;selectivity &lt;i&gt;via &lt;/i&gt;electrophilic palladation. These reactions allow for the formation of a diverse range of synthetically versatile C3&#8208; and C5&#8208;alkynylated products from 2&#8208;pyridylthiophenes. Notably, this strategy was successfully employed in the straightforward synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended functionalized 2&#8208;pyridylthiophenes, which could be converted into more valuable compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Silylation of Aryl Alkynoates: Synthesis of Silylated Coumarins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we reported the photocatalytic synthesis of 3&#8208;silyl coumarins using hydrosilanes as the silyl radical source with aryl alkynoates. Readily prepared N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts act as hydrogen atom transfer reagents for generating silyl radicals under photoredox catalysis. The reaction proceeds through silyl radical addition to alkyne followed by radical cascade cyclization/migration with subsequent oxidation and aromatization to give desired 3&#8208;silyl coumarins in 34% to 89% yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Vinylation of Phosphines with Sulfones and Alcohols
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a manganese&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component vinylation strategy for the synthesis of vinylphosphines from readily available alcohols, sulfones, and phosphines via acceptorless dehydrogenative strategy. This multi&#8208;component, four&#8208;stage, one&#8208;pot protocol offers a stereoselective approach, overcoming the challenges associated with achieving these products through the hydrophosphination of terminal alkynes. The reaction utilizes sulfones and common alcohols to access both (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;substituted vinylphosphines (using methanol) and &#945;&#8208;substituted vinylphosphines (using primary alcohols) in yields ranging from 52% to 99%, with E:Z stereoselectivity of 95:5 to 99:1. Importantly, the synthesized branched&#8208;substituted vinylphosphines exhibited superior ligand performance in the copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl bromides with pyrazole compared to the commercially available PPh3 and diphenyl(vinyl)phosphane.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The one&#8208;pot formation of two C&#8211;P bonds and one C&#8211;halogen bond was achieved through a mild three&#8208;component coupling reaction utilizing arynes, phosphites, and haloalkynes.  In this reaction, the aryl anion, generated from the nucleophilic addition of phosphite to aryne, directly attacked the halogen of the haloalkyne.  The reaction proceeded smoothly with a wide substrate scope and good functional group tolerance.  This operationally simple method enables direct access to ortho&#8208;halogen&#8208;substituted aryl(alkynyl)phosphinates.  The synthetic utility of ortho&#8208;halogen&#8208;substituted aryl(alkynyl)phosphinates with prospective applications in natural product synthesis, medicinal chemistry, and materials chemistry has also been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric [3+3] Cycloaddition of N&#8208;Vinyl Oxindole Nitrones with 2&#8208;Indolylmethanols to Prepare Spirooxindole[1,2]oxazines</title>

Abstract
We describe a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed asymmetric [3+3] cycloaddition of N&#8208;viny oxindole nitrones with 2&#8208;indolylmethanols to prepare various spirooxindole[1,2]oxazines in 43&#8211;93% yields and 88:12&#8211;97:3 enantiomeric ratios. Experimental results revealed that the addition of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) played important roles to help CPA control the reaction reactivity and enantioselectivity. The present method features the construction of a tetrasubstituted chiral carbon stereocenter and the example of N&#8208;vinyl nitrones in asymmetric [3+3] cycloaddition.

     alt="Asymmetric [3+3] Cycloaddition of N-Vinyl Oxindole Nitrones with 2-Indolylmethanols to Prepare Spirooxindole[1,2]oxazines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed asymmetric [3+3] cycloaddition of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-viny oxindole nitrones with 2-indolylmethanols to prepare various spirooxindole[1,2]oxazines in 43&#8211;93% yields and 88:12&#8211;97:3 enantiomeric ratios. Experimental results revealed that the addition of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) played important roles to help CPA control the reaction reactivity and enantioselectivity. The present method features the construction of a tetrasubstituted chiral carbon stereocenter and the example of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-vinyl nitrones in asymmetric [3+3] cycloaddition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible Light Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Reaction of Styrenes with Malonic Esters and CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed bifunctionalization of styrenes with malonic esters and CO2 to form two C(sp3)&#8211;C bonds has been developed. The reaction proceeds at room temperature with 0.1 mol% of the organic photocatalyst (4DPAIPN) and cesium carbonate as a base at a CO2 pressure of 4 atm. This results in the production of 3&#8208;arylpropane&#8208;1,1,3&#8208;tricarboxylic acid esters in yields ranging from 48% to 99%.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of rutaecarpine analogues by borrowing hydrogen strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of rutaecarpine analogues were synthesized in 11&#8211;90% yields via an iron (II) phthalocyanine&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;alkylation reaction of 3&#8208;hydroxyethyl quinazolinone&#8208;linked indole. Mechanistic investigation revealed that the formation of C&#8208;N bonds in the cyclization reaction occurs through intramolecular borrowing hydrogen annulation. The crucial intermediates in this process were verified by LC&#8208;MS analysis and DFT calculations, further supporting the proposed mechanism. Furthermore, biological evaluation demonstrated that some of the synthesized rutaecarpine analogues exhibited good anti&#8208;inflammatory activity.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral C&#8208;Glycosyl amino acids are prevalent structural motifs found in pharmaceuticals and natural products, making them a significant dimension for exploration in modern pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. However, the current synthesis methods for these compounds face numerous environmental and practical challenges, highlighting the critical need to establish more sustainable approaches. Herein, we report a simple and powerful strategy for the stereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;glycoamino acids. This method features the design and use of (&#8208;)/(+)&#8208;camphorsultam as an ideal chiral auxiliary, shielding one prochiral face of the glycine &#945;&#8208;carbon efficiently and imposing a high kinetic barrier for the epimerization of thus&#8208;generated chiral &#945;&#8208;carbon that two configuration products of R and S could be achieved independently. It proceeds under mild conditions, shows broad scope, and allows for the direct stereoselective glycosylation without metal and chiral ligand.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We, herein, report a base free, photocatalytic decyanation of &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles. A range of amides and lactams were obtained in 52&#8208;95% yields. Control experiments indicate O2 as an amide/lactam oxygen source and the reaction (lactam formation) follows radical pathway via dioxetanimine species. This methodology also applied for &#945;&#8208;ester/aldehyde substituted pyrrolidines in the presence of a base, probably via decarboxylation pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiocarbonyl&#8208;Directed Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;H Silylation of Indoles and Pyrroles with Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, hydrogen&#8208;acceptor&#8208;free C2&#8208;selective iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H silylation of indoles and pyrroles with hydrosilanes via C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H bond activation to generate the desired silylated products is presented. The developed protocol allows for the C&#8211;H silylation of a wide range of functionalized indoles with monohydrosilanes under iridium catalysis. Significantly, this process represents a rare silylation of C&#8211;H bonds using &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;directing groups.

         <title>Recyclable All&#8208;in&#8208;one Organo&#8208;Photo&#8208;Auxiliaries Enabling (sp3)C&#8211;(sp3)C Coupling Reactions with Diverse Functionalities
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical C&#8211;C coupling reactions can be tailored to environmentally benign industrial chemical processes and preparations of valuable pharmaceuticals. Yet, recent approaches in this area are limited to using precious transition metal coordination complexes that facilitate light absorption and redox processes with benchtop chemicals. Herein, we propose a new paradigm that involves all&#8208;in&#8208;one organo&#8208;photo&#8208;auxiliaries, thio&#8208;heteroarenes, which exhibit unique photophysical properties. These thio&#8208;heteroarenes were employed to prepare several all&#8208;in&#8208;one ionic photo&#8208;salts from commercially available alkyl/benzyl and heterocyclic halides via aromaticity&#8208;mediated nucleophilic substitution reactions. From the library of &gt; 30 salts, we performed on&#8208;demand photochemical C&#8211;C coupling reactions to isolate numerous symmetrical and unsymmetrical diary/alkyl&#8208;ethanes with yields up to 84% and mass balance as high as 96%. We also investigated the influence of structural features/properties on the outcomes of the photochemical C&#8211;C coupling reactions. The current photochemical C&#8211;C method was successful in the isolation of &gt;30 photoproducts, including the natural product Brittonin A, a precursor of Imipramine, and derivatives of the bioactive Honokiol Analogues. Furthermore, transient absorption spectroscopy and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations were used to decipher the nature of light&#8208;promoted electronic transitions. The present research opens new avenues in sustainable photochemical C&#8211;C coupling reactions to afford valuable compounds and bioactive systems while avoiding the use of precious metals&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

Furthermore, transient absorption spectroscopy and time-dependent density functional theory calculations were used to decipher the nature of light-promoted electronic transitions. The present research opens new avenues in sustainable photochemical C&#8211;C coupling reactions to afford valuable compounds and bioactive systems while avoiding the use of precious metals-based catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Cyclization of 2&#8208;(Alkynylaryl)acetonitriles and Amines: Access to 3&#8208;Hydroxyisoindolinones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe an approach to the synthesis of 3&#8208;hydroxyisoindolinone derivatives via copper&#8208;catalyzed tandem cyclization of 2&#8208;(alkynylaryl)acetonitriles and amines. This reaction is compatible with 2&#8208;(alkynylaryl)acetonitriles and primary alkyl amines  containing various functional groups, providing the corresponding 3&#8208;hydroxyindolinone derivatives with yields ranging from 44% to 82% (medium to good yields). Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction involves oxidation of the benzylic carbon, amide formation, hydration of the alkyne and intramolecular cyclization to produce various 3&#8208;hydroxyisoindolinones. The practicality of the strategy was further demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis, late&#8208;stage functionalizations, and the post modification of natural products.</dc:description>

Abstract
The synthesis of substituted 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones has attracted considerable attention due to the frequent presence of the indole nucleus in numerous natural products and biologically active molecules. Herein, a direct access to 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones through copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative intramolecular cyclization of N&#8208;(2&#8208;acetylphenyl)picolinamide has been developed. This method exhibits good functional group tolerance, atom&#8208;economy and avoids the pre&#8208;functionalization of substrates.

         <title>Solvent&#8208; and Temperature&#8208;Switched Chemoselectivity: Controlled Synthesis of Diverse Pyrazolo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Divergent synthesis of two types of functionalized pyrazolo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines was established via a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol involving a tunable dehydrogenation process and deacylative oxidation accompanied by elimination of the HNO2 pathway. Key attributes of the procedure included the initial formation of C,N&#8208;cyclic&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;acyl azomethine imines and subsequent switchable chemoseletivity that either led to aroyl&#8208; and nitro&#8208;substituted pyrazolo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines or proceeded via deacylative oxidation and elimination of HNO2 pathway to afford solvent and temperature used. The present approach features the use of readily available amines and aldehydes as raw materials, switchable chemoselectivity, wide functional group tolerance such as nitro, halide, aryl, aroyl and sulfonyl group, and easy separation and purification. A combination of control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided important insights into the possible mechanism.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Aerobic oxidative tandem C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H imination and amination between pyridylmethane and aminomethane derivatives was demonstrated using a flavin&#8211;iodine&#8208;coupled catalyst. This method provides a simple and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of various 1,3&#8208;substituted imidazo[1,5&#8208;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyridines with fluorescent properties. The flavin&#8211;iodine catalyst efficiently promoted multiple reactions, including the oxygenation of pyridylmethane and subsequent oxidative C&#8211;N bond formation, utilizing only molecular oxygen, which is a sustainable ideal oxidant. The resulting 1&#8208;ester&#8208;substituted imidazo[1,5&#8208;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyridine derivatives exhibited dual&#8208;state emission in both solution and solid states. In particular, imidazo[1,5&#8208;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyridine with a bulky 2,6&#8208;dichlorophenyl substituent showed an apparent blue emission with good photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields (0.49 in CH2Cl2 solution and 0.39 in the solid state), making it promising candidate for use in optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Dimerization of Fungal Natural Products Through Intermolecular Disulfide Bridges</title>

Abstract
The biosynthetic pathway for the production of natural products from various species often include a dimerization step which increases the structural variability and range of biological activities. These dimerization reactions are highly interesting for biocatalytic applications. Epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) are an important class of natural products whose potent bioactivities rely on disulfide bridges. ETPs often carry a transannular disulfide bridge and can be linked through C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds to form dimers. In this study, we shed light on the mechanism of disulfide formation in the case of the dimeric vertihemiptellides (vhe) produced by the fungus Verticillium hemipterigenum BCC1449. These compounds feature a unique intermolecular disulfide bridge which links two monomers together. Using comparative genomics, we identified the 12&#8208;membered vhe gene cluster. In vitro assays, kinetic analysis, and protein mutagenesis, enabled us to characterize VheT, the oxidase catalyzing an intermolecular disulfide bond formation resulting in ETP dimers. We showed that the CxxC motif of VheT plays a crucial role in catalyzing this reaction. VheT is an oxidase linking natural product monomers through intermolecular S&#8722;S bridges and could be developed into a biocatalyst for thiol specific dimerization reactions.

Abstract
A Palladium catalyzed C4&#8208; alkylation of indoles using epoxide as an alkylating agent and pivaloyl as a weak chelating group has been demonstrated. A variety of substituted epoxides and indoles furnished the desired &#946;&#8208;indolylethyl alcohols in 38%&#8211;87% yields. Control experiments indicate that the C&#8722;H cleavage step is irreversible. The resultant hydroxyl group has been converted to various functional groups to demonstrate the synthetic utility of this protocol.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Iodine&#8208;Catalyzed Dealkylative Synthesis of Enaminones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Light mediated iodine&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of enaminones through C&#8722;N bond cleavage has been described. In addition to substituted ynones, diverse substituted acyclic tertiary amines, and cyclic tertiary amines were also reactive under standard conditions. Selected transformations of the coupling adduct demonstrated the latent utility of this protocol. Preliminary mechanistic studies were also conducted.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Engineering of a Short&#8208;Chain Dehydrogenase LfSDR1 for Efficient Biosynthesis of (R)&#8208;9&#8208;(2&#8208;Hydroxypropyl)adenine, the Key Intermediate of Tenofovir</title>

Abstract
(R)&#8208;9&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl) adenine ((R)&#8208;HPA) is an important intermediate for the synthesis of tenofovir and its prodrugs. Herein, structure&#8208;guided rational design of short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase LfSDR1 was adopted to improve the catalytic performance for enantioselective synthesis of (R)&#8208;HPA at high substrate loading. The crystal structures of LfSDR1 in its apo form as well as in complex with NADPH were solved, which were used for mutagenesis studies and illustration mechanism. Three residues (G92, E141 and V186) were identified as hotspots by structural analysis, and variants V186A/G92V and V186A/G92V/E141L with remarkably improved activity were obtained. By molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of WT and variants, G92V plays a key role in enzyme&#8208;substrate interaction in the binding pocket. Whole cells expressing the mutant LfSDR1&#8208;V186A/G92V and glucose dehydrogenase BsGDH from Bacillus subtilis were used as the catalyst, and up to 200&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 substrate without cosolvent was completely converted to (R)&#8208;HPA with 99.9% ee and a high space&#8208;time yield (STY) of 800&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8197;day&#8722;1. This study improves the understanding of the catalytic mechanism of LfSDR and provides a potential biocatalytic strategy for industrial synthesis of (R)&#8208;HPA.

Abstract
A variety of &#945;&#8208;benzotriazinium ketones were prepared in 38%&#8211;89% yields through a copper(II)&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam reaction and [2,3]&#8208;rearrangement in a one pot reaction open to air from N&#8208;hydroxybenzotriazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones and alkenyl boronic acids at room temperature. Experimental results showed that the copper catalyst not only played as cross&#8208;coupling catalyst but also served as Lewis acid catalyst to control the chemoselectivity of [2,3]&#8208;rearrangement. The reaction tolerated various linear and cyclic disubstituted alkenyl boronic acids. Moreover, &#945;&#8208;benzotriazinium ketone could be easily prepared in gram scales. The present method highlights dual roles of copper catalyst and [2,3]&#8208;rearrangement of N,O&#8208;vinyl moiety.

FeCl3/K2S2O8/Et3SiH system&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;methylation of &#946;&#8208;ketosulfones with N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) was developed. In the overall process, DMF takes up the role of one methyl group in the generation of &#945;&#8208;methyl &#946;&#8208;ketosulfones via single carbon&#8722;carbon (C&#8722;C) bond formation under reflux conditions. Herein, a plausible reaction mechanism is proposed.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Alkyl Selenides with Aryl Bromides: Cross&#8208;Coupling Between Two Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction has been developed using two distinct electrophiles: an aryl alkyl selenide and an aryl bromide. The organoselenium compound, due to the lower bond dissociation energy of the C&#8722;Se bond, acts as a pseudohalide. This one&#8208;pot reaction proceeds by cleaving the C&#8722;Se bond, producing the desired biaryls in moderate to good yields. The use of commercially available aryl bromides eliminates the handling of pre&#8208;formed organomagnesium reagents, enhancing the practicality and applicability of this approach.

         <title>Enantioselective Addition of Thiols to Acyclic Ketiminoesters Using Cinchona Alkaloid Amide/Zinc(II) Catalysts</title>

Abstract
The first enantioselective reaction of acyclic &#945;&#8208;ketiminoesters with thiols has been developed. Good yields and enantioselectivities were obtained using our original cinchona alkaloid amide/zinc(II) catalysts. The obtained products were converted into useful chiral thiazolidines. Based on experimental results and DFT calculation, transition states were proposed to explain the stereoselectivity of the reaction.

         <title>Decarboxylative Aminomethylation of Ferulic Acids via Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Flavin Photocatalysis and its Application in the Synthesis of Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Lead Compounds</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a protocol for the direct visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted decarboxylative aminomethylation of ferulic acid with N&#8208;aryl tetrahydroisoquinolines under air atmosphere. The current protocol uses naturally available ferulic acid as coupling partner, the inexpensive organic photocatalyst riboflavin tetraacetate (RFTA) as photocatalyst and molecular oxygen as oxidant, which is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. This methodology further demonstrated its utility by the protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free semi&#8208;synthesis of natural alkaloids maclekarpine E and by assessing the anti&#8208;inflammatory activity of its analogues.

         <title>Dearomative Functionalization of Activated Quinolines: Transfer Hydrogenation/Cycloaddition Cascade to Construct &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Cascade dearomative functionalization is a robust protocol to convert flat arenes into medicinally relevant three&#8208;dimensional architectures with added new functionality. Herein, a dearomative cycloaddition protocol for synthesizing tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;embedded &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine scaffolds has been developed employing quinolinium salts and sulfonyl azides under metal&#8208;free conditions. An underexplored and mechanistically distinct pathway is unveiled, creating quaternary&#8208;center&#8208;bearing amine skeletons by an amine group migration during the transfer hydrogenation and cycloaddition cascade reaction. This approach provided a broad substrate scope of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine scaffolds from a plethora of C3&#8208;substituted quinolinium and sulfonyl azides. The post&#8208;synthetic modifications have further diversified the &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine core into interesting scaffolds. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested the involvement of aziridine ring formation for the amine migration to the C&#8208;3 position of quinoline to generate the &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine core.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Substitution Using Nucleophilic Amines: Access to Functionalized Mono&#8208; and Bis&#8208;N&#8208;Allyl Synthons</title>

Abstract
We here report a catalytic strategy to enable the decarboxylative allylic amination of vinyl cyclic carbonates using various aliphatic and nucleophilic amines. The use of a protic medium and chelating diphosphine ligands are the main drivers towards chemoselective allylic amine formation, thereby minimizing undesired ligand&#8208;driven complex speciation and aminolysis of the involved substrate. This improved approach amplifies the repertoire of allylic amine synthons that can be prepared from a variety of substrate combinations.

Abstract
Catalyst&#8208;controlled switchable (4+3) and (4+2) annulation reactions of Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates with benzofuran&#8208;derived azadienes have been established. Employing PCy3 as the catalyst, the reaction could provide a variety of synthetically useful benzofuro[3,2&#8208;b]azepines in good yields (80&#8211;92%) with excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities via (4+3) cycloaddition reactions. Whereas changing the catalyst from PCy3 to DMAP, the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities were switched to construct highly substituted spirotetrahydroquinoline scaffolds with three sequential stereocenters containing all&#8208;carbon spiro&#8208;quaternary stereocenters in excellent efficiency and diastereoselectivities (92&#8211;96% yields with all cases&gt;25:1 dr) via (4+2) annulations. In addition, the synthetic utility of this method was further showcased by gram&#8208;scale reactions and synthetic transformations of the product.

Abstract
We present a diastereoselective Au/Pd relay catalytic tandem cyclization reaction to produce dearomatic 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;7&#8208;azaspiro[4.5]decane derivatives under mild conditions. This process involves generating furan&#8208;derived azadiene from readily available enynamide, followed by a [2+4] cycloaddition with Pd&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl dipole decarboxylated from vinyl benzoxazinanone. Our method efficiently constructs the spiro[4.5]decane skeleton, achieving yields ranging from 31&#8211;97% and diastereoselectivities from 6:1 dr to &gt;20:1 dr across 34 examples. This research introduces new cycloaddition sites for azadienes as 1,2&#8208;dipoles and offers a reliable approach for constructing oxa&#8208;azaspiro[4.5]decane frameworks.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aza&#8208;S(VI) fluorides are crucial compounds in the synthesis of various S(VI) derivatives, which find broad applications in drug discovery. However, the synthesis of sulfonimidoyl and sulfondiimidoyl fluorides have been relatively underexplored, often requiring lengthy reaction sequences and/or the use of hazardous gaseous reagents. In this study, we present a rapid one&#8208;pot method for producing sulfonimidoyl fluorides from sulfinylamines via a nucleophilic addition/electrophilic fluorination sequence. Similarly, sulfondiimidoyl fluorides can be synthesized using the same sequence, preceded by the formation of unsymmetrical sulfurdiimides readily generated in situ from sulfinylamines. Whereas isolation of sulfondiimidoyl fluorides was not feasible, they could be efficiently converted into primary sulfonimidamides by base hydrolysis in a one&#8208;pot process. Furthermore, we explored the reactivity of aza&#8208;S(VI) fluorides with various nucleophiles, demonstrating a versatile synthetic platform for the synthesis of aza&#8208;S(VI) compounds..</dc:description>

         <title>A High&#8208;Throughput in Vitro Assay System for the Detection of the Enzymatic Dihydroxylation of Aliphatic Olefins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Rieske dioxygenase enzymes can perform the cis&#8208;dihydroxylation of aliphatic olefins, representing a potential green alternative to established methods of performing this important transformation. However, the activity of the natural enzymes in this context is low relative to their more well&#8208;known activity in the cis&#8208;dihydroxylation of aromatics. To enable the engineering of dioxygenase enzymes for improved activity in the dihydroxylation of aliphatic olefins, we have developed an assay system to detect the relevant diol metabolites produced from whole&#8208;cell fermentation cultures. Optimization studies were carried out to maximize the sensitivity of the assay system, and its utility in the in&#8197;vitro screening of enzyme variant libraries was demonstrated. The assay system was utilized in screening studies that identified Rieske dioxygenase variants with significantly improved activity in the dihydroxylation of aliphatic olefins relative to the wild&#8208;type enzyme.

Abstract
A route for the construction of benzofulvenes derivatives through 4&#8208;Aminobenzotriazole (ABTA) directed Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions of amides with inner alkynes was developed. This method afforded a diverse array of benzofulvene derivatives in yields ranging from 34% to 91%. The control experiments indicated that the substrate reacts with alkynes in tandem to synthesize 1,3&#8208;diene intermediates, and ultimately 1,3&#8208;diene underwent intramolecular cyclization to produce benzofulvene derivatives. Furthermore, the directing group can be removed.

         <title>Stereoselective Construction of Trisubstituted 1,3&#8208;Enynes via Aryl to Vinyl 1,4&#8208;Palladium Migration</title>

Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective olefinic C&#8722;H alkynylation of gem&#8208;diarylsubstituted ethylenes with propargylic alcohols was achieved to access diverse unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;enynes. The regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities were established through a 1,4&#8208;palladium migration from aryl to vinyl in the presence of 2&#8208;FC6H4OH as additive. Mechanistic investigations suggest that cleavage of the olefinic C&#8722;H bond might not be involved in the rate&#8208;determining step of the catalytic process.

         <title>Rapid (Deuterio)difluoromethylation of Heteroatoms Using R&#8208;22 Gas: A Demonstration of Flow Chemistry in Suppressing Intrinsic Reaction Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
R&#8208;22 gas (ClCF2H) is utilized in continuous flow for the installation of CF2H and CF2D groups on heteroatoms. A judiciously designed flow system suppresses the intrinsic SN2 reaction between heteroatom anions and ClCF2H, allowing for selective carbene&#8208;based fragment coupling to yield X&#8208;CF2D products with deuterium incorporation levels up to 96%. A broad scope of X&#8211;CF2H and X&#8211;CF2D products (X=S, O, N) is obtained with a short residence time of 5 minutes and scalability is demonstrated.

Abstract
Monophosphine ligands based on C&#8722;N axially chiral N&#8208;Arylpyrrole backbones are prepared starting from amino acids and evaluated in Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitutions. 20.7&#8211;99.9% ees are achieved in the reactions of rac&#8208;1,3&#8208;diphenylallyl acetates with O&#8722;, N&#8722; and C&#8208;nucleophiles. Ligand screening revealed that the steric hindrance from 3&#8208; or 4&#8208; position of the pyrrole is crucial for the enantioselectivity of the reaction. The synthetic utilization of the products was demonstrated by the transformation of one product by a gold&#8208;catalyzed oxidative rearrangement reaction.

Abstract
A multicomponent cascade cyclization reaction using aryl methyl ketones, aryl amines, and enaminamide reagents to construct 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;1&#8208;one skeleton with good substrate compatibility (50 examples) has been reported. The one&#8208;pot, metal&#8208;free process formed two C&#8722;C bonds, two C&#8722;N bonds, and a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter containing a hydroxyl group. The reaction enabled modified transformation of drug molecules and derivatization of products.

         <title>Aldehyde&#8208;Mediated Open&#8208;Air Stereoselective &#946;&#8208;Glycosylation of Glycals: An Expeditious Route towards Glycosyl&#8208;Ester Synthesis</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
The study introduces a method for achieving a selective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;glycosyl esters through the reaction of glycals with carboxylic acids. This process is characterized by stereoselectivity, operating under mild reaction conditions and in an open&#8208;air environment mediated by an aldehyde. Detailed investigations and control experiments indicate the significance of benzaldehyde in conjunction with atmospheric air in facilitating this transformation. The method's versatility is evident in its broad substrate scope, accommodating various carboxylic acid derivatives with electron&#8208;releasing and electron&#8208;neutral functional groups. The practical applicability of the protocol is demonstrated by successfully esterifying different drugs, including indomethacin, tolmetin, and stearic acid, resulting in the production of novel compounds with excellent yields. Mechanistic studies, supported by controlled experiments, highlight the formation of glycal epoxide as an intermediate in the reactions.

Abstract
The development of synthetic methods for the synthesis of organic azides is highly important, given their critical role in advancing click chemistry over the last twenty years. We report a reagent&#8208;economical, reliable, and scalable synthesis of alkyl azides from primary and secondary alcohols. This robust click method capitalizes on the synergistic interaction between Sulfur Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) reagents &#8211; specifically, benzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;disulfonyl fluoride (BDSF) or benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trisulfonyl fluoride (BTSF) &#8211; and trimethylsilyl azide (TMSN3). The method offers procedural ease, accommodates a wide array of substrates, and enables late&#8208;stage functionalization.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of synthetic methods for the synthesis of organic azides is highly important, given their critical role in advancing click chemistry over the last twenty years. We report a reagent-economical, reliable, and scalable synthesis of alkyl azides from primary and secondary alcohols. This robust click method capitalizes on the synergistic interaction between Sulfur Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) reagents &#8211; specifically, benzene-1,3-disulfonyl fluoride (BDSF) or benzene-1,3,5-trisulfonyl fluoride (BTSF) &#8211; and trimethylsilyl azide (TMSN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The method offers procedural ease, accommodates a wide array of substrates, and enables late-stage functionalization. Additionally, we demonstrate the protocol&#8216;s adaptability by validating a straightforward one-pot deoxyazidation-CuAAC sequence for drug discovery applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
The aerobic ring&#8208;opening oxidation of cyclopropanols catalyzed by copper complexes was systematically investigated, with a focus on the effect of nitrogen ligands on the distribution of oxidation products. This study led to the development of a new synthesis of &#946;&#8208;aminoketones and &#946;&#8208;enaminones from cyclopropanols, where product specificity is tuned through ligand and solvent selection. &#946;&#8208;Aminoketones were prepared in 34&#8211;99% yields by copper(II) acetate&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation of cyclopropanols in the presence of nucleophilic secondary aliphatic amines. In contrast, bipyridine&#8208;ligated copper catalysts resulted in the generation of &#946;&#8208;enaminones in 36&#8211;86% yields, presumably via the Kornblum&#8208;DeLaMare rearrangement of intermediate 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes.
