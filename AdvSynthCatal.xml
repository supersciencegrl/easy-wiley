      <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Aroylation of Diarylmethanes with N&#8208;Bn&#8208;N&#8208;Boc Arylamides and N&#8208;Acylpyrroles</title>
      <dc:description>In the last 20 years, efficient transition metal catalysts for the &#945;&#8208;arylation of enolates have been introduced. Despite the popularity and utility of these reactions, there remains room for improvement (reduced costs, elimination of transition metals and specialized ligands). Herein is reported a general, scalable and green method for aroylation of simple diarylmethane pronucleophiles through direct acyl C&#8211;N cleavage of N&#8208;Bn&#8208;N&#8208;Boc arylamides and N&#8208;acylpyrroles under transition metal&#8208;free conditions. Importantly, a 1 : 1 ratio of the amide to the pronucleophile is employed.  Unlike.	use of Weinreb amides, this method avoids preformed organometallics (organolithium and Grignard reagents) and does not employ cryogenic temperatures, which are difficult and costly to achieve on scale. The operationally simple protocol provides straightforward access to a variety of sterically and electronically diverse 1,2,2&#8208;triarylethanones, a group of compounds with high&#8208;value in medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Organocatalyst&#8208;Mediated Benzannulation Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Aromatic compounds are omnipresent in organic chemistry, which are the broadest skeletons of bioactive molecules, medicines, and materials. Due to their importance, conventional methods to assemble aromatic rings have attracted considerable attention. The direct formation of benzene cores from readily available acyclic precursors offers a highly versatile and superior approach to prepare both small organic molecules and sophisticated natural products. Recently, organocatalyst&#8208;mediated annulation reaction, including phosphine&#8208;, tertiary amine&#8208;, secondary amine&#8208;, primary amine&#8208;, and NHC&#8208;mediated benzannulation reactions, is considered as an efficient method to access multi&#8208;substituted arenes. In this review, we will emphasize the selected examples of organocatalyst&#8208;mediated benzannulation reactions of available acyclic precursors for the construction of diverse aromatics.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aromatic compounds are omnipresent in organic chemistry, which are the broadest skeletons of bioactive molecules, medicines, and materials. Due to their importance, conventional methods to assemble aromatic rings have attracted considerable attention. The direct formation of benzene cores from readily available acyclic precursors offers a highly versatile and superior approach to prepare both small organic molecules and sophisticated natural products. Recently, organocatalyst&#8208;mediated annulation reaction, including phosphine&#8208;, tertiary amine&#8208;, secondary amine&#8208;, primary amine&#8208;, and NHC&#8208;mediated benzannulation reactions, is considered as an efficient method to access multi&#8208;substituted arenes. In this review, we will emphasize the selected examples of organocatalyst&#8208;mediated benzannulation reactions of available acyclic precursors for the construction of diverse aromatics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Silylcarboxylic Acids as Bifunctional Reagents: Application in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed External&#8208;CO&#8208;Free Carbonylative Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed external&#8208;CO&#8208;free carbonylative Hiyama&#8208;Denmark cross&#8208;coupling reaction is presented. The introduction of silylcarboxylic acids as bifunctional reagents (CO and nucleophile source) avoids the need for external gaseous CO and a silylarene coupling partner. The transformation features high functional group tolerance and it is successful with electron&#8208;rich, &#8208;neutral, and &#8208;poor aryl iodides. Stoichiometric studies and control experiments provide insight into the reaction mechanism and support the hypothesized dual role of silylcarboxylic acids.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A direct and versatile copper&#8208;mediated three&#8208;component reaction of arylboronic acids, Me3SiN3 and aldehydes for the synthesis of A direct and versatile copper&#8208;mediated three&#8208;component reaction of arylboronic acids, trimethylsilyl azide and aldehydes for the synthesis of benzimidazoles is reported. The reaction is well tolerated in a wide range of substituted aromatic aldehydes and aromatic boronic acids to produce the corresponding benzimidazoles with moderate to high yields. Mechanism investigation demonstrated that copper&#8208;promoted Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam coupling, C&#8208;H amination and oxidative cycloaddition are involved in the tandem processes.</dc:description>

The reaction is well tolerated in a wide range of substituted aromatic aldehydes and aromatic boronic acids to produce the corresponding benzimidazoles with moderate to high yields. Mechanism investigation demonstrated that copper&#8208;promoted Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam coupling, C&#8208;H amination and oxidative cycloaddition are involved in the tandem processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Halogen Bond&#8208;Catalyzed Povarov Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>The use of a bidentate halogen bond donor to catalyse Povarov reactions of imines derived from aryladehydes and anilines is reported.  Dienophiles used in these reactions included 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran, N&#8208;vinyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone and N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;protected 2,3&#8208;dihydropyrrole.  Very high isolated yields of the desired 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline products were obtained with low catalyst loadings (0.01 equivalents) and short reaction times (minutes to hours) at ambient temperature.  Notably, the bis(benzimidazolium iodide)&#8208;based catalyst used in these reactions proved to be more efficient than analogous bromine and chlorine functionalized compounds, as well as a related monodentate benzimidizolium iodide.

      <title>C3&#8208;Thioester/&#8208;Ester Substituted Linear Dienones: A Pluripotent Molecular Platform for Diversification via Cascade Pericyclic Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Substituted oxabicyclo derivatives bearing two quaternary carbon centers and five contiguous stereocenters have been synthesized from C3&#8208;thioester/&#8208;ester substituted dienones, a simple and linear pluripotent molecular platform. The conversion proceeds from neat reactants, possibly via a thermally&#8208;driven pericyclic cascade manifold involving sequential (E)&#8208;s&#8208;trans to (E)&#8208;s&#8208;cis isomerization, oxa&#8208;6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization, and intermolecular, regioselective [4&#960; + 2&#960;] cycloaddition. The proposed mechanism has been substantiated by intermediate trapping experiments and DFT studies. Such dienones have also been exploited to effect stereoselective cross Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadditions with olefins and sequential Diels&#8208;Alder/retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with activated alkynes. The reaction is greatly influenced by the substituent effect exerted by the C3&#8208;thioester/&#8208;ester group.</dc:description>

      <title>Zinc/Indium Bimetallic Lewis Acid Relay Catalysis for Dehydrogenative Silylation/Hydrosilylation Reaction of Terminal Alkynes with Bis(hydrosilane)s</title>
      <dc:description>When mixed with two different Lewis acid catalysts of zinc and indium, terminal alkynes were found to elegantly react with bis(hydrosilane)s to selectively give 1,1&#8208;disilylalkenes from among several possible products, by way of a sequential dehydrogenative silylation/intramolecular hydrosilylation reaction. Adding a pyridine base is crucial in this reaction; a switch as a catalyst of the zinc Lewis acid is turned on by forming a zinc&#8208;pyridine&#8208;base complex. A range of the 1,1&#8208;disilylalkenes can be obtained by a combination of aryl and aliphatic terminal alkynes plus aryl&#8208;, heteroaryl&#8208;, and naphthyl&#8208;tethered bis(hydrosilane)s. The 1,1&#8208;disilylalkene prepared here is available as a reagent for further transformations by utilizing its C&#8208;Si or C=C bond: the former includes Hiyama cross&#8208;coupling, bismuth&#8208;catalyzed ether formation, and iododesilylation; the latter includes double alkylation and epoxidation. Mechanistic studies clarified the role of the two Lewis acids: the zinc&#8208;pyridine&#8208;base complex catalyzes the dehydrogenative silylation as a first stage, and, following on this, the indium Lewis acid catalyzes the ring&#8208;closing hydrosilylation as a second stage, thus leading to the 1,1&#8208;disilylalkene.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Progress on Reductive Coupling of Nitroarenes by Using Organosilanes as Convenient Reductants</title>
      <dc:description>Nitroarenes are stable, low&#8208;cost, and readily available starting materials. The directly utilize nitroarenes in synthetically valuable C&#8211;N bond formation is of great significance, because the pre&#8208;reduction step to corresponding amines can be avoided. Previously, phosphines and carbon monoxide (CO) are the most widely used reductants in the reductive cyclization or/and carbonylation of nitroarenes. Currently, much attention has been attracted to organosilanes as new potential reducing agents, not only because they are inexpensive, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, and mild reagents, but also various novel reaction models of nitroarenes have been explored. In this review, we mainly summarize the recent progress on the reductive coupling of nitroarenes by using organosilanes as the end reductants. We hope that a deep understanding of the reaction model and underlying working mechanism can provide a timely guideline for researchers who are interested in this fantastic area, leading to further exploration of practical and efficient reductive coupling of nitroarenes for C&#8208;N bond formation and N&#8208;heterocycle synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>Advances in the Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Atropisomeric Hexatomic N&#8208;Heterobiaryls</title>
      <dc:description>Axially chiral hexatomic N&#8208;heterobiaryls are among the most important class of structures with extensive utility in asymmetric catalysis as chiral ligands and organocatalysts, as exemplified by QUINAP and QUINOX. Besides, these atropisomers have attracted broad attention due to their application in drug discovery. Hence, it is not surprising that extensive efforts have been devoted for the pursue of efficient catalytic asymmetric methods for their direct and atroposelective construction. In addition to the direct heteroaryl&#8208;aryl cross&#8208;coupling, which remains as a challenge, a series of creative catalytic asymmetric strategies based on pre&#8208;formed heterobiaryl systems have been developed by taking advantage of the intrinstic property of N atom on the heteroarenes. Generally, the methods employed extensively involved kinetic resolution, dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation, dynamic kinetic resolution and desymmetrization reaction. A growing number of approaches through stereoselective de novo formation of a six&#8208;membered
N&#8208;heteroaromatic ring have also been reported for specific applications in this field. This review summarizes recent advancements of axially chiral hexatomic N&#8208;heterobiaryls construction by means of asymmetric catalysis, including their scope, limitations, mechanisms and applications.

      <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Alkyne Functionalization by N&#8208;O/S&#8208;O/C&#8208;O Bond Oxidants</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract: Since the beginning of this century, homogeneous gold&#8208;catalyzed alkyne transformations have been an active area of research in pursuit of developing novel and efficient synthetic methodologies. This emerging area of research which at the beginning exploited the mild Lewis acid character of gold and its propensity to form &#960;&#8208;complex with alkyne, has been reinvigorated upon the discovery of gold&#8208;catalyzed oxidative alkyne functionalization in 2007. The gold&#8208;catalyzed alkyne oxidation enabled direct access to &#945;&#8208;oxo gold carbenes and gold alkynal complex with versatile reactivity which has been applied to achieve novel transformations including but not limited to oxyarylation, C&#8722;H, X&#8722;H (X = N, O) insertion, cyclization, cycloaddition, ring expansion, and various novel cascade reaction. This review provides a comprehensive summary of methods, applications and mechanistic insight of gold&#8208;catalyzed oxidative alkyne functionalization by N&#8722;O/S&#8722;O/C&#8722;O bond oxidants covering the literature reports appeared since 2007.</dc:description>

      <title>Double Carbonylation Reactions: Overview and Recent Advances</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. The compounds like amides, carbamates, oxamates, oxamides, &#945;&#8208;keto amides, diketones, esters, ureas, etc. find extensive applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and organic synthesis. The classical syntheses of these compounds often involve cumbersome routes involving toxic chemicals. The carbonylation reactions such as aminocarbonylation, alkoxycarbonylation, oxidative carbonylation and double carbonylation deliver as an efficient and attractive alternative to the conventional synthetic routes even at industrial scale. The catalytic single carbonylation reactions are extensively studied, however, catalytic double carbonylation reactions are not explored for several potential applications. This review covers literature on the use of different types of catalysts involving various	metals like Pd, Cu, Fe, Co, Rh and Ni for double carbonylation reactions along with the chemistry of associated ligands. It also covers double carbonylation used for synthesis of different types of novel substrates with the discussion related to mechanism of formations of mono and di carbonylation products. The notable introduction of several CO&#8208;surrogates and exploration of their efficiency have solved the problems related to the toxicity of CO.  CO&#8208;surrogates used for double carbonylation reactions are also discussed.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Heteroarene&#8208;Fused Cyclopentadienes and Related Compounds Suitable for Metallocene Preparation</title>
      <dc:description>Metallocene catalysis is widely used in transformations of unsaturated organic compounds, including the bulk industrial synthesis of polyolefins. Over the last few decades, the electronic and structural properties of their &#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;coordinated ligands have been modified by introducing electron&#8208;donating, electron&#8208;withdrawing, and sterically hindered substituents to obtain desirable catalytic properties for the metallocenes. An efficient way to design &#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;coordinated ligands is to exploit the annelation of heterocyclic fragments with a cyclopentadiene ring. In the present review, we summarize, systematize, and analyze synthetic approaches to heterocycle&#8208;fused cyclopentadienes suitable for metallocene catalyst preparation.
