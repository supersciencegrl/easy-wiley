         <title>Synthesis of Indoles via Sigmatropic Rearrangements and Olefin Isomerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indoles are  important heterocycles in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, and their atom&#8208;economical synthesis is needed. Herein, we describe the synthesis of indoles using sigmatropic rearrangements. The N&#8208;allylaniline was oxidized by environmentally benign hydrogen peroxide, and spontaneous [2,3]&#8208;Meisenheimer rearrangement gave N&#8208;allyloxyaniline.  Subsequent treatment with a ruthenium catalyst afforded N&#8208;vinyloxyaniline, which underwent [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement to give indoles, expelling water as the only byproduct. The whole sequence is free of quantitative salt byproducts, thereby avoiding aqueous work up and cutting off the inorganic waste.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Functionalization of Heptacyclo[6.6.0.02,6.03,13.04,11.05,9.010,14]tetradecane</title>

         <dc:description>The regioselective functionalization of heptacyclo[6.6.0.02,6.03,13.04,11.05,9.010,14]tetradecane (HCTD) under photocatalytic conditions is described. The protocols developed share an initial photo&#8208;triggered hydrogen atom abstraction that regioselectively generates the necessary HCTD&#8208;radical preferentially at position 1&#8208;, they employ no excess of the precious cage carbocycle, and enable the straightforward access to a broad variety of 1&#8208;(alkyl, aryl, or sulfinyl) HCTDs in moderate but still synthetically useful yields. The scope and limitations of each transformation are also discussed.

         <title>A Direct Synthesis of Substituted Exocyclic 1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones by Base&#8208;Mediated Multicomponent [3+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component, base&#8208;mediated [3+2] cycloaddition reaction to synthesize 1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones from readily available amino acid esters, aldehydes, and terminal alkynes was reported. Isolation of the intermediate and the detailed mechanistic study revealed the course of the reaction. This multi&#8208;component reaction proceeds via imine formation followed by the nucleophilic addition of alkyne to form a propargylamine precursor. Base&#8208;mediated conversion of propargylamine precursor into 1&#8208;azadiene followed by in situ ketene formation leading to [3+2] cycloaddition that ultimately produces unusual 1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Cascade Cyclization Reactions of 1,7&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elaborated molecular architectures, especially carbocyclic, heterocyclic, endocyclic, and polycyclic molecular structures, serve as an important class of organic complexes because they are frequently occurring core structural units in a variety of biologically and pharmacologically relevant natural products, drug molecules, agrochemicals, and functional materials. A main challenge of current synthetic approaches is the development of strategically efficient and selective formation of these compounds from easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle starting materials. The cascade cyclizations of 1,7&#8208;enynes have afforded an indispensable method for accessing molecular complexity and diversity, thus highlighting their potential significance in both academic and industrial communities. In the lastdecades, tremendous efforts have been devoted to discovering convenient routes to access sophisticated annulation derivatives, and a wide range of powerful and straightforward synthetic strategies have been reported. In this review, the latest achievements in the cascade cyclization reactions of 1,7&#8208;enynes are summarized, which could be separated into three categories: (1) Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reactions of 1,7&#8208;enynes; (2) Metal&#8208;free catalyzed reactions of 1,7&#8208;enynes; (3) Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions of 1,7&#8208;enynes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated ketones are highly versatile intermediates in organic synthesis, widely being used as substrates in e.g. 1,4&#8208;addition&#8208; and Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. Their synthesis, however, often proceeds via multi&#8208;step pathways. Here we present an alternative methodology for the one&#8208;pot formation of 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ones by the Pd&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;coupling of readily available bromides and lithium 1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes, proceeding in 2.5 h at 40 &#176;C. In situ hydrolysis of the intermediate 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes affords the desired 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ones, providing a direct cross&#8208;coupling method to access isomerically pure (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;enones.</dc:description>

This transformation involves C&#8208;H activation by a chlorine radical generated during the iron&#8208;promoted ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer process, triggering subsequent C&#8208;H pyrimidination. The substrates and catalysts are inexpensive and readily available, while the reaction conditions and procedures are simple without the need for external oxidants.

         <title>[3+2] Cycloaddition of Rationally Designed Trisubstituted Cyclic &#945;&#8208;Chloroamide: an Alternative Strategy for Accessing Spirocyclic &#947;&#8208;Lactam Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Here we present a [3+2] cycloaddition of rationally designed trisubstituted cyclic &#945;&#8208;chloroamides, primarily those incorporating pharmacological pyrazolone cores, as potent synthons for synthesizing valuable spirocyclic &#947;&#8208;lactam architectures. This protocol exhibits 52&#8211;96% yields, impressive substrate compatibility, and scale&#8208;up capacity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we present a [3+2] cycloaddition of rationally designed trisubstituted cyclic &#945;-chloroamides, primarily those incorporating pharmacological pyrazolone cores, as potent synthons for synthesizing valuable spirocyclic &#947;-lactam architectures. This protocol exhibits 52&#8211;96% yields, impressive substrate compatibility, and scale-up capacity. Importantly, this study also represents one of the rare examples that harness enaminone C&#8722;N bond cleavage to engineer relevant spirocyclic &#947;-lactam skeletons of biological interest. Moreover, we propose a plausible mechanistic explanation to elucidate the outstanding chemical outcomes observed, thereby enriching the synthetic toolbox for pyrazolone chemistry and &#945;-haloamide-mediated reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Herein a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H silylation of o&#8208;alkynylanilines with hexamethyldisilane for the synthesis of disilylated 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles is reported. In this reaction, o&#8208;alkynylanilines undergo an aminopalladation, C&#8722;H activation, and dealkylation sequence to form five&#8208;membered C,C&#8208;palladacycles, which then couple with hexamethyldisilane to construct one C&#8722;N bond and two C&#8722;Si bonds. This method provides an alternative strategy for C&#8722;H silylation.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral 2&#8208;Oxazolidinones by Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation of 2&#8208;Oxazolones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of 2&#8208;oxazolones in the presence of a chiral diamine ruthenium catalyst with potassium formate as a hydrogen source and potassium carbonate as an additive in 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol is described. A series of chiral 2&#8208;oxazolidinones were obtained with 29%&#8211;95% yields and 86%&#8211;&gt;99% ee's. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale synthesis of chiral 2&#8208;oxazolidinone and its downstream derivatizations demonstrate the practicality of this method.

Abstract
We studied a reaction of chromone&#8208;containing acrylonitriles and cyanoacrylates with acid hydrazides. This reaction turned out to be a method for the synthesis of salicyloyl&#8208;substituted 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines. The synthesis developed is a tandem ring&#8208;opening/double ring&#8208;closing process. This synthetic approach is characterized by low toxic solvents (ethanol, butanol) and mediator (Et3N), 37&#8211;84% yields, non&#8208;chromatographic isolation of products, and substrate tolerance (59 examples).

         <title>Catalytic Deoxygenative Reduction of Hydrazides to Hydrazines via B(C6F5)3&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The catalytic deoxygenative reduction of hydrazides to the corresponding alkyl hydrazine with PhSiH3 via B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation is reported. This metal&#8208;free protocol is compatible with various acylhydrazides and diacylhydrazides, giving rise to a variety of structurally diverse alkyl hydrazine products in 63&#8208;95% yields.

This metal-free protocol is compatible with various acylhydrazides and diacylhydrazides, giving rise to a variety of structurally diverse alkyl hydrazine products in 63-95% yields. The proper selection of borane catalyst and hydrosilane reductant is essential for catalysis. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the reaction involves a hydrazone intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible Light instead of Transition Metal: Electron Donor Acceptor Complex Enabled Cross Coupling of Aryl Halides with Active Methylene Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An arylation of anions of active methylene compounds with aryl halides provides an access to synthetically versatile &#945;&#8208;arylated 1,3&#8208;diketones, &#946;&#8208;keto esters, &#946;&#8208;keto nitriles, &#946;&#8208;cyano esters, etc. Previously, these C&#8211;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions have been accomplished only using transition metal&#8208;based catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate that these arylations can be successfully realized under catalyst&#8208;free conditions employing the electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex photoactivation strategy. The protocol was further optimized for a semi&#8208;one pot synthesis of indole derivatives via an intramolecular C&#8211;C coupling.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An EDA complex comprising &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;allyl bromodifluoroacetamides and tertiary alkyl amine was exploited to facilitate annulative difunctionalization reaction under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This external photocatalyst&#8208;free methodology garners olefin&#8208;olefin coupling featuring a radical Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement and produced long&#8208;chain functionalized gem&#8208;difluoropyrrolidones from &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;substituted methacryloyl sulfonamides, while simple &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;aryl methacrylamides furnished pyrrolidinone&#8208;oxindole hybrid lactams in high yields. Mechanistic investigations substantiate a combined reaction mechanism, involving charge&#8208;transfer EDA complex&#8208;based radical cascade, alongside an &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical&#8208;triggered XAT process, exhibiting a quantum yield value of 1.48.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for the synthesis of (E)&#8208;vinyl sulfones and alkynyl sulfones through the cleavage of thiosulfonate promoted by the formation of EDA complexes under visible light irradiation at room temperature without the need for other metal catalysts is described. The mechanism study shows that sodium iodide and thiosulfonate form EDA complexes under visible light irradiation, resulting in a single&#8208;electron transfer cleavage to generate sulfonyl radicals, which then react with olefins or alkynes to produce (E)&#8208;vinyl sulfones or alkynyl sulfones, respectively. This method is applicable to 44 olefin and alkyne substrates, with yields ranging from 38% to 90%, providing a radical synthesis approach for the preparation of sulfonylated compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Sulfoxonium Ylides Using Hypervalent Iodine Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of &#945;&#8208;arylated sulfoxonium ylides has been achieved from mesitylene&#8208;derived diaryliodonium salts and &#945;&#8208;carbonyl sulfoxonium ylides. The reaction is believed to proceed via an electrophilic Cu(III)&#8208;aryl intermediate that can be trapped upon nucleophilic attack of the sulfoxonium ylide precursor. The reaction was tolerant to both &#945;&#8208;keto and &#945;&#8208;ester&#8208;derived sulfoxonium ylides, to drug&#8208;derived ylide motifs and to electronically&#8208;diverse arenes, and enabled the direct synthesis of 32 &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;sulfoxonium ylides in 42&#8208;85% yield.</dc:description>

Abstract
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes with anilines/indoles and acetonitrile has been developed. This protocol provides an access to functionalized cyano&#8208;containing molecules. In this transformation, employing di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide as a radical initiator, a variety of commercialized nucleophiles and electronically diverse arenes were well tolerated. In addition, we also studied the kinetic isotope effect.

         <title>TBHP&#8208;Mediated Intermolecular Radical Coupling and Intramolecular Cyclization Cascade: Access to Furo[2,3&#8208;b]quinoxalines and Their Photophysical Study</title>

Abstract
A cascade one&#8208;pot strategy to construct 31 examples of furo&#8208;fused quinoxalines in up to 88% yields has been devised from readily accessible &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides and quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;ones in open flask at room temperature under TBHP mediated conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed that the overall reactivity relies on the seamless integration of intermolecular radical coupling and intramolecular cyclization via desulfhydration of C=S bond cleavage. Generation of H2S as the only by&#8208;product makes this process highly attractive. Furthermore, the photophysical behavior of the furo&#8208;fused quinoxalines has also been studied.

Abstract
The established strategy unveils a metal and mediator&#8208;free electrochemical [3+2] cycloaddition approach among &#945;&#8208;amino carbonyls and tosylmethyl isocyanide (TosMIC) fabricating substituted imidazole scaffolds. Implementation of electro&#8208;redox conditions on this cycloaddition approach eliminates the essential requirement of transition metal catalysts and chemical oxidants. A wide variety of different functionalities are well tolerated under this reaction condition, contributing to the substrate scope and applicability. Several control experiments and cyclic voltammetry studies suggest an electro&#8208;oxidation triggered successive C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formations followed by rapid aromatization for constructing the five&#8208;membered core structure.

Abstract
A dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation, involving the generation of four stereogenic centers with a well&#8208;defined configuration, occurs in the cyclocondensation of diastereomeric mixtures of 2&#8208;oxocyclohexanepropionic acid racemates 6 with (1S,2R)&#8208;cis&#8208;aminoindanol: two major tetracyclic lactams, 7&#8201;a and 7&#8201;b, that differ in the configuration of the four stereocenters on the decahydroquinoline moiety were obtained. From the above lactams, the removal of the chiral auxiliary, the introduction of a 2&#8208;piperidone ring, and the closure of the diazine ring complete the first enantioselective total synthesis of the Myrioneuron alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;schoberine B and its enantiomer (+)&#8208;schoberine B.

         <title>Construction of Polyheterocyclic Skeletons through C&#8722;H Bond Activation&#8208;Initiated Cascade Reactions by Using Cyclopropanol as Alkylating Agent as well as Masked Nucleophile and Electrophile</title>

Abstract
Presented herein is a synthesis of indane fused bicyclic pyrazolidinones based on the reactions of aryl azomethine imines with cyclopropanols. Mechanistically, the formation of product involves Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed direct aryl C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of aryl azomethine imine with cyclopropanol through in&#8197;situ ring&#8208;opening, followed by cascade intramolecular C&#8208; and N&#8208;nucleophilic addition. In this tandem process, cyclopropanol acts as not only an alkylating agent but also masked nucleophile and electrophile to participate in the construction of both the indane and the bicyclic pyrazolidinone scaffolds. To our knowledge, such a cascade reaction pattern has not been disclosed. In general, this synthetic protocol has advantages such as easily obtainable substrates, valuable products, concise synthetic procedure, unique reaction pathway, and good compatibility with diverse functional groups.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Diazabicycloalkanes via Organocatalytic aza&#8208;Michael/Aldol Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
We introduce a strategy for the one&#8208;step synthesis of chiral diazabicycloalkanes that delivers the annulated ring system in a single reaction step. The method entails a direct aza&#8208;Michael/aldol reaction of enals in conjunction with modified oxopropanamides and establishes the chiral center via iminium&#8208;enamine tandem catalysis. For this purpose, we developed simple diphenylethylendiamine frameworks as dual activation organocatalyst, effectively engaging both the substrate and reagent, thus leading to yields of 31&#8211;86% and enantioselectivities in the range of 80&#8211;98%. The final product features not only the diazabicycloalkane moiety but includes also additional functionalities, such as aldehyde motives that can be modified in&#8197;situ without loss of enantioselectivity, and an sp2&#8208;bearing methyl group. Our approach accommodates a wide array of enals with high functional group tolerance. Additionally, we demonstrated the adjustability of enantioselectivity and yield by modulating the acid cocatalyst&#8216;s quantity, thus offering multiple optimization possibilities.

         <title>Synthesis of Benzo[a]fluorene, Benzo[c]fluorene, and Benzo[j]fluoranthene via a Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Prins&#8208;Type Cycloaromatization: Application to the Total Synthesis of Viridistratin A.</title>

         <dc:description>
The front cover illustrates the streamlined synthesis of representative non&#8208;alternant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons through Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed Prins&#8208;type cycloaromatization (on the earth). Notable features of the catalytic reaction encompass air tolerance, high productivity, remarkably short reaction times, and scalability. The plausible mechanism suggests that Prins&#8208;type benzannulation competes with oxonium&#8208;ene cyclization. The robustness and high productivity of the key reaction allowed the application towards total synthesis of natural benzo[j]fluoranthene, viridistratin A (on the moon). Details can be found in the Communication by Hwayoung Yun and co&#8208;workers (M. Jeong, M. Yoon, L. H. Nguyen, S. Kim, J. Han, C. S. Tran, J. Kim, J. Jo, Y.&#8208;S. Jung, J.&#8208;W. Yoo, H.

         <title>Recent Advances in Synthetic Methods for 2H&#8208;Pyrroles</title>

Abstract
The compound, 2H&#8208;pyrrole, is a key scaffold contained in natural products, bioactive compounds, pharmaceuticals, and organic functional materials. However, the development of efficient synthetic strategies for 2H&#8208;pyrroles is challenging. This is because 2H&#8208;pyrroles, owing to their nonaromatic nature, are easily converted into the thermodynamically more stable 1H&#8208;pyrroles. Recently, efficient and straightforward synthetic strategies for 2H&#8208;pyrroles have been developed, including the dearomatization of 1H&#8208;pyrrole, oxidation of pyrrolines or pyrrolidines, ring construction via catalytic cycloaddition, and rearrangement of 3H&#8208;pyrroles. In this review, we summarize the progress in the research on 2H&#8208;pyrrole synthesis since 2000 and briefly discuss the synthesis reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Accessing Indenoazulenes via a Gold&#8208;Catalysed Cyclisation of Cycloheptatrienyl&#8208;Substituted 1,5&#8208;Diynes</title>

Abstract
Herein we report that cycloheptatrienyl&#8208;substituted 1,5&#8208;diynes with aromatic backbones undergo a gold&#8208;catalysed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclisation to give 11H&#8208;indeno&#8208;[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes at room temperature. This methodology complements the established range of aromatic structures obtained from gold&#8208;catalysed conversions of differently substituted 1,5&#8208;diynes accessed via highly reactive cationic intermediates. We have demonstrated the scope of the reaction and have assessed the possibility of further functionalisation of the indenoazulene scaffold. Additionally, we have studied the optical and electrochemical properties as well as the frontier molecular orbitals of this structural motif by both spectroscopic and theoretical means.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights on the Enantioselective (4+3) Cycloaddition Between Oxyallylcations and Furans Catalyzed by BINOL&#8208;Based Phosphoramides</title>

Abstract
The mechanism of the enantioselective (4+3) cycloaddition between furan derivatives and oxyallylcations, which are generated from the corresponding oxiranes through in&#8197;situ oxidation of allenamides, has been studied using DFT methods. The research has revealed that, under acid&#8208;catalysis by a chiral non&#8208;racemic phosphoramide, the epoxide ring&#8208;opening proceeds without any energy barrier, while the rate&#8208;limiting step is the electrophilic attack of the intermediate enaminium ion on the furan ring. The reaction exhibits low energy barriers when dealing with furan derivatives unsubstituted at C2 and C5. Calculations predict the formation of an achiral regioisomer for 2&#8208;substituted furans, a prediction that has been experimentally confirmed. Additionally, the calculations accurately predict the reaction with substituted allenamides.

         <title>Aza&#8208;Prins Cyclization on Ketones to Access Piperidines with Tetrasubstituted Carbon Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The aza&#8208;Prins cyclization in presence of a variety of aliphatic, aromatic, and heterocyclic ketones is disclosed. The developed method allows an access to diverse C&#8208;2 functionalized piperidines, bearing a tetrasubstituted or spiranic carbon stereocenter, in a range of 30 to 87% yields. When diastereomers were formed, the trans isomer was identified as the major product.

Abstract
Herein we describe Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of &#945;&#8208;pinene derivative &#8211; pinacarvone O&#8208;methyl oxime (1) with aryl halides (2). Surprisingly, the formation of the C&#8722;C coupling product was accompanied by an unexpected opening of the pinene bicyclic structure. The (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;aryl&#8208;4,4,5&#8208;trimethylcyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;one O&#8208;methyl oxime (3) was formed as the resulting product. The reaction conditions of the developed synthetic procedure were carefully optimized and the reaction mechanism was supposed on the basis of data obtained by structural and computational methods.

Abstract
A convergent paired electrolysis method for the synthesis of 1&#8208;pyrazolyl&#8208;substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines has been developed. The reaction proceeded without any transition metal catalyst and chemical oxidant. The desired products could be isolated in high yields (80&#8211;99%) in 60&#8211;80&#8197;minutes. The Faradaic efficiency was 108% and gram&#8208;scale synthesis (84%) could be carried out. Mechanistic studies revealed that the C&#8722;N bond formation process might mainly involve a nucleophilic addition reaction.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated cycloaddition of azobenzenes and nonstabilized azomethine ylides has been developed to access 1,2,4&#8208;triazolidines. With readily available organic dye rose bengal as a photocatalyst and alkyl tertiary amines as precursors for azomethine ylides, the reaction proceeded smoothly under visible light irradiation at room temperature, affording various 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolidines with yields of up to 96%. Preliminarily mechanistic studies suggest that the nonstabilized azomethine ylides are formed in&#8197;situ through photoredox catalysis.

Abstract
In this paper, a non&#8208;Cp* cobalt&#8208;catalyzed [4+1] spirocyclization of aromatic amides with cyclic diazo compounds for the synthesis of pentatomic spirolactams is presented. The reaction features with high regio/chemoselectivity by using cheap and commercially available base metal catalyzed C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H bond functionalization. Moreover, the practicability of this developed protocol is further demonstrated by the removal of the directing group and gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

         <title>A Three&#8208;Step Chemoenzymatic Cascade Synthesis of Miconazole Analogues Based on the Asymmetric Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Heteroaryl Amino Alcohols via Ketoreductases</title>

Abstract
Chiral &#946;&#8208;heteroaryl amino alcohols play a crucial role as intermediates in the synthesis of numerous bioactive pharmaceuticals, including cenobamate, oteseconazole, and miconazole. Nevertheless, there is a lack of literature documenting the establishment of a versatile approach for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;heteroaryl amino alcohols and the aforementioned drugs. In this study, we successfully asymmetrically synthesized 50 pairs of chiral &#946;&#8208;heteroaryl amino alcohols using two engineered ketoreductases (KREDs) with opposite stereopreference. Based on this achievement, we developed a three&#8208;step chemoenzymatic cascade route for synthesizing of chiral miconazole analogues from commercially available 2&#8208;bromoacetophenone derivatives. By optimizing the solvent for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;imidazolyl ketones in the first step, followed by the reduction of &#945;&#8208;imidazolyl ketones using KREDs in the second step and etherification in the third step, we obtained 20 chiral miconazole analogues with promising yields (26&#8211;84%) and impressive stereoselectivities (up to &gt;99%&#8201;ee). Notably, this route eliminates the need for the isolation of ketone and alcohol intermediates, and avoids the use of metal catalysts in the synthesis of chiral miconazole analogues. Furthermore, we successfully scaled up the preparation of (S)&#8208;miconazole, achieving a 30% isolated yield and &gt;99%&#8201;ee. This method presents a novel synthetic approach for production chiral ether drugs and chiral &#946;&#8208;heteroaryl amino alcohols, offering new possibilities in pharmaceutical synthesis.

Abstract
The intermolecular anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamination of vinylsilanes was achieved utilizing five silyl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;terphenoxide yttrium complexes. The highest activity was observed for the most sterically encumbered triphenylsilyl&#8208;substituted complex. Excellent activity and complete anti&#8208;Markonikov selectivity were obtained for a variety of benzylic and aliphatic primary and secondary amines. Interestingly, the reaction with 2&#8208;picolylamine produced the hydroaminoalkylation product rather than the hydroamination product. Reaction of dimethyldivinylsilane resulted in a range of 1,4&#8208;azasilinanes via sequential hydroamination/endocyclization in good yields.

         <title>Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalysed Kinetic Resolution of Secondary and Tertiary 3&#8208;Amido Allylic Alcohols</title>

Abstract
A synthetic method to prepare enantioenriched secondary and tertiary 3&#8208;amido allylic alcohols efficiently that relies on their stereoablative enantioselective kinetic resolution (KR) catalysed by a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid is described. Achieved at room temperature, the stereoablative asymmetric KR protocol was shown to exhibit excellent functional group tolerance and provided product yields up to 50%, and ee and s values up to 99% and &gt;200. The synthetic utility of the divergent catalytic protocol was exemplified by the 1&#8197;mmol scale preparation of one tertiary example and its reduction or bromination to give the corresponding 1,3&#8208;amino alcohol and 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,3&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives. The suggested asymmetric KR pathways provide rare instances of accomplishing enantioselective discrimination through the dehydration or imine&#8208;enamine tautomerisation/retro&#8208;aza&#8208;aldol reaction of the respective 2&#176; and 3&#176; alcohol substrates.

&lt;p&gt;A synthetic method to prepare enantioenriched secondary and tertiary 3-amido allylic alcohols efficiently that relies on their stereoablative enantioselective kinetic resolution (KR) catalysed by a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid is described. Achieved at room temperature, the stereoablative asymmetric KR protocol was shown to exhibit excellent functional group tolerance and provided product yields up to 50%, and ee and &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; values up to 99% and &amp;gt;200. The synthetic utility of the divergent catalytic protocol was exemplified by the 1&#8197;mmol scale preparation of one tertiary example and its reduction or bromination to give the corresponding 1,3-amino alcohol and 2-bromo-1,3-amino alcohol derivatives. The suggested asymmetric KR pathways provide rare instances of accomplishing enantioselective discrimination through the dehydration or imine-enamine tautomerisation/retro-aza-aldol reaction of the respective 2&#176; and 3&#176; alcohol substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A selective reaction of bridged ozonides with Fe(II) salts proceeds through the sequence of O&#8722;O, C&#8722;C scissions and halogenation to form &#945;&#8208;halogen substituted &#948;&#8208;ketoesters and &#948;&#8208;diketones in 15&#8211;72% yields. The overall sequence shows how a temporary installation of a peroxide functionality can be used to replace the acyl group within an acetoacetic ester unit with a halogen.

Abstract
A Cu/Pd co&#8208;catalyzed Catellani&#8208;type ortho arylation reaction of iodoarenes with aryl diazonium salts has been developed. Aryl radicals that derived from aryl diazonium salts were regioselectively installed at ortho position of iodoarenes via palladium catalyzed C&#8722;H activation. Mechanistic studies showed that, in contrast to classical Pd0&#8722;PdII&#8722;PdIV&#8722;PdII&#8722;Pd0 catalytic cycle, this radical cascades performed via a Pd0&#8722;PdII&#8722;PdIII&#8722;PdI&#8722;Pd0&#8197;cycle.

Abstract
Cu&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular borylation&#8208;cross coupling reaction of alkenes was developed. Racemic and chiral borylated indolines were achieved by borylation&#8208;cross coupling of alkenes with B2pin2 via simultaneous construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;B bonds by Cu/phosphine ligand system. With CuOAc and DPPE ligand, a series of 3&#8208;substituted borylated indoline derivatives were concisely synthesized in good to excellent yields in short time under mild conditions. Asymmetric synthesis was investigated by ligand screening, and the chiral 3&#8208;substituted borylated indoline was obtained in 80% yield and 80:20 er with (R, R)&#8208;Me&#8208;Duphos. Application of 3&#8208;substituted borylated indolines has been demonstrated by a gram scale synthesis and further functionalization.

Abstract
Short&#8208;chain dehydrogenases (SDRs) are powerful catalysts for the asymmetric reduction of prochiral ketones in pharmaceutical products. Herein, through gene mining and evolutionary analysis, we obtained two major types of SDRs (SDR&#8208;1 and SDR&#8208;2) for the enantioselective complementary reduction of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;piperidone, which gives the corresponding product (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc&#8208;piperidol, an intermediate of the interleukin inhibitor and lymphoma treatment drug (imbruvica), respectively. By integrating multiple sequence alignment, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and computational modeling, we proposed a &#8220;loop regulation&#8221; mechanism for the enantioselective control of SDRs, through which residues in the loop region could potentially fine&#8208;tune their enantioselectivity. Further, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis assays showed that two key residues (L201 and F205 for SDR&#8208;1, F92 and H93 for SDR&#8208;2) in the loop and its adjacent region played critical roles in fine&#8208;tuning the enantioselectivity of SDRs. Understanding this mechanism of SDR stereo preference in catalyzing asymmetric reduction, we further switched the enantioselectivity of the homologous enzymes. The obtained enzymes catalyzed the enantiodivergent synthesis of chiral heterocyclic alcohols with different ring sizes and substituents (25&#8211;99% conversion and 25&#8211;99% ee (R/S)), including piperidols, 4&#8208;hydroxy azepanes, 3&#8208;hydroxy azepanes and pyrrolidinols. These findings could potentially guide future attempts at protein engineering of stereoselective SDRs.

Abstract
Herein we have reported an expedient di&#8208;functionalization of such versatile scaffolds. By harnessing an under explored reactivity of N&#8208;aminopyridinium ylides, we have developed an aminopyridylation of N&#8208;substituted maleimides and 1, 4&#8208;quinones at room temperature in 2&#8208;methyl THF without any external reagents. The [3+2] cycloaddition of N&#8208;aminopyridinium ylides generate the corresponding cycloadduct with various maleimides and 1, 4&#8208;quinone substrates, which rapidly undergoes oxidation at the alkene moiety under open air, inducing a considerable driving force, thermodynamically, to facilitate aromatisation of the pyridine and a subsequent homolytic cleavage of the N&#8722;N bond to generate the desired 2, 3&#8208;aminopyridylated products in good to excellent yield. Experimental and computational studies clarify the reaction mechanism.

The [3+2] cycloaddition of N-aminopyridinium ylides generate the corresponding cycloadduct with various maleimides and 1, 4-quinone substrates, which rapidly undergoes oxidation at the alkene moiety under open air, inducing a considerable driving force, thermodynamically, to facilitate aromatisation of the pyridine and a subsequent homolytic cleavage of the N&#8722;N bond to generate the desired 2, 3-aminopyridylated products in good to excellent yield. Experimental and computational studies clarify the reaction mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
This work describes the selective synthesis of a series of pyrido/benzo&#8208;fused 1,4&#8208;selenazines, through the reaction of bis(3&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl) or bis(2&#8208;aminophenyl) diselenides with different &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. When molecular I2 was used as catalyst, a series of (Z)&#8208;1&#8208;(1H&#8208;pyrido[2,3&#8208;b][1,4]selenazin&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;ylidene)propan&#8208;2&#8208;ones were obtained. On the other hand, in the absence of catalyst, 1&#8208;(2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrido[2,3&#8208;b][1,4]selenazin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;ones could be prepared selectively. The structure of the prepared compounds was elucidated by NMR and HRMS analysis and confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The versatility of the protocol was demonstrated not only by the access to a variety of 1,4&#8208;selenazine derivatives, but also by the structural diversity in the 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl precursors, incorporating multifunctionalities in the synthesized heterocycles.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Carboxylic Acids with Disulfides to Access Thioesters</title>

Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross coupling reaction of carboxylic acids with disulfides is described. The readily available and inexpensive carboxylic acid is activated in&#8197;situ by the formation of a mixed anhydride. The transformation occurs at room temperature with wide functional group tolerance to efficiently generate structurally diverse thioesters. Moreover, the reaction tolerated a broad substrate scope, including sterically hindered of disulfides. Ultimately, this powerful method could be applied to the late&#8208;stage functionalization for the construction of diverse thioesters, affording a convenient and practical tactic to construct carbon&#8208;sulfur bonds.

Abstract
A Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] oxidative annulation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketoxime acetates with cyclopropanols has been developed for the synthesis of 2,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted pyridines in 28&#8211;76% yields. This method employs cyclopropanols as C2 synthons and features various functional group compatibility and gram&#8208;scale synthesis. In addition, a plausible reaction pathway was proposed based on the mechanism studies.

         <title>Construction of Nitrogen Spirocycles in a Tandem Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation/Dipolar Cycloaddition Reaction</title>

Abstract
Complex spirocyclic isoindolines and pyrrolidines are formed in a tandem process involving Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed dienylation of cyclic C&#8208;aryl nitrones with 2,3&#8208;butadien&#8208;1&#8208;ol carbonates, followed by intramolecular 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition. The nitrone moiety serves both as a directing group for the C(aryl)&#8722;H activation and the dipole in the cycloaddition step. High regioselectivity of the fused vs. bridged product can be obtained by adjusting the reaction temperature. Reactions with substituted allenic substrates provide heterocycles with additional stereocenters usually with complete diastereoselectivity. The reaction products were readily transformed further into other complex nitrogen&#8208;containing spirocyclic systems.

The inside cover picture shows an approach for the asymmetric synthesis of miconazole analogues through a chemoenzymatic cascade. Beginning with 2&#8208;bromoacetophenone derivatives, the pathway involves chemical synthesis and two engineered stereocomplementary ketoreductases, enabling the synthesis of 50 pairs of &#946;&#8208;heteroaryl amino alcohols with high conversions and stereoselectivities, along with 10 pairs of miconazole analogues with promising yields and remarkable enantiopurities. Details can be found in the Research Article by Jiali Fang, and co&#8208;workers. (J. Fang, Y. Xu, H. Ren, C. Huang, W. Zhang, X. Jia, S. You, B. Qin, Adv. Synth.

         <title>Merging Continuous Flow Technology, Photochemistry and Biocatalysis to Streamline Steroid Synthesis</title>

Abstract
Since their structural elucidation in 1935, the introduction and substitution of functional groups and the modification of the steroidal scaffolds have been a fertile ground of research for synthetic and medicinal chemists. The discovery of steroids with hormonal and pharmacological activity has stimulated tremendous efforts to the development of highly selective and efficient synthetic procedures. Despite the progress made, steroid chemistry remains challenging and the preparation of steroidal compounds of pharmaceutical interests and in clinical practice, often requires long and elaborated synthesis. In recent years, a new impetus in the field came with the advent of enabling chemical technologies, such as continuous flow chemistry, which are exploited to overcome problems that arise from batch synthesis. Although it is still a niche sector, the use of flow technology in steroid synthesis and functionalization holds the premise to empower methodology development and to provide innovative tactics also for many hitherto uncharted chemistries. In this review, scientific contributions are reported and discussed in terms of flow set&#8208;up and advantages offered concerning process efficiency, optimization, waste minimization, safety improvement, easy scale&#8208;up and costs. We also highlight the main challenges, key improvements and the future trajectory in the application of continuous flow chemistry and its implementation to different disciplines such as photochemistry and biocatalysis with the ultimate goal of streamlining steroid synthesis.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to the Challenging Direct C&#8208;Alkylation and C&#8208;Allylation of Unactivated Nitroalkanes</title>

Abstract
The limited nucleophilic character and the bidentate nature of unactivated nitroalkane anions (nitronates) makes the corresponding alkylation and allylation procedures rather troublesome. This aspect is in sharp contrast with other commonly employed processes involving nitronate anions such as conjugate additions or nitroaldol reactions. This review summarizes the most rewarding approaches that along the years have been devised to overcome this limitation. Efficient methods are nowadays mainly based on metal&#8208;catalyzed processes involving purely ionic or mixed ionic&#8208;radical intermediates including photoenzymatic reactions.

Abstract
(Hetero)Aryl fluorosulfates (ArOSO2F/ArOFs) emerged as a versatile synthon in &#8220;click chemistry,&#8221; attracting the interest of chemists owing to their extensive applications in fields such as biology, medicine, materials, and polymers. Readily prepared from widely available phenolic compounds in nature, fluorosulfates serve as a economical, efficient, and environmentally friendly alternative to trifluoromethane sulfonates. In recent years, fluorosulfates have attracted research attention as emerging electrophilic reagents in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions. The development of a broad range of coupling reactions will considerably expand their applications in interdisciplinary fields. This review summarized the synthesis methods for fluorosulfates and their instances as coupling partners in various transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of Dibenzo[b,f]azepines via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade [4 + 3] Annulation of o&#8208;Alkenyl Bromoarenes and o&#8208;Bromoaniline Derivatives</title>

Abstract
A cascade [4+3] annulation of o&#8208;alkenyl bromoarenes and o&#8208;bromoaniline derivatives was described. Various dibenzo[b,f]azepines with substitutions on the 10/11 position were obtained in 14&#8211;97% yields. The synthetic versatility of this protocol is highlighted by the preparation of a precursor of the drug molecule oxcarbazepine, a gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and two product transformations. Unlike previous amination/Heck sequence, this cascade process is supposed to undergo a C(vinyl), C(aryl)&#8208;palladacycle involved pathway.

Abstract
Here we report a light&#8208;induced FeCl3&#8208;catalyzed approach for benzyl C&#8722;H chlorination with remarkable regioselectivity, which enables alkylbenzenes to be converted into versatile benzyl chlorides under mild conditions using trifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride (TfCl) as the chlorine source. DFT calculations show that the dynamics preference of benzylic &#945;&#8722;C&#8722;H chlorination is more pronounced by employing TfCl.

Abstract
A cascade Wolff rearrangement and double N&#8208;acylation reaction has been developed for the synthesis of fused pyrimidinediones in one&#8208;pot under air. These reactions were performed with &#945;&#8208;diazoketones and 2&#8208;aminopyridines or 3&#8208;aminopyrazoles under catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions. The protocol avoided traditional purification procedures, such as organic solvent extraction and column chromatography. The synthesis of biologically active molecules and gram&#8208;scale experiment demonstrated the potential applications of this reaction.

Abstract
We disclosed the dual role of neutral [Hmim]Br towards the direct conversion of arylsulfonic anhydride into arylthiol surrogate for the controlled and regioselective synthesis of 3&#8208;sulfenylindoles from indole derivatives at rt. In addition, 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;3&#8208;sulfenylindoles were synthesized in the presence of catalytic water at 50&#8201;&#176;C in a cascade manner i.&#8201;e. sulfenylation and bromination through de&#8208;oxygenative reduction with [Hmim]Br in the absence of any additional brominating agent. The present method was also utilized for the sulfenylation of other heterocycles including azaindole, coumarin, naphthol, and pyrrole in good to excellent yields. Moreover, mechanistic investigations revealed this reaction was driven by imidazolium cation of neutral ionic liquid i.&#8201;e. [Hmim]Br, which converts arylsulfonic anhydride into sulfenyl group for sulfenylation/bromination of sp2 C&#8722;H bond wherein an acidic ionic liquid [Hmim]pTSA is released as a by&#8208;product.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light induced multicomponent reaction of aromatic aldehydes, amines and sodium difluoromethanesulfinate for the synthesis of fluorinated secondary amines has been investigated. The protocol affords a convenient pathway for the introduction of difluoromethyl group into imines, which generated in&#8197;situ by the reaction of aldehydes and amines. A diverse range of fluorinated secondary amines were synthesized in 43%&#8211;79% yields under room temperature. In addition, a plausible mechanism was proposed based on several control experiments.

Abstract
We established a strategy for the copper&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component 1,4&#8208;phosphinoylcyanation of 1,3&#8208;enynes with diarylphosphine oxides and trimethylsilyl cyanide. The reaction produced various tetrasubstituted phosphinoyl&#8208; and cyano&#8208;containing allenes with high functional group compatibilities in good yields under mild reaction conditions. A preliminary reaction mechanism involving the formation of phosphinoyl radicals and their regioselective addition to 1,3&#8208;enynes was also proposed.

Abstract
A convenient protocol for the synthesis of thiazole&#8208;2&#8208;thiones from nitrobenzene, chalcones and carbon disulfide is described. The construction of one C&#8722;S bond and two C&#8722;N bonds via [3+2] cycloaddition reaction is achieved using NaOH as the base in one pot. Various functional groups attached to substrates were well tolerated to afford the corresponding products in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Desilylation&#8208;Promoted Phosphine Catalysis: Intramolecular Annulation/Nucleophilic Addition Sequence of Trimethylsilylethynyl Benzoxazinanones with N&#8208;Tosyl Imines</title>

Abstract
Under phosphine catalysis facilitated through desilylation, intramolecular annulation/nucleophilic addition of trimethylsilylethynyl benzoxazinanones with electron&#8208;deficient imines or alkenes was achieved to afford a series of indole derivatives in moderate to high yields. The trimethylsilylethynyl benzoxazinanones without electron&#8208;withdrawing group on the alkyne moiety functioned as phosphine acceptors. Notably, the distinctive desilylation activation played a key role in catalytic process. Particularly, those indole derivatives could be readily transformed into various biologically significant &#947;&#8208;carboline compounds. The use of chiral phosphine achieved asymmetric reaction, leading to a 95% ee of product.

Abstract
This work demonstrated the efficacy of a proline&#8208;derived chiral urea for &#8220;on water&#8221; asymmetric hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis by incorporating a hydrophobic and electron&#8208;withdrawing pentafluoro&#8208;phenyl substituent into the urea moiety. When employed as a catalyst, pentafluorophenyl&#8208;substituted proline&#8208;derived chiral urea exhibited significant enhancement of both the reaction rate and stereoselectivity when conducted &#8220;on water&#8221; compared to that of conventional organic solvents due to the hydrophobic hydration effect. Moreover, this catalyst did not display notable self&#8208;aggregation during the &#8220;on water&#8221; hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis and was confirmed to exist as a monomeric species with catalytic activity. Due to its remarkable acceleration in &#8220;on water&#8221; conditions, the catalyst load was significantly reduced. Consequently, complete conversion was achieved at room temperature within 2&#8197;hours while maintaining good enantioselectivities (up to 96% ee) even at 0.2&#8197;mol% catalyst loading in the Michael addition of dithiomalonate to nitrostyrene.

Abstract
We developed a cascade reaction of diynone and o&#8208;hydroxy aromatic aldimine under mild conditions. This protocol is proposed to proceed through sequential [3+2]/[4+4] cycloaddition and proton transfer processes, thus providing an efficient way for the synthesis of a variety of dihydropyrrole fused eight&#8208;membered ring scaffolds.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unactivated olefins rank amongst the most important feedstocks in organic synthesis. Their availability makes them particularly useful synthons for subsequent  functionalization, particularly in a catalytic manner. Driven by the popularity ascribed by nickel catalysis as a new tool to rapidly forge molecular architectures via one&#8208;or two&#8208;electron manifolds, the recent years have witnessed significant advances in Ni&#8208;catalyzed olefin difunctionalization of olefins. While 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization or remote functionalization via &#8220;chain&#8208;walk&#8221; have become mature disciplines for repurposing the potential of olefins as building blocks, it was only recently that extensions of this chemistry to 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization have been possible.

Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkylation of indoles with &#945;&#8208;diazoesters is well&#8208;known, however, the underlying mechanisms of this reaction, particularly the origin of stereoselectivity, remain uncertain. For the Pd catalysis, we address this cutting&#8208;edge challenge from two complementary viewpoints &#8211; i) the molecular level regarding a single catalytically active Pd center; and ii) nano&#8208;level Pd species investigating the factors favoring the appearance of the preferred catalytic centers. The formation of the active catalytic species was monitored by structural methods (NMR and ESI&#8208;MS), and metal particles were characterized with electron microscopy (SEM, EDX). On the molecular level, chiral bipyridine&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dioxides proved to be competent chiral controllers. The kinetic and DFT computational data revealed a crucial role of water in the rate and selectivity determining steps and showed that the enantioselectivity of the process is controlled by the protodepalladation step. On the nano&#8208;scale, the important effect of catalyst precursor on the overall reaction performance was shown.

Abstract
Asymmetric three&#8208;component, 1,2&#8208;aminoxy&#8208;trifluoromethylation of styrenes with N&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;benz/naphthoxazine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones (i.&#8201;e., N&#8208;OH&#8208;(B/Np)OxzOn) catalysed by chiral vanadyl complexes derived from N&#8208;salicylidene&#8208;L&#8208;t&#8208;leucinate were explored. Among 14 different solvents and 13 different catalysts screened, the best reaction scenarios were in 2&#8208;propanol with 3&#8208;(2,5&#8208;dimethyl)phenyl&#8208;5&#8208;bromo (DMP), or 3&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;5&#8208;bromo substituted catalysts that led to the corresponding complementary (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;products with potential biological activities in 45&#8211;91% yields and up to 85 and 75% ee, respectively. Further optimisation with the DMP catalyst led to the best combination of 3&#8208;halo/3,5&#8208;dihalo&#8208;styrenes with 6&#8208;/7&#8208;Br&#8722;N&#8722;OH&#8208;(B/Np)OxzOn as the trapping agents. The corresponding eight different products were isolated in 52&#8211;75% yields with ees in a range of 88&#8211;93% (R). Based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations with conformational searches, the origin of enantiocontrol and the working mechanism were proposed by resorting to a bidentate&#8208;chelation between the amide or carbamate C=O group and N&#8722;OH group in the trapping agent to the vanadyl center followed by asymmetric benzylic radical trapping in an SH2 fashion. Subsequent Fragment Molecular Orbital (FMO)/Pair Interaction Energy Decomposition Analysis (PIEDA) calculations with the DMP catalyst were carried out to rationalize the extent of asymmetric induction. One representative product derived from p&#8208;methyl&#8208;styrene and NpOxzOn was hydrolyzed in basic MeOH with decarboxylation to unmask its carbamate moiety. The resulting chiral (R)&#8208;N&#8208;benzoxy&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;naphthamide was subjected to aerobic, oxidative homo&#8208;coupling catalysed by the DMP catalyst in CCl4. The corresponding 2,2&#8208;binaphthol product was isolated in 90% (brsm) yield with nearly complete diastereo&#8208;control at the created (M)&#8208;axial chirality, allowing for sequential, bi&#8208;functional asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Pyrido&#8208;[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline Derivatives via Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Cascade Reaction of Enamides</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cascade reaction of tertiary enamides has been developed, which provides a method for the preparation of diverse pyrido[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives with good function group tolerance. Preliminary investigation of the reaction mechanism indicate that this process comprises a nucleophilic addition of the enamide to an alkynyl group, followed by the capture of the acyliminium ion by an electron&#8208;rich aromatic component. Additionally, scale&#8208;up experiments and further transformations of pyrido&#8208;[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines underscore the utility of this methodology.

Abstract
Treatment of 1&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;(2,2&#8208;dihalovinyl)arenes with a catalytic amount of Rh2(esp)2 afforded various 2,3&#8208;dihaloindoles in 51&#8211;74% yields. This reaction progressed via the intramolecular cyclization of rhodium nitrene generated in&#8197;situ and the rearrangement of one halogen group. For the 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;iodovinyl group, the iodo group selectively rearranged to yield 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;iodoindoles as single isomers. Moreover, 1&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;[(2,2&#8208;dihalomovinyl)(Boc)amino]arenes were reacted with a catalytic amount of Rh2(oct)4, which produced 2&#8208;haloquinoxaline in 55&#8211;92% yields.

Abstract
A substrate and catalyst&#8208;controlled synthetic strategy was employed to construct two distinct types of fused polycyclic heterocycles, namely pyrido[2,3,4&#8208;de]quinazolinones and indolo[1,2&#8208;c]quinazolinones. The most notable advantage of this method is its ability to rapidly generate two different polycyclic scaffolds via a simple C&#8722;H activation and subsequent cyclization cascade pathway. Specifically, sulfoxonium ylides played a crucial role in both transformations, serving as a two&#8208;carbon synthon and a one&#8208;carbon synthon, to independently construct the two fused polycyclic scaffolds through [4+2] and [4+1] annulation pathways, respectively.

Abstract
A three&#8208;step synthesis of anti&#8208;amoebic, ring&#8208;fused mackinazolinones has been developed. A Mannich&#8208;type reaction between quinazolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones and N&#8208;Cbz propanal in the presence of AgOTf afforded quinazolinones (19&#8211;94% isolated yield) bearing a newly formed heterocycle with an alkylamine appendage that, upon N&#8208;Cbz deprotection and basification, triggered a domino rearrangement to afford 45 separable, ring&#8208;fused products. Several compounds inhibited growth of Naegleria fowleri parasites that can cause a lethal human brain infection. Thus, the methodology provides immediate access to a promising anti&#8208;amoebic scaffold.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Laetevirenol A via Regioselective Gold&#8208;Catalyzed and Acid&#8208;Promoted Cyclizations</title>

Abstract
The total synthesis of Laetevirenol A, a natural product with antioxidant activity, has been achieved. A gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of an o&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;o&#8217;&#8208;alkynylbiphenyl has been used as the key step for the construction of the phenanthrene moiety present in Laetevirenol A. Several studies in model substrates have been carried out to unveil the effect of substituents in different locations in the outcome of this cyclization, which allowed the design of an appropriate precursor for the fundamental gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization. The suitably functionalized phenanthrene intermediate obtained in this key step could be further transformed into Laetevirenol A via a Friedel&#8208;Crafts cyclization, which also turned out to be dependent on the nature of the substituents. Finally, Laetevirenol A was obtained in 10 steps from commercially available substrates, with a 20% global yield.

         <title>Chemical Approach for Investigation of the Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship of Salmycin and Identification of a Glycan&#8208;based Analogue for Drug Resistant Staphylococcus aureus</title>

Abstract
New synthetic routes were devised for total synthesis of Fe3+&#8208;bound (ferri&#8722;) salmycin B (Sal B) (1), glycan&#8208;based Sal analogues 2&#8211;5 and their Fe3+&#8208;unbound (desferri&#8722;) counterparts 1&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; for the structure to activity relationship (SAR) study. The results of SAR study reveal the effective structure of 1 and its desferri&#8208;counterpart 1&#8242; that are responsible for the observed inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Among the analogues 2&#8211;5 and 2&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242;, glucose&#8208;based analogue 2 and its desferri&#8208;counterpart 2&#8242; exhibited inhibitory potency comparable to 1 and 1&#8242;. Chemical modification of 2&#8242; for further antibacterial study enabled us to discover desferri&#8208;Sal analogue 7&#8242; that endowed with a simpler pharmacophore structure but significantly higher antibacterial potency against methicillin&#8208;sensitive and resistant S. aureus than the natural product 1&#8242; and even the clinical vancomycin. Together with a better hydrolytic stability and shorter synthetic route, the analogue 7&#8242; represents an attractive antibiotic lead for further exploration.

Abstract
The preservation of scarce rare earth metals, such as palladium, rhodium, iridium, and others, poses a significant challenge for humanity due to their limited availability. These rare earth metals might be replaced by earth&#8208;abundant 3d&#8208;transition metals such as cobalt, manganese, iron, nickel, copper, etc. Isoquinolines have acquired an important position in synthetic organic chemistry as well as medicinal chemistry. They manifest in a diverse range of natural and synthetic molecules, serving as pivotal synthons for the synthesis of numerous bioactive compounds with notable medicinal significance. Numerous reports on the synthesis of isoquinoline derivatives via transition metal catalysis have been published worldwide. In this review, we summarize recent approaches for synthesizing various isoquinoline derivatives using 3d&#8208;transition&#8208;metal catalysts since 2020. The review has been divided into different 3d&#8208;transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysis. We expect that this review will bring a better overview of the present status of the significant progress made in the 3d&#8208;transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based synthesis of isoquinolines and persuade more advancements and research in this area in the near future.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxa(aza)benzonorbornadienes are utilized as important synthetic intermediates and useful building blocks in organic synthesis due to their structural features and reactivity. In addition to ring-opening reactions, the transition-metal-catalyzed ring-retentive addition reactions of oxa(aza)bicyclic alkenes have increasingly drawn the attention of various researchers. Numerous efficient protocols in this field have been investigated that enable facile and efficient transformations of oxa(aza)benzonorbornadienes to related valuable adducts, which are summarized and discussed in detail in this review.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Utilization of Non&#8208;Stabilized Diazoalkanes from (3+2) Cycloaddition of Linear N,N&#8208;Disilyl Enamines and Azides</title>

Abstract
A (3+2) cycloaddition reaction of linear N,N&#8208;disilyl enamines and organic azides is investigated. The N,N&#8208;disilyl enamines, derived from the selective double hydrosilylation of conjugated nitriles, are employed in&#8208;situ for this investigation. The resulting triazoline intermediate from the (3+2) cycloaddition reaction promptly undergoes retro&#8208;(3+2) cycloaddition to yield versatile non&#8208;stabilized diazoalkane, along with formamidine. The presence of a transient and unstable alkyl diazomethane is confirmed by utilizing carboxylates as trapping reagents. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of these alkyl diazomethanes by utilizing them in reactions with various reagents, including hydroborane, diboron, silaborane, alkenes, and alkynes.

         <title>Strategies and Methods for the Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Benzofuran/Benzopyran Fused Acetals: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Benzofuran&#8208; and benzopyran&#8208;fused polycyclic acetals are found in a variety of biologically active natural products. The synthetic methods toward this class of polycyclic heterocycles have fascinated one of the most intensive pursuits in total synthesis. Nevertheless, stereoselective methods towards the rapid construction of such skeletons still remain challenging for organic chemists. Significant progress has been made in this research area in recent years, however, literature on enantioselective approaches to construct these molecules has not fully reviewed. Driven by their intriguing and complex scaffolds with potential usefulness, we compose the recent advances in this review covering all the important works in this field. We hope this review will promote future research in this area.

         <title>Pd(0)&#8208;Catalyzed&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Vitamin D Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
1&#945;,25&#8208;Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3), the hormonally active form of vitamin D3, regulates mineral homeostasis, cell growth, cell differentiation&#8208;proliferation, apoptosis, and immune responses. 1,25D3 activates more than 229 genes associated with several diseases, including arthritis, diabetes and cancer, suggesting its implications in a broader range of biological functions than originally thought. Despite the wide range of biological activities, the clinical applications of 1,25D3 have been limited due to its collateral hypercalcemic effects. This problem has boosted intense synthetic activity in the vitamin D area in the last decades aimed at the development of highly active and non&#8208;calcemic analogs for treatment of hyperproliferative diseases. This review covers the most useful synthetic approaches to 1,25D3 analogs containing the natural vitamin D triene system with emphasis on the Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed transformations involved in the formation of the vitamin D triene system and A&#8208;ring synthons.

         <title>Synthesis of Phenethylamine&#8208;Azulene Conjugates Enabled by Regioselective Ring Opening of Aziridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The BF3&#8901;OEt2&#8208;catalyzed reaction of azulene with N&#8208;protected aziridines represents a general, efficient (up to 91% yield) and regioselective approach to phenethylamine&#8208;azulene conjugates. Stereochemical studies and DFT calculations lend support to a concerted SN2&#8208;type mechanism governing the ring&#8208;opening of the aziridine.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidation of Indoles to Access Tryptanthrins at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An electrooxidative reconstruction of the indole core under ambient conditions is reported, resulting in the construction of tryptanthrins. This electrochemical strategy simplifies molecular skeleton&#8208;hopping by employing commercially available NH&#8208;indole feedstock as the starting materials. Furthermore, the synthetic value of this skeletal reconstruction was demonstrated by divergent further transformations. A preliminary mechanistic investigation involving control experiments and cyclovoltammetric studies showed the indispensability of electricity, as well as the importance of oxygen and TEMPO, thereby revealing a possible reaction pathway.

         <title>Regioselective Organocatalyzed Monochlorination of Arenes with Electrophilic Chlorosulfoniums</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
This manuscript presents a regioselective chlorination of arenes, yielding almost exclusively the monochlorinated product. It tolerates free hydroxy groups, 1&#176;, 2&#176; and 3&#176; amines, and carboxylic acids, among other polar and nonpolar functional groups, as well as mono&#8208; and polysubstituted aromatic rings. Additionally, the utilization of chlorosulfonium salts as the chlorinating agent is demonstrated. The method emerges as an alternative to other processes where organic byproducts must be separated from the reaction mixture. In addition, the main byproducts are gaseous materials such as CO and CO2. This publication introduces the application of sulfoxides, oxalyl chloride, and aqueous hydrogen peroxide as the chlorination mixture.

         <title>Dual photoredox catalysis with vanadium complexes in low oxidation state: a diastereoselective pinacol coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Dual photoredox catalysis is modifying the approach to sustainable metal&#8208;catalysis based on metals in low oxidation state, as the use of stoichiometric metal as reductants are avoided. In this study, we showcase the potential use of vanadium in a dual photoredox process, allowing us to effectively control the formation of V(II) and its corresponding chemical reactions. A diastereoselective pinacol coupling with aromatic aldehydes is described. The process shows broad scope, and interestingly, unprotected salicylic aldehydes are compatible with the reaction protocol. Additionally, among all the ligands investigated we found that inexpensive bipyridines control the diastereoselection of the reaction favouring the d,l chiral compound (dr &gt; 20:1 for most of the aldehydes investigated). To promote the reaction and avoid an unproductive and not stereoselective radical coupling of the generated ketyl radical, the use of [DMQA]+, a stable organic dye, was found crucial. Furthermore, this dye possesses the remarkable capability of efficiently capturing light in the red segment of the visible spectrum, effectively raising efficiency of the protocol. The utilization of red light carries notable advantages in terms of penetration and safety, making it particularly significant. Moreover, careful photophysical investigations were able to give indications about the mechanism of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;Allenynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first Ni&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;allenynes. Substrates containing terminal alkynes afford cyclopentene derivatives, whereas internal alkynes lead to the formation of two consecutive C&#8208;C bonds to give fused 5&#8208;5 bicyclic compounds. The reaction shows a wide scope. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies suggest a Ni(0)&#8208;Ni(II) catalytic cycle. The reaction starts with an oxidative cyclometallation followed by a &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination. The trans arrangement of alkenyl and hydride ligands is key to allow formation of the second carbocycle.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a method for electrochemical&#8208;induced 1,3&#8208;oxohydroxylation of arylcyclopropanes with H2O as the green oxygen source. This transformation offers a regioselective route to highly functionalized &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketones under oxidant&#8208; and metal&#8208;free conditions. Notably, this electrochemical approach features high step and atom economy, simple operation, excellent regioselectivity, high functional group tolerance, and easy derivatization of the products. Mechanistic studies have provided solid evidences that 1,3&#8208;diol acts as the crucial intermediate in this reaction, leading to the observed regioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>An Organocatalytic Route to endo&#8208;Vinylene Carbonates from Carbon Dioxide&#8208;Based exo&#8208;Vinylene Carbonates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An organocatalytic route has been developed for the isomerization of exo&#8208;vinylene carbonates (exo&#8208;VCs) to endo&#8208;vinylene carbonates (endo&#8208;VCs). The exo&#8208;VC starting material can easily be obtained from propargylic alcohols via cyclization with carbon dioxide. In this study, these exo&#8208;VCs are shown to isomerize to the thermodynamically more stable endo&#8208;VCs in the presence of an N&#8208;heterocyclic base and phenol. Density functional theory (DFT) studies were conducted to elucidate the mechanism, tackling difficulties of the description of charge separation steps. This isomerization process delivers an ample diversity of endo&#8208;VCs in good to excellent yields and chemoselectivities under mild reaction conditions.

Abstract
Condensations of the title educts R4CH=CH(C=O)CH2CO2Et and R6CH=CHNO2 in the presence of NEt3 and the catalyst &#923;&#8208;[Co((S,S)&#8208;dpen)3]3+2Cl&#8722;B(C6F5)4&#8722; (both 10&#8197;mol%, 0&#8201;&#176;C; dpen=1,2&#8208;diphenylethylenediamine) afford R6CHCH(NO2)CH(R4)CH2C(OH)CCO2Et, with three contiguous carbon stereocenters, as &gt;99:1 to 85:15 mixtures of diastereomers (ten examples). The major diastereomers are isolated in 81&#8211;63% yields and 97&#8211;76% ee. When R4 and R6 are both aryl groups, additions of 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylquanidine/CH3CN epimerize the CHNO2 moieties, affording 78:22 to 67:33 mixtures of the new/old diastereomers (2&#8197;h, RT). Alternatively, epimerization to &gt;99:1 mixtures occurs spontaneously over 4 weeks in hexanes/isopropanol. These transformations entail two consecutive Michael additions, and two crystal structures confirm the relative and absolute product configurations. These assignments are supported by NMR data in solution and literature studies of similar compounds. Overall, catalyst &#923;&#8208;[Co((S,S)&#8208;dpen)3]3+2Cl&#8722;B(C6F5)4&#8722; affords superior yields and enantio&#8208; or diastereoselectivities compared to those previously reported for the title reaction.

         <title>Electrochemical Selenylation&#8208;Induced Annulation of Alkenyl Ureas to Access Cyclic Isoureas</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A direct electrosynthesis of cyclic isoureas from N&#8208;allyl ureas and diselenides has been described. This protocol proceeds without any additional catalyst and oxidant, mild reaction conditions, providing the desired products up to 91% yields. In addition, the synthesis of cyclic isoureas containing five to seven&#8208;membered rings has also been achieved by the employment of this strategy. On the basis of the mechanism experiments and previous research works, a probable mechanism is proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating chemocatalysis and enzyme engineering for coproduction of bioplastic precursors butanediol and succinic acid from xylose</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polybutylene succinate (PBS) is one of the most important biobased plastics, based on the amount produced. Owing to its high melting point and resemblance to petroleum&#8208;based plastics (i.e. PP), PBS becomes one the emerging bioplastics with an array of applications. PBS is manufactured by polymerization of 1,4&#8208;butanediol and succinic acid. Thus, it is of great importance to ensure the use of renewable resources to produce the PBS precursors. As the second most abundant carbohydrate monomer on Earth, D&#8208;xylose will be a suitable candidate for this purpose. In this work, we combined protein engineering with chemical oxidation by gold catalyst to enable transformation of D&#8208;xylose to 1,4&#8208;butanediol and succinate simultaneously. In silico docking studies and semi rational design were employed to create variants of the key enzyme, branched chain &#945;&#8208;keto acid decarboxylase (KdcA) with higher affinity 	for the intermediates in the production of 1,4 butanediol and succinate. Direct enzymatic biotransformation would result in a production of both monomers with 3:1 ratio, thus not readily suitable for a direct polymerization to PBS. By developing a one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;step chemo&#8208;enzymatic approach with a gold catalyst to perform the first oxidation step, we could achieve a final product ratio of 1:1. Application of an engineered KdcA variant allowed us to achieve &gt;98% yield after four hours transformation. In contrast, after 24 h transformation, &gt;10% intermediate was still observed when the original variant was used. We anticipate this new approach could serve as an alternative route for biotechnological productions of PBS and its precursors.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Coupling Reaction of Cyclopropanols with Electrophilic Alkenes Enabled by Decatungstate as Photoredox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
We introduce a methodology for the photocatalytic generation of &#946;&#8208;ketoalkyl radicals from tertiary cyclopropanols, utilizing tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as a photoredox catalyst. The application is demonstrated by the synthesis of distantly functionalized ketones via the redox&#8208;neutral addition of the cyclopropanol&#8208;derived &#946;&#8208;ketoalkyl radicals to the double bond of electrophilic olefins. The transformation occurs under ambient temperature conditions and is suitable for coupling a wide range of cyclopropanol and alkene substrates. This was demonstrated by the preparation of 33 ketone products with 35&#8211;92% yield. The method's preparative robustness has been validated through upscaled preparations conducted under continuous flow conditions. Mechanistic investigations support the role of TBADT as a photoredox catalyst, which facilitates the single electron oxidation of cyclopropanols, followed by the electron transfer from the reduced form of decatungstate to the electrophilic double bond of alkene. Moreover, we found that electron&#8208;rich aromatic cyclopropanols and electron&#8208;deficient olefins form photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes. This property allows the reaction to proceed under UV light irradiation via the photoinduced charge transfer in the absence of the photocatalyst.

         <title>Electrochemical Annulation of ortho&#8208;Alkynylbiphenyls to Fused Sulfenyl Phenanthrenes and Spiro Cyclohexenone Indenes</title>

Abstract
Here, we present an electrochemically induced synthesis of 9&#8208;sulfenylarylphenanthrenes and 3&#8217;&#8208;sulfenylarylspiro&#8208;cyclohexa[4.5]trienones starting from o&#8208;alkynylbiphenyls and diaryl disulfides. This method was accomplished through constant current electrolysis of 10&#8197;mA in an undivided cell setup by utilizing CH3CN as a solvent and LiClO4 as an electrolyte at room temperature. Notably, the present strategy enabled the formation of sulfenylphenanthrenes and sulfenyl spiro cyclohexa[4.5]trienones in 70%&#8211;95% yield. Scale&#8208;up synthesis, mechanistic studies, and cyclic voltammetry have also been carried out.

Abstract
Spirooxindoles are privileged scaffolds in diverse bioactive natural products and pharmaceuticals, significant achievements for the construction of these molecules have thus been made in the past years. Among them, organocatalysis, in particular, nucleophilic Lewis base catalysis, has recently emerged as an efficient and reliable method for the preparation of diverse and valuable functionalized spirooxindoles. According to different kinds of nucleophilic catalysts, we summarize and classify three catalytic strategies; these are tertiary amine&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions, NHC&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions, and tertiary phosphine&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions, respectively. Through these methods, potential bioactive spirooxindole skeletons owning various functional groups can be produced to enrich the small organic molecule library. In this review, we describe a comprehensive and updated advances of nucleophilic Lewis base catalytic cycloaddition reactions for the construction of spirooxindoles. Meanwhile, the related mechanism and the application of these annulation strategies in natural product total synthesis will be highlighted in detail.

Abstract
Palladium catalyzed S&#8208;allylation of vinyl carbinols from ionones (or conjugated carbonyls) with 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzothiazole (BT&#8208;SH) provides versatile C15 dienyl benzothiazolyl (BT) sulfides. This Pd(dppe)Cl2&#8208;catalyzed S&#8208;allylation is highly selective for free allylic alcohols in the presence of allylic acetates, resulting in 3&#8208; or 4&#8208;acetoxy C15 dienyl BT&#8208;sulfides suitable for xanthophyll synthesis. The corresponding C15 dienyl BT&#8208;sulfones undergo Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination reactions with C10 2,7&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;octatrienedial under mild conditions to produce carotenoids natural products. Efficient synthesis is achieved for a range of carotenoids including xanthophylls such as iso&#8208;zeaxanthin, zeaxanthin, and lutein as well as carotenes like &#946;&#8208;carotene, &#1013;&#8208;carotene, and 9&#8242;&#8208;Z&#8208;phenyl&#8208;carotene.

This Pd(dppe)Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-allylation is highly selective for free allylic alcohols in the presence of allylic acetates, resulting in 3- or 4-acetoxy C&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; dienyl BT-sulfides suitable for xanthophyll synthesis. The corresponding C&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; dienyl BT-sulfones undergo Julia-Kocienski olefination reactions with C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; 2,7-dimethyl-2,4,6-octatrienedial under mild conditions to produce carotenoids natural products. Efficient synthesis is achieved for a range of carotenoids including xanthophylls such as iso-zeaxanthin, zeaxanthin, and lutein as well as carotenes like &#946;-carotene, &#1013;-carotene, and 9&#8242;-&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-phenyl-carotene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>1,6&#8208;Addition Reactions of Difluoroenol Silyl Ethers with Benzoquinones and Quinonediimines To Access Difluorooxymethyl and Difluoroaminomethyl Compounds</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
The etherification and amination of difluoroenol silyl ethers with benzoquinones and quinonediimines were achieved by using hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as the solvent. This 1,6&#8208;addition reaction could construct difluorooxymethyl and difluoroaminomethyl compounds under metal&#8208;free conditions. It is preliminarily speculated that the reaction took place through a single electron transfer (SET) process.

         <title>Blue Light&#8208;Promoted Synthesis of Thiochromenopyrroledione Derivatives via Titanium Dioxide&#8208;Catalyzed Dual Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bond Formation with Thioanisole and Maleimide Derivatives</title>

Abstract
Under anaerobic conditions, thioanisole derivatives bearing a thiomethyl group participated in dual carbon&#8208;carbon bond&#8208;forming reactions with maleimide derivatives in the presence of titanium dioxide. Blue light irradiation facilitated these reactions, producing thiochromenopyrroledione derivatives and nearly equimolar quantities of succinimide derivatives. Specifically, a thiochromenopyrroledione derivative formed from thioanisole and N&#8208;benzylmaleimide was achieved with a 43% yield after 12&#8197;hours of blue light exposure (&gt;420&#8197;nm), approaching its theoretical maximum yield of 50%. Without titanium dioxide, the reaction remained dormant. Our investigations with five varieties of 4&#8208;substituted thioanisoles and four N&#8208;substituted maleimides as precursors resulted in the synthesis of 20 distinct thiochromenopyrroledione derivatives with moderate to high yields. From observed substituent effects, we postulate that this reaction proceeds through a charge transfer from thioanisole to the conduction band of titanium dioxide during blue light irradiation, initiating the one&#8208;electron oxidation of thioanisole and subsequent generation of &#945;&#8208;thioalkyl radicals via deprotonation.

Abstract
In this study, we developed a process for the [2+1+3] cyclization of 2&#8208;methylbenzothiazole salts, aldehydes and amidine hydrochlorides, which allows rapid synthesis of 1,3&#8208;diazaphenothiazines with moderate to good yields. The use of ethanol as solvent, oxygen as the terminal oxidant, mild reaction conditions, good functionality tolerance show the promising application in organic synthesis.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Eosin Y&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Type Sulfonylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A strategy for sulfonylation of boronic acids with sulfonyl chlorides has been established via Suzuki&#8208;type radical cross&#8208;coupling. This approach allows for the synthesis of more than 50 sulfone examples enabled by photoredox catalysis under visible light radiation. Moreover, the title reaction is applied in late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules, and further transformation of the resulting sulfones into 2&#8208;functionalized sulfones, borates, triphenylphosphine oxide and N&#8208;arylcarbazole can be also achieved.

Abstract
The air mediated radical alkylation of cyclic aldimines via autoxidation of alkylboronic acids has been realized under mild reaction conditions. By simply heating cyclic aldimines with alkylboronic acid using air as sole oxidant, this protocol provides a catalyst&#8208;free access to a variety of alkylated cyclic aldimines with 21&#8211;91% yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that a radical pathway might be involved in the reaction.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Syntheses of Flavonoids and Cannabinoids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Flavonoids and cannabinoids comprise two large families of natural products that contain a chromane moiety in their structure. Their therapeutic potential has been extensively investigated as potential treatments to several diseases, ranging from cancer to infectious and neurodegenerative diseases. Despite their relative structural simplicity, in recent years creative synthetic methodologies were designed to overcome limitations from the previous synthetic strategies applied to these compounds. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of all the enantioselective organocatalytic strategies that have been applied to the synthesis of flavonoids and cannabinoids to date.

Abstract
C10a&#8208;Acetoxylated perhydroazepino[1,2&#8208;a]&#8208;indoles, accessible via visible light&#8208;mediated sensitized photooxygenation of cyclo&#8208;hepta[b]indoles, are precursors to structurally elaborate carbon&#8208;centered radicals. Their photoredox&#8208;catalyzed SET reduction by phenothiazine or phenoxazine photocatalysts, followed by fragmentation and C&#8722;O bond cleavage, liberates tricyclic &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals that readily engage in radical addition reactions with silyl enol ethers and silyl ketene acetals. The C&#8722;C functionalized azepinoindole[1,2&#8208;a]indoles are useful building blocks for the synthesis of polycyclic indole derivatives as shown by the controlled borohydride reduction of a C10a&#8208;methylenecarboxylate derivative, which leads stereoselectively to tetracyclic azepino[1,2&#8208;a]furo[3,2&#8208;b]indoles. The photocatalytic method developed herein is also suitable for the radical functionalization of simple &#945;&#8208;acetoxy acetophenones.

         <title>Selective Catalysts for the Homogeneous Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An efficient and highly selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of terminal alkynes to alkenes using neutral dimeric rhodium(I) complexes of the type [Rh(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(PP)]2 is presented. Dehydroisophytol (DIP) was chosen as the alkyne for this study because of its high importance in the industrial production of synthetic vitamin E. Excellent selectivity of over 91% towards the alkene was achieved with known and new rhodium catalysts. No deactivation was observed for the [Rh(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(PP)]2 complexes and the molar Rh:DIP ratio could be increased to 1:20 000, and importantly, no reduction in selectivity was observed. The results presented open the door to the industrial application of homogeneous rhodium complexes in the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of terminal alkynes.

         <title>Domino Reactions with Dicyanoalkenes and Fluorinated Conjugated Sulfinyl Imines. A Convenient Strategy for the Generation of Structural Diversity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Dicyanoalkenes are versatile reagents in organic synthesis and they have been extensively used in a wide variety of organic transformations. However, their reactivity towards fluorinated imines remained almost unnoticed. The divergent reactivity of fluorinated conjugated sulfinyl imines with dicyanoalkenes is described herein. On the one hand, when tert&#8208;butyl sulfinyl imines were employed, a cycloaromatization cascade process took place preferentially, rendering valuable trifluoromethyl arenes. On the other hand, the reaction with p&#8208;tolyl sulfinyl imines mainly led to a complex tetracyclic skeleton, involving an azetidinimine rearrangement of a reaction intermediate. Finally, when 1&#8208;indanone&#8208;derived dicyanoalkenes were employed, the aromatization process was interrupted, rendering a new family of diene derivatives. Theoretical calculations were performed in order to shed light on the mechanistic outcome of this transformation.

         <title>The Intermolecular Pauson&#8208;Khand Reaction: Applications, Challenges and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid assembly of complex organic molecules from simple and structurally diverse building blocks is a prevalent challenge in organic synthesis. The Pauson&#8208;Khand reaction (PKR) is a method of choice for the construction of five membered rings that has historically been popularized as a late&#8208;stage intramolecular cyclization method. The intermo&#8208;lecular version of the PKR, on the other hand, constitutes a powerful approach for the rapid assembly of densely func&#8208;tionalized cyclopentanic cores at early stages of a synthetic sequence. Despite its potential, the intermolecular PKR is much less prevalent in the organic synthesis literature due to several historical limitations, most importantly a reduced scope with respect to the alkene component of the reaction.
The last decade has witnessed important developments in the area including a) experimental and theoretical studies that provide a good mechanistic understanding of the reac&#8208;tion and its selectivity, b) methodological developments that have broadened the scope of potential alkene part&#8208;ners, and c) the development of catalytic enantioselective versions that provide useful levels of enantioselectivity. In parallel, remarkable synthetic applications of the intermo&#8208;lecular PKR have emerged, including (enantioselective) total syntheses of complex natural products (polycyclic terpenes, alkaloids, prostanes) as well as examples of in&#8208;dustrial relevance.
A fundamental limitation of the PKR that needs to be ad&#8208;dressed in the future is the current lack of a ligand&#8208;accelerated version of the reaction, which would be a promising advance towards developing more efficient and general catalytic (enantioselective) reactions.

         <title>Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloaddition of C60 with Enynes. Unveiling the Mechanistic Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study we present a method for functionalizing C60 through a Rh&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction with 1,6&#8208;enynes, resulting in the formation of a fused bicyclic structure. Additionally, fullerene derivatives are further functionalized through regioselective photooxygenation reactions. Our DFT calculations reveal two distinct reaction pathways: one involving rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of the enyne followed by Diels&#8208;Alder with C60, and the other featuring a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of enyne and C60 followed by isomerization. Surprisingly, both pathways exhibit nearly identical energy barriers. However, experimental tests indicate that the predominant pathway varies depending on the substitution motifs of the substrates.</dc:description>

Abstract
An array of enantioenriched vinyl boronates bearing an allylic carbonate moiety have been prepared through selective hydroboration of propargyl carbonates. Treatment of these vinyl boronates with TBAF in THF affords enantioenriched 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allenes through a novel 1,2&#8208;anti elimination in good yields and high enantiospecificities.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light induced approach has enabled the synthesis of 3&#8208;alkyl indole from ynones via Csp3&#8722;H bond functionalization. This protocol proceeded under base&#8208;free conditions andat room temperature, providing a series of 3&#8208;alkyl indole motifs in 39% to 90% yields (44 examples). Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that a radical process should be involved in this transformation.

The front cover picture illustrates gold&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling of N&#8208;hydroxy phthalimide esters and disilanes or diborons to give organosilicon and organoboron compounds. In these reactions, gold nanoparticles functioned as single&#8208;electron transfer catalysts, which enabled the generation of alkyl radical and silyl radical, thereby enabling radical cross&#8208;coupling. The unique nature of supported gold catalyst enables the practical transformation of carboxylic acid derivatives into value&#8208;added organosilicon and organoboron compounds.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of Alkenyl Iodide</title>

Abstract
Alkenyl iodide, as an essential precursor and structural unit in organic synthesis, has been widely used in the synthesis of natural products, pharmaceutical pesticides and functional materials. The high reactivity of the Csp2&#8722;I bond enables the formation of a C&#8722;M bond through oxidative addition, followed by subsequent transformations of the C&#8722;M bond to create new chemical bonds. A variety of valuable scaffolds, in particular the cyclic motifs, could be achieved via designing and synthesis the corresponding alkenyl iodide, which makes this strategy to be a hot topic in synthetic chemistry. In this paper, the recent progresses of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclizationof alkenyl iodides are summarized, and the possible mechanisms for most transformations are described in detail.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Anisidines by Controlling Cu&#8208;Catalyzed [1,3]&#8208;Methoxy Rearrangement</title>

Abstract
A divergent synthesis of ortho&#8208;anisidines was achieved by controlling Cu&#8208;catalyzed [1,3]&#8208;methoxy rearrangement. The reactions of N&#8208;alkoxyanilines having an electron&#8208;donating group (EDG), such as an alkyl or anisyl group, at the ortho position and a pivaloyl group on the nitrogen atom in the presence of catalytic amounts of IPrMeCuCl and AgNTf2 afforded the corresponding 6&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;anisidines with good product selectivity through a [1,3]&#8208;rearrangement of the methoxy group to the unsubstituted ortho position. In contrast, the reactions of N&#8208; methoxyanilines having a benzyloxycarbonyl group on the nitrogen atom using IPrCuBr and AgBF4 as catalysts afforded 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;anisidines via a domino process involving a [1,3]&#8208;rearrangement of the methoxy group to the EDG&#8208;substituted ortho position followed by a [1,2]&#8208;rearrangement of the EDG of the resulting ortho&#8208;quinol imine intermediate.

Abstract
We demonstrate a photocatalyst and transition metal catalyst free photo&#8208;activation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones in visible light in the presence of an acid catalyst. The photoactivated quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one species transfers its energy to oxygen which promotes C&#8722;N cross dehydrogenative coupling with nucleophilic partners such as carbazoles, azoles and amides giving the products in 42&#8211;75% yields. Preliminary studies reveal quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one&#8208;carbazole adducts to display fluorescent properties including Intramolecular Charge Transfer (ICT) and Aggregate Induced Emission (AIE).

Abstract
A photocatalytic reaction of N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;methacryloylbenzamides with monoalkyl oxalates is described. Monoalkyl oxalates undergo single&#8208;electron oxidation/CO2 extrusion to generate alkoxycarbonyl radicals, followed by the addition and subsequent cyclization to give alkoxycarbonyl substituted isoquinolinediones. A wide variety of monoalkyl oxalates were amenable in this protocol, affording various alkoxycarbonyl substituted isoquinolinediones.

         <title>Contemporary Approaches for Amide Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Amide bond construction has garnered significant interest in recent decades due to amides being one of the most prevalent functional groups among bioactive molecules. Out of the thirty&#8208;seven new drugs approved by the FDA in 2022, eleven are small molecules containing at least one amide bond. Additionally, there are nineteen large molecules approved as new drugs, some of which have peptide structures, and therefore, also bear amide bonds. In recent years, multiple teams have embraced the challenge of developing more efficient methods for amide bond formation. This dedication has led to numerous publications appearing monthly in prestigious journals, showcasing significant advancements in this field. The primary goal of this review is to present the most viable strategies for constructing the amide bond. It is crucial to differentiate between amide bond formation and amide synthesis; hence, the focus is on describing specific methods for forming new C(O)&#8722;N bonds.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amide bond construction has garnered significant interest in recent decades due to amides being one of the most prevalent functional groups among bioactive molecules. Out of the thirty-seven new drugs approved by the FDA in 2022, eleven are small molecules containing at least one amide bond. Additionally, there are nineteen large molecules approved as new drugs, some of which have peptide structures, and therefore, also bear amide bonds. In recent years, multiple teams have embraced the challenge of developing more efficient methods for amide bond formation. This dedication has led to numerous publications appearing monthly in prestigious journals, showcasing significant advancements in this field. The primary goal of this review is to present the most viable strategies for constructing the amide bond. It is crucial to differentiate between amide bond formation and amide synthesis; hence, the focus is on describing specific methods for forming new C(O)&#8722;N bonds. In particular, this review concentrates on the methods developed within the last six years.

Abstract
2&#8208;Iminothiazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;one, 5&#8208;ethylidenethiazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;one, and thiazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thione are all medicinally relevant structures. In this work, a NaSO2CF3&#8208;promoted [2+2+1] cascade annulation reaction of CF3&#8208;imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides and isothiocyanates was reported to synthesize a variety of decorated thiazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thiones in 35&#8211;91% yields with exclusive stereoselectivity. The gram&#8208;scale reaction and further chemoselective S&#8208;alkylations demonstrated the synthetic utilities of this transformation.

         <title>General Synthesis of Alkyl Amines via Borrowing Hydrogen and Reductive Amination</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
Amines are a very important class of compounds and the selective synthesis of differently substituted primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl amines is challenging. Here we present the synthesis of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl amines from ammonia and alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and hydrogen by combining borrowing hydrogen or hydrogen autotransfer and reductive amination with hydrogen. The key is a nanostructured, bimetallic Co/Sc catalyst able to mediate both reactions or concepts efficiently. We observe a broad product scope, a very good functional group tolerance, upscaling is easily accomplished and our catalyst is reusable.

         <title>Cooperative Biocatalysis Enables Assembly of a Prenylated Indole Alkaloid</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The hapalindole&#8208;type metabolites have garnered significant interest due to their diverse biological activities and unique chemical structures. Recently, the biosynthesis of this family of indole alkaloids has been uncovered and shown to involve a rare biocatalytic Cope rearrangement. Previously, we demonstrated cis&#8208;indole isonitrile C&#8208;3 normal geranylation using FamD2. Thus, we sought to explore further the reaction potential with this substrate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) using prenyltransferases and cyclases from the hapalindole biosynthetic pathways. Here, we report a new compound derived from an unexpected biosynthetic Cope rearrangement, which expands further the scope of metabolites generated from cyanobacterial Stig cyclases.

Abstract
A concise method for the synthesis furan and benzene fused 2&#8208;tetralones via photo&#8208;induced rearrangement of 2&#8242;&#8208;(furan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;ols was developed. Under argon atmosphere and room temperature, 6,7&#8208;dihydrophenanthro[9,10&#8208;b]furan&#8208;5(4H)&#8208;ones were obtained by irradiating 2&#8242;&#8208;(furan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;ols with a 254&#8197;nm UV lamp (64&#8197;W) in dichloromethane (DCM) for 1&#8197;hour.

Abstract
The one&#8208;pot construction of diversified sulfonyl flavones was developed by K2CO3&#8208;mediated formal (5+1) stepwise annulation of &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl o&#8208;hydroxyacetophenones with substituted nitriles under the open&#8208;flask atmosphere conditions. A plausible mechanism is proposed and discussed. This method provides intermolecular and intramolecular ring&#8208;closure via the formations of one carbon&#8208;oxygen single (C&#8722;O) bond, one carbon&#8208;carbon (C=C) double bond, and the cleavage of one carbon&#8208;nitrile triple (C&#8801;N) bond.

         <title>Primary and Secondary Amines by Flavin&#8208;Photocatalyzed Consecutive Desulfonylation and Dealkylation of Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Alkane&#8208;, arene&#8208;, and perfluoroalkanesulfonyl groups are widely used in organic synthesis to protect amino functionalities or to facilitate their installation. Protection of amino functions by a sulfonyl group to form sulfonamides is advantageous as they are easy to purify and tolerate various reaction conditions. On the other hand, sulfonyl group removal is difficult. Herein, we present a versatile metal&#8208;free photocatalytic reductive method for desulfonylation of sulfonamides and aryl sulfonates to the parent amines mediated by flavin derivatives, namely deazaisoalloxazines and deazaalloxazines, and visible light. Photocatalysis with 5&#8208;deazalloxazines is shown to even mediate the cleavage of perfluoroalkanesulfonamides (triflylamides and nonaflylamides), which is significantly more difficult than that of other sulfonamides and has previously not been achieved by photochemical means.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkane-, arene-, and perfluoroalkanesulfonyl groups are widely used in organic synthesis to protect amino functionalities or to facilitate their installation. Protection of amino functions by a sulfonyl group to form sulfonamides is advantageous as they are easy to purify and tolerate various reaction conditions. On the other hand, sulfonyl group removal is difficult. Herein, we present a versatile metal-free photocatalytic reductive method for desulfonylation of sulfonamides and aryl sulfonates to the parent amines mediated by flavin derivatives, namely deazaisoalloxazines and deazaalloxazines, and visible light. Photocatalysis with 5-deazalloxazines is shown to even mediate the cleavage of perfluoroalkanesulfonamides (triflylamides and nonaflylamides), which is significantly more difficult than that of other sulfonamides and has previously not been achieved by photochemical means. The method is shown to perform consecutive desulfonylation and dealkylation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-phenylperfluoroalkanesulfonamides affording primary anilines. This occurs via consecutive reductive and oxidative catalytic cycles mediated by the flavin catalyst. The perfluoroalkylsulfonyl group fulfils a dual role serving as a protecting group and, after removal by the reductive cycle, as the species driving the oxidative dealkylation reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>An operationally simple anhydrous carbene insertion reaction to construct DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DEL) is reported. The developed reaction employs visible light photolysis of diazo compounds and Reversible Adsorption to Solid Support (RASS) strategy. From readily available amines, alcohols, phenols, and carboxylic acids, a variety of high&#8208;value molecules, including useful unnatural amino acids, ethers, and esters, promising clinical drug derivatives, and bioactive molecules have been constructed.</dc:description>
