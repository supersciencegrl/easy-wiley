Abstract
Quinolines are ubiquitous heterocyclic aromatic scaffolds, which can be found in many natural and synthetic products. They are highly valued for their pharmacological and electrochemical properties, encouraging the discovery of new routes for quinoline synthesis and diversification. In particular, polyaryl&#8208;substituted quinolines have recently surged as useful substrates for a wide variety of applications, yet their synthetic routes remain difficult and inefficient. Herein, we report a rapid and novel mechanochemical Friedl&#228;nder synthesis of polyaryl&#8208;substituted quinolines under basic conditions using ball milling. The optimized reaction conditions resulted in moderate to excellent yields ranging from 48% to &gt;95% and demonstrated broad functional group tolerance at 1&#8197;hour reaction times. We further show a new route for the synthesis of photocatalyst DPQN2,4&#8722;di&#8722;OMe and photo&#8208;ligand PPQN2,4&#8722;di&#8722;OMe as well as OLED donor&#8208;acceptor pCzPPQ, electron transport material oligoquinoline TQB and organic semiconductor DPA. A gram scale reaction was also achieved using Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM), providing an isolated yield of 87% after a simple recrystallization in ethanol.

Abstract
Scarce dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazinoisoindole framework bearing two points of diversity was prepared through a cascade process based on concomitant Csp3&#8722;N and Csp2&#8722;N bond formation. This approach consists of an amidation in basic medium of a tosyl group by nucleophilic substitution followed by Cu&#8208;mediated Goldberg reaction in the same operation. The required &#946;&#8208;bromoenamide bearing a tosyl group was obtained by tosylation of fused brominated N,O&#8208;acetals for the first time in acidic medium using submolar amounts of PTSA. The obtained piperazines are useful building blocks as illustrated by the formation of a pentacyclic product via the intramolecular interception of the enamide function.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Interaction Enabled Ru(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of (Multi)&#8208;Substituted Pyridines</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a cost&#8208;effective synthesis of various multi&#8208;substituted pyridine derivatives, especially 2&#8208;aryl pyridines, using secondary alcohols and 1,3&#8208;diol as the primary feedstock with ammonium acetate serving as nitrogen donor, catalyzed by a new well&#8208;defined singlet mono&#8208;radical Ru(III)&#8208;catalyst featuring a cyclopentadienyl group, one PPh3, and a redox&#8208;active scaffold &#8722;N1&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine having a pendant &#8208;NH2 arm. The &#8208;NH2 arm of the catalyst facilitates the generation of the critical reactive intermediates by enhancing the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon center of the diols or diketones by forming hydrogen bonds, making it more catalytically effective over the similar other Ru&#8208;catalysts having no pendant &#8208;NH2 arm. The Ru&#8208;catalyst also functionalizes 2&#8208;aryl pyridine moieties with different coupling partners, such as aryl iodides, terminal alkynes, and styrene derivatives at the o&#8208;position of the phenyl ring.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling between Alkylidenecyclopropanes and Boronic Acids</title>

Abstract
The combination of a Pd(0) source and a phosphoramidite ligand promotes a formal allylic cross&#8208;coupling between alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) and boronic acids to yield synthetically appealing 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes. Remarkably, the reaction proceeds both under neutral and basic conditions, and works with both aryl&#8208; and alkenylboronic acids. DFT calculations suggest that the reaction entails a C&#8722;C activation/protonation mechanism instead of a hydropalladation pathway, which has been frequently proposed for other metal&#8208;promoted hydrofunctionalizations of ACPs.

         <title>Oxidation State and Halogen Influence on the NHC&#8208;Gold&#8208;Halide&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of Propargylic Amides</title>

Abstract
The homogeneously catalyzed cycloisomerization reaction of propargylic amides was tested as benchmark reaction for two homologous series of Au(I) and Au(III) complexes with NHC ligands. This reaction is known to afford either aromatic oxazoles or dihydrooxazoles, depending on the oxidation state of the applied gold catalysts. For this purpose, symmetric and unsymmetric NHC ligands with mixed alkyl or benzyl substituents (1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;imidazolyl&#8208;2yl or 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;imidazolyl&#8208;2&#8208;yl) and the corresponding Au(I) and Au(III) derivatives were prepared and characterized by analytical methods, IR and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies, and by X&#8208;ray diffraction methods. Ten NHC&#8208;gold(I) and NHC&#8208;gold(III) complexes were tested on the cyclization reactions by adding gold catalysts in the presence and absence of AgPF6. Noteworthy, only the 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;gold(III) trichloride was able to give selectively the aromatic oxazole without the addition of the silver salt. Interestingly, on contrary to what is reported in the literature, the use of gold(I) or gold(III) complexes does not influence the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reaction, while the halide bound to the metal does. In this regard, a mechanism purposing the dihydrooxazole as an intermediate for the formation of aromatic oxazole is proposed.

&lt;p&gt;The homogeneously catalyzed cycloisomerization reaction of propargylic amides was tested as benchmark reaction for two homologous series of Au(I) and Au(III) complexes with NHC ligands. This reaction is known to afford either aromatic oxazoles or dihydrooxazoles, depending on the oxidation state of the applied gold catalysts. For this purpose, symmetric and unsymmetric NHC ligands with mixed alkyl or benzyl substituents (1,3-dimethyl-imidazolyl-2yl or 1-benzyl-3-methyl-imidazolyl-2-yl) and the corresponding Au(I) and Au(III) derivatives were prepared and characterized by analytical methods, IR and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR spectroscopies, and by X-ray diffraction methods. Ten NHC-gold(I) and NHC-gold(III) complexes were tested on the cyclization reactions by adding gold catalysts in the presence and absence of AgPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Noteworthy, only the 1-benzyl-3-methyl-gold(III) trichloride was able to give selectively the aromatic oxazole without the addition of the silver salt. Interestingly, on contrary to what is reported in the literature, the use of gold(I) or gold(III) complexes does not influence the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reaction, while the halide bound to the metal does. In this regard, a mechanism purposing the dihydrooxazole as an intermediate for the formation of aromatic oxazole is proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Trimethyl phosphite promotes the synthesis of 2,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted 2H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. The protocol developed affords a two&#8208;step method towards triazoles from available reagents. 3,4&#8208;Disubstituted isoxazolones are initially coupled with diazonium tetrafluoroborates. The subsequent reaction is triggered by a single electron transfer from the phosphite to the diazenylisoxazolone under heating or blue LED irradiation at room temperature. The radical anion cascade proceeds via a ring opening/decarboxylation/cyclization sequence. The synthesized triazoles show promising fluorescence in the region from 340&#8197;nm to 450&#8197;nm with a quantum yield up to 81.6%. The emission energy depends slightly on the substituent nature at the triazole carbon atoms. If an electron&#8208;donor group is introduced into the N2 substituent of the triazole ring, it results in a bathochromic shift of the luminescence energy.

Abstract
The versatile reactivity of propargylic epoxides and alcohols, due to the presence of a triple bond, is used in the synthesis of various organic compounds and building blocks. However, there are not many known methods for the preparation of optically pure propargylic epoxides and alcohols, and the existing ones often require specific reagents. Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) can be used to obtain enantiomerically pure compounds from racemic epoxides. These important biocatalysts facilitate epoxide ring&#8208;opening reactions with unnatural nucleophiles such as azides. Here we report the biocatalytic transformation of propargylic epoxides using HHDHs. Six propargylic epoxides with different substituents were synthesized. Kinetic resolution reactions catalyzed by HHDHs in the presence of azide were performed. Two enzymes with opposite stereoselectivities, HheC and HheA2&#8208;N178A were used and yielded azido alcohols (98&#8211;&gt;99% ee, E&#8208;value &gt;200) and epoxides (29&#8211;88% ee). The best performing p&#8208;tolyl propargylic epoxide derivative was used in a sequence of two enzymatic reactions to obtain both enantiomers of the &#946;&#8208;azido alcohol and the (R)&#8208;enantiomer of the &#945;&#8208;azido alcohol, each in &gt;99% ee, through complete conversion of the starting epoxide. The obtained azido alcohols were used in further transformations. The click reactions with terminal acetylenes gave triazolyl propargylic alcohols (&gt;99% ee, 90&#8211;98% yield). In the case of the &#945;&#8208;azido alcohol, the click reaction was followed by intramolecular cyclization to form the dihydrofuranyl triazole motif that is found in biologically active compounds.

Abstract
Synthetic electrochemistry may establish direct routes to a preparation of a plethora of organic substances, which are hardly accessible by conventional experimental techniques. Herein, we present an electrochemically&#8208;driven method for an assembly of a broad range of rare heterocyclic mesoionic entities &#8211;1,2,3&#8208;triazole 1&#8208;imines. These nitrogen heterocycles were prepared through a transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and exogenous oxidant&#8208;free strategy using a C/Ni electrode pair. Over 30 examples of thus synthesized 1,2,3&#8208;triazole 1&#8208;imines illustrate selectivity and practical utility of this approach. Key solvent&#8208;controlled reactivity patterns for the formation of the triazole imine scaffold were revealed indicating a modulation ability of the developed approach. These experimental findings were additionally justified based on cyclic voltammetry (CV) data and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover, according to differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data, some of the prepared 1,2,3&#8208;triazole 1&#8208;imines correspond to the thermally stable species with an onset decomposition temperature up to 190&#8201;&#176;C.

Abstract
Chiral tetrahydrofurans are prevalent structural motifs in biologically active compounds, approved drugs and natural products, but relevant enantiocomplementary synthesis remains underdeveloped. In this study, wild type halohydrin dehalogenase HheC from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1, was first discovered to enable the intramolecular substitution of &#948;&#8208;halohydrins for the formation of tetrahydrofurans but with unsatisfied activity and stereoselectivity. Through structure&#8208;guided protein engineering, two completely enantiocomplementary variants T134M and P84L/W139A of HheC were obtained for the synthesis of tetrahydrofurans by the kinetic resolution of &#948;&#8208;halohydrins (both giving products with up to 99% e.e., E&gt;200). This research unveiled the halohydrin dehalogenases&#8217; catalytic ability to form chiral cyclic ethers larger ring size than three&#8208;membered epoxides, which has hitherto been unexplored, and provided an enzymatic synthesis access to valuably enantiocomplementary tetrahydrofurans.

Abstract
Herein, catalytic difunctionalization of vinyl arenes is reported using an iron salt as a catalyst without ligands. A series of substituted alkylboronic acid esters was obtained as a single regioisomer from vinyl arenes at 50&#8201;&#176;C. This multicomponent protocol enabled the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;B bonds to produce boroalkylated products in a single process. A non&#8208;radical pathway is proposed for the reaction in contrast to the radical pathways of iron&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation reactions. The organoboron compounds generated from this reaction were further utilized for diverse functional group conversions.

Abstract
When &#947;,&#948;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters were treated with 3&#8197;equiv. of aliphatic Grignard reagents in the presence of 10 and 20&#8197;mol% FeCl2 and N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine, regio&#8208; and stereoselective substitution of the epoxide moiety with the aliphatic Grignard reagent occurred, producing exclusively &#948;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#947;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters. Similarly, &#947;,&#948;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;&#945;,&#946;,&#1013;,&#950;&#8208;unsaturated esters and amides underwent transformation to the corresponding &#948;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#947;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#945;,&#946;,&#1013;,&#950;&#8208;unsaturated esters and amides as single isomers, respectively.

Abstract
Photo&#8208;promoted cyanomethyl radical procedures for the preparation of 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;indenes and 2,8&#8208;dihydrocyclopenta[a]indenes from phenyl&#8208;linked 1,6&#8208;enynes with &#945;&#8208;halogenated acetonitriles are reported. The iodocyanomethylation/cyclization is performed via an atom&#8208;transfer radical addition (ATRA) strategy under photocatalyst&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. In particular, the photoinduced cyanomethylative cascade bicyclization is carried out under the fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3/Na2CO3 catalystic symtem and visible light irradiation. These methods offer a one&#8208;step and atom&#8208;economical access to diverse cyano&#8208;group containing five&#8208;membered rings with broad substrate scope and high selectivity. A plausible reaction mechanism is also proposed.

Abstract
A method for the reductive difluoromethylation of alkenes with 2&#8208;difluoromethylthio(benzothiazole) under photocatalytic conditions is described. The reaction involves the generation of the difluoromethyl radical by means of trimethyltriazinane, which serves as a precursor for the strongly reducing cyclic diaminoalkyl radical.

Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed inert C&#8722;H bond functionalization using sulfoxonium ylides as metal carbene surrogates to replace the explosive and labile diazo compounds is synthetically attractive. Presented herein is a divergent synthesis of (CF3)&#8208;indazolo[3,2&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives based on C&#8722;H bond activation&#8208;initiated cascade reactions of 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;1H&#8208;indazoles with sulfoxonium ylides. The formation of products involves Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H bond metalation, carbene formation, migratory insertion, proto&#8208;demetalation and intramolecular condensation. In general, this newly developed protocol features simple substrates, structurally diverse products, step&#8208;economy and scalability. In addition, evaluation of the photophysical properties and anti&#8208;proliferative activity against three human cancer cell lines of the products thus obtained showed that some of them possess potent anticancer activity with potential self&#8208;tracking capability through fluorescence detection.

Abstract
An Yb(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed [2+2] cycloaddition /retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE)/bicyclization of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoarylaklynyl)&#8208;naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ols and 3&#8208;alkylideneoxindoles is reported, enabling a direct C=C bond cleavage&#8208;reassembly process to regioselectively synthesize a variety of quinoline&#8208;tethered benzo[5,6]chromeno[2,3&#8208;b]indoles in 31&#8211;84% yields. Exchanging the amino group for a hydroxyl group in the arylalkynyl unit of the naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol substrate resulted in chromenyl chromeno[2,3&#8208;b]indoles via a similar cascade process.

&lt;p&gt;An Yb(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed [2+2] cycloaddition /retro-electrocyclization (CA-RE)/bicyclization of 1-(2-aminoarylaklynyl)-naphthalen-2-ols and 3-alkylideneoxindoles is reported, enabling a direct C=C bond cleavage-reassembly process to regioselectively synthesize a variety of quinoline-tethered benzo[5,6]chromeno[2,3-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]indoles in 31&#8211;84% yields. Exchanging the amino group for a hydroxyl group in the arylalkynyl unit of the naphthalen-2-ol substrate resulted in chromenyl chromeno[2,3-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]indoles &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; a similar cascade process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
An expedient strategy for the construction of trifluoromethylselenolated spiro[5.5]trienones/spiro[4.5]trienones through a cascade electrophilic trifluoromethylselenolation cyclization and dearomatization has been developed. This sequential process was induced by N&#8208;trifluoromethylselenophthalimide (Phth&#8208;SeCF3), which was an efficient electrophilic trifluoromethylselenolation reagent. This approach has the feature of mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and high functional group tolerance.

Abstract
The fungal natural product aspergillomarasmine A (AMA) is an inhibitor of metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamases and a promising co&#8208;drug candidate for reversing bacterial &#946;&#8208;lactam resistance. The biosynthesis of AMA from L&#8208;Asp and O&#8208;phospho&#8208;L&#8208;serine is catalyzed by AMA synthase, which possesses high synthetic potential for the biocatalytic preparation of AMA and related aminopolycarboxylic acids. Here, we identified and structurally characterized an AMA synthase from Pyrenophora teres f. teres 0&#8211;1 (PteAMAS). Crystallographic analysis revealed a unique homotetrameric fold and a highly hydrophilic active site, which supports the PLP&#8208;dependent &#946;&#8208;replacement catalytic mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of PteAMAS for the biocatalytic synthesis of AMA and its analogues, achieving structural diversification of the APA1 moiety through a modular two&#8208;enzyme system involving PteAMAS and a selective C&#8722;N lyase, namely EDDS lyase or 3&#8208;methylaspartate ammonia lyase variant MAL&#8722;Q73&#8197;A. In addition, we exhibited the usefulness of PteAMAS for convenient synthesis of various S&#8208;alkyl, &#8208;aryl, and &#8208;arylalkyl substituted L&#8208;cysteines, which are valuable non&#8208;canonical amino acids with broad pharmaceutical applications. The present study has not only provided the structural basis for catalysis and substrate recognition by PteAMAS, but also paved the way for biocatalytic preparation of structurally complex AMA analogues and various non&#8208;canonical amino acids.

Abstract
A copper or silver&#8208;catalyzed cascade addition/5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization/isomerization reaction of isothiocyanate with ynone has been developed. This strategy enables the synthesis of a variety of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene&#8208;5&#8208;aminothiophen&#8208;3&#8208;one derivatives with diverse substitutions in a single vessel. The method is featured with pot&#8208;economy as well as regio&#8208; and Z&#8208;selectivity. Several biologically active molecules could be modified using this strategy. Moreover, the relevant indole&#8208;fused and indole&#8208;substituted thiophenone derivatives were also assembled in one pot by merging this strategy with other bond formation methods. Based on the experiments and the related reports, a cascade pathway triggered by the addition of ynone&#8208;derived radical towards the C(sp)&#8208;atom of isothiocyanate was proposed to elucidate the probable process of the transformation.

Abstract
Imidazoheterocycles have extensive applications in the pharmaceutical industry and agrochemicals. A comprehensive overview has been provided on the current advancements in the electrochemical functionalization of imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycles, which have been classified into ten different types of reactions. Electrochemical synthesis has emerged as a highly effective method for producing organic molecules, especially in the context of sustainable development. Employing electrons as the traceless oxidant, several C&#8722;H functionalization reactions of imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycles have been achieved at either the C3 or C5 positions. Electrons may serve as the reducing agent to synthesize pyridine rings that are either partially or fully saturated in imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines. The purpose of the review is to attract the interest of the scientific community and promote additional research on the functionalization of imidazoheterocycles using electrochemical methods.

         <title>Recent Advances in Organocatalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane Frameworks</title>

Abstract
The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring represents an attractive yet challenging synthetic targets in the field of organic synthesis, especially in a stereocontrolled fashion. Over the past two decades, organocatalysis has emerged as an enabling technology for the facile construction of enantioenriched molecules with remarkably increasing complexity and diversity, and a myriad of chiral architectures containing bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane units were elegantly assembled through organocatalytic asymmetric transformations. This review summarizes recent advancements on this topic (mainly from 2010&#8211;2023), emphasizing the reaction types such as desymmetrization and cascade reactions of different prochiral starting materials toward various chiral bicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes as well as their aza, oxa and thio derivatives. Meanwhile, the synthetic strategy, reaction mechanism, substrate scope and synthetic applications of these catalytic reactions are also discussed. We hope that this review will motivate further development and application of organocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane frameworks.

Abstract
This article describes the development of a room&#8208;temperature visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced palladium&#8208;catalyzed directed aldehyde C&#8722;H bond arylation to access aryl quinolinyl ketones. In this pathway, the Pd catalyst plays a dual role by harvesting light as a photocatalyst and catalyzing the chemical transformation via C&#8722;H bond activation. This process is general to synthesize a range of aryl quinolinyl ketones and tolerates many common functional groups. Our methodology was successfully applied to synthesize highly potent tubulin polymerization inhibitors.

Abstract
Ruthenium (II)&#8208;catalysed regioselective C6 alkylation of indole&#8208;7&#8208;carboxamides with maleimide has been described. Electronically diverse maleimides reacted with various indoles to furnish corresponding C6 substituted succinimide derivatives of indoles with 46&#8211;89% yields. The reaction shows functional group tolerance. The synthetic utility of the reaction has been demonstrated through the conversion of the obtained product to the corresponding hexahydropyridazinyl derivative. We also studied the kinetics of the reaction through intermolecular competitive experiments with electronically distinct indole&#8208;7&#8208;carboxamides.

Abstract
Ag&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of N&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethylisatin ketimines with conjugated exocyclic double bonds including &#945;&#8208;alkylidene succinimides and aurone derivatives was developed for the first time. Using a catalyst system consisting of a ferrocenyl P,N&#8208;ligand and AgNO2, the reaction provides a facile method for the construction of chiral pyrrolidines bearing four consecutive stereocenters and two adjacent spiro&#8208;quaternary chiral centers, as well as offers a direct route to structurally diverse enantioenriched CF3&#8208;containing 3,2&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidinyl spirooxindole derivatives.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar Chiral Ferrocene Triflones</title>

Abstract
A multi&#8208;gram scale synthesis of ferrocenetriflone was optimised from ferrocenesulfonyl fluoride and Me3SiCF3 (Ruppert reagent). Enantioselective deprotolithiations were then optimised using alkyllithiums in the presence of catalytic (+)&#8208;sparteine to afford 2&#8208;substituted ferrocene triflones in 79&#8211;84% ee. The use of chiral lithium amides in the presence of in&#8197;situ traps was also optimised and was found to outperform alkyllithium&#8901;chiral diamine chelates for the first time in the ferrocene series, with 89&#8211;93% ee. Crystallisation of derivatives afforded enantiopure compounds that were engaged in deprotolithiation&#8208;electrophilic trapping sequences, a halogen &#8216;dance&#8217; reaction and transition metal&#8208;promoted coupling to afford a wide range of variously polysubstituted ferrocene triflones.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multi-gram scale synthesis of ferrocenetriflone was optimised from ferrocenesulfonyl fluoride and Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Ruppert reagent). Enantioselective deprotolithiations were then optimised using alkyllithiums in the presence of catalytic (+)-sparteine to afford 2-substituted ferrocene triflones in 79&#8211;84% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;. The use of chiral lithium amides in the presence of &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; traps was also optimised and was found to outperform alkyllithium&#8901;chiral diamine chelates for the first time in the ferrocene series, with 89&#8211;93% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;. Crystallisation of derivatives afforded enantiopure compounds that were engaged in deprotolithiation-electrophilic trapping sequences, a halogen &#8216;dance&#8217; reaction and transition metal-promoted coupling to afford a wide range of variously polysubstituted ferrocene triflones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A three&#8208;component denitrative cross&#8208;coupling reaction mediated by visible light has been developed. Various 2&#8208;arylvinyl thiophosphate compounds were synthesized with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields using cheap, nontoxic, nonvolatile, and non&#8208;hygroscopic elemental sulfur (S8) as the raw material. These transformations allow the direct formation of C&#8722;S and S&#8722;P bonds without metal catalyst via a one&#8208;pot procedure.

Abstract
In this work cascade cyclizations of vinyl sulfonium salts with either indolyl chalcones or ortho&#8208;amino trifluoroacetophenones are described. This protocol enables the assembly of fused 2,3&#8208;dihyro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles and fused tetrahydroquinolines containing a CF3&#8208;substituted tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenters.

Abstract
Herein, we report the alkylation of alkenyl carbonates using alkyl Grignard reagents and iron catalysis to generate C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds and provide synthetically useful yields over a range of substrates. The transformation allows the alkylation of a wide range of substrates, including aromatic rings, alkanes, cycloalkanes, heterocycles. This reaction has introduced a new family of electrophiles to the iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

Abstract
In this work, we present an organocatalytic spiroannulation method that provides access to spirocyclic benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;ones. The reaction proceeds via the generation of an azolium dienolate from an &#945;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde using a chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, followed by annulation with benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;one&#8208;derived alkenes. The resulting chiral spirobenzofuranone&#8208;fused cyclohexenones were obtained in 77&#8211;99% ee and dr from 1.2:1 to 20:1. The utility of the protocol was underscored by gram&#8208;scale reaction and follow&#8208;up transformations.

Abstract
A cascade regioselective 1,8&#8208;addition/biscyclization of 2&#8208;indolylmethanols with &#945;&#8208;(2&#8208;indolyl) propargylic alcohols has been developed via chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis. A series of chiral cyclopenta[4,5]pyrrolo biindoles bearing a quaternary stereogenic center were obtained in modest to good yields (72&#8211;95%) with high enantioselectivities (82&#8211;94%). Additionally, the photophysical properties of these hexacyclic bisindoles are examined, revealing bright fluorescence with high quantum yields.

Abstract
We describe a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed asymmetric [3+3] cycloaddition of N&#8208;viny oxindole nitrones with 2&#8208;indolylmethanols to prepare various spirooxindole[1,2]oxazines in 43&#8211;93% yields and 88:12&#8211;97:3 enantiomeric ratios. Experimental results revealed that the addition of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) played important roles to help CPA control the reaction reactivity and enantioselectivity. The present method features the construction of a tetrasubstituted chiral carbon stereocenter and the example of N&#8208;vinyl nitrones in asymmetric [3+3] cycloaddition.

Abstract
This study developed an electrochemically promoted skeleton transformation reaction of 2,1&#8208;benzisoxazoles to synthesize alkyl sulfones. Alkyl sulfones were synthesized in 68&#8211;93% yield by using 2,1&#8208;benzisoxazole and sulfonate as substrates, and acetonitrile and water as solvents. Mechanism studies showed that this reaction involves ring opening, removal of the oxygen atom of the 2,1&#8208;benzisoxazoles, and C(sp3)&#8208;sulfonylation under electrochemical conditions.

Abstract
TMSOTf&#8208;mediated 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig aminocyclization followed by N&#8208; to C&#8208;[1,3]&#8208;sulfonyl migration on N&#8208;homopropargyl hydroxylamines gave diastereoselective access to trisubstituted 3&#8208;sulfonyl cyclic nitrone (3&#8208;sulfonyl pyrroline N&#8208;oxide) derivatives. The synthetic utility of the 3&#8208;sulfonyl cyclic nitrone products was demonstrated through the diastereoselective synthesis of the sulfonyl&#8208;substituted nonaromatic N&#8208;heterocycles such as N&#8208;hydroxypyrrolidine, pyrrolidine&#8208;fused isoxazoline, and isoxazolidine derivatives.

Abstract
A method for the copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl bromides with a range of (DMPU)2Zn(Rf)2 reagents has been developed. This protocol tolerates multiple functional groups and provides broad access to aliphatic perfluoroalkylated compounds. The applicability of this procedure is demonstrated in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug analogues.

Abstract
A Cu/Pd&#8208;catalyzed tandem radical cyclization and C&#8722;H activation/carbene insertion of &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyls with &#945;&#8211;diazoesters has been developed for the construction of fused quinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;onescaffolds. The reaction proceeded well to afford a series of 3,5&#8208;dihydrocyclopenta[de]quinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives. Additionally, bioactive molecules such as sesamol and estrone could be modified by using this method.

Abstract
Development of a mild approach for the highly efficient synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl azoles, which are typically synthesized using high temperature, ligands and preactivated substrates, is highly desirable. Here, we report a mild and efficient photo&#8208;induced Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling to obtain C2&#8208;functionalized azoles using aryl thianthrenium salt (Ar&#8208;TTs). The reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope and an excellent functional group compatibility and serves as an ideal strategy for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals. Additionally, this method enables the efficient synthesis of azole&#8208;based polycyclic compounds.

Abstract
Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) enzymes have been extensively exploited to produce differently substituted arylalanine analogues, but their use in the stereoselective synthesis of aliphatic fatty amino acids has never been addressed. In this work, a two&#8208;step hydroamination&#8208;hydrodesulfurisation process has been investigated for the production of aliphatic L&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids from thienylacrylic acids, easily accessible by condensation from the corresponding arylaldehydes. Wild&#8208;type PALs from Planctomyces brasiliensis and Streptomyces rimosus were selected as the most promising candidates and improved by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, thus unlocking the hydroamination of a broad panel of 10 different thienylacrylic acids bearing aliphatic and aromatic substituents. The subsequent hydrodesulfurisation step, accomplished by means of inexpensive Raney nickel in mild conditions and aqueous medium, afforded the corresponding aliphatic &#945;&#8208;amino acids in 10&#8211;63% overall isolated yield and perfect enantiopurity. This chemo&#8208;enzymatic process represents the first example of aliphatic amino acid production using PALs, circumventing a major limitation of those biocatalysts.

         <title>Recent Advances in Photoredox/Chromium dual&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonyl Addition Reactions: A Review</title>

Abstract
The chromium&#8208;catalysed Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama&#8208;Kishi (NHK) reaction is a very dependable technique for alcohol synthesis and is extensively used in the complete synthesis of natural compounds. The majority of these reactions occur via a reductive&#8208;radical&#8208;polar crossover (RRPCO) mechanism, which is crucial for the transformation of reactive radical intermediates. The production of radicals using photoinduced catalytic reactions is now among the most effective approaches. The photoinduced chromium&#8208;catalysed addition reaction to carbonyl compounds is an effective technique for alcohol synthesis that integrates the benefits of photocatalysis with chromium catalysis. Photocatalysis significantly enhances the diversity of radical production, hence broadening the substrate scope in the chromium&#8208;catalysed NHK reaction. This paper primarily examines the photoredox chromium dual&#8208;catalysed carbonyl addition process for alcohol synthesis, including numerous methods for radical generation.

         <title>Photoinduced Metal&#8208;Free Hydrocarboxylation of Allylamines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we disclose a new photochemical process to prepare &#947;&#8208;amino acids from allylamines and formic acid salts. The investigated redox&#8208;neutral hydrocarboxylation process produces high yields across a wide range of functionalized allylamine substrates with excellent regioselectivity. The developed operationally simple protocol can be readily scaled with low photocatalyst loading (from 1% up to 0.02&#8197;mol%) without the need for any precautions to exclude air or moisture. The mechanistic working model utilizes a thiol&#8208;catalyzed radical chain process, delivering the hydrogen atom and CO2 from formic acid salt across the alkene substrate through the carboxylate radical (CO2&#8901;&#8722;), a crucial reactive intermediate.

         <title>Efficient Cu&#8208;catalyzed Asymmetric Alkylation and Application in the Total Synthesis of Phallotoxins and Virotoxins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric alkylation is one of the most important methods for synthesis of chiral unnatural &#945;&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;amino acids. Herein, we reported the asymmetric alkylation catalyzed by Cu/(4S,2R)&#8208;tBu&#8208;Phosferrox catalyst. This catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic performance in the asymmetric alkylation at catalyst loading as low as 1.0 mol %, giving the desired products with up to 95% yield and &gt;99% ee, which is the best results to date. Furthermore, this method was successfully applied to the scalable practical synthesize of  unnatural amino acid 4,5&#8208;OH&#8208;Leu, which could be directly used in the total syntheses of phalloidin, phallacidin, other four phallotoxins and six virotoxins.

         <title>Three&#8208; and Seven&#8208;membered Annulenones as a Lewis Base Catalyst for Enantioselective meso&#8208;Epoxide Opening
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This is the report on the Lewis base catalysis of annulenones. Additionally, the synthesis of chiral annulenone catalysts and their application in asymmetric ring&#8208;opening reactions of meso&#8208;epoxides is shown. Annulenones, such as cyclopropenones and tropones, function as Lewis bases owing to their inherent polarity caused by aromaticity, resulting in the activation of silicon tetrachloride, which catalyzes the ring&#8208;opening reaction of meso&#8208;epoxides. Moreover, various chiral annulenone catalysts have been designed and synthesized, and microwave irradiation has been shown to improve the synthetic efficiency of chiral tropones. The chiral annulenones successfully catalyzed the asymmetric ring&#8208;opening reaction of meso&#8208;epoxides, resulting in the formation of 1,2&#8208;chlorohydrins in a high yield and high enantioselectivity (up to 90% ee in 96% yield). These results represent the example of three&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered annulenones as a chiral Lewis base catalyst.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This study aims to develop a more efficient, functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant approach using stable nitroalkanes and reductive coupling reactions with aliphatic Grignard/cerium and organozinc reagents.

The reaction of tertiary nitroalkanes with organozinc reagents affords various functionalized nitrones without CuF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or CeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. These reductive coupling reactions proceed without the loss of functional groups such as alkene, alkyne, benzyl ether, chlorine, ester, and nitrile moieties. Nitrones can also be used as precursors for [3+2] cyclizations with electron&#8208;withdrawing alkenes and alkynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective hydrothiolation of terminal alkynes using half&#8208;sandwich Ni(II) catalysts bearing bidentate NHC&#8208;carboxylate ligands.</title>

         <dc:description>A half&#8208;sandwich nickel complex containing an NHC&#8208;carboxylate chelate ligand (i.e., [Ni(&#951;5&#8208;Cp)(&#954;2&#8208;C,O&#8208;NHC)]) derived from the (S)&#8208;leucine has been identified for the selective hydrothiolation of terminal acetylenes toward challenging Markovnikov&#8208;type &#120572; vinyl thioethers, even with aryl alkynes. The activity and selectivity exhibited by the nickel complex are comparable, if not superior, to those of complexes of rhodium reported to be the best catalysts to date for the Markovnikov addition in the thiol&#8208;yne reaction. The experimental data are consistent with the participation of the coordinated carboxylate group in the catalytic reaction as an intermolecular acid&#8208;base co&#8208;catalyst, favoring the formation of nickel&#8208;thiolate intermediates.</dc:description>

The experimental data are consistent with the participation of the coordinated carboxylate group in the catalytic reaction as an intermolecular acid-base co-catalyst, favoring the formation of nickel-thiolate intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report regiodivergent nucleophilic attack of Grignard reagents to 2&#8208;alkynyl aziridines. Under the catalysis of a Cu(I)&#8208;diphosphine complex, benzylic Grignard reagents add to the carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond of the aziridines to deliver &#945;&#8208;allenylamines in moderate to excellent yields; the direct addition of the Grignard reagents to the aziridines in the absence of catalyst provided	homopropargylic amine derivatives. Both reactions could proceed in highly enantiospecific ways. Further synthetic manipulations of these products enable rapid access to diverse useful heterocyclic molecular scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic C&#8722;I Bond Borylation and Phosphorylation of Diaryliodonium Salts with Excellent Atom&#8208;Economy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Highly atom&#8208;economic conversion of diaryliodonium salts represents an underdeveloped but highly desirable domain. Most reactions involving these species only utilize single aryl group of the diaryliodonium salts and produce an equivalent of aryl iodide as waste. Herein, by further transforming the side&#8208;product aryl iodide, we report an overall new two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot strategy that allows photocatalytic C&#8722;I bond borylation of diaryliodonium salts and ensures effective conversion of both aryl groups of the diaryliodonium into the relevant arylboronic esters. Mechanistic investigations suggest that electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor complex is formed between the photocatalyst phenothiazine and diaryliodonium salt substrate. Upon visible light irradiation, this complex produces aryl radical and aryl iodide. With addition of a base in the second step, the reducing ability of the photocatalyst is enhanced via proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process, thereby aryl iodide produced in the first step is reduced to yield aryl radical again. Both aryl radicals generated in the two steps react with B2(OR)4 to produce the corresponding monoarylation product in a quantitative yield. The strategy is also applicable for C&#8722;I bond phosphorylation of diaryliodonium salts, ensuring that both aryl moieties can be phosphorylated with high efficiency.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Enantioselective Intermolecular Allylation of Quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones</title>

Abstract
An enantioselective C&#8208;, O&#8208; and N&#8208; intermolecular allylic reaction of quinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones has been developed. The reaction between 3&#8208;hydroxy quinolone and Boc&#8208;protected MBH adducts with Pd&#8208;catalysis provided a series of 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diones in 20&#8211;95% yield accompanied by 69&#8211;96% enantioselectivity. In addition, the O&#8208;allylic alkylation could occur by varying the organo&#8208;catalyst and Boc&#8208;protected MBH adducts from benzaldehyde. Furthermore, the N&#8208;allylation of 3&#8208;O&#8208;protected quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones with allylic acetates was also realized (40&#8211;92% yield, 78&#8211;97% ee).

         <title>Regioselective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Protoboration of Alkynes</title>

Abstract
A regioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed protoboration of alkynes has been developed, utilizing diboron as the borylation source for the efficient synthesis of alkenylborates. The reaction proceeds via cobalt&#8208;boryl intermediates, diverging from conventional Co&#8722;H chemistry. By fine&#8208;tuning the phosphine ligand side chains, we achieved excellent reactivity and regioselectivity across a wide range of internal and terminal alkynes. This Co&#8208;catalyzed method offers significant advantages in terms of both efficiency and environmental impact, making it an attractive approach for the synthesis of complex organic molecules.

         <title>Regiospecific Alkene Oxyamination via N&#8208;Alkylation&#8208; Hydroxylation&#8208;Transesterification Cascades</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An unprecedented cascade reaction of simple inactive alkenes, azo compounds and H2O to produce valuable poly&#8208;substituted oxazolidinones is reported herein. The transformation possesses exclusive regioselectivity and features mild reaction conditions and a broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies indicated this transformation underwent a N&#8208;alkylation&#8208;hydroxylation&#8208;transesterification cascade process. This research not only pushes the boundaries of the essential difunctionalization of alkenes but also exploits a new chemistry for azo compounds.

         <title>From gem&#8208;Dichlorocyclobutenones to Cyclobutenols: Unveiling a Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Reduction&#8208;Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation Cascade</title>

Abstract
Cyclobutenones constitute an appealing class of substrates in catalytic asymmetric transformations leading to diversely substituted enantioenriched four&#8208;membered carbocycles, which are eliciting a growing interest in medicinal chemistry. Whilst several synthetically useful enantioselective conjugate addition reactions have been reported, the catalytic enantioselective reduction of the carbonyl group of simple cyclobutenones remains an elusive transformation. Herein, we disclose the discovery of a novel allylic reduction&#8208;asymmetric transfer hydrogenation cascade, catalyzed by a Noyori&#8208;Ikariya ruthenium complex, from readily available gem&#8208;dichlorocyclobutenones, leading to 2&#8208;chlorocyclobutenols with high optical purities, which can be engaged in postfunctionalization reactions enabling access to substituted four&#8208;membered rings.

Abstract
A synthetic method to prepare &#948;&#8211;&#954;&#8208;chloroketones, &#8208;esters and &#8208;amides that relies on the copper(I)&#8208;mediated chlorination at the unactivated tertiary &#948;&#8211;&#954;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of ketones, carboxylic esters, and amides by dichloramine&#8208;T is presented. By exploiting the ability of the N&#8208;chloramide to act as both the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and chlorination reagent, the reactions were shown to be site&#8208;selective with halogenation only occurring at the unactivated tertiary carbon center situated four to ten C&#8722;C bond distances away from the carbonyl functional group in the substrate. The site&#8208;selectivity of the chlorination protocol was further exemplified by the installing of the C&#8722;Cl bond at the distal position of one example containing two tertiary carbon centers and the late&#8208;stage functionalization of two drug molecules.

Abstract
Visible light&#8208;induced site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkylation and alkenylation of 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes with maleimides at room temperature via dual catalysis in an aqueous medium has been disclosed. This operationally simple and mild approach enables the selective formation of alkylation and alkenylation products up to 92% yield under silver&#8208;free conditions with excellent substrate scope. For the mechanistic examination, KIE, H/D labeling experiments, light on&#8208;off experiments, and quantum yield measurements were carried out. Moreover, the present approach for the alkylation and alkenylation of 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes is suitable for scalable synthesis.

         <dc:description>Herein, we report a conceptually new, general, and efficient approach for the synthesis of valuable ortho&#8208;azido&#8208;1,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole and one&#8208;pot synthesis of ortho&#8208;triazoletetrazole derivatives mainly via PIDA mediated N&#8208;N cleavage of the azole ring of 2H&#8208;indazoles using TMSN3. This current methodology represents an array of unsymmetrical ortho&#8208;azidotetrazole and ortho&#8208;triazoletetrazole derivatives with wide functional group tolerance in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. The practical utility of this reaction was showcased through successful scale&#8208;up synthesis and a variety of subsequent derivatizations of ortho&#8208;azidotetrazole products. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the reaction proceeds through a radical pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Direct Synthesis of Alkyl&#8208;Substituted Phosphonodithioates from White Phosphorus (P4)</title>

Abstract
The direct synthesis of organic phosphorus compounds from white phosphorus (P4) is a longstanding challenge in organic synthesis. Here, we present a novel visible light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component functionalization reaction that integrates P4, disulfide compounds, and N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) esters to produce alkyl&#8208;substituted phosphonodithioates in a one&#8208;pot process. Using 2,4,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) as a photocatalyst, blue LEDs (456&#8197;nm) as the light source, and N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) as the reducing agent in an acetone&#8208;toluene solvent system, this method achieves moderate to good yields of structurally diverse phosphonodithioates. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, ensures complete conversion of P4, avoids chlorination, and uses inexpensive, readily available starting materials, offering potential for large&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>Phosphonamidates of Camphorsultam: Versatile Building Blocks for the Synthesis of P&#8208;Chiral Phosphorous(V) Compounds</title>

Abstract
Camphorsultam was utilized for the optical resolution of P&#8208;chiral phosphorous compounds. After chromatographic separation of diastereomeric RP&#8208; and SP&#8208;phosphonamidate intermediates, subsequent substitution reactions with phenol derivatives yielded P&#8208;chiral phosphonic acid aryl esters with excellent enantioselectivities. In these processes, chiral sulfonamide of camphorsultam demonstrated superior abilities as an optical&#8208;resolving agent and a good leaving group. This method was applied to the synthesis of P&#8208;chiral phosphinic esters, phosphonamidates, and thiophosphonate diesters.

Abstract
Organic synthesis has long been fascinated by phenolic compounds, especially their exploration of selectively hydroxylating arenes utilizing H2O as a hydroxyl source. However, phenols&#8242; low redox potential and strong reactivity frequently result in unwanted overoxidation byproducts. Here, we present an electrochemical strategy to overcome this difficulty by using electricity as an oxidant and facilitating the para&#8208;selective hydroxylation of N&#8208;protected anilines. This process exhibits excellent regio&#8208;selectivity, compatibility with diverse functional groups, and adaptability by handling an extensive range of substrates. Noteworthily, the technique provides a sustainable substitute for paracetamol synthesis and terminal acetylene&#8208;holding hydroxylated products, proving the suitability of this strategy for drug synthesis. Significantly, mechanistic investigations suggest the possible radical pathway and water as a hydroxyl source for this strategy.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;/Regioselective [5+1] Annulation with gem&#8208;Difluoromethylene Allenes for the Assembly of Fluorinated 2H&#8208;Chromenes and Dihydroquinolines</title>

Abstract
A variety of fluorinated 2H&#8208;chromenes and dihydroquinolines was synthesized by virtue of gem&#8208;difluoromethylene allenes as versatile coupling partners to participate in the transition metal&#8208;catalysed cascade C&#8722;H activation/[5+1] annulation of 2&#8208;alkenylphenols/anilines. This protocol features specific chemo&#8208;/regioselectivity, redox&#8208;neutral manner and good compatibility, providing a straightforward synthetic route to intriguing motifs with the equipment of attractive fluoroalkenyl moiety. The distinctive gem&#8208;difluorine effect induced an unexpected protonolysis of &#963; carbon&#8208;metal bond, thus accounting for the observed selectivity via sequential C&#8722;H activation/allene insertion/protonolysis/cyclization/&#946;&#8208;F elimination process.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrative C2&#8208;Arylation of Oxazoles, Benzoxazoles, and Benzimidazoles with Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A step&#8208;economic method for C2&#8208;arylated azoles via Pd&#8208;catalyzed denitrative arylation of nitroarenes and azoles is reported. This protocol employs synthetically upstream nitroarenes as arylating reagents and proceeds through the selective cleavage of the C&#8722;NO2 and C&#8722;H bonds. Various nitroarenes and nitroheteroarenes were coupled with oxazoles, benzoxazoles, and methylbenzimidazoles, achieving yields of up to 95%. The method's utility is exemplified by its application in the synthesis of Flunoxaprofen. This strategy reduces synthetic steps and minimizes pollution, offering substantial cost&#8208;effectiveness and environmental benefits. Furthermore, the relatively inert C&#8722;NO2 bond in nitroarenes enables late&#8208;stage functionalization or stepwise coupling reactions, providing a complementary method for C2&#8208;arylation of azoles.

         <title>Photoinduced Methylthio Radical Generation from Methylthiophosphonium Salt</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The production of methylthio radical typically relies on gaseous methanethiol or dimethyl disulfide. Herein, we present a new and straightforward method for the photogeneration of methylthio radical from methylthiophosphonium salt, enabling the synthesis of methylthiophenanthridines via charge transfer complex strategy. In this approach, the methylthiophosphonium salt acts as the electron acceptor, while 2&#8208;isocyanobiaryls serve as the electron donors. This strategy is distinguished by its simplicity in both conditions and operation, and can be extended for the generation of various alkyl(aryl)thio radicals.

         <title>Decyanative arylation via radical coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arenes, especially heteroarenes, are crucial structural motifs in organic chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, and materials science. The introduction of (hetero)aryl groups using readily available feedstocks to modify organic chemicals is a significant topic. Nitriles are ubiquitous and versatile building blocks in organic synthesis. This article summarizes recent advances in decyanative arylation via radical cross&#8208;coupling reactions. In these transformations, (hetero)aromatic nitriles undergo one&#8208;electron reduction to form persistent radical anion intermediates. Simultaneously, transient carbon centered radicals are generated through cleavage of C&#8211;H, C&#8211;C, C&#8211;X (where X = B, N, Si, S, Br) bonds through single electron transfer or hydrogen atom transfer processes. Finally, a radical&#8208;radical coupling reaction followed by CN elimination leads to the formation of aromatized products.</dc:description>

Abstract
We developed a temperature&#8208;controlled intermolecular dearomative [5+1] spiroannulation and [5+2] cyclization of indoles with enynones, smoothly delivering a variety of spiroindolenines and dihydrocyclohepta[b]indolones under 40&#8201;&#176;C and 80&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. A three&#8208;step cascade reaction was also realized by using OTBS or NHBoc containing enynones in the reaction with the indole under the identical condition. And a novel valuable highly&#8208;oriented three&#8208;dimensional indole&#8208;based tetracyclic scaffold was produced in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities. Additionally, various spiroindolines and spirooxindoles were facilely produced through simple operations. This highly efficient domino&#8208;reaction represents an emblematic method for the preparation of indole&#8208;based polycycles through the intermolecular pathway.

Abstract
Conjugation of amino acids to bioactive molecules has emerged as a promising strategy for optimizing pharmacological profiles of lead candidates in drug discovery. This study describes a photocatalytic Minisci&#8208;type transfer reaction of N&#8208;acyl amino acids into various N&#8208;heterocycles. Notably, this protocol enables direct conjugation of amino acids into heterocyclic C&#8722;H bonds, eliminating the need for prefunctionalized substrates. A diverse array of N&#8208;heterocycles, amino acids, oligopeptides, and drugs were used to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach. In addition, the importance of this approach is demonstrated through its application in the DNA&#8208;encoded library chemistry. Various synthetic transformations and preliminary mechanistic investigations were also explored.

         <title>Regioselective Palladaelectro&#8208;Catalyzed Chlorination of Arenes in an Undivided Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Chloroarenes constitute fundamental building blocks in organic synthesis and are widely applied in the synthesis of bioactive compounds, fine chemicals, materials, natural products and pharmaceuticals. Electrochemical chlorination has been recognized as a promising synthetic method for accessing chloroarenes, but it has proved challenging to achieve in practice as shown by the limited number of existing protocols. Herein, we report on a highly general electrocatalytic strategy for the regioselective chlorination of various substituted heteroaryl scaffolds in an undivided cell setup, using ethyl chloroformate as the chlorine source. This strategy offers several practical advantages over existing methodologies, including an operationally simple experimental setup, exceptional functional group tolerance, and the possibility to form either the mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;chlorinated products in high selectivity depending on the choice of catalyst loading, electric current and ethyl chloroformate equivalents. The practicality and selectivity of the protocol were demonstrated by the successful chlorination of an array of densely&#8208;substituted arene frameworks as well as by the synthesis of chlorinated bioactive molecules.

Abstract
Isochromenes, oxygen&#8208;containing bicyclic compounds, have gained significant attention in organic synthesis due to their versatile reactivity and prominence in biologically active natural products. This review highlights recent developments in the synthesis of isochromenes, with a focus on efficient and selective methodologies. Traditional metal&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular ring&#8208;closure reactions have been the cornerstone for isochromene formation, but recent efforts have expanded to include new strategies that enhance functionalization and scalability. By examining key advancements in the field, this article provides a critical assessment of the current state of the art involving isochromene synthesis and its ongoing challenges.

         <title>Selective Enzymatic C&#8722;H&#8208;Oxyfunctionalization for the Efficient Synthesis of Grevillic Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
In this study, a selective C&#8722;H&#8208;oxyfunctionalization using an unspecific peroxygenase (UPO) enabled an efficient biosynthetic route for the synthesis of grevillic acid (GA), a natural antioxidant. The route commenced with the release of o&#8208;coumaric acid (oCA) from trans&#8208;2&#8208;coumaric acid glucoside (trans&#8208;CAG) using commercially available &#946;&#8208;glucosidase from almonds. In addition, a cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans photoisomerization of cis&#8208;CAG was implemented to increase the synthetic access of oCA. The key step, the para&#8208;hydroxylation relative to the existing hydroxyl group of oCA, was accomplished by an UPO with full conversion and 93% isolated yield. Despite its name, the UPO turned out to exhibit excellent regioselectivity in this C&#8722;H functionalization, requiring only H2O2 as a cosubstrate.

Abstract
Diaryl and heteroaryl ethers are important and common motifs in drug discovery and agrochemicals. Here we present a catalytic system for the copper catalysed arylation of phenols with aryl halides. Bidentate N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands provide a well&#8208;defined catalytic system that enable low loading of copper in effective coupling reactions (0.5&#8197;mol% Cu or lower). The reaction scope of aryl iodides and aryl bromides is developed, that is tolerant of functional groups and a library of biaryl ethers with lead&#8208;like properties is prepared. The presence of excess ligand (in a 1:3 ratio) is shown to be optimal to prevent catalyst degradation, presumably by avoiding decomplexation of the ligand. This is also supported by the catalytic results obtained with pre&#8208;formed copper complexes. The kinetics of the reaction are examined and shown to be first order in copper, supportive of a well&#8208;defined catalyst species, first order in phenol and aryl iodide, and zero order in base under the developed conditions. Computational studies performed using Minnesota MN15&#8208;L parametrisation method support an oxidative addition&#8208;reductive elimination sequence with both steps having similar enegies and the reductive elimination occurring through an intimate ion pair intermediate.

         <title>Manganese Promoted Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Phosphine Chlorides with Disulfides for the Synthesis of Thiophosphanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we reported a manganese promoted reductive cross&#8208;coupling approach to construct P&#8210;S bond. This is a practical method for the synthesis of mono&#8208;thiophosphanes, bis&#8208;thiophosphanes and tri&#8208;thiophosphanes under mild conditions. The strategy featured a wide range of substrate scope including various disulfides and phosphine chlorides, constructing diverse sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds from inodorous and readily available starting materials. The employment of reductive conditions avoided the generation of phosphorothioates (PV) by&#8208;products. Ultimately, gram&#8208;scale synthesis and applications were explored. Extensive experiments indicated that the phosphine radical cascade process was involved in the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoconvergent Access to Z&#8208;Allylborons from E/Z&#8208;Mixed 1,3&#8208;Dienes via Cu&#8208;Guanidine Catalysis</title>

Abstract
Merging the stereoisomeric mixture of substrate into a single product through stereospecific transformation is a challenging but higher&#8208;order synthetic strategy, which perfectly meets the demand of cost control in the precise chemical production. In this work, the stereoconvergent synthesis of Z&#8208;allylic boronates was realized with protoborylation of E/Z&#8208;mixed 1,3&#8208;dienes catalyzed by a novel copper&#8208;guanidine complex. The reaction could proceed smoothly under very mild conditions with good functional group tolerance, and convert diverse aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes into the desired Z&#8208;1,4&#8208;addition products with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivities in minutes. Detailed mechanistic studies also helped to disclose the origin of stereoconvergency. Both E&#8208; and Z&#8208;diene were found directly undergoing a rapid borylation without E/Z isomerization of C=C bond, followed by a convergent formation of the same thermodynamically stable allylcopper intermediate before the slow protonation step occurred.

Abstract
A metal&#8208;free base&#8208;promoted [4+3] cycloaddition reaction of N&#8208;thioacyl imines in&#8197;situ generated from &#945;&#8208;amido sulfones with &#945;&#8208;chlorohydroxamates is described. The reaction allows the straightforward synthesis of 1,3,5&#8208;thiadiazepin&#8208;6(7H)&#8208;one derivatives in 44~90% yields. Moreover, a gram&#8208;scale reaction and a product transformation were conducted, which further increased the diversity of products.

Abstract
We describe a fluorinative ring&#8208;cleavage reaction that breaks C&#8722;C bonds in cyclic &#946;&#8208;diketones bearing an aryl moiety by using N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) in the presence of inorganic carbonates (Cs2CO3 or K2CO3) in methanol at room temperature within one hour. The generated fluorinated keto acid esters bearing ortho&#8208;nitro aryl groups were transformed into fluorinated dihydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indolones (DHPIs) via reductive cyclization using B2(OH)4 followed by amidation in the presence of K2CO3. This &#8220;cut&#8208;to&#8208;fuse&#8221; strategy enables the reconstructive synthesis of valuable fused heterocycles from relatively simple cyclohexadiones.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective One&#8208;pot Double Cascade Hybrid Formation/[3+3] Spirocyclization for the Synthesis of 3&#8208;Spiropiperidines Under Phase Transfer Conditions</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report an efficient approach to synthesizing hybrid 3&#8208;spiropiperidine heterocycles that incorporate both 3&#8208;isochromanone and 3&#8208;isoindolinone units through a one&#8208;pot, double cascade reaction facilitated by an economical K2CO3/TBAB catalytic system. By examining the nucleophilicity of the lactone 3&#8208;isochromanone, we developed a cascade reaction pathway that first generates a bi&#8208;nucleophilic hybrid intermediate, which then undergoes [3+3] spirocyclization with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The regioselectivity of the spirocyclization strongly depends on the substitution pattern of lactam ring.The process exhibits high diastereoselectivity, even with the formation of three or four stereocenters, including two contiguous tetra&#8208;substituted carbons. These sequential cascade reactions were successfully scaled up, and the subsequent reactivity was readily analyzed, enabling the transformation of existing functional groups into valuable new functionalities.

Abstract
An electrochemical cascade radical cyclization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl indoles with sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate as a coupling partner has been explored, which afforded the unexpected bis&#8208;trifluoromethylated indole[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines as products. Experimental results and DFT calculations disclose that this reaction involves trifluoromethylation&#8208;triggered cyclization and the second trifluoromethylation as the key steps. This strategy does not need any transition&#8208;metal catalysts or oxidants with a readily available trifluoromethylating reagent enabling facile synthesis of bis&#8208;trifluoromethylated indole&#8208;fused tricycles.

Abstract
Herein we present a method for base&#8208;mediated sequential annulation reaction of conjugated dienes. The method offers an efficient pathway for the effective construction of bicyclo[4.1.0]heptenes. Notable features of this approach include good yields, remarkable stereoselectivity, as well as a broad substrate scope and significant step efficiency. In addition, the reaction could be effectively scaled up to a gram scale under standard condition.

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Benzo[f]chromanes and Hydroxyalkyl Naphthols: Catalytic Coupling of Naphthols and Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Catalytic dearomatization of arenols is an uphill task that can serve as a powerful method to construct C&#8722;C bonds with unsaturated coupling partners. Herein, a simple and efficient strategy for coupling naphthols with allylic alcohols is reported. A single Ru(II) pincer catalyzed coupling of naphthols with primary allylic alcohols led to the formation of benzo(f)chromanes, whereas the use of secondary alcohols delivered the hydroxyalkyl naphthols. Broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance are demonstrated. Notably, a high diastereoselectivity is attained on chromanes. Hydroxyalkyl naphthols are synthetically transformed into spiroethers, and dearomative bromination is achieved on chromanes. Mechanistic studies revealed the involvement of tandem reactions, a formal O&#8722;H bond activation of allylic alcohols by an active catalyst via amine&#8208;amide metal&#8208;ligand cooperation provided &#945;&#8208;&#946;, unsaturated carbonyl intermediates, which further underwent 1,4 conjugate addition with dearomatized naphthols. One of the crucial intermediates, naphthyl radical, is elucidated by EPR studies and trapped using a radical scavenger. Liberated hydrogen and water molecules are the only byproducts in these transformations.

Abstract
Here, we present 3,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2,5,6&#8208;trifluorophenyl glycosides as bench&#8208;stable, and reactive electron&#8208;deficient fluoroarene based glycosyl donors that can be prepared in one&#8208;step and be activated with catalytic amounts of TMSOTf. The glycosylation reaction conditions show tolerance towards acid/base sensitive protecting groups and have a different substrate scope with 68&#8211;89% yields. The electron&#8208;deficient fluoroarene&#8208;containing glycosyl donor enables the construction of O&#8208; and C&#8208;glycosides using both free alcohols and silylated alcohols, as well as C&#8208; nucleophiles as acceptors.

         <title>Modular Chiral Bithiophene&#8208;2NO Ligands: Synthesis and Application in Asymmetric Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalysed Friedel&#8208;Crafts Alkylation</title>

Abstract
The development of privileged thiophene&#8208;type ligand remains highly desirable, owing to the high coordination ability of sulfur atom to most of the soft metals. Herein, a new class of C2&#8208;symmetric rigid chiral tertiary amine&#8208;derived dioxide ligands with a coordinating bithiophene bridge was developed in a convenient synthetic route with 25&#8211;62% overall yields. The bithiophene&#8208;2NO&#8208;palladium(II) catalyst system was generated in&#8197;situ and found to be highly capable catalyst in the asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of indoles. Excellent yields (up to 92%) and high enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99% ee) are obtained for a wide range of substrates under mild conditions. Control experiments and DFT calculations revealed the origins of the enantioselectivity. This represented the first example of chiral thiophene ligands coordinating with soft metal Pd(II) in the asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation. Experiments revealed that the counteranion is involved in the stereoselectivity&#8208;determining step in this soft palladium(II) catalysis, and the additional NO and thiophene in ligands can act as the second chelation site and thus reduce the amount of free metal ions for suppressing background reaction in the catalytic system.

Abstract
We describe a selective preparation of a variety of functionalized pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;c]tetrahydroquinolines and indolo[3,2&#8208;c]tetrahydroquinolines in 40&#8211;82% and 40&#8211;80% yields from alkynyl&#8208;tethered oximes with diaryliodonium triflates, respectively. The one&#8208;pot reaction underwent N&#8208;arylation, intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition, selective [1.3] or [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement of N&#8722;O bond in total three steps. Experimental studies revealed that EtOAc solvent and copper(II)&#8208;catalyst played crucial roles on the formation of these two tetrahydroquinoline scaffolds. Moreover, these two tetrahydroquinoline scaffolds could be converted into various tetrahydroquinoline building blocks by further transformations.

         <dc:description>








Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed methodology for regioselective cycloisomerization and tandem Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of 1,7&#8208;enynes has been described, enabling the synthesis of diverse polycyclic heterocycles with four stereocenters. This stereoselective protocol demonstrates compatibility with various substituted enynes and alkenes, yielding products in 46&#8211;90% yield while tolerating a wide range of functional groups, including esters, ketones, and halides. Notably, the reaction with naphthoquinones retains the moiety in the final product, which acts as essential core structures in various natural products and bioactive compounds.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Mediated Oxidative C&#8722;H Phosphorylation of Quinoxalines and Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one</title>

Abstract
Quinoxaline is a chemical moiety known for its diverse physicochemical and biological properties, making it the focus of extensive research. Over the past few decades, quinoxaline scaffolds have been utilized in the design and development of various bioactive molecules, dyes, fluorescent materials, electroluminescent materials, organic sensitizers for solar cells, and polymeric optoelectronic materials. Herein, we present a metal&#8208;free and rapid protocol for the phosphorylation of quinoxalines and quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one. This method employs oxygen as an oxidant under ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, with experimental evidence indicating the absence of radical involvement. Our methodology provides range of phosphorylated quinoxalines and quinoxaline&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one in yields ranging from 47% to 99%.

Abstract
We present a novel and highly efficient method for synthesizing polyfunctionalized 1,2,4&#8208;triazoles. This approach leverages visible light and arylazo sulfones in combination with N&#8208;vinyl amides, in the environmentally friendly solvent ethyl acetate. Remarkably, the reaction proceeds without the need for (photo)catalysts, ensuring near&#8208;perfect atom economy and producing only water as a by&#8208;product. This method exhibits excellent functional group tolerance and can be scaled for both batch and continuous&#8208;flow processes.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Cascade Trifluoromethylation of Dienes and Enynes Using a Perylene Diimide (PDI) Organophotocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The perylene diimide (PDI) is an underexplored synthetic organic dye with significant potential in photoredox catalysis. We have developed a good chemo&#8208; and regioselective, atom&#8208;economical methodology for synthesizing trifluoroethylated saturated heterocyclic derivatives and trifluoroethyl&#8208;containing cyclobutane derivatives. This process involves the generation of trifluoromethyl radical from the Langlois (CF3SO2Na) reagent under photoredox conditions, which selectively reacts with the electron&#8208;rich terminal double/triple bonds in the diene/enyne framework. The resulting intermediate undergoes a cascade cyclization, yielding the desired compounds in a redox&#8208;neutral manner. Our methodology operates under very mild conditions, eliminating the need for transition metals and external oxidizing agents. It is broadly applicable across various substrates and is supported by comprehensive mechanistic insights from regular photophysical experiments.

         <title>Sulfur (VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) via Glass&#8211;Assisted Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An environmentally benign route for the synthesis of sulfonamides via Sulfur (VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) chemistry utilizing N&#8208;methylimidazole, that simultaneously act as a base, precatalyst, HF by&#8208;product scavenger, as well as solvent, is described. This one&#8208;step sulfonamide synthesis exhibits excellent reactivity toward highly electron&#8208;deficient and less nucleophilic anilines as well as aminopyridines while tolerating a wide range of functional groups. In addition to the desired sulfonamide target, we also isolated an ionic salt as the sole side product from the reaction mixture that has been identified as bis[1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;3&#8208;ium] hexafluorosilicate (IV). The glass surface of reaction vessel is acting as the source of silicon present in the isolated side product. Formation of hexafluorosilicate salt is also facilitating the consumption of sulfonyl fluoride for sulfonamide synthesis. Optimization of the reaction under various conditions, as well as the isolation of the bis[1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;3&#8208;ium] hexafluorosilicate (IV) salt, highlight the crucial role of N&#8208;methylimidazole and support the glass&#8208;assisted approach. Besides the first example of glass&#8211;assisted SuFEx catalyzed by benign organic bases, this reaction also offers an alternative route for accessing protic hexafluorosilicate&#8208;based molten salts without employing external HF. The synthetic utility of this SuFEx route for late&#8208;stage functionalization is also demonstrated.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An environmentally benign route for the synthesis of sulfonamides via Sulfur (VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) chemistry utilizing &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylimidazole, that simultaneously act as a base, precatalyst, HF by-product scavenger, as well as solvent, is described. This one-step sulfonamide synthesis exhibits excellent reactivity toward highly electron-deficient and less nucleophilic anilines as well as aminopyridines while tolerating a wide range of functional groups. In addition to the desired sulfonamide target, we also isolated an ionic salt as the sole side product from the reaction mixture that has been identified as bis[1-methyl-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-imidazole-3-ium] hexafluorosilicate (IV). The glass surface of reaction vessel is acting as the source of silicon present in the isolated side product. Formation of hexafluorosilicate salt is also facilitating the consumption of sulfonyl fluoride for sulfonamide synthesis. Optimization of the reaction under various conditions, as well as the isolation of the bis[1-methyl-1H-imidazole-3-ium] hexafluorosilicate (IV) salt, highlight the crucial role of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylimidazole and support the glass-assisted approach. Besides the first example of glass&#8211;assisted SuFEx catalyzed by benign organic bases, this reaction also offers an alternative route for accessing protic hexafluorosilicate-based molten salts without employing external HF.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed carbo&#8208;/protoboration of boryl enynes is disclosed, providing access to an array of penta&#8208; and hexasubstituted diboryl dienes in a chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner. All six positions of the dienes can be manipulated using this methodology. The hexasubstituted diene boronates adopt a skew conformation. An iterative Suzuki coupling of the products provided highly conjugated trienes and tetraenes.

Abstract
We have developed a synthesis for tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines involving cascade sigmatropic rearrangements. The substrates were conveniently prepared from parent anilines via a [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement and cyanomethylation. Silver&#8208;mediated decyanation afforded the corresponding iminium cation, which underwent a cascade consisting of an aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement, an aza&#8208;oxa&#8208;Cope rearrangement, an aromatization, and a Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction, and tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines were obtained as the single product. The reaction involved seven bond scissions and four bond formations and was triggered by a single reagent.

Abstract
Herein, an electroreductive aryl radical enabled 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization of N&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;halobenzamides is presented, providing a convenient route for the synthesis of a variety of 3&#8208;iminoisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones in 30&#8211;75% yields. Simply by employing zinc plate instead of graphite rod anode, the products of the electrosynthesis are switched to diverse 3&#8208;aminoisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones through aryl&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization and subsequent reductive hydrogenation. Furthermore, this anode material determined divergent 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization features mild electrochemical conditions, excellent substrate scopes, and good functional group tolerance.

Abstract
Herein, we report the development of photoredox&#8208;catalyzed N&#8722;H insertion of sulfoxonium ylides with amines via oxidative single&#8208;electron transfer (SET). These reactions exhibit broad substrate scope (32 examples) and offer operationally simple, scalable procedures for accessing &#945;&#8208;ketoamides in a single step. Mechanistic studies and control experiments confirm the participation of a photogenerated carbon radical in facilitating the oxidative single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) from the sulfoxonium ylides to initiate the reaction.

         <title>Selective 1,2&#8208;Carboimination of Isothiocyanates to Access S&#8208;Substituted Isothioureas via Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we introduce a novel method for the synthesis of S&#8208;substituted isothiourea compounds via the selective 1,2&#8208;carboimination between oxime esters as bifunctional reagents and the C=S bond of isothiocyanates under visible&#8208;light catalysis. This approach deviates from conventional methods by precisely modulating the substrate electronics to selectively functionalize the C=S bond of isothiocyanates over the C=N bond, eliminating the need for strong bases and high temperatures and bypassing the formation of thiourea intermediates. Consequently, this protocol enables the efficient one&#8208;step synthesis of S&#8208;alkyl isothioureas, with featuring mild reaction conditions, operational simplicity and broad substrate scope.

Irradiation at 525&#8197;nm causes dimerization and the formation of cyclobutanes with two spiroatoms, related to dictazoles in 87&#8211;98% yield. In turn, irradiation at 365&#8197;nm provides access to spirocyclic indolines in 67&#8211;92% yield. Each of the processes proceeds with exclusive atom economy and chemoselectivity.

Abstract
A concise and practical sustainable strategy for modular access to isoquinoline&#8208;fused benzo[f][1,3]oxazepine derivatives through a formal [4+3] annulation of commercially available salicyaldehydes with isoquinolinium salts has been developed. The reactions proceeded through the formation of two new bonds (C=C and C&#8722;O) and a seven&#8208;membered heterocyclic ring in one pot. Remarkably, use of simple NaHCO3 as a mild base, open atmosphere, nonhazardous reagents, nice functional group tolerance, and easily scale up are added characteristics to this approach. A wide range of substrates are compatible with this mild reaction system, thereby proving a facile and reliable protocol for constructing a benzo[f][1,3]oxazepine skeletons.

Abstract
Photochemical C&#8722;C coupling reactions can be tailored to industrial chemical processes and preparations of pharmaceuticals. Recent approaches in this area are limited to using precious transition metal coordination complexes that facilitate light absorption and redox processes with benchtop chemicals. Herein, we propose a paradigm that involves all&#8208;in&#8208;one organo&#8208;photo&#8208;auxiliaries, thio&#8208;heteroarenes, which exhibit unique photophysical properties. These thio&#8208;heteroarenes were employed to prepare several all&#8208;in&#8208;one ionic photo&#8208;salts from commercially available alkyl/benzyl and heterocyclic halides via aromaticity&#8208;mediated nucleophilic substitution reactions. From the library of &gt;30 salts, we performed on&#8208;demand photochemical C&#8722;C coupling reactions to isolate numerous symmetrical and unsymmetrical diary/alkyl&#8208;ethanes with yields up to 84% and mass balance as high as 96%. We also investigated the influence of structural features/properties on the outcomes of the photochemical C&#8722;C coupling reactions. The current photochemical C&#8722;C method was successful in the isolation of &gt;30 photoproducts, including the natural product Brittonin A, a precursor of Imipramine, and derivatives of the bioactive Honokiol Analogues. Furthermore, transient absorption spectroscopy and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations were used to decipher the nature of light&#8208;promoted electronic transitions.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Initiated Uranyl&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation and Hydrosulfonylation of Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
This study investigates the visible&#8208;light&#8208;initiated uranyl(VI)&#8208;catalyzed activation of Si&#8722;H bonds through direct hydrogen atom transfer, which facilitates the formation of silyl radicals from silanes. The silyl radical can abstract a chlorine atom from the sulfonyl chloride, leading to the generation of sulfonyl radicals. These silyl radicals and sulfonyl radicals could react with alkenes and alkynes, achieving the first example of uranyl&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation and hydrosulfonylation of unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds. This method features mild reaction conditions and a broad substrate scope, and exhibits exceptional functional&#8208;group tolerance. Consequently, it is suitable for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug derivatives.

         <title>Dual NHC/HAT&#8208;Promoted Esterification to Access &#945;&#8208;Aryl Glycines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Aryl glycines are among the most important carbonyl compounds, particularly as nonproteinogenic &#945;&#8208;amino acids present in many pharmacophores. As such, many strategies have been developed to access this motif, but direct carboxylation methods remain underdeveloped. Herein, we employ a dual NHC/HAT catalysis strategy to access 2&#8208;azaallyl radicals, which subsequently couple with in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated ester azolium radical intermediates. Base&#8208;mediated collapse of the ensuing tetrahedral intermediate liberates the NHC catalyst and benzophenone&#8208;protected aryl glycine. This methodology was employed to esterify a variety of aryl&#8208;substituted glycine derivatives, as well as allylic and benzylic sites. Mechanistic studies reveal that this radical process operates under both oxidative and reductive quenching cycles, while preliminary experiments employing a chiral NHC and Lewis acid additive demonstrate modest enantioselectivity.

Abstract
An efficient Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation/cyclization of 2&#8208;arylbenzimidazoles with CF3&#8208;imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides has been achieved, yielding diverse CF3&#8722; and amino&#8208;disubstituted 5,6&#8208;dihydrobenzoimidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines, which could undergo a deaminative hydroxylation to access CF3&#8722; and hydroxy&#8208;disubstituted 5,6&#8208;dihydrobenzoimidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines catalyzed by Sc(OTf)3. This developed strategy features easily available starting materials, broad substrate scope, good scalability and high efficiency. Moreover, the antitumor activities of selected products against some human cancer cell lines were also investigated, and the results indicated that several products show antiproliferative activities.

         <title>Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation of 3&#8208;Substituted 2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;Benzoxazines under Tethered Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;Diamine Catalysis with Unexpected Reversal of Enantioselectivity</title>

Abstract
The asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of 3&#8208;substituted 2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazines with an azeotropic mixture of HCO2H/NEt3 (5/2) using tethered Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;diamine catalysis has been realized. This process allows access to a broad range of chiral 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazines in high yields with up to 99% ee, and tolerates a variety of functional groups. The enantiocontrol is achieved by the judicious choice of catalyst and hydrogen source. This reaction proceeds with unexpected reversal of enantioselectivity, which is attributed to the acidic reaction conditions and the hydrogen bond between the N&#8722;H of the rhodium species and the O atom in the substrate.

Abstract
The C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization via intramolecular hydride transfer initiated cascade annulation for the synthesis of spiro&#8208;fused succinimide&#8208;containing tetrahydroquinolines induced by iminium intermediates is described. A series of diastereoselective 2,7&#8208;diazaspiro[4.5]decanes&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones were achieved using ortho&#8208;amino&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;succinimide using Lewis acid catalysis. This scandium triflate Sc(OTf)3 catalysed, oxidant&#8208;free protocol leads to the diastereoselective synthesis of a class of 2,7&#8208;diazaspiro[4.5]decanes&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones derivatives with 48&#8211;98% yield in a single step.

         <title>Generation of Sulfamoyl Radicals via Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Fixation of Sulfur Dioxide for the Synthesis of Sulfonamides</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a new approach for the light&#8208;mediated generation of sulfamoyl radicals using sulfur dioxide as key building block and the direct application of these radicals in the synthesis of sulfonamides. In the presence of different photoredox catalysts, sulfamoyl radicals can be generated directly from SO2 or the SO2 surrogate DABSO (1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane&#8901;bis (sulfur dioxide) adduct) and N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts as nitrogen radical precursors. Trapping of the in&#8197;situ generated sulfamoyl radicals with selected electron&#8208;rich olefins affords different sulfonamides in up to 86% yield in a three&#8208;component procedure. This transformation provides a complementary approach for the in&#8197;situ generation of sulfamoyl radicals as synthetic intermediates for the assembly of the sulfonamide functionality, a privileged motif in active pharmaceutical ingredients.

         <title>Methodology to Control the Regioselective Installation of a Carboxylic Acid for the Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Diarylpropionic Acids</title>

Abstract
A stepwise copper&#8208;catalyzed boracarboxylation then palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling methodology was developed to access 2,3&#8208;diarylpropionic acid derivatives regioselectively by pre&#8208;setting the position of the carboxylic acid in the boracarboxylation reaction. This method provides access to a wide range of aryl and heteroaryl products in up to 80% isolated yield. Pharmaceutical potential was demonstrated by synthesizing a glucagon receptor antagonist drug in three steps (31% overall yield) from commercially available 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylstyrene.

         <title>Unsupported Nanoporous Copper Catalyzed Insertion of Carbenes from &#945;&#8208;Diazo Compounds into Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The insertion of diazo carbene into Si&#8722;H bonds with unsupported nanoporous copper (CuNPore) catalyst has been developed. &#945;&#8208;Aryl diazoesters, diazophosphonates, and unstable aryl diazoalkyls can be used as carbene precursors to exquisitely insert into the Si&#8722;H bond of silanes. A variety of &#945;&#8208;silylesters, silylphosphonate, and functionalized arylsilane were obtained in 35&#8211;82% yields. The reusability feature of the CuNPore catalyst for this insertion reaction demonstrated its high heterogeneous catalytic activity and practicality. Further, mechanistic studies revealed that the insertion of carbene from diazo compounds into the Si&#8722;H bond may include a three&#8208;center concerted transition state on CuNPore.

         <title>Trifluoroacetic Acid Promotes Umpolung of 2&#8208;Methylindole to Achieve C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An umpolung strategy for the C(sp3)&#8722;H aminomethylation of 2&#8208;methylindole has been developed using trifluoroacetic acid to induce the transformation, with aminals serving as precursors of iminium ion. Mechanistic studies have clearly shown that trifluoroacetic acid may play a pivotal role in this strategy. The utilization of readily available starting materials, mild reaction conditions, tolerance to complex functional groups, combine with yields of up to 98% and potential biological applications render this protocol applicable and useful for organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Copper Powder&#8208;Mediated Tandem Hydroamination Cyclization&#8208;Hydrocyanation of Alkyne&#8208;Tethered Ketoximes toward Cyano&#8208;Featured Cyclic Nitrones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The copper powder&#8208;mediated tandem hydroamination cyclization&#8208;hydrocyanation of alkyne&#8208;tethered ketoximes is described by using TMSCN as the commercially available cyanating reagent. This methodology provides an alternative strategy for the synthesis of a series of structurally important cyano&#8208;substituted cyclic nitrones. The hydrocyanation process exhibits distinct regioselectivity depending on the substituent pattern of the alkyne moiety. Moreover, the synthesized products were shown to be capable of undergoing various derivatization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>PTC in the polyenolate&#8208;mediated [10+2]&#8208;cycloaddition for the synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acid precursors</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. The manuscript describes a formal [10+2] higher&#8208;order cycloaddition between 2&#8208;benzylideneindan&#8208;1&#8208;ones and &#945;&#8208;alkilidene azlactones as higherene precursors and  higherenofiles respectively. The reaction is realized under Br&#248;nsted&#8208;base catalysis utilizing the phase transfer catalysis approach. The key intermediate is an isobenzofulvene&#8208;derived polyenolate which acts as a 10&#8208;electron component in the higher&#8208;order cycloaddition. By using this strategy, a series of structurally diverse compounds containing a polycyclic hydrocarbon scaffold was prepared in 79&#8208;99% yields. In addition, the potential of the obtained [10+2]&#8208;cycloadducts has been confirmed by transformations, including the synthesis of a highly&#8208;valuable alpha,alpha&#8208;disubstituted N&#8208;protected alpha&#8208;aminoester.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Abstract. The manuscript describes a formal [10+2] higher-order cycloaddition between 2-benzylideneindan-1-ones and &#945;-alkilidene azlactones as higherene precursors and  higherenofiles respectively. The reaction is realized under Br&#248;nsted-base catalysis utilizing the phase transfer catalysis approach. The key intermediate is an isobenzofulvene-derived polyenolate which acts as a 10-electron component in the higher-order cycloaddition. By using this strategy, a series of structurally diverse compounds containing a polycyclic hydrocarbon scaffold was prepared in 79-99% yields. In addition, the potential of the obtained [10+2]-cycloadducts has been confirmed by transformations, including the synthesis of a highly-valuable alpha,alpha-disubstituted N-protected alpha-aminoester.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deuterium&#8208;labeled compounds play a pivotal role in physical organic chemistry, life sciences, and materials science. This has resulted in a surge of interest in deuterium&#8208;labeled active pharmaceutical ingredients in recent years. In this study, we present a continuous flow Raney nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange process that boasts compatibility with a wide spectrum of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles and pharmaceutical compounds. The broad applicability of the developed method was demonstrated through successful labeling of various purine bases, imidazoles, pyridines, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including complex structures like abacavir and remdesivir. Control experiments revealed Raney nickel's crucial role in the exchange process, showcasing the superiority of the continuous flow approach over batch reactions. Furthermore, a scaled&#8208;up experiment demonstrated the robustness of the catalyst.</dc:description>
