         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Homoallylic Alcohols via a Salt&#8208;Free Three&#8208;Component Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling reaction between an aldehyde, a secondary amine, and butadiene allows a straightforward access to 5&#8208;aminopent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ol scaffolds according to a salt&#8208;free process. Key steps are oxidative coupling reaction between one aldehyde, one butadiene on a low valent nickel precursor, and the nucleophilic attack of a secondary amine on the nickel&#8208;allyl moiety.

In the presence of a catalytic amount (1&#8201;mol%) of Ni(cod)2 and dppmb (1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphinomethyl)benzene)), a three&#8208;component coupling reaction between industrially available aldehydes, buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene, and amines leads to the formation of variety of homoallylic alcohols with a highly functionalized 5&#8208;aminopent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ol structure. The reaction proceeds with 100% atom economy under mild conditions (80&#8201;&#176;C) in isopropanol as solvent. The process accommodates both aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes in combination with cyclic and acyclic secondary dialkyl amines, demonstrating a broad substrates scope. Reaction monitoring shows that the initial rate of the reaction is 39&#8201;h&#8722;1, and the process reaches a maximum within 3&#8201;h of reaction at 80&#8201;&#176;C. A competitive reaction has been identified as the hydroamination of 1,3&#8208;butadiene that affords light butenylamines. The key mechanistic feature of the three&#8208;component nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction is the formation of an &#951;3:&#951;1&#8208;allylalkoxy nickel (II) intermediate obtained from the oxidative coupling reaction between a low valent nickel (0) precursor, buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene, and an aldehyde. The amine subsequently reacts as a nucleophile with the electrophilic allyl moiety of this intermediate, while the alkoxy group acts as an internal base facilitating proton transfer that enables the synthesis of 5&#8208;aminopent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ol derivatives without any base and salt formation.

         <title>Recent Advances in Spirocyclization Reactions of Biaryl Ynones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient dearomative spirocyclization reactions of biaryl ynones have been reported for the construction of various functionalized spiro[5.5]trienones and 3,3&#8208;spiroindanones.

In recent years, special emphasis has been put on spirocyclization reactions of biaryl ynones since these strategies offer versatile platforms for introducing various important functional groups into spirocyclic frameworks in a step&#8208;economical manner, which is conducive to drug discovery. In this regard, various functionalized spiro[5.5]trienones and 3,3&#8208;spiroindanones have been synthesized via the radical, radical cation, or electrophilic process promoted by thermal, photochemical, and electrochemical means. In this invited review, we systematically summarize the spirocyclization reactions of biaryl ynones with diverse organic precursors, highlighting the reaction patterns, mechanistic insights, and synthetic applications.

         <title>Chiral Potassium Br&#248;nsted Base&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Diols via a Tandem Allylic Isomerization/Asymmetric Aldol&#8211;Tishchenko Reaction</title>

Chiral potassium base catalysts featuring 1,1&#180;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol&#8208;derived chiral crown ethers as ligands promote a tandem allylic isomerization/asymmetric aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction of allylic alcohols and aldehydes. This method provides enantioenriched 1,3&#8208;diols with excellent diastereoselectivity and high enantioselectivity, thereby expanding the synthetic utility of potassium catalysis.

A series of chiral potassium Br&#248;nsted bases containing 3,3&#8242;&#8208;substituted 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol&#8208;based chiral crown ethers are demonstrated as sustainable metal catalysts for a tandem allylic isomerization/asymmetric aldol&#8211;Tishchenko reaction. The crown ether creates an effective chiral environment around the potassium cation, yielding diverse 1,3&#8208;diols containing three contiguous stereogenic centers with excellent diastereoselectivity and high enantioselectivity. This system allows the use of allylic alcohols instead of enolizable ketones as nucleophiles, thus broadening the synthetic applicability of this reaction.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Covalent Organic Frameworks: Synthetic Strategies and Catalytic Applications in Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically outlines the design, synthesis strategies, structure&#8208;activity relationships, and latest applications of M&#8208;COFs in various organic transformations, such as C&#8211;H bond activation reaction, cross&#8208;coupling reaction, reduction reaction, oxidation reaction, addition reaction, multicomponent reaction, and asymmetric synthesis. It also highlights the advantages and discusses the future development directions in this field.

Metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (M&#8208;COFs) are a class of crystalline porous materials formed by the coordination bonds between metals centers and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). They retain the characteristics of COFs while providing exposed metal active sites. Compared with homogeneous transition metal catalysts, M&#8208;COFs exhibit superior catalytic activity, high stability, tunability, high specific surface area, and ordered pore channels. More importantly, due to their heterogeneous nature, M&#8208;COFs catalysts can be reused multiple times conveniently, avoiding the residual presence of transition metals and reducing resource and environmental consumption. This review introduces the general design strategies and synthesis methods of M&#8208;COFs, briefly discusses the intrinsic relationship between their structure and catalytic activity, and focuses on summarizing their applications in organic transformations. It also highlights the advantages and challenges of M&#8208;COFs in catalyzing organic transformation reactions and discusses the future development directions in this field.

A photocatalyst&#8208;free trifluoromethylation/cyclization of unactivated alkenes with trifluoromethylsulfonyl&#8208;pyridinium salt to access trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted quinazolinones is achieved.

A novel photochemical trifluoromethylation/cyclization of unactivated alkenes to synthesize trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted quinazolinones with trifluoromethylsulfonyl&#8208;pyridinium salt (TFSP) is achieved under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal that an electron&#8208;donating&#8208;accepting complex is formed between the quinazolinone and TFSP, making this the first example of TFSP&#8208;based trifluoromethylation conducted in the absence of expensive iridium photocatalysts.

Cu+&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly engineering narrows the bandgap of ZIF&#8208;67 while extending the light absorption range of CoCu&#8208;ZIF. The staggered energy levels in the resulting CoCu&#8208;ZIF/Cu3P&#8208;GDY composite generate a strong driving force. The formation of an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction between GDY and CoCu&#8208;ZIF. Cu3P acts as an electron bridge to promote the directional transfer of photogenerated carriers driven by interfacial electric fields.

Rational design of interfacial electric fields in nanostructures for accelerated photogenerated carrier transfer and separation. First, Cu+&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly engineering narrows the bandgap of ZIF&#8208;67 while extending the light absorption range of CoCu&#8208;ZIF. Furthermore, hierarchical architecture is constructed to incorporate the cocatalyst Cu3P&#8208;GDY. The staggered energy levels in the resulting CoCu&#8208;ZIF/Cu3P&#8208;GDY composite generate a strong driving force. Comprehensive characterization, including density functional theory calculations and Mott&#8211;Schottky analysis, confirm the formation of an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction between GDY and CoCu&#8208;ZIF. Cu3P acts as an electron bridge to promote the directional transfer of photogenerated carriers driven by interfacial electric fields. Differential surface photovoltage signals demonstrate that the robust interfacial electric field enables efficient carrier separation in the CoCu&#8208;ZIF/Cu3P&#8208;GDY composite. This work establishes a new paradigm for enhancing catalytic performance through broadened light absorption and rationally engineered interfacial electric fields.

The cascade reaction of cyclic 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diketones and diarylamines was efficiently developed, enabling straightforward access to a series of 2&#8208;aminocyclopentenones in good to excellent yields (71&#8211;90%).

The cascade reaction of cyclic 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diketones and diarylamines is efficiently developed, enabling straightforward access to a series of 2&#8208;aminocyclopentenones in good to excellent yields (71&#8211;90%). The procedure is proposed to go through a sequence of Wolff rearrangement via initial ketene formation, nucleophilic addition/keto&#8208;enol tautomerization, and Rh2(OAc)4&#8208;catalyzed decarbonylative amination followed by an oxidation process. A broad range of substrates are compatible with this mild reaction system, thereby providing a facile and practical approach for constructing important skeleton of aminocyclopentenone.

Chemodivergent Higher&#8208;Order Annulation of Azaheptafulvenes with Enals through N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis.

A base&#8208;directed, chemodivergent, higher&#8208;order annulation between azaheptafulvenes and enals has been developed through N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis. In the presence of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene organocatalyst, DBU promotes an [8&#8201;+&#8201;3] annulation with excellent chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivities, whereas the reaction proceeds via an [8&#8201;+&#8201;2] annulation when potassium carbonate is used as the base. In addition, the reaction can be carried out on a gram scale, and the products are efficiently converted into bicyclic derivatives.

An electro&#8208;oxidative protocol for the alkoxylation&#8208;thiolation of vinyl ethers is developed, employing nonvolatile diaryl disulfides as atom&#8208;economical arylthio sources under oxidant&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free conditions. 4&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)pyridine is used as a base additive to suppress side reactions and improve the yield. A wide range of substrates with diverse structures and functional groups are compatible with this protocol. Mechanism experiments show that the reaction involves a mechanism in which an arylthio radical is generated at the anode as the key intermediate.

Mechanism experiments show that the reaction involves a mechanism in which an arylthio radical is generated at the anode as the key intermediate.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Dehydrogenative Lactonization of Benzylic Alcohols: A Sustainable Access to Phthalides via N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide Mediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 22, November 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, scalable electrocatalytic method for direct lactonization of benzylic alcohols to phthalides using N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide as a redox mediator is reported. This metal&#8208;free process proceeds via a phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer mechanism, shows broad scope with good to excellent yields, and enables late&#8208;stage functionalizations, including syntheses of talopram and a Y5 receptor antagonist intermediate.

A sustainable and efficient electrochemical method for the direct oxidative lactonization of benzylic alcohols, enabling rapid access to isobenzofuran&#8208;1(3H)&#8208;ones (phthalides) is presented. This electrocatalytic transformation leverages N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide as a redox mediator under mild, metal&#8208;free conditions, offering an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional oxidation protocols. The method demonstrates broad substrate scope and delivers phthalide derivatives consistently in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies, combining cyclic voltammetry and density functional theory calculations, support a radical&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer mechanism driven by phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl radicals. Importantly, the utility of the protocol extends beyond model substrates: it is successfully applied to the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant compounds, including talopram and a key intermediate for a neuropeptide Y5 receptor antagonist. Overall, this work underscores the power of electrosynthesis in modern organic chemistry, merging green chemistry principles with synthetic efficiency.

Cheap copper (I) catalyzed difunctionalization of electron&#8208;withdrawing alkenes using germanium hydride and S&#8208;phosphorothiol to produce the germylphosphorothiolated product. This three&#8208;component reaction shows excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity and can also be used for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.

A copper&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component radical relay protocol is demonstrated for difunctionalization of electron&#8208;withdrawing alkenes using germanium hydride and S&#8208;phosphorothiol to afford the germylphosphorothiolated product. This transformation reveals excellent tolerance for functional groups and occurs under mild reaction conditions, exhibiting a high level of regioselectivity. Control experiments suggest the involvement of germyl radicals in these transformations.

Carbon dioxide, a renewable and eco&#8208;friendly carbon source, has garnered significant research interest in recent years for its application as a methyl source in synthesizing bioactive methylated compounds. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in reductive methylation of various nucleophiles with carbon dioxide as a C1 synthon for constructing carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8208;nitrogen bonds through various catalytic systems.

Methylation reactions have extraordinary value in organic chemistry, ranging from the assembly of structurally diverse organic functional chemicals to the introduction of methyl groups into pharmaceutical and agrochemical intermediates. In the context of sustainable chemistry, carbon dioxide (CO2) has emerged as an idea and alternative greener C1 source. As a result, reductive methylation strategies utilizing CO2 as a methylating agent have garnered substantial research interest in recent decades, particularly for synthesizing methylated derivatives, compounds with broad applications in drug discovery and agrochemical development. In this review, reductive methylations using CO2 as C1 synthon have been summarized and discussed in detail with focus on metal&#8208;catalyzed C/N&#8208;methylation reactions, base catalyzed C/N&#8208;methylation reactions, ionic liquids catalyzed C/N&#8208;methylation reactions, and catalyst&#8208;free C/N&#8208;methylation reactions based on various reductants. We also elucidate substrate compatibility in these reductive methylations, competing side reactions, and representative reaction mechanisms. Furthermore, conclusions and future trends are depicted finally in this review.

         <title>Recent Advances in Ene Reactions with Carbon Enophiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 22, November 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the classical intra&#8208; and intermolecular ene nexus with carbon enophiles (alkenes, alkynes, arynes, and allenes) show a considerable increase in structural complexity and an enormous potential for functional applications in polymer science.

Ene reactions are inter&#8208; or intramolecular addition reactions between a four&#8208;electron "ene" component and a two&#8208;electron enophile functionality, in which two &#960;&#8208;bonds and a C&#8211;H (or metal&#8211;C) &#963;&#8208;bond are rearranged into one &#960;&#8208;bond and two &#963;&#8208;bonds. One of the newly formed &#963;&#8208;bonds is a carbon&#8211;carbon bond, while the other is the rearranged a C&#8211;H (or metal&#8211;C) bond. This transformation enables the formation of structurally and functionally complex ene products in a single step. Originally, ene reactions were discovered as concerted and stepwise pericyclic elementary processes. However, increasing mechanistic insight&#8212;gained through both experimental and computational studies&#8212;along with extensive empirical methodological work, has paved the way to a plethora of ene&#8208;type reactions involving carbon enophiles. Since 2012, the already well&#8208;established transition metal&#8208;catalyzed variants of ene reactions have significantly expanded. Moreover, highly reactive aryne intermediates&#8212;generated in&#8201;situ either by fluoride induced elimination from ortho&#8208;silyl aryltriflates at room temperature, or by hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of a 1,3&#8208;diyne with an alkyne (both inter&#8208; and intramolecularly)&#8212;find increasing application in novel ene&#8208;type sequences. Propargyl ene reactions also gain traction, particularly because the resulting ene&#8208;allenes serve as highly valuable intermediates in the design of domino sequences that lead to complex polycyclic fused structures. Finally, the implementation of ene reactions in polymer chemistry for the synthesis of functionalized polymers and renewable unsaturated raw materials has emerged as a promising alternative to the use of purely petrochemistry based substrates.

&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in the classical intra- and intermolecular ene nexus with carbon enophiles (alkenes, alkynes, arynes, and allenes) show a considerable increase in structural complexity and an enormous potential for functional applications in polymer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ene reactions are inter- or intramolecular addition reactions between a four-electron "ene" component and a two-electron enophile functionality, in which two &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-bonds and a C&#8211;H (or metal&#8211;C) &lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;-bond are rearranged into one &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-bond and two &lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;-bonds. One of the newly formed &lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;-bonds is a carbon&#8211;carbon bond, while the other is the rearranged a C&#8211;H (or metal&#8211;C) bond. This transformation enables the formation of structurally and functionally complex ene products in a single step. Originally, ene reactions were discovered as concerted and stepwise pericyclic elementary processes. However, increasing mechanistic insight&#8212;gained through both experimental and computational studies&#8212;along with extensive empirical methodological work, has paved the way to a plethora of ene-type reactions involving carbon enophiles. Since 2012, the already well-established transition metal-catalyzed variants of ene reactions have significantly expanded. Moreover, highly reactive aryne intermediates&#8212;generated in&#8201;situ either by fluoride induced elimination from &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-silyl aryltriflates at room temperature, or by hexadehydro-Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of a 1,3-diyne with an alkyne (both inter- and intramolecularly)&#8212;find increasing application in novel ene-type sequences. Propargyl ene reactions also gain traction, particularly because the resulting ene-allenes serve as highly valuable intermediates in the design of domino sequences that lead to complex polycyclic fused structures. Finally, the implementation of ene reactions in polymer chemistry for the synthesis of functionalized polymers and renewable unsaturated raw materials has emerged as a promising alternative to the use of purely petrochemistry based substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>N&#8208;Containing Carbon Materials in Metal&#8208;Free and Non&#8208;Noble Metal Liquid Phase Heterogenous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 22, November 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over 100 examples of non&#8208;noble metal supported on N&#8208;containing and metal&#8208;free N&#8208;containing carbon catalysts are discussed. Particular emphasis is put on how different N&#8208;functionalities influence catalyst performance and stability. Preparation procedures are also examined, with a strong focus on how the heat treatment temperature influences N&#8208;functionalities distribution.

Non&#8208;noble metal and metal&#8208;free catalysts can be of great benefit for the development of economically and environmentally sustainable chemical processes. In this context, N&#8208;containing carbon materials serve both as effective catalyst supports and standalone catalysts, offering enhanced stability by mitigating deactivation mechanisms such as metal leaching and sintering. The review is primarily organized by non&#8208;noble metal, systematically covering each case in which their use as an active phase on N&#8208;containing carbon materials has been reported in literature. In parallel, cross&#8208;cutting aspects are examined throughout, including the role of different N&#8208;functionalities (graphitic, pyridinic, pyrrolic, and pyridinic&#8208;N&#8208;oxide) in active&#8208;phase stabilization mechanisms. Structurally diverse carbon materials&#8212;such as amorphous carbon, carbon nanotubes, carbon spheres, carbon nanofibers, and graphene&#8212;are also considered. Furthermore, the influence of preparation methods, including template&#8208;free, hard&#8208;templating and soft&#8208;templating techniques, is analyzed with emphasis on their role in tuning textural properties. Despite significant progress, uncertainties remain regarding the precise stabilization mechanisms and the relative contributions of different N&#8208;functionalities to catalytic activity and surface acid&#8211;base properties. Addressing these knowledge gaps will be essential for optimization of N&#8208;containing carbon materials and to drive the transition towards greener and more sustainable catalytic technologies.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Insights into On&#8208;Surface Chemistry of Organosilicon Compounds by Scanning Probe Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning probe microscopy techniques enable atomic&#8208;level visualization of Si&#9472;H/O and C&#9472;Si bond activation and aromatic C&#9472;Si bond formation in organosilicon compounds (silane, silyl, and silole). Each class exhibits distinct surface&#8208;mediated transformations and bottom&#8208;up fabrication of functional nanostructures.

Organosilicon compounds (OSCs), which consist of silicon atoms bonded to organic groups, have become vital in fields such as materials science, catalysis, and electronics. Their flexibility comes from the ability to adjust their properties by attaching different organic groups to the silicon framework. Despite many progresses, a key challenge persists in controlling the structure and reactivity of these compounds, particularly on a solid surface. Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques, including scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM), are powerful tools for studying molecular behaviors at the atomic level. These techniques enable real space imaging and precise measurements, making them invaluable for understanding OSCs. This article examines the application of STM, STS, and AFM in the on&#8208;surface chemistry of organosilicon, with a focus on molecular adsorption, self&#8208;assembly, surface&#8208;driven reactions, and innovative synthesis of nanostructures. These techniques can provide valuable insights into surface reactivity, molecular organization, and the formation of nanostructures, driving the development of advanced functional materials. Further, density functional theory offers exciting opportunities for advancing surface chemistry and nanomaterial design. This article highlights the critical role of SPM in pushing forward OSCs research and enabling the development of next&#8208;generation organosilicon nanomaterials.

A Sustainable Electrochemical Platform for Decarboxylative Amidation: Direct Access to N&#8208;Arylamides from &#945;&#8208;Keto Acids and Arylamines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This electrochemical strategy enables the direct synthesis of amides from &#945;&#8208;keto acids and arylamines. Using ferrocene as a redox mediator, the system promotes single&#8208;electron oxidation to generate acyl radicals that couple with anodically oxidized arylamines. Operating under mild, oxidant&#8208;free conditions, the method provides a versatile and sustainable route to valuable N&#8208;arylamides and displays exceptional functional group tolerance, enabling the synthesis of more than 40 structurally diverse amides, including pharmaceutically relevant examples.

Amide bonds are ubiquitous in bioactive molecules, yet their synthesis often relies on prefunctionalized reagents or stoichiometric activators, posing sustainability challenges. Herein, we report a novel electrochemical decarboxylative amidation strategy enabling direct coupling of &#945;&#8208;keto acids with arylamines to access N&#8208;arylamides under mild, oxidant&#8208;free conditions. This redox mediator&#8208;controlled indirect electrolysis harnesses ferrocene to facilitate single&#8208;electron oxidation of &#945;&#8208;keto acids, generating acyl radicals that couple with anodically oxidized arylamine radicals to form amides efficiently. This programmable approach offers operational simplicity and synthetic versatility, providing streamlined access to valuable amide scaffolds with promising applications in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Discovery of Switchable Metal&#8208; and Ligand&#8208;Centered Reactivity via Mechanistic Studies on C&#63743;O Activation of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents two orthogonal reactivities localized at metal and ligand sites separately with tandem Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;O arylation of pyridyl methyl ether and homocoupling of pyridine derivatives: 1) two&#8208;electron C&#63743;O arylation via a Ni(0)/Ni(II) redox manifold with the reactive site located at metal center; 2) one&#8208;electron homocoupling via [IPr&#8211;Ni(0/I)&#8211;pyridyl&#8226;&#8722;] intermediates with the reactive site at ligands.

Metal&#8211;ligand cooperation (MLC) reaction revolutionizes the boundaries of homogeneous catalysis by permitting ligand&#8208;centered reactivity beyond traditional metal&#8208;orientated reactivity. Pyridine is key motif in many pharmaceuticals and agrochemical products, but it also shows promise in participating MLC reaction for further derivatization. However, such unique reaction integration into C&#63743;O bond functionalization remains underexplored, largely due to poorly understood reactivity profiles. In this work, a mechanistic investigation into nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;O bond activation of pyridine&#8208;based aryl ethers is reported to elucidate the electronic and structural features of the active species and MLC/metal&#8211;ligand role reversal (MLRR) pathway. With detailed mechanistic studies including density functional theory calculation, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, and model catalyst, two distinct catalytic cycles are elucidated: 1) a two&#8208;electron&#8208;based C&#63743;O arylation at nickel center and 2) a single&#8208;electron&#8208;driven pyridine homocoupling reaction via MLC and MLRR manifolds. These insights subsequently allow establishment of a synthetic methodology for switchable C&#63743;O bond cleavage and homocoupling in substrate scope studies.

         <title>1,3&#8208;Difunctionalization of Allyl Carboxylates Enabled by 1,2&#8208;Radical Migration (RaM) and Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote C&#8211;H Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work merges 1,2&#8208;radical migration (1,2&#8208;RaM) with ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8211;H activation for alkene 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization, enabling distal C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) bond formation. The cascade combines Ru single&#8208;electron transfer (Ru&#8208;SET), acyloxy migration, and radical addition, showcasing broad scope, scalability, and late&#8208;stage applicability. Mechanistic studies support the radical&#8208;involved pathway.

Radical migration, especially 1,2&#8208;radical migration (1,2&#8208;RaM), has emerged as a powerful strategy in reaction discovery and synthetic development, enabling highly selective 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes and granting access to previously unexplored functional molecules and chemical space, with broad implications for complex molecule construction and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report efficient and regioselective catalytic methods that, for the first time, combine 1,2&#8208;radical migration (1,2&#8208;RaM) with ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed remote C&#8211;H activation to achieve difunctionalization at the meta&#8208;position of aromatic C(sp2)&#8211;H bonds and the C3 position of aliphatic C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds. This transformation demonstrates broad functional group tolerance and scalability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, offering a novel approach for the construction of complex molecules.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Atropisomeric Amines via Transaminase&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic kinetic resolution approach is developed for the atroposelective synthesis of heterobiaryl primary amines. Using transaminases and leveraging Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions to induce racemization, a variety of axially chiral primary amines are produced in high yields and enantioselectivities. This mild, metal&#8208;free method expands the scope of biocatalytic asymmetric synthesis.

Atropisomeric heterobiaryl primary amines are of significant interest in both organic and pharmaceutical chemistry. A series of transaminases have been employed to synthesize these valuable compounds with high yields (up to 98% conversion) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to &#8805;99% ee) via dynamic kinetic resolution of the corresponding heterobiaryl aldehydes. This process features a Lewis acid&#8211;base interaction strategy to facilitate labilization of the stereogenic axis.

         <title>Aerobic Oxidative Dethioacetalization Catalyzed by an Iron Phthalocyanine Complex</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protocol for iron octacarboxyphthalocyanine&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidative dethioacetalization in an aqueous solvent is developed. This method can efficiently convert a broad range of dithioacetals into the corresponding carbonyl compounds. Inspired by enzyme&#8208;mediated redox processes, the environmentally friendly catalytic system exhibits remarkable functional group compatibility.

An aerobic oxidative dethioacetalization catalyzed by an iron octacarboxyphthalocyanine complex, which is designed by mimicking enzymatic oxidation, in an aqueous media is developed. The developed method can efficiently convert a broad range of dithioacetals, including those derived from aryl and aliphatic ketones and aldehydes, into the corresponding carbonyl compounds while tolerating various functional groups. This protocol is readily scalable to the gram scale. Mechanistic studies indicate that the iron phthalocyanine complex initiates the reaction by accepting a single electron from the sulfur atom of the dithioacetal, forming a radical cation intermediate. This is followed by unimolecular fragmentation and subsequent degradation of the resulting hemithioacetal to afford the corresponding carbonyl product, along with 1,2&#8208;dithiolane and its oxides.

         <title>Initiation Kinetics of Latent Olefin Metathesis Precatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ready, set, go: Initiation of several latent olefin metathesis precatalysts was measured both by light and heat activation. Sulfur&#8208;chelated ruthenium precatalysts were initiated more efficiently when thermally activated, while the precatalysts with phosphite ligands were more responsive to photochemical stimulation. The initiation results were compared with benchmark RCM and ROMP reactions.

Latent catalysts represent a specialized class of precatalysts that remain dormant under ambient conditions until activated by external stimuli to initiate catalytic activity. This study investigates the initiation behavior of latent olefin metathesis precatalysts, focusing on two different types: sulfur&#8208;chelated systems and phosphite&#8208;ligated ruthenium complexes. The initiation process was first monitored in situ by tracking characteristic proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H&#8208;NMR) signals in the presence of butyl vinyl ether under two activation modes: heating and light irradiation. The analysis for both activation stimuli enabled the determination of initiation rate constants and revealed details of the distinct mechanistic pathways. Moreover, comparing the initiation kinetics and catalytic performance in ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) and ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) established structure&#8211;activity relationships. The ligand environment was found to significantly modulate precatalyst reactivity, with sulfur&#8208;chelated complexes mostly showing enhanced thermal activity, while phosphite systems demonstrated superior photochemical responsiveness. These findings provide support for advancing the development of next&#8208;generation latent metathesis catalysts with tailored activation profiles for precision polymer synthesis and spatiotemporal control of polymerization processes.

         <title>Harnessing the Excited&#8208;State Reactivity of o&#8208;Nitrobenzyl Alcohols for the Rapid Synthesis of N&#8208;Substituted 2H&#8208;Indazoles</title>

         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, iron&#8208;catalyzed cascade enables the one&#8208;pot synthesis of 3&#8208;arylamino&#8208;2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2H&#8208;indazoles from readily available o&#8208;nitrobenzyl alcohols and anilines under mild, sustainable conditions. The process involves photoinduced formation of o&#8208;nitrosobenzaldehyde, followed by condensation, cyclization, and aromatization. The resulting indazoles exhibit a selective fluorescence quenching response toward hypochlorite, highlighting their potential for ClO&#8722; detection.

2H&#8208;Indazole scaffolds represent privileged structural motifs prevalent in a wide range of bioactive compounds and pharmaceutical agents. Despite their significance, conventional synthetic approaches to 2H&#8208;indazole derivatives often suffer from limitations such as harsh reaction conditions, the use of expensive or toxic catalysts, and multistep procedures. To address these challenges, we report a cost&#8208;effective, environmentally benign, and one&#8208;pot strategy for the synthesis of biologically and synthetically valuable 3&#8208;arylamino&#8208;2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2H&#8208;indazoles. This method employs readily available o&#8208;nitrobenzyl alcohols as key building blocks and utilizes a Lewis acid iron salt as a catalyst under visible light irradiation, harnessing the excited&#8208;state reactivity of the substrates. The transformation proceeds efficiently without the need for precious metal catalysts, external oxidants, or additives and operates under mild and sustainable conditions. The protocol enables the construction of structurally complex 2H&#8208;indazoles, including those embedded in medium&#8208;sized rings. Notably, the synthesized 3&#8208;arylamino&#8208;2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2H&#8208;indazoles exhibit a selective fluorescence quenching response toward hypochlorite, highlighting their potential as an effective probe for ClO&#8722; detection.

         <title>Domino Synthesis of Functionalized Cyclic Acetals From Organic Carbonates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic carbonates equipped with acrylic functional groups are shown to undergo a domino process in the presence of a suitable alkoxide to deliver novel types of decorated cyclic acetals. The developed protocol combines practical conditions and a wide scope and features a new reactivity modus for these carbon dioxide&#8208;derived heterocyclic precursors.

We report a method for the base&#8208;mediated transformation of ether&#8208;tethered acrylic ester&#8208;based cyclic carbonates into functionalized cyclic acetals. The protocol builds on the use of hydroxyalkyl&#8208;substituted cyclic carbonates that undergo an oxa&#8208;Michael addition reaction in the presence of alkyl propiolates thereby forging (E)&#8208;configured acrylic ether intermediates. The scope of the reaction involves the use of both five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered cyclic carbonates, and correspondingly, both five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered cyclic acetals can be prepared. The amount of reagents, the purification method, and the type of ester substrate all contribute to the efficiency of the transformation. Mechanistic control reactions point at the intermediacy of an alkoxide that induces an intramolecular Michael addition onto the acrylic double bond following alkoxide&#8208;mediated formation of both an alcohol and ester in the final product. These functional groups, among others, further enable easy diversification of acetal&#8208;based synthons.

         <title>Engineering of an Ancestral McbA with Enhanced Domain Mobility Extends Biocatalytic Amide Synthesis Scope</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show how engineered ancestral amide bond synthetases (ABSs) together with cofactor recycling using a single polyphosphate kinase paves the way for chemoenzymatic synthesis of pharmacophores. The figure illustrates how ancestral ABS has a more flexible C&#8208;terminal domain, which is associated with enhanced catalytic performance and expanded amine scope. An ancestral enzyme can thus be robust but still show enhanced interdomain mobility.

Amide bond formation is a basal transformation in synthetic chemistry and the pharmaceutical industry that is traditionally performed under harsh conditions, using excess amounts of amine and relying on coupling agents. Biocatalysis shows great potential in contributing to milder and more sustainable amide bond formation in water, in particular using the emerging family of amide bond synthetase (ABS) enzymes. Here, we use molecular dynamics, biocatalysis, and enzyme engineering to study amide bond formation in extant and ancestral ABS from Marinactinospora thermotolerans (McbA). Our results show that while being more thermostable, the C&#8208;terminal domain that delivers the amine substrate to the adenylated acid intermediate is more flexible in ancestral McbA, presumably leading to an extended amine scope as observed experimentally from a small panel of aliphatic and aromatic substrates. An engineered ancestor of McbA harboring a single mutation that presumptively represent a catalytic shift residue when going from ancestral to modern biocatalyst, show two to ten&#8208;fold improved conversions over its ancestral template while maintaining high thermostability, highlighting ancestral sequence reconstruction as a potent method in protein engineering. Kinetic experiments showed that the engineered ancestral enzyme had 2&#8208;fold higher apparent kcat values in amide formation compared to extant enzyme, concomitant with relaxed substrate inhibition and loss&#8208;of&#8208;dependency on magnesium. Finally, we optimize ATP recycling utilizing a single polyphosphate kinase to showcase how engineered ancestral McbA together with reaction optimization is amenable for pharmacophore synthesis at a preparative scale.

         <title>Enhancing Thermal&#8208;Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 via H2O&#8208;H2 Co&#8208;Feeding in Mg&#8208;Doped Bismuth Catalysts</title>

Mg&#8208;doped Bi nanospheres facilitate efficient thermal&#8208;photocatalytic CO2 reduction in a H2O&#63743;H2 atmosphere. In this system, H2O generates active Bi&#63743;OH sites for CO2 adsorption, while H2 drives the reduction by supplying *H species. The synergistic effect achieves a 2.4&#8208;fold enhancement in CO production with 100% selectivity compared to a pure H2 atmosphere.

The rational design of efficient thermal&#8208;photo CO2 reduction catalysts necessitates synergistic integration of structural modulation and reactant activation strategies. Herein, a Mg&#8208;doped Bi nanosphere catalyst is reported, engineered for efficient CO2 reduction under H2O&#8208;H2 co&#8208;feeding conditions. Mg doping not only optimizes the nanostructure by reducing the particle size but also modifies the surface charge distribution and enhances water adsorption, thereby promoting CO2 activation and catalytic performance. Crucially, under H2O&#63743;H2 co&#8208;feeding, H2O interacts with Bi to generate hydroxylated Bi&#63743;OH sites that promote CO2 chemisorption, while H2 supplies hydrogen species (*H) for CO2 reduction. In&#8201;situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy reveals a cooperative mechanism: CO2 adsorbs on Bi&#63743;OH to form *CO32&#8722; intermediates, which undergo sequential reduction facilitated by H2 activation. This synergy achieves a CO production rate of 55.32&#8201;&#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 under 420&#8201;nm illumination with 100% selectivity, which is 2.4 times higher than that under a pure H2 atmosphere. The work highlights the critical role of dopant&#8208;driven active site engineering and reactant synergies (H2O&#63743;H2) in CO2 valorization, providing a scalable strategy for catalytic performance enhancement.

         <title>Phenoxide&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Alkenes from Trifluoromethylated Alkyl Bromides</title>

         <dc:description>
A phenoxide catalyzed elimination reaction enabled by weak interactions.

&#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;substituted alkenes are a class of highly important building blocks. Herein, a new phenol&#8208;based catalytic system is developed that facilitates the elimination of trifluoromethylated alkyl bromides to produce trifluoromethylated alkenes&#8208;a process previously deemed challenging. This method is distinguished by its mild reaction conditions, extensive substrate compatibility, and high chemo&#8208;selectivity and regioselectivity. This facile elimination can be plausibly attributed to phenoxide anion&#8211;secondary trifluoromethylated alkyl bromides weak interactions.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Ketones From &#945;&#8208;Keto Acids Under Mild Conditions</title>

A sustainable photocatalytic strategy for the direct conversion of &#945;&#8208;keto acids to &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones under mild conditions.

A mild and green photocatalytic strategy for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones through N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide (NCS)&#8208;assisted decarboxylation of &#945;&#8208;keto acids, followed by radical coupling and hydrogen atom transfer has been reported. The method operates at room temperature under visible light irradiation without metal catalysts, bases, or oxidants. A wide range of aromatic &#945;&#8208;keto acids were smoothly converted into the expected products. The feasibility of scale&#8208;up and sunlight&#8208;driven reactions further highlighted its practicality. The ultraviolet&#8211;visible absorption spectra experiments ruled out the formation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor complexes, and Stern&#8211;Volmer experiments demonstrated the facilitative role of NCS in the photoinduced generation of acyl radical.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Alkenes from Alcohols or Amines by One&#8208;Pot Laccase&#8208;Mediated Oxidations and Wittig Reaction in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we present a sustainable, one&#8208;pot, chemoenzymatic procedure for the synthesis of alkenes from the corresponding alcohols or amines in aqueous medium. The procedure is based on the laccase&#8208;TEMPO&#8208;mediated oxidation of substrates and subsequent Wittig reaction. The method has a number of advantages in terms of sustainability, such as application of water as the reaction medium, use of molecular oxygen as final oxidant, or formation of water as a byproduct of the oxidation step.

A general, chemoenzymatic one&#8208;pot procedure for the transformation of alcohols or amines to the corresponding alkene products in aqueous media has been reported. The procedure is based on the laccase&#8208;TEMPO&#8208;mediated oxidations of substrates and subsequent Wittig reaction. In this way, a one&#8208;pot sequence of two consecutive reactions has been developed, which has a number of advantages such as (a) no need of purification of the intermediate products, (b) application of water as green solvent and an enzyme&#8208;laccase as natural catalyst, (c) application of molecular oxygen as final green oxidant, and (d) formation of water as a byproduct of the oxidation step.

A novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component tandem sulfonylation and carbonylation of 1,6&#8208;enynes has been developed for the rapid construction of functionalized succinimides bearing sulfone and carbonyl motifs.

A novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component tandem sulfonylation and carbonylation of 1,6&#8208;enynes has been developed for the rapid construction of succinimide, sulfone, and carbonyl motifs simultaneously. In the presence of very low palladium catalyst loading, the reaction of 1,6&#8208;enynes with nucleophiles proceeded smoothly to afford a wide range of sulfone&#8208; and carbonyl&#8208;containing succinimide derivatives with high yields and excellent selectivity. Notably, modifications of bioactive molecules were also demonstrated by using this method.

A possible reaction mechanism with triflic anhydride serving as a key mediator is proposed to explain this conversion.

         <title>Revisiting the Role of Intramolecular Proton Donation in ATC Foldamer Catalysts for Asymmetric Nitro&#8208;Michael Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterocyclic &#947;&#8208;peptide foldamers are structurally fine&#8208;tuned to improve the enantioselective nitro&#8208;Michael addition of ketones to nitroolefins. Modifications around the catalytic site enhance transition state organization and proton transfer, leading to significantly improved rates and selectivity. This work underscores the potential of &#947;&#8208;peptidic scaffolds in the rational design of chiral organocatalysts. 

The structural optimization of ATC&#8208;based foldamer catalysts for the enantioselective nitro&#8208;Michael addition of ketones to nitroolefins is reported. Building on the previous work with heteroaromatic &#947;&#8208;peptides, the influence of the spatial arrangement and flexibility around the catalytic site is investigated. A series of modified sequences are designed to fine&#8208;tune transition state preorganization while revisiting the contribution of an intramolecular proton donor function in ATC catalysts. These modifications lead to enhanced catalytic performance, with faster reaction rates and improved enantioselectivities under optimized conditions.

Dearomatization of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles was achieved through a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition. This reaction employed in situ&#8208;generated alkyne 3&#8208;methylene&#8208;3H&#8208;indoles from &#945;&#8208;(3&#8208;indolyl)propargylic alcohols, providing a route to chiral indole imine&#8208;tetrasubstituted allene skeletons. 

This work presents an efficient strategy for the dearomatization of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles to access chiral indole imine&#8208;tetrasubstituted allene skeletons. The transformation is achieved through a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition with alkyne 3&#8208;methylene&#8208;3H&#8208;indoles, generated in&#8201;situ from &#945;&#8208;(3&#8208;indolyl) propargylic alcohols. A series of chiral compounds possessing both axial and central chirality were synthesized in good to high yields with high asymmetric induction. Supported by control experiments, a plausible mechanism is proposed to elucidate the reaction pathway.

         <title>Glycine Synthesis From Methanol by a Cofactor&#8208;Neutral In&#8201;Vitro Multienzyme Cascade</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cofactor&#8208;neutral in&#8201;vitro multienzyme cascade is developed to allow the synthesis of glycine from methanol and NH3, which surpasses traditional &#8220;cell factory&#8221; paradigms, offering a novel and efficient C1&#8208;to&#8208;amino acid transformation.

The global demand for amino acids continues to rise, yet traditional synthesis methods face environmental and safety challenges. To contribute to a sustainable future vision, we herein report a novel cofactor&#8208;neutral in&#8201;vitro multienzyme cascade that directly converts methanol, a renewable C1 feedstock, into glycine under mild conditions. A two&#8208;step strategy achieves 82.2% methanol&#8208;to&#8208;glycolaldehyde and 86.0% glycolaldehyde&#8208;to&#8208;glycine conversion, respectively. At 500&#8201;mM methanol, it yields 18.8&#8201;mM glycine after 6&#8201;h, which represents a 26.8&#8208;fold improvement over the one&#8208;pot approach. These results demonstrate the potential of modular in&#8201;vitro multienzyme catalysis for efficient C1&#8208;to&#8208;amino acid transformation and establish a foundation for the synthesis of many other complex nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Biocatalytic Construction of a Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer Magnetic Resonance Imaging Nucleoside Probe: Synthesis and Evaluation of 5&#8208;Methyl&#8208;5,6&#8208;Dihydrothymidine</title>

Al&#8208;Hilfi et al. present a biocatalytic strategy for synthesizing 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;5,6&#8208;dihydrothymidine (5&#8208;MDHT), a sensitive MRI contrast agent. The study demonstrates that recombinant enzyme catalysis offers an efficient, sustainable, and eco&#8208;friendly alternative to traditional chemical synthesis for producing clinically relevant imaging probes.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a cornerstone of modern clinical diagnostics, often enhanced by contrast agents. Traditionally, these agents are chemically synthesized, which can involve complex, costly, and environmentally unfriendly processes. Here, we report a novel biocatalytic approach for the efficient, safe, and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis of 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;5,6&#8208;dihydrothymidine (5&#8208;MDHT), a potent chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST)&#8208;MRI probe for imaging in&#8201;vivo expression of the Herpes Simplex Virus Type&#8208;1 Thymidine Kinase (HSV1&#8208;TK) reporter gene. We demonstrate that 5&#8208;MDHT can be biosynthesized via one&#8208; or two&#8208;step enzymatic reactions using human purine nucleoside phosphorylase (hPNPase) and the SgvMVAV SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferase. hPNPase catalyzed the base&#8208;exchange reaction with catalytic efficiencies (kcat/KM) between 138 and 316&#8201;s&#8722;1&#183;M&#8722;1, while SgvMVAV methylation of 5,6&#8208;dihydrothymidine yielded 5&#8208;MDHT with a catalytic efficiency of 26&#8201; s&#8722;1&#183;M&#8722;1. Molecular dynamics simulations supported the enzymatic binding and selectivity observed experimentally. The resulting 5&#8208;MDHT was validated using CEST&#8208;MRI, showing a distinct exchangeable imino proton signal at 5.3&#8201;ppm. These findings highlight the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of the biocatalysts and establish biocatalysis as a viable platform for producing clinically relevant MRI contrast agents.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Based Materials for Electrocatalytic Glycerol Oxidation to Value&#8208;Added C1&#8211;C3 Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycerol, a cheap biodiesel byproduct, offers a sustainable path via electrocatalytic oxidation (GOR). Replacing the oxygen evolution reaction, GOR enables energy&#8208;saving coproduction of high&#8208;value chemicals and green hydrogen under mild conditions, reducing emissions. This review focuses on nanostructuring, defect engineering, and single&#8208;atom catalysts for designing efficient and low&#8208;cost transition metal catalysts for GOR to produce C1&#8211;C3 chemicals.

Glycerol, as the primary by&#8208;product in the biodiesel production process, is abundant and cost&#8208;effective. Its efficient conversion into other chemicals offers a promising strategy for alleviating the energy crisis. Electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) holds significant application potential due to its mild reaction conditions and lack of additional oxidants, enabling the production of various value&#8208;added chemicals such as lactic acid (LA), dihydroxyacetone (DHA), glyceric acid (GLA), oxalic acid (OA), and formic acid (FA). When GOR is used to replace the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), it enables the coproduction of high&#8208;value oxidation products and H2 while minimizing energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. This has important research significance and value for the conversion of biomass resources and the energy&#8208;efficient production of &#8220;green hydrogen.&#8221; Consequently, designing efficient and low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts to achieve high activity and selectivity in GOR is a central research objective. Among these, transition metal materials demonstrate significant advantages. This review introduces the types of transition metal catalysts used for GOR and discusses recent catalyst design strategies to enhance GOR activity and selectivity, including nanostructure regulation, defects and surface engineering, heterostructure construction, and single&#8208;atom catalysts. In addition, the practical applications of GOR as well as sustainability studies are discussed. Finally, we summarize the current challenges facing transition metal catalysts in GOR and discuss future prospects.

This review focuses on nanostructuring, defect engineering, and single-atom catalysts for designing efficient and low-cost transition metal catalysts for GOR to produce C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycerol, as the primary by-product in the biodiesel production process, is abundant and cost-effective. Its efficient conversion into other chemicals offers a promising strategy for alleviating the energy crisis. Electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) holds significant application potential due to its mild reaction conditions and lack of additional oxidants, enabling the production of various value-added chemicals such as lactic acid (LA), dihydroxyacetone (DHA), glyceric acid (GLA), oxalic acid (OA), and formic acid (FA). When GOR is used to replace the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), it enables the coproduction of high-value oxidation products and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; while minimizing energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. This has important research significance and value for the conversion of biomass resources and the energy-efficient production of &#8220;green hydrogen.&#8221; Consequently, designing efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts to achieve high activity and selectivity in GOR is a central research objective. Among these, transition metal materials demonstrate significant advantages. This review introduces the types of transition metal catalysts used for GOR and discusses recent catalyst design strategies to enhance GOR activity and selectivity, including nanostructure regulation, defects and surface engineering, heterostructure construction, and single-atom catalysts. In addition, the practical applications of GOR as well as sustainability studies are discussed. Finally, we summarize the current challenges facing transition metal catalysts in GOR and discuss future prospects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Demonstrating a Folding Strategy Utilizing Phosphine&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Rauhut&#8211;Currier Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic strategies to access new classes of indanes and dibenzocycloheptanes employing an intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier reaction are outlined. In essence, this work contributes to demonstrating the folding strategy of diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis. The scope and generality of the methods have been rigorously validated.

A folding strategy of the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis (DOS) utilizing nucleophilic organophosphine&#8208;promoted intramolecular Rauhut&#8211;Currier reaction is presented. Besides establishing a DOS variant, the strategy facilitates the rapid synthesis of highly substituted indanones and dibenzocycloheptanones under metal&#8208;free and neutral conditions. Phosphines efficiently catalyze the transformation of various tethered bis&#8208;enones, resulting in the formation of &#946;&#8208;alkylated &#945;&#8208;arylidene/allylidene indanones and dibenzocycloheptanones. These scaffolds are commonly found in numerous bioactive natural products and pharmaceutically relevant compounds. The broad applicability of the method across a wide range of substrates is demonstrated, and further enhances the skeletal and stereochemical diversity through several postsynthetic modifications.

An efficient synthesis of pyridyl&#8208;substituted unsymmetrical ureas has been accomplished by the reaction of 2&#8208;aminopyridines with N&#8208;arylmaleimides in the presence of catalytic copper acetate. Interestingly, the N&#8208;arylmaleimides act as N&#8208;arylcarbamoyl surrogate, and the reaction is endowed with good substrate scope and functional group tolerance.

         <title>Chiral Phosphoric Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Reductive Amination: Accessing 8&#8208;Arylquinoline Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic asymmetric reductive amination is developed for the synthesis of valuable axially chiral 8&#8208;arylquinoline architectures, which features good&#8208;to,&#8208;high enantioselectivities (up to 96:4 er), broad functionality tolerance, and versatile downstream transformations. DFT calculations reveal a unique racemization mechanism involving the formation of quinolinium cation intermediate. Furthermore, a &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; two&#8208;step procedure of asymmetric transfer hydrogenation is found to be capable of increasing the optical purity of quinoline products by a cascade kinetic resolution step(up&#160;to&#8201;&gt;&#8201;99:1 er).

Disclosed here is an atroposelective dynamic kinetic asymmetric reductive amination catalyzed by chiral phosphoric acid, which provides access to a series of axially chiral 8&#8208;arylquinolines in 50&#8211;97% yields with good&#8208;to&#8208;high enantioselectivities (85.5:14.5&#8208;96:4 er). The formation of quinolinium cation intermediate is found to play a key role in facilitating racemization, thereby enabling a dynamic kinetic resolution scenario. The broad functional group tolerance and versatile downstream functionalization demonstrate utility of current methodology. Interestingly, significant enantiomeric enrichment of 8&#8208;arylquinoline products is achieved by &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; two&#8208;step asymmetric transfer hydrogenation thanks to a &#8220;matched&#8221; cascade kinetic resolution step (up to&#8201;&gt;&#8201;99:1 er)

         <title>A Synthetic Approach to Sterically Hindered P&#8208;Chiral Phosphine Ligands and Their Applications for Asymmetric Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deprotonative desymmetrization and asymmetric reduction serve as key steps to enable a concise approach to highly enantiomerically enriched P&#8208;chiral phosphines, which form configurationally stable gold complexes. Application in a [2&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition reaction of a homoallenyl tryptamine demonstrates their promise as catalysts in challenging asymmetric gold catalysis.

In contrast to wide&#8208;ranging applications of axially and planar chiral bidentate phosphine ligands, the development of P&#8208;chiral monophosphine ligands is much less advanced. Here a practical method is outlined for the synthesis of P&#8208;chiral biaryl or ortho&#8208;((diphenyl)methyl)phenyl phosphines by desymmetrizing alkyl(diphenyl)phosphine oxides by directed ortho&#8208;lithiation and electrophilic quenching of the aryllithium intermediates. The biaryl subunit is introduced by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions of ortho&#8208;iodophenyl phosphine oxides in very good yields. Enantiomerically highly enriched phosphine oxides are obtained by crystallization. A widely unsolved problem consists of the asymmetric reduction of P&#8208;chiral phosphine oxides to the corresponding phosphines. Herein, mild and highly selective Ti(OiPr)4/hydrosilane&#8208;mediated stereoretentive reduction reactions of biarylphosphine oxides or stereoinvertive reductions of ortho&#8208;(diphenylmethyl)phenyl phosphine oxides to the corresponding phosphines are described. The mechanism of this reduction method is investigated and most likely proceeds by a Ti(II)&#8208;mediated P&#63743;O bond cleavage in the phosphine oxide. The optically highly enriched P&#8208;stereogenic monophosphine ligands form stable gold(I) complexes. Their initial application in an intramolecular asymmetric [2&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition of an allenyl indole reveals good catalytic activity and promising asymmetric induction.

It proceeds through an unprecedented selective C-3 propargylation facilitated by Lewis acid catalysis, leading to a pivotal C-3 propargylated indole-2-carboxylic acid and a subsequent gold-catalyzed Z-selective cycloisomerization to afford the pyrano indolone derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;

A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenyl esters or ketones has been achieved, affording the disubstituted cis&#8208;gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (up to 99% ee and &gt;20:1 dr). Furthermore, the hydrogenation proceeds smoothly at gram scale without erosion of activity and enantioselectivity. The chiral gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropane products could be transformed into chiral building blocks and bioactive molecule.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Biocatalytic One&#8208;Pot Conversion of 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Alkenes into Optically Enriched Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable one&#8208;pot/two&#8208;step photobiocatalytic cascade to convert &#945;&#8208;methyl terminal alkenes into enantiomerically pure amines is developed. Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven oxidative cleavage of alkenes to prochiral ketones using 9&#8208;fluorenone and molecular oxygen in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is seamlessly coupled with transaminase&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective reductive amination, affording pharmaceutically&#8208;relevant chiral amines in up to 95% overall conversion and &gt;99% ee under mild and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions.

Merging photocatalysis with biocatalysis has recently emerged as a powerful strategy in chemical synthesis. Whereas photocatalysis enables the generation of reactive intermediates under mild conditions, biocatalysis provides exceptional selectivity with minimal byproducts. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot/two&#8208;step photo&#8208;biocatalytic oxidation&#8211;reductive amination cascade that transforms &#945;&#8208;methyl terminal alkenes into enantiomerically pure amines. In the initial step, 1,1&#8208;disubstituted (hetero)aryl alkyl olefins underwent oxidative cleavage to prochiral ketones using molecular oxygen under blue&#8208;light irradiation (427&#8201;nm) with 9&#8208;fluorenone as a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalyst in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which simultaneously serves as solvent and quencher of in situ generated H2O2. Subsequent sequential combination with transaminase&#8208;catalyzed reductive amination furnished the targeted nonracemic amines in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent overall conversions (52%&#8211;95%) and high&#8208;to&#8208;excellent enantiomeric excesses (90%&#8211;99.9%) in a stereocomplementary manner. The photo&#8208;biocatalytic cascade was successfully scaled up with &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene (1.0&#8201;mmol), enabling the synthesis of the pharmaceutically relevant chiral precursor (R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethylamine in 93% conversion, 61% isolated yield, and &gt;99% ee. Further derivatization of this key intermediate delivered the L&#8208;type calcium channel blocker fendiline in 77% isolated yield and 99% ee, without the need for costly transition metal catalysts, hazardous hydrogen gas, and high pressure.

A novel strategy for the synthesis of 2&#8208;imino&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydrofuran derivatives by a cascade Ugi/Ag&#8208;catalyzed domino cyclization has been described. The reaction initially produces the Ugi intermediate. Subsequently, in the presence of K2CO3 and AgNO3, a tandem domino cyclization and ring&#8208;opening reaction occurs. This process, facilitated by the neighboring group, results in the formation of 2&#8208;imino&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydrofurans with a high overall yield.

         <title>Development of a Copper&#8208;Free Click Reaction for Asymmetric Rh Diene Catalysis Under Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;free amino&#8211;yne click reaction enables the selective functionalization of chiral diene ligands with both soluble and immobilized amines. Substituent&#8208;controlled stereoselectivity affords (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;enaminone ligands, which are converted into Rh complexes for asymmetric catalysis under homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions.

We report a copper&#8208;free alkynone&#8208;amine click reaction as a versatile strategy for the immobilization of chiral norbornadiene&#8208;based ligands. This methodology was applied to both soluble amines and amino&#8208;functionalized mesoporous silica support materials. Therefore, a series of (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;configured enaminones were synthesized, revealing a strong substituent&#8208;dependent stereoselectivity: primary amines exclusively formed (Z)&#8208;enaminones, while secondary amines afforded (E)&#8208;isomers with high selectivity (&gt;99:1). The resulting enaminone&#8208;functionalized diene ligands were subsequently applied in Rh catalysis both under homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions. Regarding the enantioselectivity it was found that the catalysts performed well under homogeneous conditions for 1,2&#8208;additions while heterogeneous conditions gave the best results for the Rh&#8208;catalyzed isoxazole ring contraction.

         <title>Exploring Ligand Effects in the Selective Catalytic Dehydrogenative Borylation of Alkynes with Aluminum</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proper selection of a modified guanidinato ligand allows for the selective catalytic dehydroborylation of terminal alkynes by an air&#8208;stable aluminum complex. A plausible reaction pathway is suggested based on DFT studies, where the auxiliary substituent of the guanidinato ligand actively participates in the activation of the &#963; C&#63743;H bond.

The adequate design of ligands is an essential tool for controlling selectivity in catalytic reactions, particularly as the field shifts toward the use of Earth&#8208;abundant metals. Herein, the synthesis and catalytic evaluation of a series of aluminum guanidinato complexes derived from guanidine ligands bearing diverse donor substituents: (iPrHN)2CNR (R&#8201;=&#8201;2&#8208;Ph2PC6H4, 2&#8208;MeSC6H4, 2&#8208;PhSC6H4, 2&#8208;NCyMeCH2C6H4) is reported. An interesting correlation is identified between selectivity and the hard&#8211;soft donor properties of the substituent. Notably, the complex featuring an additional nitrogen&#8208;based substituent is air&#8208;stable and exhibits high chemoselectivity in the dehydrogenative borylation of alkynes with HBpin, in contrast to the conventional hydroboration pathway. Aromatic and aliphatic alkynes with different substituents have been borylated. This catalyst is also capable of hydroborating and subsequently borylating an aldehyde bearing an alkyne group in a tandem process. The experimental and DFT studies allow to establish bonding situations between the auxiliary group and the metal center ranging from noncovalent interconnections to labile bonds and support a mechanism in which these interactions play a key role in driving this distinct reactivity.

         <title>Stereoselective Control of Iminium Catalysis at Elevated Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective control is achieved through iminium catalysis at elevated temperatures utilizing secondary amine&#8211;strong acid catalytic systems. Through construction of a hydrocarbazole polycyclic skeleton containing continuous chiral centers and all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters, this strategy demonstrates significant advantages in promoting reactions with low&#8208;reactivity substrates.

A significant challenge in the field of organocatalysis is limited scope of substrate applicability, particularly in facilitating efficient reactions involving low&#8208;reactivity substrates. Stereoselective control at elevated temperatures stands out as one of the most effective strategies for mitigating the challenge. We herein report the stereoselective control achieved through iminium catalysis at elevated temperatures utilizing secondary amine&#8208;strong acid catalytic systems. According to the construction of a hydrocarbazole polycyclic skeleton containing continuous chiral centers and all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters, this strategy has demonstrated significant advantages in promoting reactions with low&#8208;reactivity substrates.

         <title>Integrating Vitamin B12 with Immobilized Lipase for a Recyclable Chemoenzymatic Cascade</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating a metallocofactor (Vitamin B12) with an immobilized enzyme enables a recyclable chemoenzymatic cascade. Vitamin B12 first catalyzes the deprotection of allyl ether to alcohol, which is subsequently converted by immobilized lipase into the target ester. The immobilized lipase boosts activity beyond free lipase and Novozym 435, and the cascade retains&#8201;&gt;&#8201;90% of its initial activity after five cycles.

Chemoenzymatic cascades combine the strengths of chemical and biological catalysis, offering tremendous potential for applications in synthetic chemistry, but integrating natural metallocofactors with immobilized enzymes in aqueous media remains underdeveloped. Here, we report the example of a recyclable chemoenzymatic cascade through integrating a natural metal&#8208;based catalyst (vitamin B12) with an immobilized enzyme. By a two&#8208;step&#8208;sequence chemoenzymatic cascade, vitamin B12 first catalyzes a deprotection of allyl ether to release 3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;propanol, which is subsequently converted by immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B (CalB) into the target ester 3&#8208;phenylpropyl butyrate. CalB is immobilized on tailored alkyl&#8208;functionalized silica nanoparticles, creating a hydrophobic microenvironment that enhances enzyme immobilization and good chemoenzymatic cascade activity, outperforming the controls (free enzyme and Novozyme 435). Under optimized conditions, the designed cascade reaction achieves 62% conversion in 24&#8201;h, and interestingly, the system can be reused for at least five cycles while retaining over 90% of its initial activity. As a compelling demonstration of integrating a natural metal complex with immobilized enzymes in a cascade process, this article establishes a good example for chemoenzymatic synthesis, with broad potential for extension to other high&#8208;value chemical transformations.

Nucleophile Promoted Functionalization of Cross&#8208;Conjugated Enynone Gives Sulfonylated Furan</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfonylated furans form serendipitously when cross&#8208;conjugated sulfonyl enynones react under basic conditions in alcohols, with the solvent acting as a nucleophile. Fluorinated alcohols provide optimal yields. Other nucleophiles also participate effectively via a Michael addition&#8211;alkyne to allene isomerization&#8211;oxa&#8208;Michael sequence. The protocol extends to pyrroles, benzofurans, and polyheterocycles. TFE&#8208;substituted furans readily convert into bi&#8208;/triaryl methanes.

Serendipitous formation of sulfonylated furan was observed when cross&#8208;conjugated sulfonyl enynones were reacted under basic conditions in alcohol, with solvent acting as a nucleophile. Fluorinated alcohols gave the best outcomes. Not only alcohols but other nucleophiles also worked well via Michael addition/alkyne to allene isomerization/oxa&#8208;Michael addition reaction sequence. The developed protocol is extended to the synthesis of pyrrole, benzofuran, and polyheterocyclic compounds.

&lt;p&gt;Sulfonylated furans form serendipitously when cross-conjugated sulfonyl enynones react under basic conditions in alcohols, with the solvent acting as a nucleophile. Fluorinated alcohols provide optimal yields. Other nucleophiles also participate effectively via a Michael addition&#8211;alkyne to allene isomerization&#8211;oxa-Michael sequence. The protocol extends to pyrroles, benzofurans, and polyheterocycles. TFE-substituted furans readily convert into bi-/triaryl methanes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electrosynthesis of &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Ketones Directly from Ketones with Methanol as a Hydroxymethylating Reagent</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported an electrochemical protocol for the &#945;&#8208;hydroxymethylation of ketones via a dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H of ketones and methanol. The prevalence of methanol also enables the possibility to install deuterated hydroxymethyl groups.

An electrochemical cross coupling for ketones and methanol is developed, providing an efficient access to &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketones. In this protocol, the biofuel methanol is readily used as a hydroxymethylating reagent to couple with ketones with hydrogen as the only by product. This sustainable reaction proceeds smoothly in an aqueous medium, giving diverse &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketones in 26%&#8211;92% yields at room temperature in the absence of exogenous oxidants.

A triflic acid&#8208;mediated iodocarbocyclization of alkene&#8208;tethered sulfonamides with iodoarenes has been developed. Electrophilic iodine species generated form iodoarenes and triflic acid successfully promote the iodocarbocyclization under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions to afford benzo&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocycles in moderate to good yields.

A triflic acid&#8208;mediated iodocarbocyclization of allylic and homoallylic sulfonamides with iodoarenes has been developed for the synthesis of benzo&#8208;fused saturated N&#8208;heterocycles. The combination of iodoarenes and triflic acid provides an efficient electrophilic iodine species for the iodocarbocyclization under ambient reaction conditions. A variety of sulfonamides derived from benzylamines, phenethylamines, and anilines were successfully transformed into the corresponding iodine&#8208;functionalized benzo&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocycles in good to high yields.

         <title>Zinc Hydride Complexes Stabilized by Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes for Hydrosilylation of Aldehydes and Ketones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neutral zinc hydride complexes supported by anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands containing a weakly coordinating borate anion (WCA&#8208;NHC) are synthesized and structurally characterized. The dimeric and monomeric zinc hydrides act as efficient catalysts for the hydrosilylation of aldehydes and ketones, highlighting solvent&#8208;dependent aggregation and reactivity.

An anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand with a weakly coordinating borate entity in the backbone (WCA&#8208;NHC) is employed in the preparation of zwitterionic zinc complexes. Among these, zinc hydride species [(WCA&#8208;IDipp)ZnH]2 and [(WCA&#8208;IDipp)ZnH(THF)2] (WCA&#8201;=&#8201;B(C6F5)3, IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) were obtained either as a dinuclear zinc complex with two bridging hydrides or as a monomeric complex with a single terminal hydride, respectively. In these zwitterionic complexes, the positive charge at zinc is compensated by the anionic carbene ligand WCA&#8208;IDipp. The overall neutral complexes display excellent solubility in organic solvents and were demonstrated as efficient catalysts in hydrosilylation reactions of aldehydes and ketones.

         <title>Bimetallic Cluster Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Rapid Photocatalytic Water Splitting to Produce Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) incorporating Ce/Ti bimetallic clusters and organic photosensitizers is fabricated. The synergistic effect between the bimetallic clusters and organic linkers facilitates charge carrier separation. This MOF is employed for photocatalytic water splitting and exhibits excellent H2 evolution reaction activity (20,778.7&#8201;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) under the visible&#8208;light irradiation.

A core challenge in photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production, as a clean method of hydrogen fuel generation, lies in simultaneously achieving efficient hydrogen production and long&#8208;term stability of catalysts. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of a novel bimetallic cluster&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) exhibiting exceptional performance for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen production. This unique MOF catalyst demonstrates a remarkably high hydrogen evolution rate of 20,778.7&#8201;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible&#8208;light irradiation, significantly surpassing many MOF photocatalysts. Crucially, the MOF exhibits outstanding stability, maintaining its high catalytic activity over multiple reaction cycles without significant degradation. The synergistic effects within the bimetallic clusters and sensitively light&#8208;responsive linkers are regarded as the key contributors to both the enhanced efficiency and remarkable durability. This work presents a highly promising and stable MOF photocatalyst for efficient solar energy harnessing towards clean hydrogen fuel generation.

         <title>P&#8208;Stereogenic Phosphines via Mn(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrophosphination of Vinyl Sulfones: A Case of Solvent&#8208;Induced Stereoinversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for synthesis of P&#8208;chiral phosphines via manganese&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrophosphination was established. The solvent like iPrOH was found to be able to tune the enantioselectivity of the product, thus providing both enantiomers of P(III)&#8208;stereogenic compounds with a single (Rc, Sp)&#8208;Clarke Mn(I) complex catalyst.

In this work, we report a novel approach for synthesizing P&#8208;chiral phosphines through Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrophosphination of vinyl sulfones. A distinctive feature of this system is its solvent&#8208;dependent stereoinversion, which enables the formation of products with opposite configurations using the same catalyst enantiomer. This phenomenon has been demonstrated across a range of vinyl sulfones and diarylphosphines, providing access to both configurations of P&#8208;stereogenic phosphines with a single catalytic system.

An efficient method for the ionic hydrosulfonylation of alkenes lacking electron&#8208;withdrawing groups has been developed. This transformation proceeds smoothly to afford benzyl sulfone products, featuring easy operation, a broad substrate scope, good atomic economy, the use of sodium sulfinates as a safe sulfone source, and water/alcohol as green solvents. Furthermore, our strategy enables the synthesis of tertiary carbon sulfone compounds.

A 1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholene&#8208;catalyzed 1,6&#8208;conjugate reduction of para&#8208;quinone methides and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;vinylcyclohex&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;one is developed.

In the past 10 years, P&#8208;hydrido&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholenes (DAP&#8208;Hs) have been demonstrated to be able to reduce carbonyls, imines, and enones. However, the 1,6&#8208;conjugate reduction transformations catalyzed by DAP&#8208;Hs have been rarely studied. Herein, we developed a DAP&#8208;catalyzed 1,6&#8208;conjugate reduction of p&#8208;QMs with DAP&#8208;Br as the precatalyst. Furthermore, the dienone could also be well tolerated in this transformation.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the latest advancements in the synthesis of alkenyl nitriles through the cyanation of alkenes, alkynes, and other starting materials, resulting in functionalized alkenyl nitrile derivatives, while also addressing the remaining challenges and future perspectives.

Alkenyl nitrile derivatives represent important structural motifs found in a variety of natural products, active pharmaceuticals, and functional materials. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in the development of efficient and selective catalytic methods for synthesizing alkenyl nitriles from alkenes, alkynes, and other precursors under relatively mild conditions with new synthetic technologies. However, a comprehensive summary of the synthesis of alkenyl nitriles has yet to be established in recent literature. This perspective highlights the latest advancements in the synthesis of alkenyl nitriles through the cyanation of alkenes, alkynes, and other starting materials, leading to functionalized alkenyl nitrile derivatives. The remaining challenges and future perspectives at the conclusion of the review is also discussed. It is hoped that this overview will inspire the development of novel approaches to access diverse alkenyl nitriles and facilitate their applications in organic chemistry and drug research.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Copper&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;(Styrylsulfonyl)amides via SO2 Incorporation Under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;(Styrylsulfonyl)amides are prepared from &#945;&#8208;bromoamides, SO2, and styrenes in a one&#8208;step photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reaction in the presence of a copper complex. Additionally, related ester analogs could be synthesized following the same procedure. The mechanism of the newly developed method is investigated and model postmodification reactions are carried out.

&#945;&#8208;(Styrylsulfonyl)amides and their related ester analogs are an important class of substances that have been widely used as precursors toward bioactive compounds. While most existing methods for the preparation of related compounds include either multiple steps or the use of precious metals, the method presented in this paper utilizes copper and visible light to produce &#945;&#8208;(styrylsulfonyl)amides and &#945;&#8208;(styrylsulfonyl)esters from &#945;&#8208;bromoamides or esters, SO2 and styrenes in moderate to high yield in a single step. The mechanism of the newly developed method is investigated and likely differs from related methods for the photocatalyzed fixation of SO2 into organic scaffolds.

         <dc:description>
This article reports a transition metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free photooxidative azolation of C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds with azoles using CBr4 under 400&#8211;405&#8201;nm irradiation and at room temperature. The amination reaction exhibits broad substrate scope and is applicable to follow&#8208;up transformation of drug molecules.

Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and radical&#8211;polar crossover (RPC) have emerged as a powerful strategy for the C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization of organic molecules. Herein, we disclose a transition metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free photooxidative azolation of C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds with azoles using CBr4. This amination performed at room temperature under 400&#8211;405&#8201;nm irradiation was operationally simple, and tolerated a variety of functional groups. Its utility in synthesis was demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of a drug molecule. CBr4 acted as a HAT agent and oxidant, undergoing photochemical homolysis to promote this cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction.

         <title>Eco&#8208;Friendly and Additive&#8208;Free Synthesis of C&#63743;P Bonds: Synergistic Catalysis by a Polyoxovanadate&#8208;Based Cu&#8211;Organic Framework Using Molecular Oxygen</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel polyoxovanadate&#8208;based copper&#8211;organic framework (Cu&#8208;POV) featuring dual&#8208;active sites was synthesized and used as a heterogeneous catalyst for the additive&#8208;free cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of N&#8208;aryl tetrahydroisoquinolines with diarylphosphine oxides to form C&#63743;P bonds, using molecular oxygen as an oxidant and green ethanol as the solvent, demonstrating excellent catalytic performance, recyclability, and feasibility for gram&#8208;scale reactions.

Development of environmentally benign methods for C&#63743;P bond formation is of great significance due to the extensive applications of organophosphorus compounds in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Herein, we report a polyoxovanadate&#8208;based Cu&#8211;organic framework, [Cu3(pty)2][V8O23]&#183;H2O (Cu&#8208;POV, pty&#8201;= &#8201;4&#8242;&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine), for catalyzing the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of N&#8208;aryl tetrahydroisoquinolines with diarylphosphine oxides to form C&#63743;P bonds using molecular oxygen (O2) as an oxidant in green ethanol medium. The outstanding efficiency of Cu&#8208;POV stems from a synergistic mechanism involving its structural CuII and VV centers: the two activate the N&#8208;aryl tetrahydroisoquinolines through single&#8208;electron transfer and subsequently react with O2 to generate the key superoxide radical species. The catalyst can be recycled at least six times without compromising performance, and applied in gram&#8208;scale reaction with a turnover number of 2025.

         <title>Photocatalytic Assembly of Structurally Diverse &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Tertiary Amines Using Benign Nitrogen Donors</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed photocatalytic arylamination and alkylamination of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes using nitriles and oximes as benign nitrogen donors instead of toxic azide reagents, providing a green and mild route to diverse &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl tertiary amines. Only N2 or CO2 are emitted as byproducts. Scalability, broad substrate tolerance and high yields highlight their practicality. The products readily convert to valuable &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl amine derivatives via simple reduction and hydrolysis reaction.

&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl amines are privileged motifs in drug design. Traditional assembly of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl amines relies on harsh conditions and toxic reagents, prompting the demand for milder, atom&#8208;economical methods. While alkene carboamination offers a modular access to diverse amines, the aminative difunctionalization of trifluoromethyl alkenes pose challenges due to facile defluorination. Herein, we report two visible light&#8208;induced protocols for the aminative difunctionalization of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes using benign nitrogen sources&#8212;nitriles and oximes&#8212;instead of prior toxic azides. A photoredox approach leads to the arylamination of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes and radical oxidation, leveraging nitriles to capture benzyl carbocations, while a complementary alkylamination strategy exploits the decarboxylative decomposion of alkyl oxime esters and installs C&#8208; and N&#8208;radicals on the double bond with regiospecificity. These two protocols constitute flexible access to diverse &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl tertiary amines under sustainable conditions. Only N2 or CO2 are emitted as byproducts. Scalability, broad substrate tolerance, and high yields highlight the practicality of this methodology.

         <title>The Novel Strategies for the Construction of Homoallylic Alcohols via Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically summarizes recent advances in the synthesis of valuable homoallylic alcohols via photoredox catalysis. We categorize strategies by catalytic method, analyzing substrate scope, mechanisms, and applications in constructing complex targets. The perspective also highlights future challenges and opportunities in this emerging field, underscoring its potential for mild, efficient, and sustainable synthesis. 

The importance of homoallylic alcohols were reflected in the development of remarkable synthetic strategies and the discovery of novel reactivities that enable access to complex molecular targets. Compared to the traditional pathway, the booming single&#8208;electron transfer pathway has demonstrated remarkable potential for the construction of valuable and otherwise difficult to synthesized homoallylic alcohols. Especially, photoredox catalysis has emerged as a alternative and prospective protocol for the synthesis of homoallylic alcohol via radical pathway owing to mild reaction conditions, lower activation energy, eco&#8208;friendly, and excellent compatibility. Thus, this review systematically summarizes the recent important advances in the synthesis of homoallylic alcohols through photoredox catalysis. It categorizes these advancements according to the distinct catalytic methods, providing a concise analysis of substrate scopes, limitations, and mechanistic explores, as well as their applications in the construction of various functionalized molecules, natural products, pharmaceuticals, or bioactive molecules. Furthermore, key challenges and emerging opportunities are highlighted to guide the development of novel strategies and expand their practical applications.

Sc(OTf)3 and Ambient Air Promote Radical&#8208;Based Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling Reactions: Reactivity of &#945;&#8208;Enaminone toward Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A site&#8208;selective Csp2&#8208;Csp3 cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction is developed for a&#8208;enaminone and donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) in the presence of air and Sc(OTf)3 (30 mol%) through radical pathway, affording tetrahydroquinolinones in good yields with large substrate scope. The utilization of less amount of Sc(OTf)3 (3 mol%) leads to a ring&#8208;opening reaction with good yields and large substrate scope.

A new cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction for tetrahydroquinolinones formation is achieved using &#945;&#8208;enaminones and donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes. Traditional cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions require the presence of a redox&#8208;active metal, and an additional oxidant. This work introduces a new type of catalytic system, which only involves a redox&#8208;inactive rare earth metal and ambient air serving as the oxidant. Mechanistic investigation has revealed a radical pathway for the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative Csp2&#8208;Csp3 coupling reaction and Sc(OTf)3 combined with 3O2 are found to facilitate the critical SET process. When 3 mol% of Sc(OTf)3 is used, &#945;&#8208;enaminone served as nitrogen nucleophile to react with the donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes, resulting in new ring&#8208;opening products. Increasing the catalyst loading to 30 mol%, tetrahydroquinolinones are formed via cross&#8208;dehydrogenative Csp2&#8208;Csp3 coupling reaction. Both reactions give good to excellent yields with broad substrate scopes. Enantiospecific formation of tetrahydroquinolinones is also investigated with high retention of enantiomeric purity (up to 97% ee). The discovery that Sc(OTf)3 and air can promote the formation of &#945;&#8208;enaminone radical and malonic ester radical is unprecedented and is expected to initiate their broad applications in developing novel organic transformations.

The discovery that Sc(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and air can promote the formation of &#945;-enaminone radical and malonic ester radical is unprecedented and is expected to initiate their broad applications in developing novel organic transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Trifluoromethylchlorosulfonylation of Alkenes via Copper&#8208;Mediated SO2Cl Radical Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports an electrosynthetic method for vicinal trifluoromethylchlorosulfonylation of alkenes using [Cu(MeCN)4]PF6 and triethylamine, without elaborate ligands. The reaction efficiently adds CF3 and SO2Cl across diverse unactivated alkenes with broad functional group tolerance. The resulting sulfonyl chlorides are versatile intermediates, and mechanistic studies support a Cu&#8208;mediated, electrochemically driven SO2Cl radical transfer pathway.

This article describes an electrosynthetic method for vicinal trifluoromethylchlorosulfonylation of alkenes using the readily available copper salt [Cu(MeCN)4]PF6 and triethylamine, without the need for elaborate ligands. This protocol enables efficient and selective addition of CF3 and SO2Cl groups across a wide range of unactivated alkenes with broad functional group tolerance, including pyrrole, furan, thiophene, thioethyl, and silyl substituents. The sulfonyl chloride products can be readily transformed into sulfonamides, sulfonates, sulfonyl fluorides, and thiosulfonates. Mechanistic studies provide evidence in support of an electrochemically driven, Cu&#8208;mediated SO2Cl radical transfer mechanism.

         <title>Merging Single&#8208;Electron Transfer and Strecker Degradation to Access Densely Substituted Pyridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work represents the first example of a [4 + 2] annulation of methyl ketoxime acetates to afford polysubstituted pyridine derivatives. This strategy activates all three substrates, generating imine anions and two different aldehydes through the merging of single electron transfer and Strecker degradation. Mechanism studies reveal that the key &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketimine intermediates, generated in situ from ketoxime acetates and phenylglycine, prevent the homo&#8208; and cross&#8208;merization of two distinct &#945;&#8208;amino acids. Additionally, these intermediates are indispensable for shifting the reaction pathway from [3 + 3] to [4 + 2] annulation of ketoxime acetates.

An I2&#8208;mediated three&#8208;component protocol of readily available ketoxime acetates and two structurally distinct &#945;&#8208;amino acids has been developed, merging single&#8208;electron transfer and Strecker degradation to enable the concise synthesis of densely substituted pyridines. The reaction proceeds via an unprecedented [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] annulation, wherein phenylalanines intercept the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines generated in&#8201;situ from ketoxime acetates and phenylglycines. This process features the simultaneous activation of three substrates, and mild reaction conditions, good functional&#8208;group tolerance.

         <dc:description>The hitherto few explored &#945;&#8208;halomethyl amidine motif has been assembled through the addition of a lithiated (di)&#8208;halomethane (i.e. carbenoid) to easily accessible N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl substituted carbodiimides. Despite the inherent low electrophilicity of these heterocumulenes &#8211; as quantitatively determined in Mayr&#8217;s previous studies &#8211; their sp&#8208;hybridized carbon atom acts as a competent site of attack for these tamed nucleophiles. The overall high&#8208;yielding transformation featuring a genuine chemoselective profile &#8211; as documented by employing variously functionalized materials &#8211; is adaptable to the addition of dihalogenated carbenoids. Reaction products could be advantageously employed in nucleophilic substitution sequences, as well as, in further functionalization of the nitrogen atoms due to the constitutive heteroallyl&#8208;type skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>eAmidation: An Electrochemical Amidation of Aldehydes via the Oxidation of N&#8208;Aryl Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the use of electrochemistry has emerged as a powerful yet sustainable means of enabling key transformations. Amidation is one of the most frequently executed transformations in synthetic chemistry, and using an electrochemical approach, the current study has demonstrated the synthesis of amides from aldehydes and amines. Mechanistic work indicates that the reaction proceeds via the oxidation of an intermediate hydrazone to generate an acyl diazene as the acylating species. The protocol developed has enabled the synthesis of a broad range of amides, including access to pharmaceutically relevant products, directly from aldehydes without recourse for hazardous chemical oxidants and activating agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand controlled regio&#8208;divergent [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of alkynes by merging electrochemistry and nickel catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions between three alkynes, a diyne and an alkyne, or a triyne offer a straightforward and typical protocol toward all kinds of polysubstituted benzens. Herein, the synthesis of polysubstituted aromatics through electrochemical nickel catalyzed cyclotrimerization of alkynes is developed. The regio&#8208;divergent cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes was achieved by judicious choice of ligands. And tributylphosphine, sterically hindered bipyridine or &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands delivered 1,2,4&#8208; and 1,3,5&#8208;substituted aromatics with high regioselectivities respectively. Besides, the semi&#8208;intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between	diynes and alkynes are also amenable under this catalytic system. This approach operates without metal reductant, exhibits wide functional groups tolerance, ease of scalability and furnishes 75 examples with moderate to good yields, including some biorelevant compounds. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculation revealed the catalytic pathways of 1,3,5&#8208; and 1,2,4&#8208;cyclotrimerizations, and the origin of the ligand controlled regioselectivity.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;carboalkoxy&#8208;3&#8208;substituted&#8208;cyclohexenones are powerful building blocks for the synthesis of a variety of bioactive target molecules. Their preparations requires multi&#8208;steps sequence involving the use of stoichiometric quantities of various reagents, while the catalytic approaches are limitited to trisubstituted cyclohexenones. We describe here an efficient catalytic approach based on gold(I)&#8208;catalysis starting from unsymmetrical diynyl mono&#8208;ester or symmetrical diynyl di&#8208;ester substrates. The carbon chain linking the two alkyne functions can bear two or one substituent, or even be unsubstituted. Regardless of the nature of the substrates and independently of its substitution, the cyclohexenone derivatives are cleanly produced.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(II) complex dispersed in imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid: Recyclable catalyst system for regioselective and chemoselective hydrobromination and hydrochlorination of alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a recyclable catalyst system combining Cu(II)O and 4,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline in a 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid for the hydrohalogenation of alkynes. The reaction efficiently yields alkenyl bromides and chlorides with good functional group tolerance and regioselectivity across a range of functionalized alkynes. Remarkably, the reaction exhibits unprecedented chemoselectivity for alkyne over alkenes in polyenynes and enables late&#8208;stage modifications to rapidly synthesize brominated polyenes. The catalyst system could be recycled for up to six runs without significant reduction of the reaction yield.</dc:description>

         <title>SuFEx reactions when shaken not stirred
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Click reactions display many of the goals desired for more sustainable chemical
conversions.  Yet, the solvent used is an often overlooked aspect in determining the
environmental impact of reactions. In the current paper we develop the first
mechanochemical method for the efficient and solvent&#8208;free SuFEx reaction of sulfonyl
fluorides with a wide range of phenols.  After outlining the optimization process, which
yields an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use and robust method, we provide indications of the very wide
scope of this approach, and demonstrate this potential via the application to a range of
natural phenols that also display other functionalities, and several gram&#8208;scale
syntheses.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A convenient and efficient metal&#8208;free protocol has been reported for formylation of various amines with carbon dioxide. This reaction could proceed under ambient conditions and show a broad substrate scope, encompassing primary amines, secondary amines, chiral amino acid esters and bioactive molecules. Furthermore, this method offers several advantages, including the preservation of substrate chirality, ease of separation and purification and the suitability of formic acid and formate salts as reactants in this reaction.</dc:description>
