      <title>A Convoluted Polyvinylpyridine&#8208;Palladium Catalyst for Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling and C&#8208;H Arylation</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. The development of highly active and reusable supported catalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling and catalytic C&#8208;H arylation is important for fundamental and applied chemistry, with these reactions being used to produce medical compounds and functional materials. Herein, we found that a mesoporous composite made of a linear poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) and tetrachloropalladate acted as a dual&#8208;mode catalyst for a variety of cross&#8208;coupling reactions, with both Pd nanoparticles and a Pd complex catalyst being observed under different conditions. The polyvinylpyridine&#8208;palladium composite 1 was readily prepared via the molecular convolution of poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) and sodium tetrachloropalladate to provide a hardly soluble polymer&#8208;metal composite. The Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling and the C&#8208;H arylation of aryl chlorides and bromides with arylboronic acids, thiophenes, furans, benzene, and anisole proceeded in the presence of 0.004 mol% (40 mol ppm) to 1 mol% Pd of 1 to afford the corresponding coupling products in high yields.
Furthermore, the catalyst was reused without an appreciable loss of activity. Pharmaceutical compounds and functional materials were synthesized via the coupling reactions. N2 gas adsorption/desorption analysis indicated that the catalyst had a mesoporous nature, which played a crucial role in the catalysis. In the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings, in situ generated palladium nanoparticles in the polymer matrix were catalytically active, while a polymeric Pd(II) complex was crucial in the C&#8208;H arylations. These catalytic species were investigated via XAFS, XPS, far&#8208;infrared absorption, and Raman spectroscopies, as well as DFT calculations.</dc:description>

N2 gas adsorption/desorption analysis indicated that the catalyst had a mesoporous nature, which played a crucial role in the catalysis. In the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings, in situ generated palladium nanoparticles in the polymer matrix were catalytically active, while a polymeric Pd(II) complex was crucial in the C&#8208;H arylations. These catalytic species were investigated via XAFS, XPS, far&#8208;infrared absorption, and Raman spectroscopies, as well as DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Enantioselective organocatalytic synthesis of &#948;&#8208;lactone&#8208;fused 4&#8208;chromanones</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. An organocatalytic enantioselective synthesis of &#948;&#8208;lactone&#8208;fused 4&#8208;chromanones was demonstrated using 1&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyaryl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;butanedione and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes in the presence of J&#248;rgensen&#8208;Hayashi catalyst. The reaction proceeded through a Michael addition/cycloketalization/hemiacetalization sequence, and the resulting hemiacetals were oxidized into the corresponding lactone derivatives in a one&#8208;pot manner. The desired fused O,O&#8208;ketal tricyclic lactone motifs containing three contiguous chiral centres were obtained in excellent chemical yields (up to 97%) and with high stereoselectivities (&gt;20:1 dr and up to 95% ee).

      <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Nitrogen Heterocycles Using Arenediazonium Salts as Nitrogen Sources</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrogen heterocycles are important structural subunits that occur widely in bioactive natural products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, dyes, cosmetics, and functional materials. Considering the importance of these useful compounds in modern science, the synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycles and their derivatives has always been a hot topic in organic synthesis. Recently, arenediazonium salts which can be easily prepared from inexpensive and abundantly available anilines, have been used as versatile nitrogen sources in the field of nitrogen heterocycles synthetic chemistry due to their ready availability, rich reactivity, and diverse transformations. The aim of the present review is to summarize the recent advances in the synthesis of nitrogen heterocycles using arenediazonium salts as nitrogen sources in the past ten years. Hopefully, it can provide practical guidance for the readers who are interested in utilizing arenediazonium salts as building blocks in organic synthesis. For simplicity and clarity, the organization of this review is based on the number of N atom in the ring of nitrogen heterocycles.</dc:description>

      <title>Fluorination and Fluoroalkylation Reactions Mediated by Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>
      <dc:description>This review summarizes the progress in the fluorination and fluoroalkylation of electron&#8208;rich systems with diverse fluorine (F) and fluoroalkyl (Rfn) reagents employing hypervalent iodine compounds as initiators in the last few decades. Because of the strong electrophilicity, high oxidizing properties, low toxicity, air and moisture stability, ready availability, ease of handling, and mild reaction conditions, the hypervalent iodine reagents have been widely utilized in modern organic chemistry. In particular, the use of hypervalent iodine reagents to initiate the C&#8208;F and C&#8208;Rfn (Rfn = CF2H, CF3, perfluoroalkyl, OCH2CF3, SCF3, SeCF3 and etc) bond formation has been increasingly developed. In these reactions, hypervalent iodine compounds behave as powerful oxidants or electrophiles and activate the fluorination/fluoroalkylation reagents, the transition&#8208;metal catalysts, or the substrates to in situ form electrophilic or radical intermediates, which subsequently participate in fluorination, difluoromethylation, trifluoromethylation, perfluoroalkylation, trifluoroethoxylation, fluoroalkylthiolation, trifluoromethylselenolation and others under mild conditions. Although great achievements have been made in this area, they are just the initial phase and still require a wide scope for improvement. It is anticipated that this review will draw much attention from the organic chemistry community and inspire more contributions in the development of new hypervalent&#8208;iodine&#8208;mediated fluorination and fluoroalkylation reactions.</dc:description>

      <title>A Strategy for Accessing Aldehydes via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;O/C&#8208;N Bond Cleavage in the Presence of Hydrosilanes</title>
      <dc:description>We report the catalytic reduction of both active esters and amides by selective C(acyl)&#8211;X (X = O, N) cleavage to access aldehyde functionality via a palladium&#8208;catalyzed strategy. Reactions are promoted by hydrosilanes as reducing reagents with good to excellent yields and with excellent chemoselectivity for C(acyl)&#8211;N and C(acyl)&#8211;O bond cleavage. Carboxylic acid C(acyl)&#8211;O bonds are activated by 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;4,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (CDMT) to form triazine ester intermediates, which further react with hydrosilanes to yield aldehydes in one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step procedures. We demonstrate that C(acyl)&#8211;O cleavage/formylation offers higher yields and broader substrate scopes compared with C(acyl)&#8211;N cleavage under the same reaction conditions.</dc:description>

Carboxylic acid C(acyl)&#8211;O bonds are activated by 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;4,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (CDMT) to form triazine ester intermediates, which further react with hydrosilanes to yield aldehydes in one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step procedures. We demonstrate that C(acyl)&#8211;O cleavage/formylation offers higher yields and broader substrate scopes compared with C(acyl)&#8211;N cleavage under the same reaction conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>Oxidative coupling methodology is widely applied for the formation of carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds. This review focuses on methods for oxidative sulfonylation of multiple bonds involving sulfonyl hydrazides, sulfinic acids and their salts as S&#8208;reagents. Under oxidative conditions, they generate sulfonyl radicals, trapped by multiple carbon&#8208;carbon bonds resulting in a variety of SO2&#8208;containing products: mainly, vinyl and alkynyl sulfones, hydroxy&#8208;, keto, and halo&#8208;substituted sulfones, sulfonylated derivatives of carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. This exhaustive review summarizes 321 references from 1996 to 2020 with the specialization of the studies of the last five years, and is divided into the chapters according to the classes of compounds being sulfonylated.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>We have developed simple and efficient one&#8208;step protocols for the preparation of a large selection of &#945;&#8208;aminocyclopropyl ketones or benzo[d]imidazoles, by reacting 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxycyclobutanones with aryl amines or o&#8208;phenylenediamines, respectively. In most case the reactions proceed at room temperature and are catalyst&#8208;free.

The front cover picture provided by L&#237;gia Martins, PauIa Robalo and coworkers, created by Diogo Batuca/Est&#250;dio Jo&#227;o Campos, illustrates an eco&#8208;friendly approach for the one&#8208;pot enzymatic synthesis of 4&#8208;arylamino&#8208;1,2&#8208;naphthoquinones. CotA&#8208;laccase, in the presence of 4&#8208;substituted arylamines, preferentially oxidises 4&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxynaphthalene&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonic acid to a 1,2&#8208;naphthoquinone intermediate, which reacts with the arylamines. The distinct specificity of laccase towards oxidisable amines allows the design of new frameworks, broadening the competence of laccases as biocatalysts and opening new perspectives for their use in organic synthesis.

      <dc:description>Here we report a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed rearrangement for a special type of alkynylcyclopropanes, such as (6&#8208;ethynylbicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;6&#8208;yl)silanes. These enynes evolved through an isomerization reaction towards the formation of isomeric alkynylcyclopropanes instead of the expected alkynylcyclohexadienes. A computational study on the reaction mechanism revealed the participation of a polycyclic gold(I) carbene complex as intermediate instead of a &#963;&#8208;allylic gold cation which is in agreement with the expected influence in the energy of those intermediates due to the presence of the silyl group. Finally, this gold(I) carbene intermediate could be experimentally intercepted through intramolecular cyclopropanations.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Abstract. A colloidal catalyst was developed by complexation of copper chloride in polydiacetylene micelles. The latter were designed to accommodate and stabilize copper salts, by providing a suitable liganded environment. Micelles were valorized as nanoreactors for the promotion of the Huisgen cycloaddition reaction in water thanks to their central hydrophobic core which permitted not only aqueous dispersion, but also concentration of the reagents at the vicinity of the catalyst. The system was found to be active on a variety of substrates and efficiently operated under sustainable conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Generalized Chemoselective Transfer Hydrogenation/ hydrodeuteration</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. A generalized, simple and efficient transfer hydrogenation of unsaturated bonds has been developed using HBPin and various proton reagents as hydrogen sources. The substrates, including alkenes, alkynes, aromatic heterocycles, aldehydes, ketones, imines, azo, nitro, epoxy and nitrile compounds, are all applied to this catalytic system. Various groups, which cannot survive under the Pd/C/H2 combination, are tolerated. The activity of the reactants was studied and the trends are as follows: styrene&gt; diphenylmethanimine&gt; benzaldehyde&gt; azobenzene&gt; nitrobenzene&gt; quinoline&gt; acetophenone&gt; benzonitrile.	Substrates bearing two or more different unsaturated bonds were also investigated and transfer hydrogenation occurred with excellent chemoselectivity. Nano&#8208;palladium catalyst in situ generated from Pd(OAc)2 and HBPin extremely improved the TH efficiency. Furthermore, chemoselective anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrodeuteration of terminal aromatic olefins was achieved using D2O and HBPin via in situ HD generation and discrimination.</dc:description>

      <title>NHC&#8208;Ni(0) catalyzed diastereodivergent hydroacylative enyne cyclization: synthesis of heterocycles bearing &#947;&#8208;enone</title>
      <dc:description>NHC&#8208;Nickel(0) catalyzed 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;diastereodivergent hydroacylative heteroenyne cyclization with aldehydes was achieved (Syn&#8208;:Anti&#8208;, switchable from up to 1:99 to 98:2). Both sets of heterocyclic diastereomers are accessible via this route, with a high &#947;&#8208;:&#945;&#8208;enone structure ratio. Preliminary DFT investigations indicated that the manipulation of the N&#8208;substituent exerts a direct influence on the diastereoselectivity of NHC&#8208;nickelacyclopentene formation. The energy differences associated with the endocyclic bond angle (C&#8208;Z&#8208;C) changes noted in the calculations, might possibly account for the broad scope and high diastereodivergent selectivity observed.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Progress on Reductive Coupling of Nitroarenes by Using Organosilanes as Convenient Reductants</title>
      <dc:description>Nitroarenes are stable, low&#8208;cost, and readily available starting materials. The directly utilize nitroarenes in synthetically valuable C&#8211;N bond formation is of great significance, because the pre&#8208;reduction step to corresponding amines can be avoided. Previously, phosphines and carbon monoxide (CO) are the most widely used reductants in the reductive cyclization or/and carbonylation of nitroarenes. Currently, much attention has been attracted to organosilanes as new potential reducing agents, not only because they are inexpensive, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, and mild reagents, but also various novel reaction models of nitroarenes have been explored. In this review, we mainly summarize the recent progress on the reductive coupling of nitroarenes by using organosilanes as the end reductants. We hope that a deep understanding of the reaction model and underlying working mechanism can provide a timely guideline for researchers who are interested in this fantastic area, leading to further exploration of practical and efficient reductive coupling of nitroarenes for C&#8208;N bond formation and N&#8208;heterocycle synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Heteroarene&#8208;Fused Cyclopentadienes and Related Compounds Suitable for Metallocene Preparation</title>
      <dc:description>Metallocene catalysis is widely used in transformations of unsaturated organic compounds, including the bulk industrial synthesis of polyolefins. Over the last few decades, the electronic and structural properties of their &#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;coordinated ligands have been modified by introducing electron&#8208;donating, electron&#8208;withdrawing, and sterically hindered substituents to obtain desirable catalytic properties for the metallocenes. An efficient way to design &#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;coordinated ligands is to exploit the annelation of heterocyclic fragments with a cyclopentadiene ring. In the present review, we summarize, systematize, and analyze synthetic approaches to heterocycle&#8208;fused cyclopentadienes suitable for metallocene catalyst preparation.
