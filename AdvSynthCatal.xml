      <title>Recent Advances in Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Chemical and Enzymatic Carbene&#8208;Transfer Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>The use of diazo compounds in the transition metal catalyzed coupling reaction to form C&#8208;C and C&#8208;X (X=O, S, N, Si, P etc.) bonds have been a well&#8208;established approach in organic synthesis. In this context, various transition metals such as Pd, Cu, Rh, Ni, Co, Fe, Ir etc. have been proved useful to generate metal&#8208;carbene intermediate which subsequently undergoes carbene transfer or insertion to form C&#8208;C, C&#8208;Si or C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. However, the use of most abundant, cheaper and environmentally benign metal such as iron to catalyze carbene transfer reaction have attracted a great attention in the last few years. Iron is the second most abundant transition&#8208;metal in nature and also an integral part of various biological systems which made it highly valuable to use as a catalyst in organic chemistry. This review is summarizing the efforts made after 2013 in the area of iron&#8208;catalyzed chemical and enzymatic carbene transfer reactions using diazo compounds as carbene precursor.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This review describes recent advances in the synthesis of anthranilamide (aam)/1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene (dan)&#8208;substituted organoboron compounds with diminished boron&#8208;Lewis acidity via catalytic B(aam)&#8208; and B(dan)&#8208;installing borylation reactions, which have attracted growing attention especially in the last five years owing to their unique reactivity, regioselectivity, and the outstanding stability toward air and moisture of organoboron compounds obtained therefrom.

      <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Amino Carboxylic&#8208;Phosphonic Acid Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral amino acids featuring a phosphonate pendant arm are an important type of biologically active scaffolds. Here in this review, we comprehensively summarize the modern synthetic methods towards asymmetric construction of chiral amino carboxylicphosphonic acid derivatives. The main streams of such interesting compounds include phosphono&#8208;containing &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;amino acid derivatives, amino acid fluorophosphonate derivatives, amino acid cyclopropanylphosphonate derivatives, and bisphosphono&#8208;amino acid derivatives. Chiral resolution protocols, chiral auxiliary&#8208;directed syntheses, and valorization of the pool of abundant chiral amino acid resources remain contemporary concerns, meanwhile catalytic enantioselective synthesis has also emerged as a potent strategy as demonstrated by the latest advances.</dc:description>

The main streams of such interesting compounds include phosphono&#8208;containing &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;amino acid derivatives, amino acid fluorophosphonate derivatives, amino acid cyclopropanylphosphonate derivatives, and bisphosphono&#8208;amino acid derivatives. Chiral resolution protocols, chiral auxiliary&#8208;directed syntheses, and valorization of the pool of abundant chiral amino acid resources remain contemporary concerns, meanwhile catalytic enantioselective synthesis has also emerged as a potent strategy as demonstrated by the latest advances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Copper&#8208;catalyzed Reaction of Anthranils with Methyl Ketones: Site&#8208;Selective C5&#8208;Dicarbonylation of Anthranils</title>
      <dc:description>A copper&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective C5&#8208;dicarbonylation reaction of anthranils has been developed for synthesis of 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds using methyl ketone as a commercially available carbonylation reagent.

      <title>Recent Development of Recoverable MacMillan Catalysts for Asymmetric Organic Transformations</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral imidazolidinone as an organocatalyst was developed by MacMillan and co&#8208;workers in 2000 and they evaluated this organocatalyst originally in the enantioselective Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. Later, this catalyst was used in a number of other asymmetric organic transformations. Chiral organocatalysts are expensive, therefore their recoverability and reusability are highly desirable to make the organic transformation economically viable for industrial application. Hence, the chiral imidazolidinone was modified and attached to different supports for its recoverability and reusability. A number of recoverable imidazolidinones have been reported in asymmetric Diels&#8208;Alder reactions.

      <title>Catalytic Photoredox Allylation of Aldehydes Promoted by a Cobalt Complex</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract. The preparation of homoallylic alcohols by addition organometallic allyl compounds to carbonyls is an important strategy in organic chemistry. Allylating organometallic cobalt species can be generated employing stoichiometric quantities of Zn acting as reductant.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Abstract. The preparation of homoallylic alcohols by addition organometallic allyl compounds to carbonyls is an important strategy in organic chemistry. Allylating organometallic cobalt species can be generated employing stoichiometric quantities of Zn acting as reductant. To avoid the employment of stoichiometric amount of Zn, we have developed an allylation reaction of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes promoted by photoredox catalysis in the presence of a cobalt complex, and we present herein a full account of our research. In the presence of the abundant CoBr2 (10 mol%), 4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl (dtbbpy, 10 mol%), allyl acetate (3 equiv),	[Ir(dtbbpy)(ppy)2]PF6 (ppy = 2&#8208;phenylpyridine, 2 mol%), and N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (4 equiv), an allylation of aldehydes is taking place, in moderate to good yields. Substrates scope, limitations, and photophysical investigations of this new process are reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Selective Construction of C&#8211;C and C=C Bonds by Manganese Catalyzed Coupling of Alcohols with Phosphorus Ylides</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report the manganese catalyzed coupling of alcohols with phosphorus ylides. The selectivity in the coupling of primary alcohols with phosphorus ylides to form carbon&#8211;carbon single (C&#8211;C) and carbon&#8211;carbon double (C=C) bonds can be controlled by the ligands. In the conversion of more challenging secondary alcohols with phosphorus ylides the selectivity towards the formation of C&#8211;C vs. C=C bonds can be controlled by the reaction conditions, namely the amount of base. The scope and limitations of the coupling reactions were thoroughly evaluated by the conversion of 21 alcohols and 15 ylides. Notably, compared to existing methods, which are based on precious metal complexes as catalysts, the present catalytic system is based on earth abundant manganese catalysts.The reaction can also be performed in a sequential one&#8208;pot reaction generating the phosphorus ylide in situ followed manganese catalyzed C&#8211;C and C=C bond formation. Mechanistic studies suggest that the C&#8211;C bond was generated via a borrowing hydrogen pathway and the C=C bond formation followed an acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling pathway.</dc:description>

      <title>Site&#8208;Selective Pd&#8208;Catalysed Fujiwara&#8208;Moritani type Reaction of N,S&#8208;Heterocyclic Systems with Olefins</title>
      <dc:description>Dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;thiazine skeletons bearing olefin fragment at their &#945;&#8208;position were prepared through a robust Pd(OAc)2&#8211;catalysed Fujiwara&#8208;Moritani type reaction via C&#8211;H alkenylation with olefins. This approach is selective, generalizable to a wide range of olefins and requires only 1 eq. of Ag2CO3 without the need of co&#8208;oxidant. The C&#8211;H bond activation proved to be strongly dependent on the olefin&#8217;s substitution while unfused dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;thiazines seemed to be affected by the oxidation state of the sulfur atom. The utility of olefins obtained was demonstrated by their implication in the dipolar cycloaddition reaction with a non&#8208;stabilized azomethine ylide.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;thiazine skeletons bearing olefin fragment at their &#945;&#8208;position were prepared through a robust Pd(OAc)2&#8211;catalysed Fujiwara&#8208;Moritani type reaction via C&#8211;H alkenylation with olefins. This approach is selective, generalizable to a wide range of olefins and requires only 1 eq. of Ag2CO3 without the need of co&#8208;oxidant. The C&#8211;H bond activation proved to be strongly dependent on the olefin&#8217;s substitution while unfused dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;thiazines seemed to be affected by the oxidation state of the sulfur atom. The utility of olefins obtained was demonstrated by their implication in the dipolar cycloaddition reaction with a non&#8208;stabilized azomethine ylide.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>C2&#8208;Functionalization of Pyridines/Quinolines by N&#8208;Oxide Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
There is a famous sentence in Tao Te Ching: &#8220;The Tao produced one. One produced two. Two produced three. Three produced all things.&#8221; In this front cover picture, Tai Chi stands for Tao, and &#8220;N&#8221; and &#8220;O&#8221; in the two circles represent N&#8208;oxides of this paper. Thunder and lightning stimulate Tai Chi to produce everything, which is represented by the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Therefore, this picture indicates that pyridine N&#8208;oxides can produce numerous nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds under the action of activating reagent. Details can be found in the Review by Dong Wang and co&#8208;workers (L. D&#233;saubry, G. Li, M. Huang, S. Zheng), Adv. Synth. Catal. 2021, 363, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202000910).

      <title>Utilizing Alcohols for Cross&#8208;Coupling with Alkenyl Bromides</title>
      <dc:description>
The inside cover picture, designed by Takuya Suga, illustrates the merger of titanium&#8208;mediated homolytic C&#8211;OH bond cleavage and nickel catalysis that realizes a cross&#8208;coupling reaction between benzyl alcohols and alkenyl bromides. The direct application of alcohols to cross&#8208;coupling may set us free from tedious preparations of halides and homolysis&#8208;active esters. Manganese powder was used to reduce titanium(IV) and nickel(II) to their active low&#8208;valent forms that can cleave C&#8211;OH and C&#8211;Br bonds, respectively. More information can be found in the Communication by Suga, Takahashi, and Ukaii. (T. Suga, Y. Takahashi, Y. Ukaji, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2020, 362, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202000945).
