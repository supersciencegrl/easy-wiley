         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Vicinal Amino Alcohol Derivatives via Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Ring Opening of Aziridines with Alcohols and Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Under the catalysis of a Cu(I) or Ag(I) salt with a chiral diphosphine ligand, the enantioselective nucleophilic ring opening of racemic 2&#8208;styrenylaziridines via kinetic resolution or dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) and of meso aziridines via desymmetrization with alcohols was realized. The reaction provided a range of chiral vicinal amino ether derivatives in 47%&#8208;98% yields and with 50%&#8211;98% ee. The reaction could be extended to aliphatic carboxylic acids as nucleophiles. The synthetic utility was demonstrated in a four&#8208;step formal synthesis of a diastereomer of the antirythmetic agent vernakalant.

         <title>Synthetic Route to Benzostannoles via Al&#8722;Li&#8208;dimetal Intermediate and Their Application to Dibenzofulvene Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Benzostannoles were synthesized from commercially available and easily accessible substrates. The ring construction proceeds via an Al&#8722;Li&#8208;dimetal intermediate generated in&#8197;situ from 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;(silylethynyl)benzenes. This methodology provided various 2&#8208;silylbenzostannoles in 32% to 97% yields. The benzostannoles obtained were converted into dibenzofulvenes by treatment with 1,2&#8208;dibromobenzenes in the presence of a Pd catalyst. This transformation yielded various types of symmetrical and unsymmetrical dibenzofulvenes, with combination of the benzostannoles and 1,2&#8208;dibromobenzenes.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of Polysubstituted Carbazoles from Indoles and Simple 1,4&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Polysubstituted carbazoles were efficiently synthesized through direct benzannulation reaction between 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds and indoles with catalytic amount of inexpensive zirconium(IV) chloride. This transformation proved to be regioselective and furnishes 1,4&#8208;disubstituted and 1,2,4&#8208;trisubstituted carbazoles with yields ranging from 26% to 91% and broad substrate scope. Moreover, this protocol benefits from using readily accessible starting materials without the need of their pre&#8208;functionalization. The synthetic utility of the products was exemplified by functionalization of an iodocarbazole by means of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions and by the synthesis of a 3&#8208;deaza&#8208;derivative of the natural product canthin&#8208;6&#8208;one.

         <title>Photoinduced C&#8722;O Bond Formation through C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage of Alcohols by Suppressing Alcohol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we present a photoinduced deconstructive alkoxyamination of alkyl alcohols catalyzed by iron salts. This transformation involves the initiation of alkoxy radicals through chlorine radical&#8208;induced alkoxy radical formation, followed by &#946;&#8208;scission and trapping of the resulting carbon radicals with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl (TEMPO). This reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope (40 examples), including primary and secondary alcohols that are prone to oxidation by the combination of TEMPO and iron. Mechanistic investigations have revealed that enhanced coordination of the chloride ion with the iron center inhibits the OH oxidation process, thereby enabling the tolerance of primary and secondary alcohols.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Amino Esterification of Cyclic Ketones to Access Distal Amino Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
This study developed a method of synthesizing distal amino acid derivatives by the ring&#8208;opening reaction of cyclic ketones, following the amino esterification functionalization of both terminals. To achieve this goal, we performed the ring&#8208;opening reaction of cyclic ketones with an aminating reagent and alcohol under metal&#8208; and photocatalysis&#8208;free conditions in a single step. The method directly afforded distal amino acid derivatives bearing C4&#8722;C6, C8, and C12 carbon main chains, such as &#947;, &#948;, and &#1013;&#8208;amino esters. The obtained amino esters were simply transformed into amino acids by hydrolysis.

Abstract
An I2&#8208;promoted [3+2] cyclization reaction between thiocarbamates with enaminones has been developed for the synthesis of thiazol&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;one derivatives. This protocol involves C&#8722;S and C&#8722;N bond formation and exhibits good functional group tolerance. The reaction proceeded well at room temperature and provided up to 98% yield of the desired products.

         <dc:description>An intermolecular addition reaction involving an unconventional combination of a diarylmethyl anion and an electrophile, which is mediated by the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis, was developed. Diarylmethyl anions having a benzofuran moiety were generated through the rearrangement with the aid of a catalytic amount of phosphazene base P2&#8208;tBu. The resulting carbanion intermediates were trapped by various electrophiles, such as &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, aryl aldehydes, &#945;&#8208;ketoesters, and N&#8208;Boc imines, providing the corresponding diarylalkane derivatives in good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Arylsilanes via Barbier&#8208;Type Reaction between Aryl Halides and Chlorosilanes with Magnesium</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The reaction of chlorosilanes with organometallic reagents is an old and well&#8208;developed approach to organosilicon compounds, however, its application was limited due to the sensitivity of organometallic reagents to air, water. Here we display a mechanochemical access to arylsilanes via Barbier&#8208;type reaction of chlorosilanes with aryl halide with magnesium. By treatment of the two halides with Mg powder under electromagnetic milling, a series of arylsilanes are obtained within 15 minutes. Taking the advantages of the electromagnetic milling, this protocol features transition&#8208;metal free, good functional group tolerance, air stable and mild conditions.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfonaminoformyloxylation of Alkenes with N&#8208;Aminopyridinium Salts and DMF</title>

Abstract
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component sulfonaminoformyloxylation reaction between alkenes, N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts and DMF has been developed, which avoids the usage of erosive formic acid as the formyloxylation reagent. Besides DMF, alkyl and aryl carboxylic acids proved to be feasible nucleophiles to afford various &#946;&#8208;amino esters. The robustness of this method was further demonstrated by its applicability in the late&#8208;stage modification of biological molecules. Control experiments suggested that a sulfonamidyl radical was involved in this reaction.

Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H acyloxylation of 2&#8208;aroyl pyridine derivatives with simple sodium carboxylate utilizing transformable directing groups is described. This protocol features broad functional group tolerance and chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectivity, providing the acyloxylation products in 45%&#8208;84%yield. Furthermore, the synthetic utility of this protocol was demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical compounds. Notably, the acyloxylation products could be further transformed into a variety of useful heterocycles under mild conditions.

Abstract
In this paper, we present a one&#8208;pot protocol that enables a straightforward and selective transformation of alkyl benzothiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl and phenyltetrazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl sulfones and acyl chlorides into ketones, E&#8208;olefins, Z&#8208;olefins, and even pyrroles. The final product of the reaction depends on the proper choice of the reaction workup. Notably, the protocol designed for olefin formation allows a switch between E&#8208; and Z&#8208;olefin formation by the correct choice of the reaction workup. These developed protocols facilitate the formation of all compounds under mild reaction conditions, as evidenced by the synthesis of (nitro)&#8208;fatty acids, and the concept can be extended to other product formations, as demonstrated by the synthesis of pyrroles.

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we present a one-pot protocol that enables a straightforward and selective transformation of alkyl benzothiazol-2-yl and phenyltetrazol-2-yl sulfones and acyl chlorides into ketones, E-olefins, Z-olefins, and even pyrroles. The final product of the reaction depends on the proper choice of the reaction workup. Notably, the protocol designed for olefin formation allows a switch between E- and Z-olefin formation by the correct choice of the reaction workup. These developed protocols facilitate the formation of all compounds under mild reaction conditions, as evidenced by the synthesis of (nitro)-fatty acids, and the concept can be extended to other product formations, as demonstrated by the synthesis of pyrroles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Herein, the use of triphenylmethylium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate as an efficient catalyst for the intermolecular dehydrative coupling of p&#8208;hydroxymandelic acid hydrate with substituted aromatic amines and (thio)phenols was developed, which allows for the preparation of arylacetic acid derivatives in a convenient manner. Notably, this method offers several advantages, including being prefunctionalization free, high atom efficiency, and high regioselectivity. Additionally, it exhibits a broad substrate scope, enabling the synthesis of a range of arylacetic acid derivatives. Furthermore, this method can also be applied to the etherification of arylthiol derivatives, facilitating the preparation of various thiolated products, which would enhance the applicability and potential utility of this method in organic synthesis.

Abstract
Herein, a successive energy transfer (sEnT) strategy to enable a dehydrogenative 6&#960;&#8208;photocyclisation, without the need for an external oxidant is reported, in which the energetically unfavourable dehydrogenation is driven by energy transfer. The valuable applicability of this method was demonstrated by the scaffold hopping of indole containing bioactive molecules, as well as by the succinct synthesis of naturally occurring tetracyclic furocarbazole alkaloids. Moreover, experimental and computational studies were conducted to elucidate the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Visible Light instead of Transition Metal: Electron Donor Acceptor Complex Enabled Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Halides with Active Methylene Compounds</title>

Abstract
An arylation of anions of active methylene compounds with aryl halides provides an access to synthetically versatile &#945;&#8208;arylated 1,3&#8208;diketones, &#946;&#8208;keto esters, &#946;&#8208;keto nitriles, &#946;&#8208;cyano esters, etc. Previously, these C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions have been accomplished only using transition metal&#8208;based catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate that these arylations can be successfully realized under catalyst&#8208;free conditions employing the electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex photoactivation strategy. The protocol was further optimized for a semi&#8208;one pot synthesis of indole derivatives via an intramolecular C&#8722;C coupling.

Abstract
We have defined a procedure for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of aryl borazines to facilitate the synthesis of a diverse array of borazine derivatives with varying substitution patterns, paving the way for further exploration of the field. More in detail, we have studied and disclosed a simple iodination procedure that could be applied to several differently substituted substrates (1&#8201;a&#8211;i) with mostly good to excellent yields (47&#8211;96%). The representative iodinated compounds 2&#8201;b and 2&#8201;e, were utilized to test their use in further representative functionalization steps such as cyanation, Heck, and Sonogashira reactions. All products 3&#8201;a&#8211;e were obtained in satisfactory good to very good yields considering the multiple (three or six times) concomitant reactions.

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component, base&#8208;mediated [3+2] cycloaddition reaction to synthesize 1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones from readily available amino acid esters, aldehydes, and terminal alkynes was reported. Isolation of the intermediate and the detailed mechanistic study revealed the course of the reaction. This multi&#8208;component reaction proceeds via imine formation followed by the nucleophilic addition of alkyne to form a propargylamine precursor. Base&#8208;mediated conversion of propargylamine precursor into 1&#8208;azadiene followed by in&#8197;situ ketene formation leading to [3+2] cycloaddition that ultimately produces unusual 1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones.

Abstract
A four&#8208;component reaction of N&#8208;arylpropiolamides, Hantzsch esters, Na2S2O5 and water via a radical cascade cyclization process with the insertion of sulfur dioxide mediated by K2S2O8 is reported. A series of alkylsulfonated spiro[4,5] trienones are prepared up to 86% yield with a good functional group tolerance and substrate applicability. Preliminary mechanism experiments indicate that carbonyl oxygen of spiro[4,5] trienones originated from water.

Abstract
An electrochemical methodology for the construction of &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;substituted carbonyl compounds in moderate to good yields under exogenous metal and oxidant&#8208;free conditions has been developed. The protocol involves the single&#8208;electron oxidation of the aryl ring to generate a radical cation followed by a three&#8208;electron SN2 reaction resulting in the formation of &#945;&#8208;CF3 substituted ketones.

         <title>Synthesis of Indoles via Sigmatropic Rearrangements and Olefin Isomerization</title>

Abstract
Indoles are important heterocycles in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, and their atom&#8208;economical synthesis is needed. Herein, we describe the synthesis of indoles using sigmatropic rearrangements. The N&#8208;allylaniline was oxidized by environmentally benign hydrogen peroxide, and spontaneous [2,3]&#8208;Meisenheimer rearrangement gave N&#8208;allyloxyaniline. Subsequent treatment with a ruthenium catalyst afforded N&#8208;vinyloxyaniline, which underwent [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement to give indoles, expelling water as the only byproduct. The whole sequence is free of quantitative salt byproducts, thereby avoiding aqueous work up and cutting off the inorganic waste.

The front cover illustrates the streamlined synthesis of representative non&#8208;alternant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons through Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed Prins&#8208;type cycloaromatization (on the earth). Notable features of the catalytic reaction encompass air tolerance, high productivity, remarkably short reaction times, and scalability. The plausible mechanism suggests that Prins&#8208;type benzannulation competes with oxonium&#8208;ene cyclization. The robustness and high productivity of the key reaction allowed the application towards total synthesis of natural benzo[j]fluoranthene, viridistratin A (on the moon). Details can be found in the Communication by Hwayoung Yun and co&#8208;workers (M. Jeong, M. Yoon, L. H. Nguyen, S. Kim, J. Han, C. S. Tran, J. Kim, J. Jo, Y.&#8208;S. Jung, J.&#8208;W. Yoo, H.

Abstract
The pharmaceutical industry has traditionally employed batch processing as a means of synthesizing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) on a commercial scale.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pharmaceutical industry has traditionally employed batch processing as a means of synthesizing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) on a commercial scale. Batch manufacturing enables API synthesis in large quantities in order to meet regulations. Yet, this strategy remains cumbersome, is labor-intensive, and creates complex logistical networks. In recent decades, batch API processing has gradually eroded American economic competitiveness and has led to the offshoring of API manufacturing from the United States. Today it is estimated that +80% of APIs are manufactured overseas.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; Meanwhile, disruptions from the Coronavirus Disease (SARS-CoV-2) have exacerbated weaknesses in the global supply chain, culminating with widespread shortages of critical life-saving drugs.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; These shortages have emphasized the importance of reshoring drug manufacturing to the U.S. and fostered a regulatory landscape that seeks advanced methods of API manufacturing in order to bolster America's supply chain resiliency.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Recently, increased attention has been directed towards continuous drug manufacturing to enable nonstop API production within modular stand-alone flow systems. Continuous manufacturing (CM) facilitates modular automation, offers new avenues towards process intensification, and even enables in-line analytical monitoring from raw materials to packaged products. This strategy offers better conversion, increased safety, reduced waste, and overall cost savings versus traditional batch-style processing. The rise of advanced API manufacturing, coupled with the current regulatory landscape, offers a rare window of opportunity to convert traditional batch pharmaceutical processes into continuous, streamlined production systems to on-shore API manufacturing and eliminate drug shortages.

Abstract
Elaborated molecular architectures, especially carbocyclic, heterocyclic, endocyclic, and polycyclic molecular structures, serve as an important class of organic complexes because they are frequently occurring core structural units in a variety of biologically and pharmacologically relevant natural products, drug molecules, agrochemicals, and functional materials. A main challenge of current synthetic approaches is the development of strategically efficient and selective formation of these compounds from easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle starting materials. The cascade cyclizations of 1,7&#8208;enynes have afforded an indispensable method for accessing molecular complexity and diversity, thus highlighting their potential significance in both academic and industrial communities. In the last decades, tremendous efforts have been devoted to discovering convenient routes to access sophisticated annulation derivatives, and a wide range of powerful and straightforward synthetic strategies have been reported. In this review, the latest achievements in the cascade cyclization reactions of 1,7&#8208;enynes are summarized, which could be separated into three categories: (1) Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reactions of 1,7&#8208;enynes; (2) Metal&#8208;free catalyzed reactions of 1,7&#8208;enynes; (3) Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions of 1,7&#8208;enynes.

         <title>Synthesis of Benzo[a]fluorene, Benzo[c]fluorene, and Benzo[j]fluoranthene via a Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Prins&#8208;Type Cycloaromatization: Application to the Total Synthesis of Viridistratin A</title>

Abstract
Synthesis of benzo[a]fluorene, benzo[c]fluorene, and benzo[j]fluoranthene have been accomplished from readily accessible enol ether precursors via a Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed Prins&#8208;type cycloaromatization. Mechanistically, it was proposed that Lewis acids catalyze the generation of oxonium species, which accelerate subsequent annulation and aromatization. This protocol offers the benefit of an operationally simple, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, and air&#8208;tolerant reaction condition, enabling gram&#8208;scale syntheses of the desired products. The total synthesis of viridistratin A further supported this synthetic strategy for establishing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon architectures.

Abstract
A regio&#8208; and diastereoselective conjugate addition reaction of Grignard reagents to fluoroalkyl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl ketimines was disclosed. A range of different fluoroalkyls and Grignard reagents were well tolerated, giving up to 99% diastereomeric and regioisomeric ratios. This reaction provided a straightforward method for the synthesis of a variety of enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;fluorinated enamines and derivatives which are difficult to achieve with other methods.

Abstract
A Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of &#945;&#8208;arylated sulfoxonium ylides has been achieved from mesitylene&#8208;derived diaryliodonium salts and &#945;&#8208;carbonyl sulfoxonium ylides. The reaction is believed to proceed via an electrophilic Cu(III)&#8208;aryl intermediate that can be trapped upon nucleophilic attack of the sulfoxonium ylide precursor. The reaction was tolerant to both &#945;&#8208;keto and &#945;&#8208;ester&#8208;derived sulfoxonium ylides, to drug&#8208;derived ylide motifs and to electronically&#8208;diverse arenes, and enabled the direct synthesis of 32 &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;sulfoxonium ylides in 42&#8211;85% yield.

Abstract
An electrocatalytic approach for the bromide&#8208;mediated selenocyclization of N&#8208;propargylamides with diselenides is described, providing a synthetic route for the synthesis of various seleno&#8208;oxazoles in 41&#8211;73% yields. The success of gram&#8208;scale experiments demonstrate the potential value of this protocol in synthetic chemistry. Mechanistic investigations suggest that this selenocyclization protocol proceed through two possible pathways, including selenium cation and radical processes.

Mechanistic investigations suggest that this selenocyclization protocol proceed through two possible pathways, including selenium cation and radical processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Vinyl Triflates and 1,4&#8208;Dicyanobenzene to Access Alkenyl Nitriles</title>

Abstract
We report a vinyl cyanation reaction of vinyl triflates and readily available 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene through a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling process. The reaction is operated under mild conditions with remarkable functional&#8208;group compatibility. Cyclic vinyl triflates with various ring sizes and substituents at different positions all reacted smoothly. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by the derivatization of pharmaceutical and natural compounds, a scale&#8208;up synthesis, and various functional group transformations. Preliminary mechanistic studies demonstrate that vinyl triflates are more reactive than 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene towards the oxidative addition to nickel catalyst.

         <title>Organocatalytic Stereoselective Decarboxylative Addition of &#945;&#8208;Amido Malonic Acid Half Oxyesters to Isatins</title>

Abstract
The stereoselective reaction of &#945;&#8208;amido&#8208;substituted malonic acid half oxyesters (&#945;&#8208;amido&#8208;MAHOs) with isatins was developed. A cinchona alkaloid thiourea catalyst gave products bearing a tetrasubstituted stereogenic centre in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (75&#8211;99% yield, 83:17&#8211;97:3 dr, 92:8&#8211;99:1 er). The obtained products can be converted into some chiral compounds without loss of enantiopurity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to clarify the origin of stereoselectivities, and suggested that the first stereogenic centre is set in the decarboxylation, the second in the protonation.

Abstract
A direct thiocyanatosulfonation of alkynes with sulfinic acids and potassium thiocyanate was developed at room temperature. This method provided a efficient and practical pathway to selectively access (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;(thiocyanato)vinyl sulfones by two C&#8722;S bonds formation in one step under metal&#8208;free condition. The advantages of this method included simple reaction conditions, easily available starting materials, good functional group compatibility, high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity and good to excellent yields of products.

Abstract
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;regioselective dicarbofunctionalization of silylated 1,3&#8208;dienes with functionalized solid organozinc pivalates and alkyl bromides is disclosed, thus affording the alkylarylated and dialkylated silanes in a regioselective manifold. Herein, regioselectivity is steered by steric hindrance of the bulky silyl groups, which could prohibit the formation of the flexible &#960;&#8208;allylcobalt intermediate. Furthermore, derivatizations of the resulting products and modifications of bioactive molecules demonstrate the synthetical utility of our method.

Abstract
A strategy was developed for synthesizing furan&#8208;fused dibenzotropones via intramolecular Wittig reactions of alkylidene dibenzo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;tropolones and acylating reactants in catalytic or stoichiometric conditions. With these protocols, a series of furo[2,3&#8208;f]dibenzotropones were obtained in 49&#8211;99% yields within 1&#8211;10&#8197;hours. Mechanistic studies of the base&#8208;free phenomena revealed that the organophosphane acts both as a mediator and a regenerable Br&#248;nsted base under heating.

&lt;p&gt;A strategy was developed for synthesizing furan-fused dibenzotropones &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; intramolecular Wittig reactions of alkylidene dibenzo-&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-tropolones and acylating reactants in catalytic or stoichiometric conditions. With these protocols, a series of furo[2,3-&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;]dibenzotropones were obtained in 49&#8211;99% yields within 1&#8211;10&#8197;hours. Mechanistic studies of the base-free phenomena revealed that the organophosphane acts both as a mediator and a regenerable Br&#248;nsted base under heating.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Flavin&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidative C&#8722;C Bond Formation by Metal/Light&#8208;Free Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>

Abstract
Biomimetic flavin catalysts enable green and selective aerobic oxidative transformations. However, most previous studies tended to focus on reproducing the enzymatic function of flavin monooxygenase, thereby limiting the applications of flavin catalysts to oxygen&#8208;atom transfer reactions. We herein report a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) between the sp3 C&#8722;H bond of tetrahydroisoquinolines and the sp3 and sp2 C&#8722;H bonds of carbon nucleophiles, such as &#945;&#8208;methylene carbonyl compounds, nitromethane, and indoles, for C&#8722;C bond formation promoted by flavin catalysts. Flavin catalysis enables the oxidative C&#8722;H activation of tetrahydroisoquinolines and the efficient activation of molecular oxygen (1&#8197;atm) under mild and metal/light&#8208;free conditions, thus facilitating a green aerobic CDC that generates benign water as the sole by&#8208;product.

         <title>Catalytic Orthogonal Glycosylation Enabled by Enynal&#8208;Derived Copper Carbenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present an approach for catalytic orthogonal glycosylation utilizing earth&#8208;abundant copper carbenes. This method operates under mild conditions and employs readily accessible starting materials, including benchtop stable enynal&#8208;derived glycosyl donors, synthesized at the gram scale. The reaction accommodates a variety of glycosyl acceptors, including primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols. The enynal&#8208;derived copper carbenes exhibit remarkable reactivity and selectivity, allowing for the formation of glycosidic linkages with different protecting groups and stereochemical patterns. This approach provides access to both 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208; and &#8208;trans&#8208;glycosidic linkages. The product stereoselectivity is independent of the anomeric configuration of the glycosyl donor, which also has orthogonal reactivity to widely used alkynes and thioglycoside donors. An iterative synthesis of a trisaccharide further demonstrates the application of this orthogonal reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Difluorocyclopropanes via Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated [1+2] Cycloaddition of Diazo Esters with gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes and Evaluation of their Antifungal Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we reported a method for construction of difluorocyclopropanes through visible light&#8208;promoted [1+2] cycloaddition reaction of aryl diazo esters with gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, encompasses a wide range of substrates (36 examples), exhibits good tolerance to various substituents, and demonstrates excellent diastereoselectivity (&gt; 20:1 dr). Additionally, antifungal activity evaluation revealed that these derivatives exhibited certain activity, the EC50 values for the products towards Botrytis cinerea and Rhizoctonia solani were measured to be 1.51 and 1.36 &#956;M respectively, which are significantly lower than that of commercial fungicides Hymexazol and Azoxystrobin. This work not only provides an efficient method for the synthesis of difluorocyclopropanyl derivatives, but reveals their potential applications in fungicide creation.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Atroposelective Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Involving Ring Manipulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Axially chiral architectures exist widely in natural products, biologically relevant molecules, chiral ligands and catalysts as well as functional materials. Therefore, catalytic asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers has become one of the most fast&#8208;growing fields in the community of chemistry and rapid advances have occurred. Among different methods reported, the organocatalytic atroposelective dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) involving ring manipulations stands out as a cutting&#8208;edge technology to construct axial chirality from the point of atom/step economy. In this DKR strategy, the configurational lability of starting materials originates from chirally&#8208;labile ring structure of cyclic substrates/intermediates or transient ring formation through noncovalent interactions from acyclic substrates. The two atropisomers of starting material are in equilibrium in the reaction medium, ensuring the constant transformation of the less reactive atropisomer into the more reactive one, and then to a single enantiopure product in the presence of an appropriate organocatalyst. This review summarizes recent advancements on this topic, including their scopes, limitations, mechanisms, applications and provides some insights into further developments.

Abstract
Herein, we describe a copper&#8208;catalyzed sequential C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H annulation of indoles with propargylic alcohols for the synthesis of diversely functionalized hydrobenzo[b]carbazole scaffolds. The reaction involves a Friedel&#8208;Crafts addition, 1,5&#8208;H shift, 6&#960; electrocyclization, and dearomatization&#8208;aromatization cascade. Importantly, this is a report of the use of 2&#8208;(diarylmethyl)indoles as three&#8208;carbon synthons in a (3+3) annulation reaction involving C(sp3)&#8722;H indole functionalization under oxidant&#8208;free conditions.

Abstract
Copper&#8208;catalyzed silylarylation of N&#8208;(arylsulfonyl)acrylamides via a tandem silyl radical addition/1,4&#8208;aryl migration/desulfonylation sequence has been developed. This method employs silanes as the precursor of silyl radical and di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide (DTBP) as the initiator. By using this cascade procedure, a series of &#946;&#8208;silyl amide&#8208;pharmaceutical hybrids which contain an &#945;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter were facilely synthesized.

By using this cascade procedure, a series of &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-silyl amide-pharmaceutical hybrids which contain an &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-all-carbon quaternary stereocenter were facilely synthesized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
An asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkylated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated 2&#8208;acyl imidazole with nitrones or N,N&#8217;&#8208;cyclic azomethine imines to construct chiral &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkylated &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols or chiral &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkylated 1,3&#8208;diamino compounds has catalyzed by chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal rhodium complexes is reported. The corresponding products with three contiguous tertiary stereocenters were obtained in 62%&#8211;98% yields with stereoselectivities up to &gt;20:1 dr and 99% ee. Remarkably, as low as 0.06&#8197;mol% of chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal rhodium complex can promote a gram&#8208;scale reaction with nitrones or N,N&#8217;&#8208;cyclic azomethine imines.

         <title>Organocatalytic Activation of Pyruvates Toward Michael Addition to Nitroalkenes: Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Despite the significant role of pyruvic acid in biotransformations, the utilization of pyruvates in the field of catalytic asymmetric synthesis has been unexpectedly limited. This statement also applies to enamine catalysis, in which pyruvates seem to be challenging substrates. Recently, the first illustration of the asymmetric addition of pyruvic acid to &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes, catalyzed by a NahE enzyme using the enamine mechanism, has appeared in the literature. Now, we demonstrate pyrrolidine&#8208;based catalyst can mimick enamine mechanism used by this enzyme to activate pyruvates in the asymmetric addition to structurally diverse nitroalkenes to produce highly enantioenriched Michael adducts without the limitations in substrate structures associated with biocatalysts. In addition to confirming that optically pure pyrrolidines can serve as ultimately small organic catalysts in pyruvate activation, we present an exceedingly simple and versatile method for the synthesis of optically pure &#947;&#8208;nitro acids, which are precursors for well&#8208;known active pharmaceutical ingredients namely GABA derivatives

         <title>Nitrosonium Ion Catalyzed Oxidative Bromination of Arenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A nitrosonium catalyzed bromination of electron&#8208;rich arenes has been developed, using bromide salts as bromine sources, oxygen gas as a terminal oxidant and Br&#248;nsted acids (sulfuric acid, TFA or HBr). This arene bromination process is free of transition metals, proceeding in acetic acid and under mild temperatures (25&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C) to give brominated arenes with good to excellent yields. Our mechanistic studies indicated that this oxidative bromination of arenes reaction is catalyzed by nitrosnium ion (NO+), without the involvement of Br2 or Br+. The kinetic isotope effect of this reaction was measured using pentadeuteriophenyl phenyl ether (kH/kD=1.1).

         <title>Synthesis of Vinyl and 1,3&#8208;Dienyl Sulfones Enabled by Photochemical Excitation of Halogen&#8208;Bonding Complexes</title>

Abstract
The photochemical catalyst&#8208;free radical&#8208;based synthesis of vinyl and 1,3&#8208;dienyl sulfones is disclosed. Mechanistic investigations support that the transformations rely on a visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted activation of a halogen&#8208;bonding complex, which is formed between an alkenyl (or 1,3&#8208;dienyl) bromide and a sodium sulfinate salt. The reactions exhibit a wide functional group tolerance (compatible with heteroatoms, electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating groups), finding application in the structural modification of biologically relevant molecules. Eventually, a continuous flow protocol was developed to upscale these transformations.

         <title>Recent Advances in Radical Coupling Strategies Enabled by 2&#8208;Azaallyl Anions as Super&#8208;Electron&#8208;Donors</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Due to amine derivatives widely existing in numerous clinical medicines and bioactive compounds, their synthesis has received considerable attention over the past few decades. Traditional methods for the synthesis of amine derivatives largely relied on the reduction of nitroarenes, amides, hydrazines, nitriles, and azides. Recently, the discovery of 2&#8208;azaallyl anions as super&#8208;electron&#8208;donors (SEDs) has opened up new possibilities for the construction of diverse carbon&#8722;carbon and carbon&#8722;heteroatom bonds through radical coupling strategies. This breakthrough highlights the potential of generating 2&#8208;azaallyl radicals as versatile intermediates in organic synthesis. Then, hydrolysis of the coupling product can easily separate the corresponding amine derivatives. Thus, tremendous attention has been paid to the C&#8211;H functionalization of 2&#8208;azaallyls as an alternative strategy for the synthesis of amine derivatives. Herein, we comprehensively summarize the recent progress in radical coupling strategies enabled by 2&#8208;azaallyl anions as SEDs. Their proposed mechanistic pathways, advantages, and limitations are also discussed in detail.</dc:description>

Abstract
This study describes the palladium&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective amination of chloro(hetero)aryl triflates in the C&#8722;Cl bond for the first time. A newly designed and synthesized alkyl&#8208;pyrazole&#8208;based phosphine ligand, L26 (BirdPhos), which is featured with the pyrazole ligand core and the cyclohexyl group at the C3 and C5 positions, was key to the success of this reaction. A variety of chloro(hetero)aryl triflates coupled with aromatic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic amines smoothly afforded the corresponding products up to 97% yields with general chemoselectivity (&gt;99%) in the C&#8722;Cl bond. Drug analogs were also synthesized via the chemoselective intermolecular amination. This study attempts to investigate the structure&#8208;activity relationship of this new class of ligand through experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Recent Progress in Functionalization of the Pyridine Ring through C&#8211;S Bond Formation under Transition Metal Catalyst Free Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyridines and quinolines substituted with sulfur&#8208;containing functional groups are widely used as drugs, drug candidates, organic materials, N,S&#8208;ligands and others. Traditional synthetic routes to produce these compounds are based on nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions of (pseudo)halopyridines. While effective in many cases, both approaches are limited due to using forcing conditions and expensive, specifically designed catalytic systems. In the last decade, a number of innovative methods for the functionalization of the pyridine ring via the formation of a C&#8211;S bond have been developed. Most of these methods proceed through the direct or indirect C&#8211;H&#8208;functionalization of unfunctionalized, thus avoiding the use of oftentimes not readily available halopyridines as the starting materials. Deoxygenative C&#8211;H&#8208;functionalization of pyridine&#8208;N&#8208;oxides and deaminative transformation of aminopyridines have been also employed for the introduction of diverse organosulfur functionality into the pyridine ring. All these processes can be easily performed under mild conditions, typically affording value pyridines and quinolines in good to high yields. Usually being highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective, these methods allow the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules including drugs and natural products. In this review, we summarize the most recent synthetic methods for functionalization of pyridines and fused pyridines with sulfur&#8208;containing functional groups reported mostly since 2018. For a better understanding of the processes, the mechanisms of the described reactions are briefly discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of Solid Me3SiZnI for the Synthesis of Aryl and Alkyl Trimethylsilanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Silylzinc reagents are desirable for the synthesis of organosilanes due to their compatibility with functional groups; however, the use of pyrophoric silyllithium and dissolved lithium salts in their production hinders their development. Our solid Me3SiZnI circumvents these limitations, and herein, we demonstrate its significance in the synthesis of aryl and alkyl trimethylsilanes via cross&#8208;coupling of aryl and alkyl bromides. The milder reaction condition tolerates functional groups such as MOM, Boc, Bpin, and aldehydes.

         <title>General Access to Clavine Alkaloids via a Rhodium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereoselective Hayashi&#8208;Miyaura Reaction</title>

Abstract
We report the development of the diastereoselective rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular conjugate addition (Hayashi&#8208;Miyaura reaction) of robust and easily handled 4&#8208;pinacolboronic ester D&#8208;tryptophan derivatives tethering an activated alkene as the acceptor. This methodology provides, access to the functionalized chiral tricyclic core of the ergoline skeleton diastereoselectivity and allows further modification for the cyclization of the fused fourth ring present in several clavine alkaloids.

Abstract
A three&#8208;component phase&#8208;transfer catalytic domino reaction involving cyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione&#8208;derived enaminones, 5&#8208;alkenyl rhodanines, and haloalkanes has been developed. This protocol produces a wide range of 3&#8208;thioquinoline&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones in yields of 52&#8211;81%. The construction of a C&#8722;S bond at the C&#8208;3 position of the quinoline&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione framework expands its structural diversity. Studies into the reaction mechanism revealed that the reaction undergoes a conjugate addition, ammonolysis, elimination, and nucleophilic substitution sequence. The synthetic potential of the reaction was demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale syntheses of representative products. Chloroalkyl chains were installed on the sulfur atoms of most products obtained in this reaction. Diversified product derivatives were obtained by exploiting the favorable leaving nature of the chloride moiety.

Abstract
Herein, we report a modular photocatalytic platform for the site&#8208;selective pyridination of saturated hydrocarbon compounds employing organic photoredox catalysis to forge new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. The site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H pyridination could couple benzylic/allylic C&#8722;H bonds with pyridylphosphonium salts, which installed directly and regioselectively from C&#8722;H heteroarenes through a radical&#8208;radical cross coupling mechanism. This synthetic methodology could tolerate a variety of functional groups, complex heteroarenes, even late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals selectively.

The reaction involves the use of a PdII catalyst and norbornene as a transpositional co&#8208;catalyst, in which a pyrrole&#8208; and norbornyl&#8208;fused palladaheterocycle forms as the key intermediate. The 2&#8208;substituted pyrroles, and other 2,3&#8208;disubstituted pyrroles underwent the selective C5 glycosylation. This reaction is compatible with various types of glycosyl chlorides including D&#8208;mannose, L&#8208;rhamnose, D&#8208;mannofuranose, and D&#8208;ribofuranose. The viability of this strategy is showed by gram&#8208;scale, various synthetic transformation and functionalization.

Abstract
An exclusive anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamination as well as hydroalkoxylation of allylic alcohols catalyzed by a simple catalyst Y(CH2SiMe3)3(THF)2 has been developed, providing a variety of &#947;&#8208;amino and &#947;&#8208;alkoxy alcohols in good yields under mild conditions. Moreover, this protocol is applied to the synthesis of drug molecules Propipocaine and Proroxan. The rare&#8208;earth metal catalyst features readily available, wide substrate compatability, exclusive anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity, and performs in the absence of a base or an additive.

Abstract
Both furan and 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine (1,4&#8208;DHP) are key structural motifs in pharmaceuticals. Herein, we report the synthesis of 4&#8208;(furan&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines from pyridiniums and furfural derivatives under NHC catalysis. This reaction involves the generation of NHC&#8208;bounded trienolates from furfural derivatives and following addition to the C&#8208;4 position of N&#8208;aryl pyridinium salts. This protocol features good yields (41&#8211;99%), and high levels of regioselectivity (&gt;20:1 for all cases).

The front cover picture visualises the colourful beauty of the synthesised compound class of 11H&#8208;indeno&#8208;[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes. In contrast to their colourless structural isomer naphthalene, azulenes are known for exhibiting vibrant colours, resulting from their non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbon nature. Whereas the unsubstituted azulene is blue, the presented indenoazulenes show a range of dark green emerald&#8208;like shades. The golden highlights depict the elegance and eternity of gold in its elemental state, emphasising the crucial role of the metal as a catalyst in the presented methodology. Details can be found in the Research Article by Hashmi and co&#8208;workers (A. V. Mackenroth, A. Ahrens, J. F. Wunsch, R. Berger, F. Rominger, M. Rudolph, A. S. K. Hashmi, Adv. Synth.

         <title>Hydroformylation of Alkynyl Sulfides: A Stereo&#8208; and Regioselective Route to &#945;&#8208;Sulfenyl Acroleins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation of alkynyl sulfides at 40&#8201;&#176;C under 5 bars of syngas is described. The method gives access to &#945;&#8208;sulfenyl acroleins with &#945;/&#946; regioselectivities up to 89/11 and is applicable to alkyl or aryl substituted substrates. It is effective even on more complex substrates, such as cysteine and cholesterol derivatives. To demonstrate the synthetic potential of the obtained products, (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;cyclohexyl&#8208;2&#8208;methylsulfenyl acrolein was selected as an example and its sulfur atom selectively oxidized to the corresponding sulfoxide or sulfone. Acid&#8208;promoted (Z) to (E) isomerization of the double bond occurred during oxidation. The three obtained sulfenyl&#8208;, sulfinyl&#8208;, and sulfonyl&#8208;functionalized acroleins have been then used as dienophiles to access cyclohexene carbaldehydes.

Abstract
Mg&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition reactions between 2&#8208;aminobenzaldehydes and ynones offered an array of 2&#8208;arylquinoline motifs merged with a CF3&#8208;acyl group. Furthermore, with Mg&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation as the key step, DDD107498, DDD102542, and Hit analogues were assembled. Finally, a computational study of the reaction mechanism was conducted.

An iodine&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic addition of indoles to an aldehyde group of 2&#8208;styrylbenzaldehydes leads to the formation of carbocation intermediates that undergo 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization to give indenes with a trisubstituted double bond. These indenes are transformed into thermodynamically more stable products with a fully substituted double bond under the reaction conditions. Minor quantities of indolylbenzo[b]carbazoles are also produced as by&#8208;products.

Abstract
Here, we report the organocatalytic enantioselective synthesis of dihydrothiopyran derivatives from trans racemic donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropane carbaldehydes (DACCs) and 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;arylethanone via formal thio (4+2) cycloaddition involving thia&#8208;Michael aldol condensation and annulation. Mechanistic studies indicate a typical kinetic resolution (KR) is involved in this transformation, which results in moderate yields and enantiomeric ratios. Remarkably, this method is characterized by its one&#8208;pot simplicity, mild reaction conditions, and resilience towards air and moisture interference.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalyzed [3+3] Annulation for the Enantioselective Synthesis of Benzopyranothiazinones</title>

Abstract
The design, inspired by the core&#8208;structure of oxicam has allowed the enantioselective synthesis of benzopyranothiazinone motifs employing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. The NHC&#8208;mediated transformation involves the reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes with suitable substituted benzothiazinone derivatives. This process encompasses the initial formation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acylazoliums from ynals and concurrent generation of enolates from benzothiazinone. The culmination of these reactions results in an efficient annulation, yielding the desired products with reasonable yields and high stereoselectivities. This study underscores the potential of NHC catalysis in the streamlined synthesis of complex heterocyclic structures.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;induced Selective &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation of N&#8208;alkyl Amines: Synthesis of Coumarin&#8208;fused Quinolinones under Air</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
A substrate&#8208;induced synthesis of coumarin&#8208;fused quinolinones is achieved from 4&#8208;(phenylamino)&#8208;2H&#8208;chromen&#8208;2&#8208;ones using N&#8208;alkyl amines as the solvent and a carbon source under air conditions without any catalysts in one pot. This protocol highlights the special roles of 4&#8208;(phenylamino)&#8208;2H&#8208;chromen&#8208;2&#8208;ones which were not only used as reactants but also as an internal oxidant selectively activated N&#8208;&#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond. This reaction features catalyst&#8208;free, broad substrate scopes (N&#8208;alkyl amines 27 examples and quinolinones 24 examples), operationally simple for the one&#8208;step synthesis, and recovery and recycling of the solvent.

Abstract
We demonstrate the application of chiral magnesium complexes in an asymmetric carbon&#8208;sulfur bond&#8208;forming reaction. Enantioselective and cost&#8208;effective methodology under mild condition for the thia&#8208;Michael addition, utilizing an in&#8197;situ generated chiral dinuclear magnesium&#8208;ProPhenol complex, has been developed. The versatility of this protocol is demonstrated with a broad range of thiol nucleophiles and a wide selection of enones. Enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;ketosulfides are obtained in good to excellent yields and moderate to excellent enantioselectivity. The presented catalytic system exhibits excellent tolerance for structurally different substrates while maintaining high enantioselectivity. This observation aligns with proposed mechanism, wherein the sulfur atom coordinates to the catalyst in close proximity to the reaction center.

         <dc:description>Herein, a Rh&#8208;catalyzed redox C7&#8208;spiroannulation reaction of N&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole indolines with maleimides has been reported, chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208; selectively providing a series of N&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole indoline fused azaspirocycles in up to 92% yield. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by the synthesis of highly functionalized nitrogen&#8208;containing spiropolycyclic skeletons, which could be extended to maleic esters and acrylates. The products could be purified through simple filtration. The recyclable Rh catalyst and scale&#8208;up synthesis with as low as 0.5 mol% catalyst loading makes this protocol potential application in industrial. Moreover, the efficient post&#8208;modification of pharmaceutical molecules demonstrates its practicability.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of Bertagnini's Salts in a Mechanochemical Approach Toward Aza&#8208;Heterocycles and Reductive Aminations via Imine Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our research has demonstrated that mechanochemical activation is more effective with solid reagents. We have showcased the 
 practicality of Bertagnini's salts, also called aldehyde&#8208;bisulfite adducts, which are crystalline, simplifying preparation and storage. These salts are stable substitutes for liquid aldehydes and ketones that have been effectively employed in reductive amination, 
synthesizing aza&#8208;heterocycles and hydrazones within mechanochemistry. The technique's effectiveness broadens the substrate scopes, simplifies purification, reduces reaction times, and delivers good product yields. Additionally, the thermal stability of the bisulfite adducts has been confirmed through TGA (Thermogravimetric analysis) analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;Quinolones based on Visible Light&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation of Diazo compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a photocatalytic method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;quinolones under mild conditions by employing &#945;&#8208;diazo acetamide as substrates. The use of Eosin Y as a photocatalyst allows an economical and environmentally benign synthetic method. The process involves the generation of radicals from diazo compounds promoted by a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism. The method demonstrates a broad substrate scope to provide various aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;quinolones. To support the proposed mechanism, a series of mechanistic experiments were conducted.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Enabled Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese (Mn) is the third most abundant transition metal on Earth and is known for its exceptional biocompatibility. The development of novel catalytic mode for Mn is of great significance to advancing organic synthesis. In this study, the first manganese (Mn)&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of alkynes is achieved with the aid of visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis. Photoredox catalysis is proposed to promote the transformation by in situ reduction of high&#8208;valent Mn(II) complex to Mn(0) species, thereby initiating the reaction. Additionally, a photooxidation&#8208;induced reductive ellimination step is also suggested. This system is further distinguished by its notable tolerance towards both terminal and internal alkynes as counterparts of diynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira couplings: extending the reaction scope to aryl bromides and chlorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The alkyne motif is present in several naturally occur&#8208;ring molecules and specialty chemicals. The Sonogashira reaction is recognized as one of the most exploited methods for the synthesis of substituted alkynes. While palladium catalysts have been traditionally employed, recent efforts have been directed towards developing alternatives based on Earth&#8208;abundant metals such as nickel. However, nickel&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira couplings still present important substrate limitations. While more reactive aryl iodides have been well documented, the coupling of more challenging yet cost&#8208;effective aryl bromides and chlorides lags significantly behind. Herein, we present a method for the nickel&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling of aryl bromides and chlorides, whose discovery was accelerated thanks to high&#8208;throughput experimentation. Fine&#8208;tuning of the bipyridine ligand was essential to activate chemoselectively C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;)&#8211;Br or C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;)&#8211;Cl bonds. A wide range of functionally diverse alkynes, including examples of active ingredients and their intermediates, were accessed in a single step and with yields up to 98%. The developed methodology is expected to be widely adopted by academia and industry, marking a step forward in the field of base metal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Microwave&#8208;assisted Rhodium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed C8&#8211;Regioselective C&#8211;H Alkenylation and Arylation of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrahydroquinolines with Alkenyl and Aryl Carboxylic Acids</title>

         <dc:description>Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;selective C&#8211;H alkenylation and arylation of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines with readily available and inexpensive alkenyl and aryl carboxylic acids under microwave assistance have been realized. Using [Rh(CO)2(acac)] as the catalyst and Piv2O as the acid activator, various 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines undergo smooth C8&#8208;selective decarbonylative C&#8211;H alkenylation with a wide range of alkenyl carboxylic acids, affording the C8&#8208;alkenylated 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines with high efficiency and wide tolerance of functional groups. This method enables the synthesis of C8&#8208;alkenylated 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines that would otherwise be difficult to access by means of conventional C&#8211;H alkenylation protocols. Moreover, this catalytic system also works well in C8&#8208;selective decarbonylative C&#8211;H arylation of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines with aryl carboxylic acids. The catalytic activity strongly depends on the choice of the N&#8208;directing group, with the readily installable and removable N&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrimidyl) group being optimal. The catalytic pathway is elucidated by mechanistic experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>An Access to Chiral Phthalides: Enantioselective Synthesis of Escitalopram</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for the asymmetric synthesis of phthalides containing a stereogenic &#947;&#8208;carbon has been described. The protocol, based on the arylogous Michael addition to chiral alkenoyl oxazolidinones catalyzed by a crown ether under phase&#8208;transfer conditions does not require anhydrous conditions and uses commercially available materials. A complete syn&#8208;stereocontrol is achieved and facial diastereoselectivities are moderate to excellent (62:38 to 99:1 d.r.).	Purification of the major diastereomer by chromatography and selective cleavage of the chiral auxiliary affords enantiopure Michael products. The protocol has been applied to the formal synthesis of escitalopram.

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Structural Rearrangement of Ynamide and Simultaneous N&#8208;Desulfonylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The strategy of ynamide structural rearrangement is crucial in modern organic synthesis. The distinct carbon atoms in ynamides have different selectivity under various reaction conditions. Herein, we developed a base&#8208;promoted regioselective and chemoselective cascade cyclization, ynamide N&#8211;Csp bond cleavage, selective intramolecular 1,3&#8208;migration, and simultaneous N&#8208;desulfonylation strategy for the synthesis of 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3&#8208;(phenylethynyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indole derivatives within a time of 15 min. We observed multiple bond breaking (&#8208;N&#8211;Ts, and Csp2&#8211;Ts, Csp2&#8211;I/Csp2&#8211;SePh) from (E)&#8208;3&#8208;(1&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;tosylvinyl)&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;tosyl&#8208;indole/(E)&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;(phenylselanyl)&#8208;2&#8208;tosylvinyl)&#8208;1&#8208;tosyl&#8208;indole derivatives to achieve 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3&#8208;(phenylethynyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indole in 15&#8211;60 min using our standard 	reaction conditions. A gram&#8208;scale experiment and the postsynthetic transformation of the synthesized 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3&#8208;(phenylethynyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indole were conducted to exhibit the advantages of our synthetic methodology. The developed methodology has multiple advantages: a rapid reaction rate, regioselectivity and chemoselectivity, transition metal and acid oxidant free, preventing resource waste and a time&#8208;consuming process in deprotecting steps, broad substrate scope, mild reaction condition, simple setup, ease of handle, gram&#8208;scale experiment, and synthetic product transformations.

Abstract
A designed chiral thiourea&#8208;iminophosphorane catalyst was developed to afford &#945;&#8208;acyloxythioesters through enantioselective acyl&#8208;transfer/protonation of &#945;&#8208;acyloxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketosulfides. The desired reaction proceeded in good yields with high enantioselectivities using a chiral thiourea&#8208;iminophosphorane bearing a pyrrolidine scaffold.

Abstract
The prospect of developing methods to control the reactivity of metal(oxo) holds appeal for both synthetic and bioinorganic chemistry. In this study, we observed that carboxylic acids enhance reactivity in C&#8722;H oxidation by forming hydrogen bonds with the oxo ligand, thereby increasing the basicity and electrophilicity of the oxo intermediate. Additionally, we discovered that H&#8208;dicarboxylate ligands, such as oxalate, malonate, and maleate, significantly improve the catalyst turnover frequency (up to 760/h) in unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H oxidation. Furthermore, the addition of maleic acid was also found to activate Fe and Mn(pdp)&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H oxygenation. Notably, Ru(bpga)(H&#8208;maleate)2 3&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization exhibited a broad functional group tolerance, including bromine, hydroxyl, benzoate, nitro, nitryl, sulfonate, imide, sulfonylamide, and carbamate, yielding up to 98% in a site&#8208; and chemoselective manner with only 0.1&#8211;2.0&#8197;mmol% loading.

Abstract
A catalyst system based on palladium 2&#8208;methylnaphthyl complexes bearing ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines (YPhos) was found to enable the selective &#947;&#8208;arylation of 1,3&#8208;dioxinone derivatives with diversely functionalized aryl, heteroaryl, and vinyl chlorides. The products were further converted into 1,3&#8208;diketones and heterocycles, highlighting their function as synthetic hubs. Experimental and computational studies revealed that bulky, electron&#8208;rich YPhos ligands are uniquely effective because they enable the oxidative addition of aryl chlorides at room temperature while at the same time efficiently promoting the rate&#8208;limiting reductive elimination step of the thermally sensitive enolates.

         <title>Shifting Access from Pyrimidine&#8208;Spirofused to Fused Benzoheterocycles by Modifying the Activated Group Position</title>

Abstract
The synthesis of pyrimidine&#8208;spirofused indolines from 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes with 2&#8208;sulfonyliminoindolines has been achieved under catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions, in which five atoms of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes were introduced to the spiro&#8208;annulation products via a (5+1) pathway. Subsequently, this strategy was extended to 3&#8208;aminoindoles and 3&#8208;aminobenzothiophenes, but a different reaction pathway (3+3) was observed. In these cases, three&#8208;atoms of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes were incorporated into pyrimidine&#8208;fused indoles/benzothiophenes. These two transformations demonstrate the potential and versatility of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes to construct nitrogen&#8208;heterocycles.

         <title>Recent Advances in Cyclization Reactions of 1,6&#8208;Enynes</title>

Abstract
Elaborated molecular architectures, specifically those bearing one or more carbon stereocenters, stand as an important class of carbocyclic and heterocyclic frameworks because they are frequently occurring core structures in numerous natural products and biologically active pharmaceutical molecules. Over the past few decades, the development of versatile synthetic approaches via cascade cyclization reactions of 1,6&#8208;enynes for the construction of a series of fused and spiro compounds has been the focus of a great deal of research initiatives. These synthesis strategies are peculiarly fascinating in the context of the assembly of a wide array of pharmaceutical molecules, natural products, agrochemicals, and functional materials. In this review, recent developments in the transformations of 1,6&#8208;enynes with diverse coupling reagents are summarized since 2018, which could be divided into five categories: 1) Introduction; 2) Transition metal catalyzed cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes; 3) Metal&#8208;free cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes; 4) Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes; 5) Electrocatalytic cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes.

         <title>Aryne&#8208;Based Synthesis of Cyclobutadiene&#8208;Containing Oligoacenes and Related Extended Biphenylene Derivatives</title>

Abstract
A previously undescribed aryne derived from a &#960;&#8208;extended biphenylene, 2,3&#8208;didehydrobenzo[b]biphenylene, has been developed. The participation of this new aryne building block in [4+2] and palladium&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions has been applied to the synthesis of a variety of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) with appealing structures which combine (aromatic) benzene and (antiaromatic) cyclobutadiene (CBD) rings. Among them, a family of unsubstituted (or barely substituted) CBD&#8208;oligoacenes has been accessed by iterative Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of the new aryne with furans and/or isobenzofurans, followed by deoxygenative aromatization of the resulting epoxy&#8208;derivatives. The experimental and computational studies of the newly synthesized PCHs suggest an important degree of electron delocalization along the polycyclic skeleton, more pronounced in the linearly fused derivatives. The computed ACID plots reveal clockwise current density vectors at the peripheral bonds, originating from the &#963; contributions of the antiaromatic cyclobutadiene rings.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced selenocyclization of ortho&#8208;vinylanilides to 4H&#8208;3,1&#8208;benzoxazines has been developed under controlled O2 atmosphere. The low O2 content in reaction medium promotes the aerobic selenol oxidation to diselenides for the full use of 2&#8197;equiv. selenyl radicals in a redox&#8208;neutral way, avoiding the aerobic oxidation of ortho&#8208;vinylanilides under higher O2 content. The developed visible light&#8208;induced selenocyclization of ortho&#8208;vinylanilides utilizes only visible light with low O2 content, eliminating the use of exogenous photocatalyst and chemical oxidant.

         <title>Acceleration of the Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction between 9&#8208;Functionalized Anthracenes and C60/C70 in the Cavity of a Water Soluble Subphthalocyanine Cage</title>

Abstract
Herein we report on the acceleration of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between a series of 9&#8208;functionalized anthracenes and C60/C70 encapsulated in a water&#8208;soluble metallo&#8208;organic Pd(II)&#8208;subphthalocyanine cage (SubPc&#8208;cage), which performs as a catalytic molecular reactor that provides a beneficial hydrophobic environment. Negatively and positively charged anthracenes do not react either with C60 or C70, due to a favored solvation in water medium and/or to detrimental interactions with positively&#8208;charged Pd(II) corners of SubPc&#8208;cage. Experiments with C60 and C70 rendered parallel results, although C70 proved more reactive, leading to anthracene cycloadducts by reaction in the &#945; bonds. All the results have been rationalized by theoretical calculations at the GFN2&#8208;xTB level.

         <title>Borylated Cyclopentanes via Atom Transfer Radical [3+2] Annulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An atom transfer radical [3+2] annulation (ATRAn) reaction involving alkenyl boronic esters and homoallylic iodides provides a rapid access to polysubstituted borylated cyclopentanes. A variety of &#945;&#8208;substituted vinylboronic esters are suitable substrates and offer unique opportunities for further modification of the formed 5&#8208;membered ring. For instance, the oxidation of the boronic ester to an alcohol allows the preparation of products that corresponds to an annulation involving the enol form of acetone. Substitution of the iodide by a nucleophile such as lithium methoxide without modifying the boronic ester moiety is also feasible. Finally, by using a (3&#8208;acetoxyprop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;yl)boronic ester, a facile 1,2&#8208;elimination reaction provided a methylenecyclopentane. In this case, the alkenylboronate radical trap acts as an equivalent to allene, a building block so far elusive for preparative radical reactions.

&lt;p&gt;An atom transfer radical [3+2] annulation (ATRAn) reaction involving alkenyl boronic esters and homoallylic iodides provides a rapid access to polysubstituted borylated cyclopentanes. A variety of &#945;-substituted vinylboronic esters are suitable substrates and offer unique opportunities for further modification of the formed 5-membered ring. For instance, the oxidation of the boronic ester to an alcohol allows the preparation of products that corresponds to an annulation involving the enol form of acetone. Substitution of the iodide by a nucleophile such as lithium methoxide without modifying the boronic ester moiety is also feasible. Finally, by using a (3-acetoxyprop-1-en-2-yl)boronic ester, a facile 1,2-elimination reaction provided a methylenecyclopentane. In this case, the alkenylboronate radical trap acts as an equivalent to allene, a building block so far elusive for preparative radical reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aryl Ketone&#8208;Catalyzed Light&#8208;Driven Radical Oxy&#8208;Functionalization of Non&#8208;Acidic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds Enabled by Triple Role of TEMPO</title>

Abstract
A light&#8208;driven radical oxy&#8208;functionalization of non&#8208;acidic aliphatic and benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds was achieved with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) in a single&#8208;step by employing an aryl ketone as a sole catalyst. The transformation was initiated by homolysis of a C(sp3)&#8722;H bond in the starting substance by the photo&#8208;excited aryl ketone. The derived carbon radical was then promptly trapped by TEMPO leading to the formation of the TEMPO&#8208;adduct. The derived TEMPO&#8208;adduct is synthetically versatile as an alcohol equivalent since it can be readily converted to the corresponding ketone by oxidation and to the corresponding alcohol by reduction. The key to realizing the present catalytic reaction relies on the distinctive triple role of TEMPO, which acts as the precursor of the oxygen functionality, the oxidant to regenerate the aryl ketone, and the protective group for the derived TEMPO&#8208;adduct from over&#8208;oxidation.

         <title>Direct Intramolecular Coupling of Primary/Secondary Alcohols with Secondary Alcohols for Macrocyclic Alkenylation Using Ni&#8208;Zeolite Catalyst Under Continuous&#8208;Flow Conditions</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report the direct intramolecular coupling of primary and secondary alcohols for the selective synthesis of macrocyclic olefins in the presence of Ni&#8208;zeolite catalyst under continuous flow. This reaction proceeds via dehydration of secondary alcohols to alkenes, which subsequently undergo intramolecular dehydrative coupling reaction with a primary alcohol to obtain moderate yields of macrocyclic olefins. This reaction is also effective for the coupling of secondary&#8208;secondary alcohols and alkene&#8208;alcohols to produce diverse macrocyclic olefin products. This unique approach has various advantages including step&#8208;economy, no additives and pre&#8208;functionalization required, inexpensive and reusable catalyst, and exemplification with 23 macrocycles in different ring sizes. The continuous flow macrocyclisation afforded higher productivity and space&#8208;time yield than the batch reaction conditions.

         <title>Indolyl&#8208;Ynones: Building Blocks for Molecular Diversity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
This review centers on the synthetic strategies employed with indolyl&#8208;ynones. Indolyl&#8208;ynone, owing to its highly reactive ynone moiety, frequently partakes in dearomatizing spirocyclization reactions and subsequent rearrangement reactions when subjected to various reaction conditions. Hence, various heterocycles such as densely functionalized spiroindolenines, carbazoles, quinolines and carbo&#8208;and hetero&#8208;cycle substituted indoles are synthesized from indolyl&#8208;ynones. In addition to this, the versatile spirocyclic indole scaffold exhibits the capability to produce tetracyclic and polyclic structures through intricate skeletal rearrangement processes. Moreover, the total synthesis of natural products using the indolyl&#8208;ynone moiety was also compiled in this review.

Abstract
An organocatalytic remote stereocontrolled 1,8&#8208;conjugated addition of in&#8197;situ formed propargylic aza&#8208;p&#8208;QMs from &#945;&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl) propargylic alcohols and indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates was developed, affording axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes in 62&#8211;99% yield with 52&#8211;99% ee. The synthetic strategy not only enriches the chemistry of aza&#8208;p&#8208;quinone methides, but also provides an alternative tool for the preparation of axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes.

         <title>Synthesis of Styrenes and E&#8208;Stilbenes by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Vinylation of Aryl Iodides with 1,2&#8208;Dibromoethane</title>

Abstract
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed vinylation reactions of aryl iodides using 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane is developed for the synthesis of styrenes and stilbenes. In these reactions, vinyl bromide is generated from 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane and then undergoes reductive cross&#8208;coupling with aryl iodides, affording styrene products. Under slightly modified reaction conditions, styrenes can continue reacting with vinyl bromide to form E&#8208;stilbenes, which provides a one&#8208;pot synthetic method for stilbenes. Alcohols, including iso&#8208;propanol and methanol, are employed as the reductant in these reductive cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Asymmetric Hydrogenation for the Synthesis of an (S)&#8208;Metolachlor Intermediate Using Catalysts Immobilized on a Core/Shell&#8208;Type Support</title>

Abstract
Here we show continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of a key inter&#8208;mediate of (S)&#8208;Metolachlor, which is a widely used agrochemical that is in huge demand, with asymmetric hydrogenation using a heterogeneous catalyst immobilized on a core/shell&#8208;type support. We have immobilized a homogeneous catalyst onto a core/shell&#8208;type heterogeneous support that was developed in our laboratory, which showed high turnover frequency and turnover number over a long period (over 120&#8197;h) when used in a solvent&#8208;free continuous&#8208;flow manner. This result demonstrates the feasibility of continuous&#8208;flow production of chiral agrochemicals with packed&#8208;bed heterogeneous catalysts. Moreover, the heterogenization protocol was shown to be applicable to elaborate practical catalysts used in industry, especially the group of phosphine ligands.

         <title>Reaction Space Charting as a Tool in Organic Chemistry Research and Development</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The chemical and reaction spaces are incredibly vast and special procedures are required to study them. Their complex and multiparametric nature encompass myriads of compounds and interactions and endless modifications involving the distinct impact of relevant variables (temperature, solvent, stoichiometry, etc.). This often calls for the design, collection, and analysis/interpretation of large datasets. Reaction charting, the systematic scanning, description, analysis, and guided modifications of a given process, stands as the most promising approach. It offers fast and accurate solutions as well as expanding the knowledge about the systems. This deeper understanding enables reliable predictions, improvement of the productivity (yields, scope), eventually leading to sustainable, economic, and safe applications. The present review introduces the topic, analyzing selected examples and recent advancements in different organic chemistry&#8208;related fields. The covered methodologies range from classical experimentation modifying one factor at a time, to Design of Experiments and more modern computational approaches involving Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. In this way, the impact of charting in process development, biological and medicinal chemistry, catalysis, reaction discovery and computational methods is accounted. Finally, the conclusion/outlook section gives a general appraisal and a prospect on the future implementation of the methodology.

         <dc:description>Mn(II)&#8208;catalyzed alkylations of methyl N&#8208;heteroarenes was firstly reported via borrowing hydrogen strategy with alcohols as the alkylating reagent. The newly developed geometry&#8208;constrained benzimidazole&#8208;iminopyridyl ligand played a key role in promoting the transformation and stablizing the metal center. A wide range of alcohols (aromatic, heteroaromatic and aliphatic) and methyl N&#8208;Heteroarenes could be able to apply in the current catalytic system, with TON up to 7400.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Organo&#8208;Catalyzed Ring&#8208;Opening of a Six&#8208;Membered Heterocycle Combining Phosphonate and Ester Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The synthesis of a difunctional P&#8208;heterocycle combining phosphonate and ester moieties in a six&#8208;membered ring is described. Using trifluoromethane sulfonic acid HOTf as organocatalyst, ring&#8208;opening with neopentyl alcohol readily occurs with complete selectivity for O&#8208;acyl bond cleavage. In turn, ring&#8208;opening polymerization proceeds in a controlled manner when an excess of P&#8208;heterocycle is used. Copolymerization with &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone is also reported and semi&#8208;batch conditions are shown to enable regular incorporation of the phosphonate moieties along the polymer chains.

         <title>Direct Site&#8208;Selective Difunctionalization of Pyrazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
This study presents a protocol for the direct site&#8208;selective difunctionalization of pyrazoles under mild reaction conditions. This protocol showcase a notable site&#8208;selectivity and encompasses a wide substrate scope. Detailed mechanistic investigations elucidate the dual role of the sulfonium salt acting both as the reaction substrate and acid donor, thereby effectively catalyzing the reaction. The demonstrated one&#8208;pot synthesis, scale&#8208;up reaction and subsequent product modifications can assist in advancing the potential application of this protocol in organic synthesis and its associated domains.

         <title>Selective Synthesis of Tetrahydro Oxepines by Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Condensations of Diazomalonates and gem&#8208;Dialkyl Vinyl Oxetanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Thanks to an unprecedented gem&#8208;dialkyl substituent effect, an efficient synthesis of tetrahydro oxepine derivatives is achieved by ring expansion of vinyl oxetanes using acceptor(&#8722;acceptor) diazo reagents under Cu(II)&#8208;catalysis. A large scope of 2&#8208;vinyl oxetanes and either diazo mono or diester reagents give access to a series of functionalized oxepines.

Abstract
The combination of organocatalytic activation and photocatalysis for enabling the intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of enone&#8208;ene substrates bearing one Lewis base binding site is reported. While in a variety of solvents a poor conversion or no reaction takes place in the absence of a hydrogen bonding catalyst, the corresponding ring&#8208;fused cyclobutane products could be built in moderate to good yields using a synergistic dual iridium&#8208;urea co&#8208;catalytic system. Control and mechanistic studies supported the postulated interaction between the organocatalyst and the substrate, which proved essential for an efficient energy transfer from the photosensitizer.

Abstract
We report herein a chiral CpXRh(III)&#8208;catalyzed domino cyclization/C3&#8208;arylation process using 2&#8208;alkynylanilines and 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones as viable substrates, delivering indole&#8208;based derivatives endowed with axial chirality. The method features high enantioselectivity, broad substrate scope, and robust functional group tolerance. Subsequent functionalization of the synthesized scaffolds underlines the practicality of this approach in the design of indole&#8208;derivated axially chiral frameworks, demonstrating its substantial promise in synthetic and medicinal chemistry applications.

         <title>Enantioselective Flow Synthesis of a Tetrahydroquinoline SERM Enabled by Immobilized Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalysis and Diboronic Acid Mediated Selective Nitro Reduction</title>

Abstract
An asymmetric enantioselective flow process is reported for the formal synthesis of a 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline selective estrogen receptor modulator. Starting from an easily available 2&#8208;nitrochalcone, the first part of the process comprised a telescoped nitro reduction/intramolecular cyclocondensation sequence using diboronic acid as a simple reductant. Subsequent enantioselective transfer hydrogenation in the presence of an immobilized phosphoric acid organocatalyst followed by telescoped N&#8208;alkylation furnished the targeted chiral intermediate. The approach ensures flexibility regarding the scale of the synthesis, whilst minimizing the need for intermediate purifications and ensuring environmentally benign metal&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Electronic and Steric Effects in a Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Activation Reaction of 1&#8208;Bromoalkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The functional group compatibility of our recently disclosed gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1&#8208;bromoalkynes is studied in detail. Two main features are addressed, the minimum distances at which polar functional groups are tolerated and the influence of both electronic and steric effects on the performance of aryl ether derivatives. Moreover, robustness assessment experiments have been carried out shedding light on the factors dictating functional group tolerance. In addition, the reaction has been applied to the synthesis of a key intermediate in the total synthesis of a natural product and a heterobifunctional molecule. DFT calculations have shed light on the mechanistic features behind the observed reactivity trends. On one hand, the destabilization of the TS by the proximity of the polar group may hamper the reactivity for proximal functional groups. On the other hand, some polar functional groups are not tolerated regardless of their position due to the preferential coordination of gold to the oxygen atom over the alkyne, resulting presumably in competitive catalyst deactivation pathways.

         <title>A Silica&#8208;Supported Yttrium Triflate Packed Bed Reactor for Continuous Flow Michael Addition of Indoles to Benzylidene Malonates</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
The catalytic properties of packed bed reactors filled with Y(OTf)3 immobilised onto functionalised silica have been tested in the Michael addition of indoles to benzylidene malonates under flow conditions, providing improved productivity over the batch conditions, a greater ease of recovery of the final products and a prolonged life of the catalyst. Noteworthy, the same catalytic reactor, after being used for five days, was employed to perform a different reaction, a stereoselective Diels Alder cycloaddition in flow, with a 24&#8197;times higher productivity compared to the in&#8208;batch reaction.

         <title>FeCl3/KI&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Oxidative Cyclization for Switchable Total Synthesis of Luotonin A, B and Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A total synthesis strategy was developed for the synthesis of luotonin A, B and their analogues using synergistic FeCl3/KI&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization. This protocol utilizes cheap and widely available N&#8208;propargyl 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;quinazolinones and arylamines under mild conditions, and it has a wide substrate scope and high atom economy. Different natural products (luotonin A, B and derivatives) can be synthesized via a unique switchable approach. Further transformations from luotonin B to luotonin E and structural modification of natural products demonstrate the potential applications of this method. Moreover, camptothecin can also be modified with the reported protocol to afford the hydroxyl&#8208;substituted product.

         <title>Weak&#8208;Chelation Assisted Regioselective Indole C(4)&#8208;Alkynylation via Six&#8208;Membered Cobaltacycle Intermediate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein a regioselective indole C4&#8208;alkynylation has been uncovered utilizing an earth&#8208;abundant cobalt(III)&#8208;catalyst. For this process, (bromoethynyl)benzene was used as an alkynylating agent. Also, after screening various amide&#8208;protected chelating groups we found dimethyl&#8208;amide is optimal for the in&#8208;situ generation of cobaltacycle intermediate. The six&#8208;membered cobaltacycle intermediate has been detected through high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry HRMS, which is a key intermediate for this conversion. Further, mechanistic studies were performed such as KIE experiments, and reactions with radical scavengers, and based on the results a plausible mechanism has been proposed. Moreover, to show the application of this methodology, the product has been oxidized to diketone, monoketone, alkene, alkane and further derivatized to a tricycle indole derivative, which is a core structure of many natural products.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein a regioselective indole C4-alkynylation has been uncovered utilizing an earth-abundant cobalt(III)-catalyst. For this process, (bromoethynyl)benzene was used as an alkynylating agent. Also, after screening various amide-protected chelating groups we found dimethyl-amide is optimal for the in-situ generation of cobaltacycle intermediate. The six-membered cobaltacycle intermediate has been detected through high-resolution mass spectrometry HRMS, which is a key intermediate for this conversion. Further, mechanistic studies were performed such as KIE experiments, and reactions with radical scavengers, and based on the results a plausible mechanism has been proposed. Moreover, to show the application of this methodology, the product has been oxidized to diketone, monoketone, alkene, alkane and further derivatized to a tricycle indole derivative, which is a core structure of many natural products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Immobilised Organocatalysts for the Synthesis of Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The art of tuning functional polymeric materials through the covalent incorporation of organocatalysts lies at the core of creating asymmetric immobilized chiral catalysts that mimic the enzymatic action. Herein, we explore diverse synthetic techniques to immobilize l&#8208;proline&#8208;derived N&#8208;carbonyl amides on functional polymeric matrices, transforming them into chiral Lewis bases for facilitating the asymmetric reduction of ketimines with HSiCl3. A comprehensive examination of the design factors, encompassing linker selection, anions, and polymeric support characteristics, enables precise adjustment of steric and electronic features in these immobilized catalysts. This approach establishes structure&#8208;performance relationships, ultimately enabling the development of an engineered immobilized organocatalytic system that meets the desired criteria for activity, stability, and selectivity.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A four&#8208;component acylative fluorination type radical&#8208;dual&#8208;difunctionalization of two different alkenes is developed, assisted by the interaction of silver catalyst and Selectflour. Various &#945;&#8208;ketonic acids can be decarboxylated to form acyl radicals at 35 celsius centigrade, sequentially add to the electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208;rich alkenes to provide the benzyl fluorinated compounds containing diversified functional groups.
