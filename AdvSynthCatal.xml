         <title>Photocatalytic Assembly of Structurally Diverse &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Tertiary Amines Using Benign Nitrogen Donors</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed photocatalytic arylamination and alkylamination of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes using nitriles and oximes as benign nitrogen donors instead of toxic azide reagents, providing a green and mild route to diverse &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl tertiary amines. Only N2 or CO2 are emitted as byproducts. Scalability, broad substrate tolerance and high yields highlight their practicality. The products readily convert to valuable &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl amine derivatives via simple reduction and hydrolysis reaction.

&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl amines are privileged motifs in drug design. Traditional assembly of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl amines relies on harsh conditions and toxic reagents, prompting the demand for milder, atom&#8208;economical methods. While alkene carboamination offers a modular access to diverse amines, the aminative difunctionalization of trifluoromethyl alkenes pose challenges due to facile defluorination. Herein, we report two visible light&#8208;induced protocols for the aminative difunctionalization of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes using benign nitrogen sources&#8212;nitriles and oximes&#8212;instead of prior toxic azides. A photoredox approach leads to the arylamination of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes and radical oxidation, leveraging nitriles to capture benzyl carbocations, while a complementary alkylamination strategy exploits the decarboxylative decomposion of alkyl oxime esters and installs C&#8208; and N&#8208;radicals on the double bond with regiospecificity. These two protocols constitute flexible access to diverse &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl tertiary amines under sustainable conditions. Only N2 or CO2 are emitted as byproducts. Scalability, broad substrate tolerance, and high yields highlight the practicality of this methodology.

         <title>The Novel Strategies for the Construction of Homoallylic Alcohols via Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically summarizes recent advances in the synthesis of valuable homoallylic alcohols via photoredox catalysis. We categorize strategies by catalytic method, analyzing substrate scope, mechanisms, and applications in constructing complex targets. The perspective also highlights future challenges and opportunities in this emerging field, underscoring its potential for mild, efficient, and sustainable synthesis. 

The importance of homoallylic alcohols were reflected in the development of remarkable synthetic strategies and the discovery of novel reactivities that enable access to complex molecular targets. Compared to the traditional pathway, the booming single&#8208;electron transfer pathway has demonstrated remarkable potential for the construction of valuable and otherwise difficult to synthesized homoallylic alcohols. Especially, photoredox catalysis has emerged as a alternative and prospective protocol for the synthesis of homoallylic alcohol via radical pathway owing to mild reaction conditions, lower activation energy, eco&#8208;friendly, and excellent compatibility. Thus, this review systematically summarizes the recent important advances in the synthesis of homoallylic alcohols through photoredox catalysis. It categorizes these advancements according to the distinct catalytic methods, providing a concise analysis of substrate scopes, limitations, and mechanistic explores, as well as their applications in the construction of various functionalized molecules, natural products, pharmaceuticals, or bioactive molecules. Furthermore, key challenges and emerging opportunities are highlighted to guide the development of novel strategies and expand their practical applications.

Sc(OTf)3 and Ambient Air Promote Radical&#8208;Based Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling Reactions: Reactivity of &#945;&#8208;Enaminone toward Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A site&#8208;selective Csp2&#8208;Csp3 cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction is developed for a&#8208;enaminone and donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) in the presence of air and Sc(OTf)3 (30 mol%) through radical pathway, affording tetrahydroquinolinones in good yields with large substrate scope. The utilization of less amount of Sc(OTf)3 (3 mol%) leads to a ring&#8208;opening reaction with good yields and large substrate scope.

A new cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction for tetrahydroquinolinones formation is achieved using &#945;&#8208;enaminones and donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes. Traditional cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions require the presence of a redox&#8208;active metal, and an additional oxidant. This work introduces a new type of catalytic system, which only involves a redox&#8208;inactive rare earth metal and ambient air serving as the oxidant. Mechanistic investigation has revealed a radical pathway for the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative Csp2&#8208;Csp3 coupling reaction and Sc(OTf)3 combined with 3O2 are found to facilitate the critical SET process. When 3 mol% of Sc(OTf)3 is used, &#945;&#8208;enaminone served as nitrogen nucleophile to react with the donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes, resulting in new ring&#8208;opening products. Increasing the catalyst loading to 30 mol%, tetrahydroquinolinones are formed via cross&#8208;dehydrogenative Csp2&#8208;Csp3 coupling reaction. Both reactions give good to excellent yields with broad substrate scopes. Enantiospecific formation of tetrahydroquinolinones is also investigated with high retention of enantiomeric purity (up to 97% ee). The discovery that Sc(OTf)3 and air can promote the formation of &#945;&#8208;enaminone radical and malonic ester radical is unprecedented and is expected to initiate their broad applications in developing novel organic transformations.

         <title>Electrochemical Trifluoromethylchlorosulfonylation of Alkenes via Copper&#8208;Mediated SO2Cl Radical Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports an electrosynthetic method for vicinal trifluoromethylchlorosulfonylation of alkenes using [Cu(MeCN)4]PF6 and triethylamine, without elaborate ligands. The reaction efficiently adds CF3 and SO2Cl across diverse unactivated alkenes with broad functional group tolerance. The resulting sulfonyl chlorides are versatile intermediates, and mechanistic studies support a Cu&#8208;mediated, electrochemically driven SO2Cl radical transfer pathway.

This article describes an electrosynthetic method for vicinal trifluoromethylchlorosulfonylation of alkenes using the readily available copper salt [Cu(MeCN)4]PF6 and triethylamine, without the need for elaborate ligands. This protocol enables efficient and selective addition of CF3 and SO2Cl groups across a wide range of unactivated alkenes with broad functional group tolerance, including pyrrole, furan, thiophene, thioethyl, and silyl substituents. The sulfonyl chloride products can be readily transformed into sulfonamides, sulfonates, sulfonyl fluorides, and thiosulfonates. Mechanistic studies provide evidence in support of an electrochemically driven, Cu&#8208;mediated SO2Cl radical transfer mechanism.

         <title>Merging Single&#8208;Electron Transfer and Strecker Degradation to Access Densely Substituted Pyridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work represents the first example of a [4 + 2] annulation of methyl ketoxime acetates to afford polysubstituted pyridine derivatives. This strategy activates all three substrates, generating imine anions and two different aldehydes through the merging of single electron transfer and Strecker degradation. Mechanism studies reveal that the key &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketimine intermediates, generated in situ from ketoxime acetates and phenylglycine, prevent the homo&#8208; and cross&#8208;merization of two distinct &#945;&#8208;amino acids. Additionally, these intermediates are indispensable for shifting the reaction pathway from [3 + 3] to [4 + 2] annulation of ketoxime acetates.

An I2&#8208;mediated three&#8208;component protocol of readily available ketoxime acetates and two structurally distinct &#945;&#8208;amino acids has been developed, merging single&#8208;electron transfer and Strecker degradation to enable the concise synthesis of densely substituted pyridines. The reaction proceeds via an unprecedented [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] annulation, wherein phenylalanines intercept the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines generated in&#8201;situ from ketoxime acetates and phenylglycines. This process features the simultaneous activation of three substrates, and mild reaction conditions, good functional&#8208;group tolerance.

     alt="Merging Single-Electron Transfer and Strecker Degradation to Access Densely Substituted Pyridines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work represents the first example of a [4 + 2] annulation of methyl ketoxime acetates to afford polysubstituted pyridine derivatives. This strategy activates all three substrates, generating imine anions and two different aldehydes through the merging of single electron transfer and Strecker degradation. Mechanism studies reveal that the key &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated ketimine intermediates, generated in situ from ketoxime acetates and phenylglycine, prevent the homo- and cross-merization of two distinct &#945;-amino acids. Additionally, these intermediates are indispensable for shifting the reaction pathway from [3 + 3] to [4 + 2] annulation of ketoxime acetates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated three-component protocol of readily available ketoxime acetates and two structurally distinct &#945;-amino acids has been developed, merging single-electron transfer and Strecker degradation to enable the concise synthesis of densely substituted pyridines. The reaction proceeds via an unprecedented [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] annulation, wherein phenylalanines intercept the &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated imines generated in&#8201;situ from ketoxime acetates and phenylglycines. This process features the simultaneous activation of three substrates, and mild reaction conditions, good functional-group tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A stereoselective one&#8208;step (3&#8201;+&#8201;3)&#8208;cycloaddition between in&#8201;situ generated pyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;methides and carbonyl ylides has been developed using cooperative rhodium and chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. The reaction affords oxa&#8208;bridged cyclohepta[1,2&#8208;b]pyrroles bearing three stereogenic centers, including two quaternary ones, in high yields and enantioselectivities. This method provides a straightforward synthetic access to complex heterocyclic scaffolds.

This transformation is enabled by a cooperative dual&#8208;catalytic system comprising rhodium(II) acetate and a chiral phosphoric acid, each operating in separate catalytic cycles to generate the key transient intermediates. The reaction delivers structurally complex products bearing three stereogenic centers, two of which are quaternary. Excellent yields, high levels of enantioselectivity, and low to moderate diastereoselectivity are additional key features of this process. This methodology provides a straightforward synthetic access to valuable heterocyclic scaffolds with potential applications in synthetic and medicinal chemistry.

Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer Processes in the Decarboxylative Synthesis of C&#8208;4 Substituted Chroman&#8208;2&#8208;Ones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research presents a new mild photocatalytic method enables C&#8208;4 alkylation of chroman&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives with primary alkyl radicals. This radicals are generated via oxidative PCET process. Developed approach offers broad substrate scope, scalability under photo&#8208;flow conditions, and mechanistic evidence supports a decarboxylation pathway under polar conditions.

Chroman&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives are biologically relevant structures that present interesting pharmacological and biological properties, being the C&#8208;4 alkylated derivatives of particular interest. The methods described in the literature allow the C&#8208;4 functionalization of coumarins with secondary and tertiary alkyl radicals, as well as aryl radicals produced under reductive photocatalytic conditions. Herein, we present a method that allows the introduction of primary alkyl radicals prepared through the oxidative&#8208;PCET ring opening of cycloalkanols under very mild reaction conditions. The method presents a broad scope and can be carried out on a large scale under photo&#8208;flow conditions. Moreover, mechanistic investigations allow the corroboration of decarboxylation under polar conditions.

         <title>Vinyl and Bromo&#8208;Vinyl Sulfoximine Synthesis via Reactive Sulfonimidoyl Bromide Intermediates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, catalyst&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot protocol is reported for direct synthesis of vinyl sulfoximines from alkenes, sulfonamides, and thiophenols under oxidative conditions using DBDMH. The intrinsic reactivity of the in&#8201;situ&#8208;generated sulfonimidoyl bromide intermediates eliminates the need for pre&#8208;functionalized halogenated precursors. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory calculations support a radical mechanism. Substituting alkynes for alkenes produces bromo&#8208;vinyl sulfoximines, which are new compounds with high reactivity and structural tunability, offering a versatile C&#8211;Br handle for derivatization and drug development.

Vinyl sulfoximines are valuable scaffolds in drug discovery and chemical biology, but their widespread use is limited by a lack of synthetic methods. Here, a catalyst&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot protocol is presented for the direct synthesis of vinyl sulfoximines from readily available alkenes, thiols, and nitrogen&#8208;containing substrates such as sulfonamides or amides under oxidative conditions using 1,3&#8208;dibromo&#8208;5,5&#8208;dimethylhydantoin. This transformation proceeds via the in&#8201;situ generation of reactive sulfonimidoyl bromide intermediates, which are previously unused versatile synthons that eliminate the need for pre&#8208;functionalized halogenated precursors. Mechanistic investigations and density functional theory calculations provide support for a single&#8208;electron transfer process between sulfonimidoyl bromide and phenylthiolate. Furthermore, using alkynes instead of alkenes allows the first synthesis of bromo&#8208;vinyl sulfoximines, which are reactive and structurally tunable and have a synthetically versatile C&#8211;Br handle, making them promising candidates for drug discovery applications.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Neutral Organophotocatalytic Cascade: Difluoromethylation and Radical Truce&#8211;Smiles&#8208;Driven C(sp3)&#8211;H Functionalization to Access Benzothiazine Dioxides and Oxindoles</title>

         <dc:description>
This study presents a redox&#8208;neutral organophotocatalytic cascade for difluoromethylation and cyclization, enabling the efficient synthesis of benzothiazine dioxides. Concurrently, a radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement driven by 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) achieves C(sp&#179;)&#8211;H functionalization to furnish oxindoles. The developed metal&#8208;free protocol provides a mild, sustainable, and broadly applicable route to structurally diverse heterocycles with high efficiency.

A new photochemical approach has been developed that enables the simultaneous difluoromethylation and radical cascade cyclization of alkenes, providing rapid and efficient access to structurally intricate 1,2&#8208;benzothiazine dioxide derivatives. Importantly, strategic substrate modification expands the utility of this platform to an unprecedented distal &#8216;Radical Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement&#8217; enabled by a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. This C(sp3)&#8211;H activation pathway overcomes conventional proximity constraints, allowing for the streamlined synthesis of valuable oxindole frameworks with high selectivity. The organophotocatalyst 4DPNIPN catalyzes the transformation and proceeds via a radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism initiated through oxidative luminescence quenching. Remarkably, the reaction operates under redox&#8208;neutral conditions, eliminating the need for transition metals, stoichiometric oxidants, or external additives. This sustainable protocol exhibits broad functional group compatibility, operational simplicity, and scalability.

GA: An unprecedented mechanical&#8208;force&#8208;induced cross&#8208;coupling of aryl diazonium salts with nitroalkenes has been developed under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free ball&#8208;milling conditions, enabling the efficient synthesis of stilbene in useful to good yields.

An unprecedented mechanical&#8208;force&#8208;induced cross&#8208;coupling of aryl diazonium salts with nitroalkenes has been developed under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free ball&#8208;milling conditions. This process utilizes readily available sodium chloride (NaCl) as an efficient activator, enabling the cleavage of the C&#63743;N bond in aryldiazonium salts to generate aryl radicals. These radicals are subsequently trapped by nitroalkenes, leading to the formation of stilbene derivatives. The protocol is notable for its solvent&#8208;free and transition metal&#8208;free synthesis, straightforward operation, broad scope, and exclusive selectivity for the (E)&#8208;configuration of the resulting stilbenes.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Conia&#8208;Ene Reaction of Malonate Derivatives Bearing An Alkyne Moiety by Using a Phosphine&#8211;Borane Ligand</title>

A phosphine&#8211;borane gold complex can catalyze the cycloisomerization of malonates bearing an alkyne moiety. In the case of 2&#8208;(4&#8208;pentynyl)malonate, a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#8208;mode cyclization occurs, while 2&#8208;(3&#8208;butynyl)malonate gives cyclopentenes via a 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig mode cyclization.

A gold&#8208;catalyzed Conia&#8208;ene reaction of malonate derivatives is developed by using a phosphine&#8211;borane ligand. This catalyst system can be applicable not only for 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#8208;mode cyclization reactions but also for 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig&#8208;mode cyclizations. A variety of 2&#8208;(4&#8208;pentynyl)malonates and 2&#8208;(3&#8208;butynyl)malonates afford the corresponding cyclic compounds in moderate to high yields. The boryl enolate might be formed in situ and attacks intramolecularly an alkyne moiety, activated by a gold catalyst, is considered.

         <title>Acridinium Photocatalyzed Monofluoromethyl Radical Cascade Reaction of Alkenes with Iodine(III) Reagent: A Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 19, October 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acridinium salts are effective organic photoredox catalysts with strong oxidizing properties, but their potential as photoreductants in photocatalysis is underexplored. This study investigates their use for the reductive activation of iodine(III) reagent with monofluoroacetoxy ligands, enabling the synthesis of oxindoles and related N&#8208;heterocycles containing monofluoromethyl groups from alkenyl N&#8208;arylamides.

Acridinium salts are well&#8208;known and highly effective organic photoredox catalysts, particularly recognized for their strong oxidizing properties. While they are widely used as photo&#8208;oxidants, their potential as photoreductants, formed easily through interactions with electron donors, has been largely overlooked and underexplored in photocatalysis. In this study, the application of an acridinium salt as a photocatalyst for the reductive activation of iodine(III) reagent containing monofluoroacetoxy ligands is described. This process allows for the synthesis of oxindoles and related N&#8208;heterocycles with monofluoromethyl groups, starting from alkenyl N&#8208;arylamides. Detailed mechanistic studies are conducted to gain insight into the in&#8201;situ formation of the active acridine radical species, catalyst species interconversion, and the photocatalytic mechanism underlying the monofluoromethyl radical cascade reaction of alkenyl N&#8208;arylamides. A wide range of mechanistic tools is employed, including radical trapping experiments, UV&#8211;Vis absorption spectroscopy, time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence quenching experiments, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations. The synthetic utility of this protocol is demonstrated through a substrate scope study, which highlights the efficient access to oxindoles and other polycyclic heterocycles featuring monofluoromethyl units which are widely recognized for their biological significance.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Haloaminative Cyclization of Aminoallenes via C&#63743;N Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 19, October 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;catalyzed haloaminative cyclization of tertiary amine&#8208;tethered allenes with electrophilic halogen sources via C&#63743;N bond activation is reported, which provides rapid access to halogenated N&#8208;heterocycles. The formation of quaternary ammonium salt is identified as key intermediate for the benzylic C&#63743;N bond cleavage.

The selective cleavage and efficient transformation of C&#63743;N bonds in tertiary amines remain a significant challenge due to their high bond dissociation energy and inherent stability. Herein, an iron&#8208;catalyzed haloaminative cyclization of tertiary amine&#8208;tethered allenes with electrophilic halogen sources is reported, in which the benzylic C&#63743;N bond is selectively broken by the in&#8201;situ formation of quaternary ammonium salts. This method features concise reaction protocols, broad substrate scopes, enabling the rapid acquisition of diverse N&#8208;heterocyclic derivatives containing the vinyl halide moieties. What's more, the presence of vinyl halide groups facilitates late&#8208;stage diversification through a series of downstream cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Mechanocatalytic Reduction of Nitro Compounds with Hydrogen Gas and its Application in the Synthesis of Drugs and their Intermediates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 19, October 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical reduction of nitro compounds using hydrogen gas is presented. In addition to enabling the synthesis of a variety of functionalized aniline derivatives, the method has been scaled up to gram quantities, evaluated for trace metal impurities, and applied to the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds and their precursors.

A solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical method for the catalytic hydrogenation of nitro compounds is reported, requiring only the substrate, low catalyst loading, and molecular hydrogen. The approach avoids the use of additional base additives or solvents for liquid&#8208;assisted grinding. The transformation proceeds under mild conditions using palladium on carbon and hydrogen gas in pressurizable stainless steel jars operated in a planetary ball mill. A variety of functionalized nitro compounds are converted to the corresponding anilines and amines in good to excellent yields. The method displays chemoselectivity, tolerating functional groups such as halogens, benzylic ketones, and nitriles. In addition, scale&#8208;up to multigram quantities is achieved, and an analysis of trace metal impurities from abrasion revealed only minor concentrations, all below the limits established by ICH guidelines. The protocol's practicality is demonstrated by synthesizing intermediates and active ingredients used in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. To quantify the sustainability of the protocol, green metrics are calculated and compared with those of other mechanochemical and solution&#8208;phase nitro compound reduction methods.

The photochemical approach for [4+2] annulation of 1,6&#8208;dieneynes to 3,4&#8208;disubstituted fluorenones via triplet states by energy transfer (EnT) process under visible light irradiation is presented. These EnT process and radical pathway process are confirmed by Stern&#8211;Volmer experiments, and radical scavenging studies to understand the reaction mechanism. This mild photochemical methodology showed high functional group tolerance and high atom economy.

The method of photochemical [4+2] annulation of triplet states 1,6&#8208;dieneynes to fluorenones via energy transfer (EnT) process under visible light irradiation is introduced. The EnT process between rose bengal and substrate is well supported by Stern&#8211;Volmer experiments. Control experiments and radical scavenging studies are well supported to rationale the reaction mechanism. This protocol showed high functional group tolerance and high atom economy.

         <title>Ligand Controlled Regio&#8208;Divergent [2+2+2] Cyclotrimerization of Alkynes by Merging Electrochemistry and Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 19, October 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By merging electrochemistry and Ni catalysis, we developed the ligand controlled regio&#8208;divergent [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of alkynes, and tributylphosphine, sterically hindered bipyridine or &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands generated 1,2,4&#8208; and 1,3,5&#8208;substituted aromatics with high regioselectivities respectively. Besides, the semi&#8208;intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between diynes and alkynes are also amenable under this catalytic system, demonstrating the broad applicability of the synthetic method.

Transition metal catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions between three alkynes, a diyne and an alkyne, or a triyne offer a straightforward and typical protocol toward all kinds of polysubstituted benzens. Herein, the synthesis of polysubstituted aromatics through electrochemical nickel catalyzed cyclotrimerization of alkynes is developed. The regio&#8208;divergent cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes is achieved by judicious choice of ligands, and tributylphosphine, sterically hindered bipyridine, or &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands delivered 1,2,4&#8208; and 1,3,5&#8208;substituted aromatics with high regioselectivities, respectively. Besides, the semi&#8208;intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between diynes and alkynes are also amenable under this catalytic system. This approach operates without metal reductant, exhibits wide functional groups tolerance, ease of scalability, and furnishes 75 examples with moderate to good yields, including some biorelevant compounds. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory calculation reveal the catalytic pathways of 1,3,5&#8208; and 1,2,4&#8208;cyclotrimerizations, and the origin of the ligand controlled regioselectivity.

A highly efficient gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cycloisomerization of readily available 1,6&#8208;oxygenated enynes, enabling direct access to valuable 3&#8208;oxabicyclo[4.1.0]hept&#8208;4&#8208;ene scaffolds with excellent enantiomeric excesses (up to &gt;99% ee, 35 derivatives), in the presence of a chiral cationic Au(I) catalyst ((S)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;MeOBIPHEP(AuCl)2 /AgOTf system) in toluene is described. The resulting chiral bicyclic ethers serve as versatile intermediates for the synthesis of novel hedonic derivatives.

A highly efficient gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cycloisomerization of readily available 1,6&#8208;oxygenated enynes is reported, enabling direct access to valuable 3&#8208;oxabicyclo[4.1.0]hept&#8208;4&#8208;ene scaffolds with excellent enantiomeric excesses (up to&#8201;&gt;99% ee, 35 derivatives), in the presence of a chiral cationic Au(I) catalyst ((S)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;MeOBIPHEP(AuCl)2 /AgOTf system) in toluene. This methodology uniquely combines high stereoselectivity with good to excellent yields for volatile substrates that have been challenging derivatives in the asymmetric cycloisomerization community. Notably, the resulting chiral bicyclic ethers serve as versatile intermediates for the synthesis of novel hedonic derivatives. A systematic investigation of their odor profiles reveals remarkable differences between enantiomers, demonstrating the profound impact of molecular chirality on olfactory perception.

A systematic investigation of their odor profiles reveals remarkable differences between enantiomers, demonstrating the profound impact of molecular chirality on olfactory perception.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Cyclic ethers are prevalent structural motifs in natural products and pharmaceuticals, and their efficient synthesis has attracted significant attention in organic chemistry. An approach for the functionalization of cyclic ethers via gold&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization and rearrangement is developed. This transformation enabled the synthesis of C&#8208;glycoside derivatives from alkynyl compounds bearing O&#8208;glycosides.

Cyclic ethers are prevalent structural motifs in natural products and pharmaceuticals, and their efficient synthesis has attracted significant attention in organic synthesis. A synthetic approach for the functionalization of cyclic ethers from ortho&#8208;alkynylarylmethanol derivatives protected by cyclic ethers via gold&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization and rearrangement is developed. The gold&#8208;catalyzed 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization yielded various functionalized cyclic ethers. Furthermore, this transformation enabled the synthesis of C&#8208;glycoside derivatives from alkynyl compounds bearing O&#8208;glycosides.

         <title>Photoredox/Nickel Dual Catalytic C(sp2)&#63743;S Cross&#8208;coupling of Bromoanilines Enabled by Mineral Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 19, October 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mineral acids promote nickel&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#63743;S cross&#8208;coupling of bromoanilines and related amine&#8208;containing electrophiles with thiols by protonating free amines, thereby facilitating oxidative addition. Acid additives also suppress polythiolate formation, enhance the accessibility of nickel catalysts, and reduce inner filter effects during photocatalysis, eliminating the need for protection&#8211;deprotection steps.

Cross&#8208;coupling reactions are essential tools in modern organic synthesis, enabling the formation of carbon&#63743;heteroatom (C&#63743;X) bonds. Despite significant advancements in method development, particularly with palladium, copper, and nickel catalysis, including recent progress in photoredox catalysis, their efficiency is often limited when sensitive functional groups, such as thiols and amines, are present in the nucleophile or electrophile, and typically requires extensive protection&#8211;deprotection strategies. Herein, a practical synthetic approach is reported that employs mineral acids as unconventional reagents to facilitate C(sp2)&#63743;S cross&#8208;coupling between bromoanilines (or other electrophiles bearing free primary amines as functional groups) and thiols, thereby eliminating the need for protecting group manipulations. Additionally, protonation alters the electronic influence of the aniline moiety, transforming it from an electron&#8208;donating to an electron&#8208;withdrawing group, which promotes oxidative addition, and the acidic medium suppresses polythiolate formation, enhancing nickel catalysts&#8217; accessibility and reducing inner filter effects in photocatalysis. This strategy enables efficient and high&#8208;yielding synthesis of amino thioethers across a broad substrate scope, underscoring the value of acid&#8208;assisted cross&#8208;coupling as a streamlined and robust photoredox methodology for C(sp2)&#63743;S bond formation.

Sustainable Photoelectrochemical Geminal &#945;&#8208;Fluorosulfenylation of Diazo Compounds through Carbene Radical Anion Intermediate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 19, October 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A milder photoelectrochemical method is presented for obtaining a wide range of &#945;&#8208;fluorosulfenyl derivatives from readily available thiol and diazo compounds. Several mechanistic studies reveal the synergistic role of photochemistry and electrochemistry in generating carbene radical anion at the cathode.

&#945;&#8208;Fluorosulfenyl compounds are privileged building blocks found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. While the geminal difunctionalization of diazo compounds with two different nucleophiles under mild and sustainable conditions can be envisioned as a versatile method for constructing &#945;&#8208;fluorosulfinyl molecules, it remains a significant unmet challenge. Herein, geminal &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difunctionalization of diazo compounds by merging sustainable photo&#8208; and electrocatalysis is presented. A wide range of &#945;&#8208;fluorosulfinyl products are synthesized using commercial ionic liquid as a fluorine source with moderate to good yields and excellent selectivities. Several experiments are performed to detail the reaction mechanism and elucidate the cooperativity of photo&#8208; and electrocatalysis in facilitating the reaction under milder, safe, and green conditions.

         <title>Diboron Reagents in Modern Reduction Chemistry: A Versatile Tool for Reduction of Various Functional Groups</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 19, October 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of diboron compounds as new greener reducing agents in organic synthesis. It will cover their unique properties, mechanisms of action, and versatility in reducing various functional groups, such as carbonyls, nitro groups, alkenes, and alkynes. By highlighting their advantages over traditional hydride&#8208;based reagents and catalytic hydrogenation, the review emphasizes their role in advancing sustainable and safe chemical practices. Additionally, practical guidelines for employing diboron compounds in laboratory and industrial settings will be included, along with comparisons to alternative methodologies. This review intends to serve as an educational and practical resource for chemists, researchers, and industries adopting greener reduction strategies.

Reduction of various organic functionality including aldehyde, ketone, nitro, imine, and alkyne has gained noteworthy attention due to its vast application of products in organic transformation reactions. To attempt hydrogenation several approaches have been reported by using molecular hydrogen as a reducing source. Besides, this diboron (tetrahydroxy diboron, bispinacolato diboron, neoglycolato diboron) has shown a promising and alternative approach for the reduction of the reducible functional group without using any molecular hydrogen. The ligand&#8208;free reduction approach of commercially available diboron reduces the organic compound by using water or organic solvent and metal salt making it an attractive protocol in the recent era of reduction as well as hydrogenation. Herein, we provide an extensive and collective overview of the diboron&#8208;mediated reduction approach of various organic compounds.

         <title>Recent Advances in Synthesis of Covalent Triazine Frameworks: Methods, Mechanism, and Crystallization Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 19, October 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Common manufacturing methods and synthesis mechanisms of covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are introduced, as well as the ways to improve the crystallinity of CTFs. Additionally, prospects for the future development of synthetic CTFs are discussed and are anticipated to offer a viable research direction for CTFs.

Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are a class of nitrogen&#8208;heterocyclic covalent organic framework materials based on the triazine ring. They show promising applications in catalysis, gas adsorption, and energy storage thanks to their high specific surface area, designable pore structure, and excellent physicochemical properties. Although a series of synthetic methods have been proposed, the complexity of their synthetic pathways, the challenge of regulating crystallinity, and the ambiguity of the reaction mechanism limit the precise design and performance optimization of these materials. A comprehensive understanding of the numerous synthesis methodologies is pivotal for rational modulation of its structure and performance, as well as for understanding the synthesis mechanism and crystallization effects. Herein, the common manufacturing methods of CTFs are systematically outlined. Additionally, the synthesis mechanisms and ways to improve the crystallinity of CTFs are also covered. Finally, some prospects for the future development of synthetic CTF materials are discussed. This critical review is anticipated to offer a viable research direction for CTFs.

This review highlights recent advances in the cyclization chemistry of N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts and their derivatives, with a particular focus on transition&#8208;metal catalyzed, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free systems and visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced transformations. The scope, limitations, and synthetic applications of various cyclization strategies are critically discussed, aiming to reveal the innovative potential of N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts as nitrogen&#8208;based precursors in synthetic chemistry.

N&#8208;Aminopyridinium salts are readily available and bench&#8208;stable nitrogen&#8208;containing precursors that have demonstrated broad synthetic utility in diverse cyclization reactions. As practical 1,3&#8208;dipoles, N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts can engage with dipolarophiles in cycloaddition reactions to construct nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. Moreover, as a class of novel aminating or bifunctional aminating reagents, they are capable of generating nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals under visible&#8208;light irradiation, which can initiate amination&#8208;cyclization processes. In recent years, cyclization strategies involving N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts have made remarkable progress and garnered significant attention.

         <title>Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two structurally analogous COF photocatalysts of TP&#8208;DADB COF and TP&#8208;TFMB COF with incorporating &#63743;CF3 in the latter is constructed. The introduction of &#63743;CF3 promotes the separation of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs and improves the band structure to enable simultaneous oxygen reduction and water oxidization reactions to produce H2O2. Thereby, TP&#8208;TFMB COF exhibits a 16&#8208;times higher H2O2 production rate than TP&#8208;DADB COF.

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising photocatalysts for the photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, the photocatalytic activity over COFs in pure water is limited due to poor carrier dynamics as well as sluggish oxygen reduction and water oxidation reactions. Herein, two &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COF photocatalysts is designed via solvothermal Schiff&#8208;base condensation: TP&#8208;TFMB COF (with the trifluoromethyl group modification) and TP&#8208;DADB COF (pristine COF). In pure water, TP&#8208;TFMB COF delivers an excellent H2O2 production with a yield rate of 3.83 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 (16 folds higher than that of TP&#8208;DADB COF) under visible&#8208;light irradiation. As demonstrated by experimental results, the superior photocatalytic performance of TP&#8208;TFMB COF stems from the introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing &#63743;CF3 groups, which simultaneously improve charge separation and promoted &#8226;O2&#8722; generation in oxygen reduction as well as critically boost water oxidation. This work provides the insight into the effect of the electron&#8208;withdrawing group on photocatalytic activity for H2O2 generation over COFs and may enlighten the design of catalysts for H2O2 photosynthesis.

         <title>A Mild and Efficient Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Method for Aldimine Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, efficient, and broadly applicable iridium&#8208;catalyzed method for aldimine hydrogenation, facilitating access to an array of corresponding amine products in high isolated yields is reported. The developed methodology employs a bidentate iridium&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphine complex for use at low catalyst loadings, and proceeds under an atmospheric pressure of hydrogen gas, offering a scalable and sustainable route to valuble amine compounds.

A mild and applicable protocol for aldimine hydrogenation has been developed using a bidentate iridium&#8208;N&#8208;hetrocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphine catalyst. Through a series of optimization studies, twenty&#8208;nine aldimine substrates have been successfully reduced to their corresponding amines in high isolated yields up to 99%. The developed methodology employs a low catalyst loading of just 1 mol% and proceeds under mild conditions, including under an atmospheric pressure of hydrogen gas. The process benefits from a broad solvent applicability, including notable green solvents, and tolerates aldimine substrates of varying solubility. Alongside, N&#8208;aryl&#8208;based aldimine substrates, the general protocol also accomodates more challenging N&#8208;alkyl species without the requirement of any further additive. From a mechanistic perspective, density functional theory calculations have been utilized to examine the formation, and subsequent reaction, of a crucial iridacycle intermediate, while also revealing that the C&#63743;H activation step is key for successful imine reduction. This mechanistic insight is then used to significantly elevate the performance of two poorer performing substrates.

         <title>Halogen Atom Transfer Enabled Radical Fluoroalkyl&#8208;Thiolation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an aryl radical&#8208;induced three&#8208;component fluoroalkyl&#8208;thiolation of unactivated olefins is reported through halogen atom transfer process, enabling rapid simultaneous construction of C(sp3)&#63743;Rf and C(sp3)&#63743;S bonds with high regioselectivity. Similarly, direct thiolation of fluoroalkyl iodides in the absence of alkenes affords the fluoroalkylthioethers.

A halogen atom transfer&#8208;enabled radical fluoroalkyl&#8208;thiolation of unactivated alkenes is developed employing fluoroalkyl iodides, TMEDA&#8208;ligated zinc thiolates. Notably, the aryldiazonium salts are utilized as the promoter in the three&#8208;component reaction, providing a powerful tool for simultaneous construction of C&#63743;Rf and C&#63743;S bonds across the C&#63742;C bond. Moreover, direct thiolation of fluoroalkyl iodides without alkene gives the two&#8208;component reaction products. Mechanistic studies support that the interaction between diazonium salt and zinc thiolate plays a crucial role in the transformations.

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Rf and C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;S bonds with high regioselectivity. Similarly, direct thiolation of fluoroalkyl iodides in the absence of alkenes affords the fluoroalkylthioethers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A halogen atom transfer-enabled radical fluoroalkyl-thiolation of unactivated alkenes is developed employing fluoroalkyl iodides, TMEDA-ligated zinc thiolates. Notably, the aryldiazonium salts are utilized as the promoter in the three-component reaction, providing a powerful tool for simultaneous construction of C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Rf and C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;S bonds across the C&#63742;C bond. Moreover, direct thiolation of fluoroalkyl iodides without alkene gives the two-component reaction products. Mechanistic studies support that the interaction between diazonium salt and zinc thiolate plays a crucial role in the transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Confined Pd Nanocatalysts: Tailoring Adsorption Geometry for Enhanced Selectivity in Sustainable Alkylphenol Synthesis via Ketone Hydrodeoxygenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;confined Pd/C&#8208;DMA nanocatalyst enables sustainable synthesis of alkylphenols via selective ketone hydrodeoxygenation. Its polymer layer creates a confinement effect, enforcing a specific end&#8208;on adsorption geometry. This suppresses side reactions and achieves outstanding selectivity (&gt;96%) under mild conditions.

The development of sustainable synthetic routes to access valuable alkylphenols is hampered by the poor selectivity, harsh conditions, and waste associated with traditional methods. Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of readily available aromatic ketones offers a potentially greener alternative, but achieving high chemoselectivity under mild conditions remains challenging. Herein, a simple yet effective strategy is reported employing a polymer&#8208;modified palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst, functionalized with dimethylamine (DMA) polymer chains (Pd/C&#8208;DMA), for the highly efficient and selective HDO of aromatic ketones. This catalyst achieves outstanding selectivity (up to 96.6%) toward alkylphenols with complete conversion under remarkably mild conditions (80 &#176;C, 5&#8201;bar H2), significantly surpassing unmodified Pd/C and representing a substantial improvement in process greenness. Mechanistic insights reveal that the DMA polymer layer creates a confined microenvironment on the catalyst surface. This confinement effect, through steric constraints and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, enforces a specific end&#8208;on adsorption geometry for the ketone substrate, suppressing undesired side reactions like arene ring hydrogenation. The Pd/C&#8208;DMA catalyst demonstrates broad substrate compatibility (&gt;95% yields for diverse ketones) and facilitates the scalable synthesis of valuable intermediates, offering a robust and sustainable platform for alkylphenol production.

         <title>Cleaner Production of Acetals/Ketals Using a Phosphorus&#8208;Doped Biomass&#8208;Based Carbon Catalyst via Acetalization Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of novel phosphorus&#8208;doped carbon catalysts is carried out for the acetalization of aldehydes and ketones toward acetals and ketals under mild conditions (60 &#176;C, atmospheric pressure). This catalyst, showing high conversion (87.1%) and selectivity (&gt;99.9%), offers an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional methods. The work highlights the crucial role of P&#8208;doping in modulating the acid properties of the catalyst for enhanced performance.

The transformation of aldehydes and ketones into acetals and ketals has garnered significant attention due to their wide applications as fragrances, bio&#8208;oil additives, and organic synthetic intermediates. Conventional acetalization methods, however, often rely on corrosive acids or stoichiometric additives, necessitating harsh conditions and increasing production costs. Here, the development of a phosphorus&#8208;doped carbon catalyst is presented, that enables the acetalization of aldehydes and ketones into acetals and ketals under mild conditions (e.g., 60 &#176;C, atmospheric pressure). This catalyst achieves a high yield of 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (87.1%) from benzaldehyde and exhibits exceptional stability, operating continuously for 120&#8201;h in a continuous fixed&#8208;bed reactor. In the continuous reaction, the yield of 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane remains over 96% in the first 18&#8201;h and slightly decreases to 86% after 120&#8201; h of continuous operation. Comprehensive physicochemical characterizations reveal that phosphorus acts as a Lewis acid sites and plays a critical role in modulating the Lewis acid sites of the PC catalysts. This work highlights the significance of optimizing acid properties for the efficient acetalization reaction, offering a promising approach to sustainable chemical synthesis.

This catalyst achieves a high yield of 2-phenyl-1,3-dioxolane (87.1%) from benzaldehyde and exhibits exceptional stability, operating continuously for 120&#8201;h in a continuous fixed-bed reactor. In the continuous reaction, the yield of 2-phenyl-1,3-dioxolane remains over 96% in the first 18&#8201;h and slightly decreases to 86% after 120&#8201; h of continuous operation. Comprehensive physicochemical characterizations reveal that phosphorus acts as a Lewis acid sites and plays a critical role in modulating the Lewis acid sites of the PC catalysts. This work highlights the significance of optimizing acid properties for the efficient acetalization reaction, offering a promising approach to sustainable chemical synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbocations generated through electrochemical Hofer&#8208;Moest pathways can be trapped by diverse nucleophiles or undergo elimination to form alkenes, significantly expanding synthetic versatility. This review systematically surveys advances in electrochemical Hofer&#8208;Moest reactions since 2019, categorizing transformations by bond&#8208;forming events. The review concludes by highlighting key challenges and proposing strategic research directions in this rapidly evolving field.

In contrast to radical&#8208;mediated electrochemical decarboxylative couplings, electrochemical decarboxylative functionalizations proceeding through carbocation intermediates (Hofer&#8208;Moest pathway) unlock unique reactivity and selectivity. These in&#8201;situ&#8208;generated carbocations can be trapped by diverse nucleophiles or undergo elimination to form alkenes, significantly expanding synthetic versatility. This review systematically surveys advances in electrochemical Hofer&#8208;Moest&#8208;type reactions since 2019, categorizing transformations by bond&#8208;forming events (C&#63743;N, C&#63743;O, C&#63743;P, C&#63743;F, C&#63743;C, and C&#63742;C). Beyond summarizing key breakthroughs, it also provide balanced evaluation of current limitations to delineate the scope and applicability of these methods. Finally, persistent challenges are outlined and future research directions in this emerging field is proposed.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Controlled C&#8211;H Cyanation or Thiocyanation of Indolizines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced method for the C&#8211;H cyanation/thiocyanation of indolizine derivatives has been developed by using NH4SCN as the cyano or thiocyano source.

An efficient and controlled approach for C&#8211;H cyanation/thiocyanation of indolizines is reported under visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced conditions. NH4SCN is used as the cyano or thiocyano source and the presence or absence of H2O2 are found to be the key factor in the selective construction of C&#8208;3 cyano or thiocyano indolizines. A set of control experiments, such as radical trapping experiments and fluorescence quenching studies are conducted to assess mechanistic insights of the reaction.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Azide&#8208;Selenoalkyne Cycloadditions: A Combined Synthetic&#8211;Computational Study into Reaction Scope, Mechanism, and Origins of Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (RuAAC) reaction is reported for the synthesis of selenium&#8208;substituted triazole products. Reaction regioselectivity is dependent on the identity of the non&#8208;selenium substituent of the alkyne, which challenges the perceived understanding of RuAAC regioselectivity. Computational modeling has accurately reproduced the experimental results and provided insights into the origins of regioselectivity.

A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (RuAAC) reaction involving selenoalkynes is reported for the synthesis of selenium&#8208;substituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazole products (26 examples, up to 89% yield). The reaction works well with a wide range of alkyl and aryl azides bearing both electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing groups. This contrasts RuAAC reactions using regular terminal and internal alkynes, where aryl azides bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups are not generally tolerated. The regioselectivity of the cycloaddition is highly dependent on the identity of the non&#8208;selenium substituent of the alkyne. This challenges earlier reports on RuAAC reactions involving thioalkynes and questions the perceived understanding of the regioselectivity of these reactions. Computational modeling of the reaction profiles for four alkyne substrates that provided contrasting regioselectivities accurately reproduces the experimental results. The observed regioselectivity is primarily attributed to the relative nucleophilicity of the alkyne carbons upon coordination to ruthenium and an approach is proposed in which reaction regioselectivity may be predicted.

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation on an NHC&#8208;Catalyzed [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] Annulation of 2&#8208;Bromoenals with &#946;&#8208;Oxodithioester: Mechanism, Origins of Stereoselectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism and origin of selectivities of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] annulation reaction have been systematically investigated using density functional theory method. The key roles of Lewis acid are also elucidated through the solvent&#8211;solute interaction model.

An increasing number of studies have demonstrated the cooperative use of chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and Lewis acid to enhance catalytic efficiency in stereoselective annulation reactions. Herein, molecular&#8208;level insights into the NHC&#8208;catalyzed [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] annulation of 2&#8208;bromoenals with &#946;&#8208;oxodithioester are elucidated through density functional theory calculations. The reaction proceeds via multiple key steps: formation of the Breslow intermediate, C&#63743;Br bond cleavage, &#945;&#8208;protonation generating &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acylazolium, stereoselective Si&#8208;face addition between the acylazolium and LiCl&#8208;coordinated &#946;&#8208;oxodithioester, intramolecular proton transfer, and catalyst regeneration. The stereoselectivity&#8208;determining C&#63743;C bond formation step exhibits enhanced facial control through cooperative effects. Noncovalent interaction (NCI) and atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules analyses reveal that hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, LP&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;, and O&#183;&#183;&#183;S interactions preferentially stabilize the RS&#8208;configured isomer. Notably, LiCl plays dual roles: (1) it amplifies stereocontrol by facilitating multiple NCIs during the C&#63743;C bond formation, and (2) reduces transition&#8208;state polarity through solvent&#8211;solute interactions, thereby lowering the activation barrier. The work deepens the understanding of how Lewis acid additive modulate both electronic and steric landscapes in NHC catalysis, offering valuable insights for stereocontrolled annulation reactions.

         <title>Recent Advances in Terminal Alkyne&#8208;Involved Alkynylation and Alkynylation&#8208;Triggered Tandem Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted internal alkynes are one of the most important functional groups in organic chemistry, with broad applications ranging from biochemistry to material science, medicinal chemistry, and pharmaceutical research. Much effort has been made to explore efficient methodologies to introduce an alkyne moiety into molecules. Among alkynylation reagents, terminal alkynes are considered to be the ideal reagent compared to other substrates like halogenated alkynes and alkynyl hypervalent iodine since it avoids multistep synthesis of these substrates from terminal alkynes to meet the atom&#8208;economy criteria. In this review, we summarized recent achievements in the application of terminal alkynes for the alkynylation to afford substituted internal alkynes and alkynylation&#8208;triggered tandem reactions to yield carbo&#8208; and heterocycles, which exist abundantly in the nature as synthetic drugs, biologically active natural and non&#8208;natural products.

In this review, we summarized recent achievements in the application of terminal alkynes for the alkynylation to afford substituted internal alkynes and alkynylation-triggered tandem reactions to yield carbo- and heterocycles, which exist abundantly in the nature as synthetic drugs, biologically active natural and non-natural products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Substituted internal alkynes are one of the most important functional groups in organic chemistry, with broad applications ranging from biochemistry to material science, medicinal chemistry, and pharmaceutical research. Much effort has been made to explore efficient methodologies to introduce an alkyne moiety into molecules. Among alkynylation reagents, terminal alkynes are considered to be the ideal one compared to other substrates like halogenated alkynes and alkynyl hypervalent iodine since it avoids multistep synthesis of these substrates from terminal alkynes to meet the atom-economy criteria. In this review, we summarized recent achievements (from 2020 to 2025) in the application of terminal alkynes for the alkynylation to afford substituted internal alkynes and alkynylation-triggered tandem reactions to yield carbo- and heterocycles, which exist abundantly in nature as synthetic drugs and biologically active natural and non-natural products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advancements in transition metal catalysis have enabled efficient strategies for constructing C&#8211;S bonds via olefin functionalization. This review summarizes recent developments in hydrothiolation, carbothiolation, and related sulfonylative transformations, with an emphasis on chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selective synthesis of complex sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Mechanistic insights, current challenges, and future research directions are also discussed. 

The development of efficient and selective strategies for constructing C&#63743;S bonds has garnered significant attention in organic and medicinal chemistry, owing to the widespread presence of this linkage in biologically active molecules, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional materials. Among the various approaches, alkene thiolation and sulfonylation stand out as one of the most straightforward methods for organosulfur synthesis, enabling the direct introduction of sulfur&#8208;containing functionalities into unsaturated hydrocarbons. This review provides a comprehensive summary of recent advances (2013&#8211;present) in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;S bond formation via alkene thiolation and sulfonylation. We systematically discuss the synthetic methodologies, including transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrothiolation, carbothiolation, hydrosulfonylation, and carbosulfonylation, highlighting their respective substrate scope, chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, enantioselectivity, and reaction mechanisms. By consolidating the latest developments and critical perspectives, this review aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers, encouraging further exploration and innovation in this dynamic field. The continued evolution of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;S bond formation is expected to unlock new opportunities in drug discovery, materials science, and synthetic methodology.

         <title>Monofluorinated C1 Synthon Strategy for the Construction of Fluoromethylene&#8208;Linked Bicyclo[1.1.1]Pentane Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An additive&#8208;free photochemical atom&#8208;transfer radical addition of fluoroiodomethyl sulfoxide to [1.1.1]propellane provides fluoromethyl&#8208;bicyclopentane sulfonium reagents, enabling nucleophilic substitution under mild conditions.

Fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) have emerged as an attractive scaffold in drug discovery. Herein, the modular construction of fluoromethyl&#8208;linked BCPs is reported. Fluoroiodomethyl phenyl sulfoxide is found to be a synthetic equivalent of a formal fluoromethylene radical cation synthon, which, under metal&#8208;free conditions and violet light irradiation (400&#8201;nm), enables an atom&#8208;transfer radical addition reaction to [1.1.1]propellane. This straightforward approach provides access to novel bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;substituted fluoromethyl sulfonium reagents. The electrophilic properties of these sulfonium salts allow nucleophilic displacement under mild conditions, enabling the introduction of the fluoromethyl bicyclopentyl group into diverse natural products and drug molecules with good functional group tolerance.

         <title>Installation of Trifluoromethylated Quaternary Carbon Stereocenters via Asymmetric Epoxidation of Tetrasubstituted Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic enantioselective epoxidation of acyclic tetrasubstituted alkenes, bearing a trifluoromethyl group, is reported. In the presence of Takemoto's thiourea organocatalyst and tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide, epoxides are obtained with excellent yield and good to high enantioselectivity. Computational studies provide insights into the reaction mechanism and stereocontrol. Densely functionalized trifluoromethylated compounds, bearing two vicinal quaternary stereocenters, are obtainable via epoxide derivatization.

The construction of vicinal quaternary carbon centers via epoxidation of tetrasubstituted alkenes remains a formidable challenge in asymmetric synthesis. Herein, a first catalytic enantioselective epoxidation of acyclic tetrasubstituted alkenes is reported, prepared through the Knoevenagel condensation of trifluoromethyl ketones with malononitrile. (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;configured epoxides are obtained in generally excellent yields (up to 98%) and with good to high enantioselectivities (up to 89% ee), employing a commercially available system, comprising Takemoto's catalysts and tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP). Highly reactive new tetrasubtituted alkenes allow the first successful use of Takemoto's catalyst under oxidative conditions. Interestingly, density functional theory studies show that TBHP is exclusively activated by the amino thiourea, with halogen&#8208;bonding interactions playing a critical role in affecting the stereochemical outcome of the epoxidation. Derivatizations provide access to densely functionalized trifluoromethylated compounds, featuring one or two vicinal carbon quaternary stereocenters, with the second center being introduced in a highly stereoselective manner.

A P4S10&#8208;promoted [5+1] spiroannulation of 2&#8208;(2&#8208; nitrophenyl) indoles with cyclic ketones for the preparation of spirocyclic tetrahydrocarbolines is developed. This transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free approach provides an efficient and practical pathway toward structurally valuable spirocyclic tetrahydrocarbolines.

An NH4I&#8208;promoted three&#8208;component cascade cyclization reaction for the modular synthesis of maleimide&#8208;fused benzocarbazoles and maleimide&#8208;fused indoles has been developed. The present approach starts from readily available indoles/pyrroles, cyclohexanones, and maleimides, affording variety of maleimide&#8208;fused benzocarbazoles and maleimide&#8208;fused indoles in 40&#8211;83% yields under metal&#8208;free conditions.

The photocatalytic radical tandem reaction of amines and olefins is disclosed for THQS synthesis under mild conditions. A variety of tetrahydroquinoline derivatives are acquired with high diastereoselectivity and broad substrate scope.

Herein, the intermolecular radical tandem reaction of tertiary aniline and olefin promoted by benzophenone, which acts as a photosensitizer to accelerate single&#8208;electron transfer, hydrogen atom transfer, and &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical formation is reported. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, exhibits a broad substrate tolerance and high diastereoselectivity, as well as confirms that hydrogen gas is produced in the reaction system, providing a convenient and efficient method for the synthesis of tetrahydroquinoline derivatives.

Herein, a one&#8208;pot tandem [4+4] annulation of 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;N&#8208;arylbenzenesulfonamides with 2&#8208;methylidenetrimethylene carbonates is developed, providing the functionalized benzoxathiazocines in good to excellent yields. Some enantioenriched products with C&#8211;N axial chirality are also obtained. In addition, the synthesized compounds show promising anticancer activity against Hela cells, indicating potential for drug screening.

In this article, a Pd(0)/ NaH&#8208;mediated [4&#8201;+&#8201;4] cascade annulation reaction of 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;N&#8208;arylbenzenesulfonamides and 2&#8208;methylidenetrimethylene carbonate is developed, providing the benzo[b][1,4,5]oxathiazocine&#8208;1,1&#8208;dioxides in generally excellent yields (71&#8722;95%), and some of the enantioenriched products featuring C&#8211;N axial chirality are also achieved (up to 88% yield and 60% ee) under mild conditions. Moreover, the synthesized compounds exhibit promising anticancer activity against human cancer cell lines Hela (cervical cancer), highlighting their potential applications for drug screening.

         <title>Photoinduced Sequential Hydrogen and Halogen Atom Transfer for Direct C&#8211;H Functionalization of Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with Alkyl Iodides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and halogen atom transfer cascade, propelled by in situ&#8208;produced boryl radicals from amine&#8211;borane adducts, facilitates chemoselective C(sp2)&#8211;H alkylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. Utilizing easily accessible alkyl iodides and ambient air as an oxidizing agent, this metal&#8208;free approach offers extensive substrate generality, elevated regioselectivity, and functional group tolerance for the late&#8208;stage diversification of heterocycles.

The chemoselective activation of alkyl halides under mild and sustainable conditions continues to pose an ongoing issue in C&#8211;H functionalization chemistry. A metal&#8208;free, photoinduced sequential hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and halogen atom transfer (XAT) method that utilizes transient boryl radicals produced in situ from stable amine&#8208;borane adducts is presented. This platform facilitates effective C(sp2)&#8211;H alkylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones through a synergistic HAT/XAT cascade, utilizing easily accessible alkyl iodides and ambient air as the terminal oxidant. The approach demonstrates broad substrate generality, elevated regioselectivity, and favorable functional group compatibility, enabling late&#8208;stage diversification of pharmaceutically significant heterocycles under operationally simple conditions.

A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed protocol for a hydrocarbamoylation of allamines with readily accessible 4&#8208;carboxyamido Hantzsch esters under metal&#8208;free and mild conditions is reported.

Herein, a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed protocol for allylamine hydrocarbamoylation under metal&#8208;free and mild conditions is reported. The proposed method utilizes readily accessible 4&#8208;carboxyamido Hantzsch esters as convenient substrates that deliver carbamoyl radicals upon a visible light&#8208;mediated SET process. Their addition to various allylamines proceeds with good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent efficiency and with high levels of regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity to provide the corresponding &#947;&#8208;amino acid amides.

         <title>Cooperative Photocatalysis of 9,10&#8208;Phenanthrenequinone and Sn(OTf)2 for Direct Mannich Reaction of Ethers via Hydrogen Atom Transfer Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual photocatalytic system of o&#8208;PQ and Sn(OTf)2 enables visible light&#8208;induced Mannich&#8208;type addition of ethers to nitrones via Csp&#179;&#8211;H activation. This oxidant&#8208;free method offers broad scope and good yields. Mechanistic studies suggest that a photoexcited o&#8208;PQ&#8211;Sn(II) complex mediates hydrogen atom transfer to form &#945;&#8208;oxy radicals for nitrone addition.

This oxidant&#8208; and reductant&#8208;free method featured broad substrate scope, good yields, and excellent functional group tolerance. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and downstream transformations (Suzuki, Sonogashira, Heck) demonstrated its synthetic utility.

         <title>Photo&#8208;/Electrochemically Radical Cation&#8208;/Anion&#8208;Mediated Defluorinative Functionalization of Organofluorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers the recent progress in photo&#8208;/electrochemically enabled radical cation&#8208;/anion&#8208;mediated defluorinative functionalization of organofluorides, including capabilities of photocatalysts, the synthetic strategies, plausible mechanisms, and future research outlook.

Radical cation&#8208; or anion&#8208;based defluorinative functionalization has rapidly emerged as a highly effective method for enhancing molecular complexity, with widespread applications in medicinal chemistry and materials science. Photo&#8208;/electrochemistry, as green and sustainable approaches, enable diverse chemical transformations. Remarkable achievements in photo(electro)chemical defluorinative functionalization of radical cations or anions is reported. The generation of radicals via defluorination of organofluorides occurs through three main mechanistic pathways: single&#8208;electron reduction, spin center shift, and single&#8208;electron oxidation. This review comprehensively summarizes recent advances in reactions involving photochemically, electrochemically, or photoelectrochemically initiated radical cation or anion C&#63743;F functionalization of organofluorides to forge a C&#63743;C or C&#63743;X (X&#8201;=&#8201;N, B, O, S, or Se) bond. This review highlights challenges and identifies potential areas for improvement. Additionally, the full spectrum of photocatalysts applied in this strategy, including metal&#8208;based and organic photoredox catalysts, is reviewed in detail.

     alt="Photo-/Electrochemically Radical Cation-/Anion-Mediated Defluorinative Functionalization of Organofluorides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review covers the recent progress in photo-/electrochemically enabled radical cation-/anion-mediated defluorinative functionalization of organofluorides, including capabilities of photocatalysts, the synthetic strategies, plausible mechanisms, and future research outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radical cation- or anion-based defluorinative functionalization has rapidly emerged as a highly effective method for enhancing molecular complexity, with widespread applications in medicinal chemistry and materials science. Photo-/electrochemistry, as green and sustainable approaches, enable diverse chemical transformations. Remarkable achievements in photo(electro)chemical defluorinative functionalization of radical cations or anions is reported. The generation of radicals via defluorination of organofluorides occurs through three main mechanistic pathways: single-electron reduction, spin center shift, and single-electron oxidation. This review comprehensively summarizes recent advances in reactions involving photochemically, electrochemically, or photoelectrochemically initiated radical cation or anion C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;F functionalization of organofluorides to forge a C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C or C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;X (X&#8201;=&#8201;N, B, O, S, or Se) bond. This review highlights challenges and identifies potential areas for improvement. Additionally, the full spectrum of photocatalysts applied in this strategy, including metal-based and organic photoredox catalysts, is reviewed in detail.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advancements and Challenges in Reductive Methylation of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dioxide, a renewable and eco&#8208;friendly carbon source, has garnered significant research interest in recent years for its application as a methyl source in synthesizing bioactive methylated compounds. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in reductive methylation of various nucleophiles with carbon dioxide as a C1 synthon for constructing carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8208;nitrogen bonds through various catalytic systems.

Methylation reactions have extraordinary value in organic chemistry, ranging from the assembly of structurally diverse organic functional chemicals to the introduction of methyl groups into pharmaceutical and agrochemical intermediates. In the context of sustainable chemistry, carbon dioxide (CO2) has emerged as an idea and alternative greener C1 source. As a result, reductive methylation strategies utilizing CO2 as a methylating agent have garnered substantial research interest in recent decades, particularly for synthesizing methylated derivatives, compounds with broad applications in drug discovery and agrochemical development. In this review, reductive methylations using CO2 as C1 synthon have been summarized and discussed in detail with focus on metal&#8208;catalyzed C/N&#8208;methylation reactions, base catalyzed C/N&#8208;methylation reactions, ionic liquids catalyzed C/N&#8208;methylation reactions, and catalyst&#8208;free C/N&#8208;methylation reactions based on various reductants. We also elucidate substrate compatibility in these reductive methylations, competing side reactions, and representative reaction mechanisms. Furthermore, conclusions and future trends are depicted finally in this review.

         <title>Cu(I) Catalyzed Germyl S&#8208;Phosphorothiolation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkene</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cheap copper (I) catalyzed difunctionalization of electron&#8208;withdrawing alkenes using germanium hydride and S&#8208;phosphorothiol to produce the germylphosphorothiolated product. This three&#8208;component reaction shows excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity and can also be used for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.

A copper&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component radical relay protocol is demonstrated for difunctionalization of electron&#8208;withdrawing alkenes using germanium hydride and S&#8208;phosphorothiol to afford the germylphosphorothiolated product. This transformation reveals excellent tolerance for functional groups and occurs under mild reaction conditions, exhibiting a high level of regioselectivity. Control experiments suggest the involvement of germyl radicals in these transformations.

Organocatalytic Remote&#8208;Controlled Enantioselective 1,10&#8208;Additions of In Situ Generated Alkynyl 2,4&#8242;&#8208;Biphenyl Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic remotely controlled enantioselective 1,10&#8208;additions of in situ&#8208;generated alkynyl 2,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl quinone methides from &#945;&#8208;[4&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)phenyl]propargyl alcohols with 3&#8208;arylindoles and indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates has been established, affording a broad scope of enantioenriched 3H&#8208;pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles and axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes, respectively. Breaking new ground, this work demonstrates the first involvement of these intermediates in stereoselective 1,10&#8208;additions, a transformation previously less reported.

The strategic incorporation of auxiliary groups has recently established &#945;&#8208;functionalized alcohols as versatile electrophilic alkylation reagents, enabling remotely controlled conjugate additions. Strikingly, while quinone methide chemistry has been extensively developed, their extended analogues&#8212;featuring spatially separated carbonyl and methide units across biphenyl systems&#8212;remain unexplored. Building on the prior work with alkynyl 4,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl quinone methides, an organocatalytic remotely controlled enantioselective 1,10&#8208;additions of in &#8201;situ&#8208;generated alkynyl 2,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl quinone methides from &#945;&#8208;[4&#8208;(2&#8208; hydroxyphenyl)phenyl]propargyl alcohols with 3&#8208;arylindoles and indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates is reported, affording a broad scope of enantioenriched 3H&#8208;pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles and axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes, respectively. Combined with control experiments, density functional theory calculations elucidate the reaction mechanism, revealing that the dehydration of &#945;&#8208;functionalized alcohols to generate 2,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl quinone methides constitutes the rate&#8208;limiting step, while enantioselectivity arises from the nucleophilic addition of alkynyl biphenyl quinone methides. Notably, beyond proving 2,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl quinone methides as competent intermediates, this work breaks new ground by demonstrating their participation in previously unreported stereoselective 1,10&#8208;additions.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Dehydrogenative Lactonization of Benzylic Alcohols: A Sustainable Access to Phthalides via N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide Mediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, scalable electrocatalytic method for direct lactonization of benzylic alcohols to phthalides using N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide as a redox mediator is reported. This metal&#8208;free process proceeds via a phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer mechanism, shows broad scope with good to excellent yields, and enables late&#8208;stage functionalizations, including syntheses of talopram and a Y5 receptor antagonist intermediate.

A sustainable and efficient electrochemical method for the direct oxidative lactonization of benzylic alcohols, enabling rapid access to isobenzofuran&#8208;1(3H)&#8208;ones (phthalides) is presented. This electrocatalytic transformation leverages N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide as a redox mediator under mild, metal&#8208;free conditions, offering an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional oxidation protocols. The method demonstrates broad substrate scope and delivers phthalide derivatives consistently in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies, combining cyclic voltammetry and density functional theory calculations, support a radical&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer mechanism driven by phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl radicals. Importantly, the utility of the protocol extends beyond model substrates: it is successfully applied to the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant compounds, including talopram and a key intermediate for a neuropeptide Y5 receptor antagonist. Overall, this work underscores the power of electrosynthesis in modern organic chemistry, merging green chemistry principles with synthetic efficiency.

         <title>N&#8208;Containing Carbon Materials in Metal&#8208;Free and Non&#8208;Noble Metal Liquid Phase Heterogenous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over 100 examples of non&#8208;noble metal supported on N&#8208;containing and metal&#8208;free N&#8208;containing carbon catalysts are discussed. Particular emphasis is put on how different N&#8208;functionalities influence catalyst performance and stability. Preparation procedures are also examined, with a strong focus on how the heat treatment temperature influences N&#8208;functionalities distribution.

Non&#8208;noble metal and metal&#8208;free catalysts can be of great benefit for the development of economically and environmentally sustainable chemical processes. In this context, N&#8208;containing carbon materials serve both as effective catalyst supports and standalone catalysts, offering enhanced stability by mitigating deactivation mechanisms such as metal leaching and sintering. The review is primarily organized by non&#8208;noble metal, systematically covering each case in which their use as an active phase on N&#8208;containing carbon materials has been reported in literature. In parallel, cross&#8208;cutting aspects are examined throughout, including the role of different N&#8208;functionalities (graphitic, pyridinic, pyrrolic, and pyridinic&#8208;N&#8208;oxide) in active&#8208;phase stabilization mechanisms. Structurally diverse carbon materials&#8212;such as amorphous carbon, carbon nanotubes, carbon spheres, carbon nanofibers, and graphene&#8212;are also considered. Furthermore, the influence of preparation methods, including template&#8208;free, hard&#8208;templating and soft&#8208;templating techniques, is analyzed with emphasis on their role in tuning textural properties. Despite significant progress, uncertainties remain regarding the precise stabilization mechanisms and the relative contributions of different N&#8208;functionalities to catalytic activity and surface acid&#8211;base properties. Addressing these knowledge gaps will be essential for optimization of N&#8208;containing carbon materials and to drive the transition towards greener and more sustainable catalytic technologies.

         <title>Direct Access to Aminocyclopentenones through Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Wolff Rearrangement and Decarbonylative Amination</title>

The cascade reaction of cyclic 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diketones and diarylamines was efficiently developed, enabling straightforward access to a series of 2&#8208;aminocyclopentenones in good to excellent yields (71&#8211;90%).

The procedure is proposed to go through a sequence of Wolff rearrangement via initial ketene formation, nucleophilic addition/keto&#8208;enol tautomerization, and Rh2(OAc)4&#8208;catalyzed decarbonylative amination followed by an oxidation process. A broad range of substrates are compatible with this mild reaction system, thereby providing a facile and practical approach for constructing important skeleton of aminocyclopentenone.

         <title>Light Mediated Sulfonylation/C&#8211;H Activation/Annulation of Benzimidazoles Derivatives Catalyzed by Diarylmethylium Tetrafluoroborate Salts: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the exploiting of visible&#8208;light, a key photoactive complex, and an acid&#8208;catalyzed proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, polycyclic sulfonylated benzimidazoles are obtained through a domino process including sulfonylation, C&#8211;H activation, and annulation. Diarylmethylium tetrafluoroborates are employed as inexpensive organocatalyst capable of forming a photoactive complex with sulfinates. Its interaction with light triggers the formation of the essential sulfonyl radical, which initiates the domino process.

In this article, diarylmethylium tetrafluoroborates are exploited as catalysts in a visible light promoted domino sulfonylation/C&#8211;H activation/annulation of N&#8208;alkynylbenzimidazoles producing polycyclic sulfonyl&#8208;benzimidazoles. Annulated benzimidazoles are important structures in pharmaceutical research and drug discovery known for their biological and medicinal properties. More than 20 polycyclic sulfonyl&#8208;benzimidazoles, including azepines, are obtained in good to excellent yields, in mild and metal free conditions. A mechanism proposal, based on both experimental and computational studies, establishes the role of the photoactive ion couple formed between the cation catalyst and the sulfinate in producing the key sulfonyl radical. The latter adds to the triple bond thus promoting a domino process in which the acid additive has a fundamental role in the hydrogen transfer. In addition, an acid&#8208;catalyzed proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer closes the catalytic cycle regenerating the diarylcarbenium salt thus yielding the desired product.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed annulative C&#63743;H activation of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl phosphoniums with CF3&#8208;imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides is reported, affording 3&#8208;CF3&#8208;isoquinolones in 44&#8211;98% yields.

Herein, ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H activation/annulation of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl phosphoniums with CF3&#8208;imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides is carried out to generate a series of 3&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;isoquinolones in 44&#8211;98% yields. A plausible mechanism involving a cascade C&#63743;H activation of arenes, formation of ruthenium(II) carbenoid, migratory insertion of the Ru&#8722;aryl bond, and intramolecular aza&#8208;cyclization is proposed. In addition, the reaction procedure features simple synthesis, wide substrate scope, and excellent functional group compatibility. Furthermore, the application potential of the developed protocol is demonstrated through successful scale&#8208;up experiments and subsequent transformations.

         <title>Thiazolium Salts: From Thiamine to Cutting&#8208;Edge Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) in organocatalytic reactions is of paramount interest and has been the subject of numerous studies over the years. Indeed, this hot and vast topic has been covered and often updated in many excellent articles. In this review, this subject is approached by highlighting thiazolium salts from an evolutionary perspective over time. Indeed, the idea is to retrace the origins of thiazolium&#8208;based NHC by featuring the crucial role played by thiazolium salts as precatalysts: In other words, to provide an account from the umpolung&#8208;concept beginnings through thiamine biocatalytic crucial transformations to cutting&#8208;edge thiazolylidene organocatalysts.

In this comprehensive review, the history of thiazolium salts as N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes (NHC) in organocatalytic reactions is intended to be presented. Although the subject (i.e., NHC in organocatalysis) has been covered in several reviews in past years, the idea here stands on the exclusive use of thiazolium salts in such transformations. Indeed, thiazoliums and their related NHCs are the first identified as efficient mediators for the C&#63743;C bond formation through its peculiar ability to reverse the classical reactivity (umpolung) of carbonyl groups. However, they are relatively quickly overtaken by other classes of NHCs generated from imidazolium and triazolium salts. Even though, thiazolylidenes are still better catalysts in some particular reactions affording outstanding results in terms of conversion and selectivity. Owing to the remarkably high number of reactions that are made possible thanks to the very characteristic properties of such NHCs, the aim of this review is to provide a full account on the discovery and evolution of thiazolium salts and thiazolylidenes in NHC organocatalysis. Information is&#160;first&#160;provided on their synthesis, structural evolution, physicochemical and electronic properties, and then reactivity and application in various organocatalytic methodologies.

         <dc:description>
An electro&#8208;oxidative protocol for the alkoxylation&#8208;thiolation of vinyl ethers is developed, employing nonvolatile diaryl disulfides as atom&#8208;economical arylthio sources under oxidant&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free conditions. 4&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)pyridine is used as a base additive to suppress side reactions and improve the yield. A wide range of substrates with diverse structures and functional groups are compatible with this protocol. Mechanism experiments show that the reaction involves a mechanism in which an arylthio radical is generated at the anode as the key intermediate.

         <title>Photoinduced Ligated Boryl Radical&#8208;Mediated Functionalization of Organic Halides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents the latest advancements in ligated boryl radical&#8208;mediated XAT chemistry, emphasizing the diversity of achievable reactions, the fundamental reaction pathways, and the valuable mechanistic insights uncovered.

Halogen atom transfers (XATs) represent a valuable class of reactions that facilitate the functionalization of C&#63743;X bonds in alkyl and aryl halides. Historically, these transformations relied on tin&#8208; or silicon&#8208;based reagents, which are plagued by several drawbacks, including toxicity, complex synthesis, and high costs. In response to these limitations, ligated boranes have recently emerged as a greener alternative, functioning as efficient halogen abstractors through the generation of reactive boryl radical species. This approach enables the selective and straightforward formation of alkyl and aryl radicals from their halide precursors, opening the door to a wide range of chemical transformations. This review highlights the most recent progress in ligated boryl radical&#8208;mediated XAT chemistry, focusing on the variety of accessible reactions, the underlying mechanisms, and the mechanistic insights gained. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review dedicated to boryl radical&#8208;mediated XAT processes. With growing interest in this area among synthetic chemists, the authors aim to provide both researchers and students with a clear overview of current advancements and inspire future exploration of ligated boryl radical chemistry.

Construction of meta&#8208;Disubstituted Triaryls via Iodine&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Aromatization Coupling of Cycloalkenes with Indoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxidative aromatization coupling strategy has been developed for the construction of meta&#8208;substituted unsymmetric triaryls using various substituted cyclohexenes and indoles. It is expected that this protocol may be of broad interest in chemistry community and constitutes a practical alternative to the synthesis of natural products, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials.

meta&#8208;Disubstituted triaryls are privileged scaffolds in bioactive molecules and functional materials, but their efficient synthesis remains challenging, due to limitations in regioselectivity and reliance on prefunctionalized substrates or transition metals. Herein, an iodine&#8208;catalyzed oxidative aromatization strategy is reported for the construction of meta&#8208;triaryls via direct coupling of readily available cycloalkenes with indoles. This protocol enables regioselective C&#63743;C bond formation at the indole C3&#8208;position and a subsequent dehydrogenative desaturation of the cycloalkene component to form the meta&#8208;substituted arene motif. The method features broad substrate scope, accommodating diverse substituted cycloalkenes and indoles. Key advantages include economical catalyst (HI as iodine source), avoidance of precious metals, and operational simplicity. Additionally, the products can undergo an array of synthetic transformations, including heterocycle skeleton editing to quinolines, halogenations, and photoredox functionalizations, which highlight the potential applications of this strategy.

It is expected that this protocol may be of broad interest in chemistry community and constitutes a practical alternative to the synthesis of natural products, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-Disubstituted triaryls are privileged scaffolds in bioactive molecules and functional materials, but their efficient synthesis remains challenging, due to limitations in regioselectivity and reliance on prefunctionalized substrates or transition metals. Herein, an iodine-catalyzed oxidative aromatization strategy is reported for the construction of &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-triaryls via direct coupling of readily available cycloalkenes with indoles. This protocol enables regioselective C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C bond formation at the indole C3-position and a subsequent dehydrogenative desaturation of the cycloalkene component to form the &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-substituted arene motif. The method features broad substrate scope, accommodating diverse substituted cycloalkenes and indoles. Key advantages include economical catalyst (HI as iodine source), avoidance of precious metals, and operational simplicity. Additionally, the products can undergo an array of synthetic transformations, including heterocycle skeleton editing to quinolines, halogenations, and photoredox functionalizations, which highlight the potential applications of this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thioether Synthesis via the Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Cross Electrophile Coupling of Aryl/Alkyl Disulfides and Aryl/Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel catalyzed electrochemical cross&#8208;electrophile coupling approach for the base&#8208;free synthesis of (un)symmetric (hetero)aryl and alkyl sulfides from organic halides and disulfides is described. The reaction is broadly applicable and tolerates water and air atmosphere.

A formal cross&#8208;electrophile coupling approach enables the base&#8208;free synthesis of (un)symmetric (hetero)aryl and alkyl sulfides from organic halides and disulfides. This water and air&#8208;tolerant process utilizes the addition of electrochemically generated thiolate to an in situ&#8208;generated reactive nickel species.

Rational design of interfacial electric fields in nanostructures for accelerated photogenerated carrier transfer and separation. First, Cu+&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly engineering narrows the bandgap of ZIF&#8208;67 while extending the light absorption range of CoCu&#8208;ZIF. Furthermore, hierarchical architecture is constructed to incorporate the cocatalyst Cu3P&#8208;GDY. The staggered energy levels in the resulting CoCu&#8208;ZIF/Cu3P&#8208;GDY composite generate a strong driving force. Comprehensive characterization, including density functional theory calculations and Mott&#8211;Schottky analysis, confirm the formation of an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction between GDY and CoCu&#8208;ZIF. Cu3P acts as an electron bridge to promote the directional transfer of photogenerated carriers driven by interfacial electric fields. Differential surface photovoltage signals demonstrate that the robust interfacial electric field enables efficient carrier separation in the CoCu&#8208;ZIF/Cu3P&#8208;GDY composite.

         <title>A Versatile Route to 3,3&#8208;Disubstituded Phthalides Via Arylogous Michael Addition Catalyzed by Organic Base</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the 3,3&#8208;disubstituted phthalide synthesis. This phthalide expansion toolkit involves a mild and organocatalytic Michael addition protocol to couple 3&#8208;arylphthalides with Michael acceptors, demonstrating broad functional group tolerance, gram&#8208;scale feasibility, and utility for the preparation of spiro&#8208;phthalide scaffold. 

The 3,3&#8208;disubstituted phthalide scaffold, a privileged structure in medicinal chemistry and natural product synthesis, serves as a key motif in many bioactive compounds. Leveraging the solvent&#8208;dependent pKa modulation of organic bases, this study introduces a mild, organocatalytic Michael addition protocol for coupling diverse 3&#8208;arylphthalides with Michael acceptors. The method demonstrates broad functional group tolerance, accommodating electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents. The versatility of this methodology is highlighted by mild reaction conditions, short reaction times, and gram&#8208;scale feasibility. Finally, the approach may open the gate to asymmetric catalysis, offering access to enantiomerically enriched phthalides.

Chemodivergent Higher&#8208;Order Annulation of Azaheptafulvenes with Enals through N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis.

A base&#8208;directed, chemodivergent, higher&#8208;order annulation between azaheptafulvenes and enals has been developed through N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis. In the presence of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene organocatalyst, DBU promotes an [8&#8201;+&#8201;3] annulation with excellent chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivities, whereas the reaction proceeds via an [8&#8201;+&#8201;2] annulation when potassium carbonate is used as the base. In addition, the reaction can be carried out on a gram scale, and the products are efficiently converted into bicyclic derivatives.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalyzed Selective Synthesis of 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;Dithianes From Thietanes: An Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although this article formally presents a regioselective photochemical ring enlargement of thietanes into 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;dithianes, time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations have revealed that 1,3&#8208;dithianes are in fact formed thought photoinduced hydrogen atom transfers from 1,2&#8208;dithianes initially resulting from the ring enlargement using thioaldehyde substrates.

Unlike other sulfur&#8208;containing heterocycles, the potential applications of functionalized dithianes have been less explored to date due to their challenging synthesis. To address this issue, we herein leverage the straightforward access to functionalized thietanes and describe a selective photochemical ring enlargement of the latter to 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;dithianes using thiocarbonyl substrates, which are in&#8201;situ generated via a Norrish&#8208;type II fragmentation reaction. The library of dithianes obtained by this photocatalyzed domino sequence between diversely substituted thietanes and various thiocarbonyls revealed regioselectivity rules: excited thioketones lead exclusively to 1,2&#8208;dithianes, while excited thioaldehydes selectively yield 1,3&#8208;dithianes, where 1,2&#8208;dithianes serve as precursors to their regioisomers. The ring expansion reaction leading to 1,2&#8208;dithianes was also integrated into a triple photochemical cascade, where the thietane intermediates were obtained via a thia&#8208;Patern&#242;_B&#252;chi reaction between Norrish&#8208;II thiocarbonyl products and various alkene partners. These experimental results were complemented with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations, which support the complex chemical pathway, rationalize the observed regioselectivity, and further substantiate mechanistic proposals related to the photolysis of disulfide bridges in peptides.

&lt;p&gt;Although this article formally presents a regioselective photochemical ring enlargement of thietanes into 1,2- or 1,3-dithianes, time-dependent density functional theory calculations have revealed that 1,3-dithianes are in fact formed thought photoinduced hydrogen atom transfers from 1,2-dithianes initially resulting from the ring enlargement using thioaldehyde substrates.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Recent Advances in Ene Reactions with Carbon Enophiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the classical intra&#8208; and intermolecular ene nexus with carbon enophiles (alkenes, alkynes, arynes, and allenes) show a considerable increase in structural complexity and an enormous potential for functional applications in polymer science.

Ene reactions are inter&#8208; or intramolecular addition reactions between a four&#8208;electron "ene" component and a two&#8208;electron enophile functionality, in which two &#960;&#8208;bonds and a C&#8211;H (or metal&#8211;C) &#963;&#8208;bond are rearranged into one &#960;&#8208;bond and two &#963;&#8208;bonds. One of the newly formed &#963;&#8208;bonds is a carbon&#8211;carbon bond, while the other is the rearranged a C&#8211;H (or metal&#8211;C) bond. This transformation enables the formation of structurally and functionally complex ene products in a single step. Originally, ene reactions were discovered as concerted and stepwise pericyclic elementary processes. However, increasing mechanistic insight&#8212;gained through both experimental and computational studies&#8212;along with extensive empirical methodological work, has paved the way to a plethora of ene&#8208;type reactions involving carbon enophiles. Since 2012, the already well&#8208;established transition metal&#8208;catalyzed variants of ene reactions have significantly expanded. Moreover, highly reactive aryne intermediates&#8212;generated in&#8201;situ either by fluoride induced elimination from ortho&#8208;silyl aryltriflates at room temperature, or by hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of a 1,3&#8208;diyne with an alkyne (both inter&#8208; and intramolecularly)&#8212;find increasing application in novel ene&#8208;type sequences. Propargyl ene reactions also gain traction, particularly because the resulting ene&#8208;allenes serve as highly valuable intermediates in the design of domino sequences that lead to complex polycyclic fused structures. Finally, the implementation of ene reactions in polymer chemistry for the synthesis of functionalized polymers and renewable unsaturated raw materials has emerged as a promising alternative to the use of purely petrochemistry based substrates.

         <title>Active&#8208;Site Microenvironments Design of Hydrogenation Catalysts for Enhanced Hydrocracking of Heavy Oil</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the regulation strategies of hydrogenation catalysts from the molecular scale to atomic scale for slurry phase hydrocracking (SPHC), proposes the design principles of active&#8208;site microenvironment for hydrogenation catalysts to enhance SPHC, and prospects the opportunities and challenges of hydrogenation catalysts for SPHC.

Slurry phase hydrocracking (SPHC) is one of the effective ways to achieve efficient conversion of low&#8208;quality heavy oil. The active&#8208;site structural design of catalysts is crucial to improve the performance but is still challenging. However, up to now, few reviews on the active&#8208;site microenvironments design of catalyst for enhancing SPHC performance have been reported. Herein, this review summarizes the research progress on the active&#8208;site microenvironments regulation strategies of hydrogenation catalysts at the molecular scale for SPHC systematically. Then, based on the problem of low hydrogenation efficiency due to the easy aggregation and low atomic utilization of molecular catalysts, the design strategies for catalysts on the atomic scale are proposed systematically. Subsequently, the design principles of active&#8208;site microenvironment for hydrogenation catalysts to enhance the SPHC are revealed. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of atomically dispersed catalyst for SPHC are prospected. This review provides an important reference for the design and development of high&#8208;performance hydrogenation catalysts for SPHC of heavy oil.

         <dc:description>The hitherto few explored &#945;&#8208;halomethyl amidine motif has been assembled through the addition of a lithiated (di)&#8208;halomethane (i.e. carbenoid) to easily accessible N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl substituted carbodiimides. Despite the inherent low electrophilicity of these heterocumulenes &#8211; as quantitatively determined in Mayr&#8217;s previous studies &#8211; their sp&#8208;hybridized carbon atom acts as a competent site of attack for these tamed nucleophiles. The overall high&#8208;yielding transformation featuring a genuine chemoselective profile &#8211; as documented by employing variously functionalized materials &#8211; is adaptable to the addition of dihalogenated carbenoids. Reaction products could be advantageously employed in nucleophilic substitution sequences, as well as, in further functionalization of the nitrogen atoms due to the constitutive heteroallyl&#8208;type skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>eAmidation: An Electrochemical Amidation of Aldehydes via the Oxidation of N&#8208;Aryl Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the use of electrochemistry has emerged as a powerful yet sustainable means of enabling key transformations. Amidation is one of the most frequently executed transformations in synthetic chemistry, and using an electrochemical approach, the current study has demonstrated the synthesis of amides from aldehydes and amines. Mechanistic work indicates that the reaction proceeds via the oxidation of an intermediate hydrazone to generate an acyl diazene as the acylating species. The protocol developed has enabled the synthesis of a broad range of amides, including access to pharmaceutically relevant products, directly from aldehydes without recourse for hazardous chemical oxidants and activating agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand controlled regio&#8208;divergent [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of alkynes by merging electrochemistry and nickel catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions between three alkynes, a diyne and an alkyne, or a triyne offer a straightforward and typical protocol toward all kinds of polysubstituted benzens. Herein, the synthesis of polysubstituted aromatics through electrochemical nickel catalyzed cyclotrimerization of alkynes is developed. The regio&#8208;divergent cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes was achieved by judicious choice of ligands. And tributylphosphine, sterically hindered bipyridine or &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands delivered 1,2,4&#8208; and 1,3,5&#8208;substituted aromatics with high regioselectivities respectively. Besides, the semi&#8208;intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between	diynes and alkynes are also amenable under this catalytic system. This approach operates without metal reductant, exhibits wide functional groups tolerance, ease of scalability and furnishes 75 examples with moderate to good yields, including some biorelevant compounds. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculation revealed the catalytic pathways of 1,3,5&#8208; and 1,2,4&#8208;cyclotrimerizations, and the origin of the ligand controlled regioselectivity.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydration reactions of diynes to access tetrasubstituted cyclohexenones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;carboalkoxy&#8208;3&#8208;substituted&#8208;cyclohexenones are powerful building blocks for the synthesis of a variety of bioactive target molecules. Their preparations requires multi&#8208;steps sequence involving the use of stoichiometric quantities of various reagents, while the catalytic approaches are limitited to trisubstituted cyclohexenones. We describe here an efficient catalytic approach based on gold(I)&#8208;catalysis starting from unsymmetrical diynyl mono&#8208;ester or symmetrical diynyl di&#8208;ester substrates. The carbon chain linking the two alkyne functions can bear two or one substituent, or even be unsubstituted. Regardless of the nature of the substrates and independently of its substitution, the cyclohexenone derivatives are cleanly produced.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(II) complex dispersed in imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid: Recyclable catalyst system for regioselective and chemoselective hydrobromination and hydrochlorination of alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a recyclable catalyst system combining Cu(II)O and 4,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline in a 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid for the hydrohalogenation of alkynes. The reaction efficiently yields alkenyl bromides and chlorides with good functional group tolerance and regioselectivity across a range of functionalized alkynes. Remarkably, the reaction exhibits unprecedented chemoselectivity for alkyne over alkenes in polyenynes and enables late&#8208;stage modifications to rapidly synthesize brominated polyenes. The catalyst system could be recycled for up to six runs without significant reduction of the reaction yield.</dc:description>

         <title>SuFEx reactions when shaken not stirred
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Click reactions display many of the goals desired for more sustainable chemical
conversions.  Yet, the solvent used is an often overlooked aspect in determining the
environmental impact of reactions. In the current paper we develop the first
mechanochemical method for the efficient and solvent&#8208;free SuFEx reaction of sulfonyl
fluorides with a wide range of phenols.  After outlining the optimization process, which
yields an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use and robust method, we provide indications of the very wide
scope of this approach, and demonstrate this potential via the application to a range of
natural phenols that also display other functionalities, and several gram&#8208;scale
syntheses.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A convenient and efficient metal&#8208;free protocol has been reported for formylation of various amines with carbon dioxide. This reaction could proceed under ambient conditions and show a broad substrate scope, encompassing primary amines, secondary amines, chiral amino acid esters and bioactive molecules. Furthermore, this method offers several advantages, including the preservation of substrate chirality, ease of separation and purification and the suitability of formic acid and formate salts as reactants in this reaction.</dc:description>
