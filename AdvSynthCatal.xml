         <title>Batch vs Continuous&#8208;Flow Method to Synthesize N&#8208;(3&#8208;acylamidopropyl)lactams through N&#8208;C Bond Cleavage in Amides with Amidines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective N&#8208;C bond cleavage of amides to create value&#8208;added products through a transition metal&#8208;free approach has become a significant challenge. Here, we present a method to convert amides into N&#8208;(3&#8208;acylamidopropyl)lactams through sequential amide chemoselective N&#8208;C bond cleavage and amidine ring opening under mild conditions, applicable in batch and continuous flow processes. These methods utilize bench&#8208;stable reagents and are operationally straightforward and mild, enabling synthesis on a gram scale with excellent functional group tolerance. Additionally, the synthetic feasibility of these reactions under flow conditions has proven to be highly efficient, providing N&#8208;(3&#8208;acylamidopropyl)lactam derivatives with improved yields and shorter reaction time.</dc:description>

         <title>Carboxylate&#8208;Directed Oxidative Annulation via C(Alkenyl)&#65293;H Activation/Double Alkyne Insertion/1,4&#8208;Pd Migration: Synthesis of Functionalized Naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed double consecutive C(alkenyl)&#8211;H activation/alkyne insertion method utilizing a free carboxylic acid as a directing group in the preparation of functionalized naphthalenes is reported. The reaction mechanism involves a sequence of the C (alkenyl)&#8722;H activation/alkyne insertion/1,4&#8208;palladium migration/reductive elimination steps. The second alkyne insertion occurred at the phenyl ring of the intermediate generated from the first alkyne insertion via 1,4&#8208;palladium migration, which is an uncommon case in typical C&#8211;H activation/alkyne insertion chemistry, providing functionalized naphthalene products. Additionally, the kinetic studies and control experiments as well as density functional theory (DFT) studies are also investigated to elucidate the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Lewis Acid Promoted/Visible Light Driven Preparation of Aryl Diazenyl Oxazoles from Isocyanoacetamides and Arylazo Sulfones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While arylazo sulfones have been widely applied as arylating agents, their exploitation for diazenylation reactions has been previously limited to electron&#8208;rich alkenes such as styrenes and silyl enol ethers. Herein we optimized a synthetic one&#8208;pot protocol to access oxazolyl azo compounds via a selective domino ring&#8208;closing/aryldiazenylation sequence by starting from arylazo sulfones and isocyanoacetamides in the presence of Sm(OTf)3 as the Lewis acid. The satisfactory substrate scope and functional group tolerance, along with scale&#8208;up reaction both in batch and under continuous flow conditions provide a valuable approach to such a class of heteroaryl azo compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>The Chemistry of Levulinic Acid: Its Potential in the Production of Biomass&#8208;based Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomass has been identified as the ultimate sustainable resource for all carbon&#8208;based consumer products of the chemical industries in the future. Its catalytic conversion leads to the formation of various platform chemicals that could partially or even fully replace the fossil&#8208;based building blocks that have been currently used in synthetic chemical processes. Among these compounds, levulinic acid (LA) has been recognized as a member of the "Top Value Added Chemicals from Biomass" and has attracted significant attention since the seminal paper reported by Werpy and Petersen in 2004. This review summarizes the properties, recent advances, and developments in the chemistry of levulinic acid.
   The production of LA from both plant and animal&#8208;based carbohydrate feedstocks via 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural or furfuryl alcohol is discussed from a mechanistic perspective, highlighting intrinsic molecular&#8208;level limitations to LA formation. The efficiencies of recently developed catalytic systems are also summarized and compared. Furthermore, the conversion of LA into high&#8208;value&#8208;added downstream chemicals, including its role in the synthesis of complex molecular structures, is overviewed. This section discussed the reactions of LA in the points of view of its various transformations on carbonyl&#8208;, carboxy&#8208;, methyl&#8208;, and methylene functional groups. The reactions of these functionalities with C&#8208; ,N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and S&#8208;nucleophiles, alcohols, amines, organometallic reagents, oxygen etc. were thematically summarized.
   Our review also outlooks to highlight the challenges and opportunities associated with the extensive research area of organic chemistry of levulinic acid.

         <title>Photoinduced Radical Borylation of Robust Carbon&#8211;Heteroatom Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Photoinduced borylation has emerged as a valuable strategy for synthesizing arylboronic esters. However, photochemical transformations involving inert bonds such as C(sp2)&#8722;F bonds are still challenging. Herein, we report a straightforward and operationally simple method for the activation of various inert carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds, enabling the synthesis of diverse arylboronic esters without the need for transition metals or catalysts. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the deprotonation of DMSO plays a pivotal role in the reaction, and the excited DMSO anion can undergo electron transfer to the aryl substrates activated by anionic sp2&#8211;sp3 diboron compounds, i.&#8201;e., [FB2pin2]&#8722;, thereby facilitating the cleavage of carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds. The reaction allows the conversion of diverse Caryl&#8211;hetero bonds in batch and flow reactors into the corresponding arylboronic esters. The products can be used in a subsequent Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling without isolation.

Abstract
A cascade regioselective 1,8&#8208;addition/biscyclization of 2&#8208;indolylmethanols with &#945;&#8208;(2&#8208;indolyl) propargylic alcohols has been developed via chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis. A series of chiral cyclopenta[4,5]pyrrolo biindoles bearing a quaternary stereogenic center were obtained in modest to good yields (72&#8211;95%) with high enantioselectivities (82&#8211;94%). Additionally, the photophysical properties of these hexacyclic bisindoles are examined, revealing bright fluorescence with high quantum yields.

Abstract
Herein, hydrogen&#8208;acceptor&#8208;free C2&#8208;selective iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H silylation of indoles and pyrroles with hydrosilanes via C(sp2)&#8722;H bond activation to generate the desired silylated products is presented. The developed protocol allows for the C&#8722;H silylation of a wide range of functionalized indoles with monohydrosilanes under iridium catalysis. Significantly, this process represents a rare silylation of C&#8722;H bonds using S&#8208;directing groups.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Deaminative Alkylation for the Synthesis of Chroman&#8208;4&#8208;One Derivatives via EDA Complexes</title>

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthesis of 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208; substituted chroman&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives via deaminative alkylation of amino acid derived Katritzky salts and tandem cyclization with o&#8208;(allyloxy)arylaldehydes has been developed. This approach exhibits functional&#8208;group compatibility with 31 examples and affords the desired products in yields of 16&#8211;88%. Mechanistic research results suggest that the formation of EDA complexes between the Katritzky salts and a base is the main reason for initiating the reaction.

         <title>Synthesis of Rutaecarpine Analogues by Borrowing Hydrogen Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A series of rutaecarpine analogues were synthesized in 11&#8211;90% yields via an iron (II) phthalocyanine&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;alkylation reaction of 3&#8208;hydroxyethyl quinazolinone&#8208;linked indole. Mechanistic investigation revealed that the formation of C&#8722;N bonds in the cyclization reaction occurs through intramolecular borrowing hydrogen annulation. The crucial intermediates in this process were verified by LC&#8211;MS analysis and DFT calculations, further supporting the proposed mechanism. Furthermore, biological evaluation demonstrated that some of the synthesized rutaecarpine analogues exhibited good anti&#8208;inflammatory activity.

Abstract
A three&#8208;component denitrative cross&#8208;coupling reaction mediated by visible light has been developed. Various 2&#8208;arylvinyl thiophosphate compounds were synthesized with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields using cheap, nontoxic, nonvolatile, and non&#8208;hygroscopic elemental sulfur (S8) as the raw material. These transformations allow the direct formation of C&#8722;S and S&#8722;P bonds without metal catalyst via a one&#8208;pot procedure.

Abstract
Herein, we report the alkylation of alkenyl carbonates using alkyl Grignard reagents and iron catalysis to generate C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds and provide synthetically useful yields over a range of substrates. The transformation allows the alkylation of a wide range of substrates, including aromatic rings, alkanes, cycloalkanes, heterocycles. This reaction has introduced a new family of electrophiles to the iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

Abstract
Ag&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of N&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethylisatin ketimines with conjugated exocyclic double bonds including &#945;&#8208;alkylidene succinimides and aurone derivatives was developed for the first time. Using a catalyst system consisting of a ferrocenyl P,N&#8208;ligand and AgNO2, the reaction provides a facile method for the construction of chiral pyrrolidines bearing four consecutive stereocenters and two adjacent spiro&#8208;quaternary chiral centers, as well as offers a direct route to structurally diverse enantioenriched CF3&#8208;containing 3,2&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidinyl spirooxindole derivatives.

&lt;p&gt;Ag-catalyzed enantioselective 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-2,2,2-trifluoroethylisatin ketimines with conjugated exocyclic double bonds including &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-alkylidene succinimides and aurone derivatives was developed for the first time. Using a catalyst system consisting of a ferrocenyl &lt;i&gt;P,N&lt;/i&gt;-ligand and AgNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the reaction provides a facile method for the construction of chiral pyrrolidines bearing four consecutive stereocenters and two adjacent spiro-quaternary chiral centers, as well as offers a direct route to structurally diverse enantioenriched CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-containing 3,2&#8242;-pyrrolidinyl spirooxindole derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The inside cover picture illustrates novel wavelength&#8208;dependent transformations of pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazolones into 3D&#8208;rich heterocyclic systems. The robot with flashlights represents how two distinct products can be easily obtained by simply adjusting the irradiation wavelength, leading to either 1,2&#8208;diazepines through ring expansion or tricyclic product via consecutive 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization. These transformations are highly stereoselective, do not require photocatalysts or additives, and can be easily scaled up. For more details, see the Research Article by I. Kula&#353;i&#263;, B. &#352;tefane and co&#8208;workers (I. Kula&#353;i&#263;, N. Petek, H. Brodnik, U. Gro&#353;elj, J. Svete, B. &#352;tefane, Adv. Synth.

         <title>Stereoselective N&#8208;Heterocyclic&#8208;Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Spiroannulation as an Access Towards Spirobenzofuranone&#8208;Fused Cyclohexenones</title>

Abstract
In this work, we present an organocatalytic spiroannulation method that provides access to spirocyclic benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;ones. The reaction proceeds via the generation of an azolium dienolate from an &#945;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde using a chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, followed by annulation with benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;one&#8208;derived alkenes. The resulting chiral spirobenzofuranone&#8208;fused cyclohexenones were obtained in 77&#8211;99% ee and dr from 1.2:1 to 20:1. The utility of the protocol was underscored by gram&#8208;scale reaction and follow&#8208;up transformations.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Cross Coupling Reaction of Alkyl Bromides with (DMPU)2Zn(Rf)2 Reagent: A Method for the Synthesis of Perfluoroalkylated Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A method for the copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl bromides with a range of (DMPU)2Zn(Rf)2 reagents has been developed. This protocol tolerates multiple functional groups and provides broad access to aliphatic perfluoroalkylated compounds. The applicability of this procedure is demonstrated in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug analogues.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Mediated Oxidative C&#8208;H Phosphorylation of Quinoxalines and Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quinoxaline is a chemical moiety known for its diverse physicochemical and biological properties, making it the focus of extensive research. Over the past few decades, quinoxaline scaffolds have been utilized in the design and development of various bioactive molecules, dyes, fluorescent materials, electroluminescent materials, organic sensitizers for solar cells, and polymeric optoelectronic materials. Herein, we present a metal&#8208;free and rapid protocol for the phosphorylation of quinoxalines and quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one. This method employs oxygen as an oxidant under ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, with experimental evidence indicating the absence of radical involvement. Our methodology provides range of phosphorylated quinoxalines and quinoxaline&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one in yields ranging from 47% to 99%.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual NHC/HAT&#8208;Promoted Esterification to Access &#945;&#8208;Aryl Glycines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Aryl glycines are among the more important carbonyl compounds, particularly as nonproteinogenic &#945;&#8208;amino acids present in many pharmacophores. As such, many strategies have been developed to access this motif, but direct carboxylation methods remain underdeveloped. Herein, we employ a dual NHC/HAT catalysis strategy to access 2&#8208;azaallyl radicals, which subsequently couple with in situ generated ester azolium radical intermediates. Base&#8208;mediated collapse of the ensuing tetrahedral intermediate liberates the NHC catalyst and benzophenone protected aryl glycine. This methodology was employed to esterify obtain a variety of aryl substituted glycine derivatives, as well as allylic and benzylic sites. Mechanistic studies reveal that this radical process operates under both oxidative and reductive quenching cycles, while preliminary experiments employing a chiral NHC and Lewis acid additive demonstrate modest enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving the Photochemical Skeletal Enlargement of Pyridines to 1,2&#8208;Diazepines with Isocyanates
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we extend the one&#8208;pot protocol to synthesize 1,2&#8208;diazepines from commercially available and cheap starting materials. Capitalizing on isocyanate derivatives as activating agents, the photochemical skeletal enlargement occurs, while preserving key functional groups embedded in more than 30 substrates. We also demonstrated that isocyanates can be generated in situ exploiting the wealth of methods starting from bench stable resources. Compare to previous strategies, the use of these precursors prevents the presence of deleterious HCl traces in the system, thus enabling the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;diazepines in high yields over up to 5 sequential steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Access to Aryl Quinolinyl Ketones via Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Aldehyde C&#8722;H Bond Arylation of Quinoline&#8208;8&#8208;Carbaldehydes with Arylboronic Acid</title>

Abstract
This article describes the development of a room&#8208;temperature visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced palladium&#8208;catalyzed directed aldehyde C&#8722;H bond arylation to access aryl quinolinyl ketones. In this pathway, the Pd catalyst plays a dual role by harvesting light as a photocatalyst and catalyzing the chemical transformation via C&#8722;H bond activation. This process is general to synthesize a range of aryl quinolinyl ketones and tolerates many common functional groups. Our methodology was successfully applied to synthesize highly potent tubulin polymerization inhibitors.

         <title>Controllable Synthesis of Oxa&#8208;/Thia&#8208;Spirohydroquinolines by [3+(2+1)] Annulation of Aromatic Amines with Bimolecular O/S&#8208;Heterocyclic Ketones</title>

Abstract
[3+(2+1)] Annulation represents the most straightforward and atom&#8208;economical strategies in organic synthesis for the efficient construction of diverse cyclic structural units and complex molecules. Herein, we present a Lewis acid Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed controlled synthesis of two different regioselective oxa/thia&#8208;spirohydroquinolines (C=C at the &#945;/&#946;&#8208;site of O/S&#8208;atom) from aromatic amines and bimolecular O/S&#8208;heterocyclic ketones via intermolecular [3+(2+1)] annulation. This method features mild reaction conditions, high step economy and atom utilization, and the O/S&#8208;heterocyclic ketone can act as both two&#8208; and one&#8208;carbon synthons. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the intrinsic cause of this unique regioselectivity is caused by the proton abstraction step.

Abstract
An approach to the synthesis of arylthiolated quinolino[2,1&#8208;b]quinazolinones has been developed using unactivated alkynes containing quinazolinones and diaryldisulfides under visible light irradiation. The procedure entails a sequential radical arylthiolation and cyclization reaction. A possible radical mechanism has been investigated and proven as a single electron transfer (SET) process.

         <title>Discovery of EDA&#8208;Complex Photochemical Reactions Using Computational Vision</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a multidimensional screening strategy to discover Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor (EDA) complex photochemical reactions using only simple photographic devices, such as webcams or cellphones, combined with TLC analysis. An algorithm was designed to automatically identify EDA&#8208;complex reactive mixtures in solution by processing digital images from a 96&#8208;well microplate, alongside TLC results. The code detects the absorption region of the mixture in the visible spectrum and quantifies color changes through grayscale values. Integrated automatic TLC analysis further classifies mixtures as colorimetric reactions, non&#8208;reactive, or potentially reactive EDA complexes. Leveraging this screening platform, we have developed a new EDA&#8208;mediated approach to synthesize iminophosphoranes in yields up to 90%.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstructive synthesis of fluorinated dihydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indolones by a cyclohexadione cut&#8208;to&#8208;fuse strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a fluorinative ring&#8208;cleavage reaction that breaks C&#8211;C bonds in cyclic &#946;&#8208;diketones bearing aryl moiety using N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) in the presence of inorganic carbonates (Cs2CO3 or K2CO3) in methanol at room temperature within one hour. Generated fluorinated keto acid esters bearing ortho&#8208;nitro aryl groups were transformed into fluorinated dihydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indolones (DHPIs) via reductive cyclization using B2(OH)4 followed by amidation in the presence of  K2CO3. This "cut&#8208;to&#8208;fuse" strategy enables the reconstructive synthesis of valuable fused heterocycles from relatively simple cyclohexadione.</dc:description>

         <title>Trifluoroacetic Acid Promotes Umpolung of 2&#8208;Methylindole to Achieve C(sp3)&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An umpolung strategy for the C(sp3)&#8208;H aminomethylation of 2&#8208;methylindole has been developed using trifluoroacetic acid to induce the transformation, with aminals serving as precursors of iminium ion. Mechanistic studies have clearly shown that trifluoroacetic acid may play a pivotal role in this strategy. The utilization of readily available starting materials, mild reaction conditions, tolerance to complex functional groups, combine with yields of up to 98% and potential biological applications render this protocol applicable and useful for organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deuterated hydroxyl acids and amino acids have been widely utilized in life science, biochemistry and drug development. Site&#8208;selective and stereoselective synthesis of deuterated hydroxyl acids and amino acids remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the development of a robust whole&#8208;cell&#8208;based chemoenzymatic platform for the synthesis of deuterated hydroxyl acids and amino acids from off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf aldehydes in high yields with excellent selectivities and levels of deuteration. The platform delivers products with diverse scaffolds and deuteration patterns, as well as broad scopes with both aromatic and aliphatic side chains. The application of the platform was demonstrated by the concise synthesis of a deuterium&#8208;containing antiparkinson's disease candidate. This platform provides a concrete foundation for accessing amino acid isotopologs for potential applications in research and drug discovery and development.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Sulfoximinocyclopentenones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of 4&#8208;sulfoximinocyclopent&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones were prepared in 35 to 99% yield through a calcium(II)&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;Piancatelli reaction, including in enantioenriched form. Depending on their substitution pattern, diverse diastereoselective chemical transformations can be applied to these scaffolds, allowing access to cyclopentane derivatives. This study opens synthetic routes to cyclopentane&#8208;based scaffolds and also paves the way for the exploration of the associated chemical space in drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Emerging Trends for the Direct Synthesis of Dithiocarbamates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Dithiocarbamates are common structural motifs in various bioactive compounds, attracting considerable attention due to their wide&#8208;ranging applications in organic synthesis, material science, agrochemicals, and the pharmaceutical industry. Given the significant bioactivity and extensive applications of dithiocarbamates, the continuous pursuit of their efficient and diverse synthetic methods remains critical and urgent. Direct dithiocarbamation reactions can introduce &#8722;S&#8722;C(S)NR2 group directly into parent molecules, providing shorter, greener, and more practical pathways for the synthesis of organodithiocarbamates. This article offers a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in direct dithiocarbamation reactions, categorizing them based on the different sources of the &#8722;S&#8722;C(S)NR2 group, with a particular emphasis on elucidating substrate scope and reaction mechanisms. Additionally, some synthetic limitations and applications of these methods are discussed. This review aims to provide the latest advancements in this field to both general readers and professional practitioners, inspiring innovative ideas for the synthesis of organosulfur compounds.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar Chiral Ferrocene Triflones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A multi&#8208;gram scale synthesis of ferrocenetriflone was optimised from ferrocenesulfonyl fluoride and Me3SiCF3 (Ruppert reagent). Enantioselective deprotolithiations were then optimised using alkyllithiums in the presence of catalytic (+)&#8208;sparteine to afford 2&#8208;substituted ferrocene triflones in 79&#8211;84% ee. The use of chiral lithium amides in the presence of in&#8197;situ traps was also optimised and was found to outperform alkyllithium&#8901;chiral diamine chelates for the first time in the ferrocene series, with 89&#8211;93% ee. Crystallisation of derivatives afforded enantiopure compounds that were engaged in deprotolithiation&#8208;electrophilic trapping sequences, a halogen &#8216;dance&#8217; reaction and transition metal&#8208;promoted coupling to afford a wide range of variously polysubstituted ferrocene triflones.

Abstract
A three&#8208;component reaction of 1,3&#8208;diketones with H2O2 and alcohols was discovered. 3,5&#8208;Dialkoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxolanes are formed in yields ranging from 13% to 83% using an excess of acids such as H2SO4, MeHSO3, p&#8208;TsOH&#8901;H2O or BF3&#8901;Et2O. This reaction proceeds with the formation of 3,5&#8208;dialkoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxolanes despite the diversity of possible reaction pathways leading to different types of peroxides, oligomers, polymers or hydrolysis. 3,5&#8208;Dimethoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxolanes exhibit high activity against phytopathogenic fungi.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Transformation Strategy of o&#8208;Hydroxyphenyl Propargylamines for Modular Access to 3&#8208;Functionalized Benzofurans</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A one&#8208;pot strategy to C3&#8208;functioanlized benzofurans is achieved from o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl propargylamines (o&#8208;HPPAs). 3&#8208;Aminobenzofurans were obtained in 64&#8211;96% yields through the cascade alkyne&#8208;allene tautomerization and 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig annulation of o&#8208;HPPAs in the presence of KOH/NaOtBu as the fruitful base combination. Moreover, with benzenesulfinates and diphenylphosphine oxide as nucleophiles, a one&#8208;pot protocol towards these derivatives was also demonstrated through a cascade 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition/5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig annulation/aromatization process.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A one-pot strategy to C3-functioanlized benzofurans is achieved from &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxyphenyl propargylamines (&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-HPPAs). 3-Aminobenzofurans were obtained in 64&#8211;96% yields through the cascade alkyne-allene tautomerization and 5-&lt;i&gt;exo-dig&lt;/i&gt; annulation of &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-HPPAs in the presence of KOH/NaO&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Bu as the fruitful base combination. Moreover, with benzenesulfinates and diphenylphosphine oxide as nucleophiles, a one-pot protocol towards these derivatives was also demonstrated through a cascade 1,4-conjugate addition/5-&lt;i&gt;exo-dig&lt;/i&gt; annulation/aromatization process. Additionally, a gram-scale synthesis and further transformation into other valuable functionalized benzofurans were conducted to show the potential in organic synthesis of these developed synthetic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advances in Exploring Mechanisms of Oxidative Phenolic Coupling Reactions</title>

Abstract
Biphenolic compounds serve as important scaffolds for the development of biologically active molecules. Among the methods for the synthesis of biarenols, oxidative coupling, which directly forms a C&#8722;C bond, has been extensively explored in various metal&#8208;catalyzed (V, Cr, Co, Fe, Cu, etc.) reactions, electrochemical reactions, and photochemical reactions over the decades. While the exact mechanisms remain elusive in many cases, numerous mechanistic studies have provided valuable insights. This review focuses on the mechanistic details of the oxidative coupling of phenols or naphthols, involving at least one radical intermediate. Additionally, the factors governing chemoselectivity (homo&#8208; and cross&#8208;coupling), regioselectivity (ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; and para&#8722;), and enantioselectivity (R and S configuration) are discussed, with a particular emphasis on intermediates and transition states, encompassing various oxidation sites for phenols and potential coupling sites.

         <title>Intermolecular Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Nitrene Transfer Employing Aryl Azides: An Access to 7&#8208;Functionalized 2&#8208;Aminoindoles</title>

Abstract
We report on intermolecular gold&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer, utilizing o&#8208;functionalized aryl azides as nitrene transfer reagents. This catalytic reaction provides a modular route to 7&#8208;functionalized 2&#8208;aminoindoles. Due to the optimized reaction conditions (toluene, 80&#8211;100&#8201;&#176;C), a variety of functional substituents proved compatible (36 examples; yields up to 98%). The reaction can be performed using both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic variants with a low catalyst loading (1&#8197;mol %). The synthetic potential of the obtained products was illustrated by post&#8208;modifications of the indole backbone and peripheral substituents. A plausible reaction mechanism includes the generation of intermediate &#945;&#8208;imino carbenes directly from the o&#8208;functionalized aryl azides or other nitrene sources, such as anthranils or benzofuroxans, which form during the reaction in the cases of the specific aryls.

Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric dearomative arylation of 2&#8208;naphthols enabled by the unconventional reactivity of o&#8208;quinone diimides, i.&#8201;e. the 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition on quinone sp2 hybridized carbon, has been established. Under the catalysis of chiral phosphoric acid, various cyclohexaenones bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter have been prepared with excellent yields and enantioselectivities.

Abstract
A strategy to access fluorinated spiroindolenines has been developed, involving a selective functionalization of indoles with fluorinated moieties and subsequent catalytic dearomatization. Trifluomethylthio (SCF3), diethyl phosphono(difluoromethyl)thio (SCF2P(O)(OEt)2) and (phenylsulfonyl)difluoromethyl (CF2SO2Ph) groups were embedded at the C2 position of indole derivatives substituted with alkynes, allenes, and allyl carbonate moieties at the C3 position. A gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization gave access to five spiroindolenines, and an enantioselective palladium catalyzed cyclization provided 10 fluorinated spirocyclic products with up to 77% ee.

         <title>Intramolecular Buchner Reaction: Experimental and Theoretical Comparison of the Effect of the Carbene Substituent on the Chemoselectivity</title>

Abstract
The intramolecular Buchner reaction is a powerful transformation able to dearomatize benzenic rings. However, the competitive C&#8722;H insertion of the carbene moiety into benzylic positions still remains a limitation, and the reasons governing this uncomplete chemoselectivity are poorly understood. The carbene substitution, in particular, has been observed to influence the selectivity strongly, though the currently proposed explanation relying on the electrophilicity of the metallocarbene hardly describes some experimental results reported in the literature. In this article, we present our experimental observations of intramolecular rhodium&#8208;catalyzed Buchner reactions, combined with DFT calculations on selected carbene substituents, to propose a complementary explanation for the observed chemoselectivity modification.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light triplet photocatalyst 5&#8208;acetyl&#8208;2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;benzoic acid methyl ester (AcBSH) was developed through introducing acetyl into benzenethiolate to improve the efficiency of intersystem crossing (ISC) and using o&#8208;methoxyformyl to increase the molar extinction coefficient. In the photocatalytic system of AcBSH, the reductive dearomatization of N&#8208;arylformylindoles is achieved to afford the desired indolines in moderate to excellent yields, including both indoles without (1) and with 2&#8208;substituent (2). The 2&#8208;substituent is a steric hindrance for the conjugation between benzoyl and indole moiety, and makes indole 2 and indole 1 exhibit different reduction potentials (Ered) and different triplet energy levels (&#916;ET). Thereby, two kinds of substrates undergo primarily two photocatalytic pathways: i) successive SET/protonation pathway, which merging photosensitization via triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (EnT) and photoinduced SET for substrates 1, and ii) single electron transfer (SET) from the triplet photocatalyst and a concerted hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process for substrates 2.

         <title>Dearomative Functionalization of Activated Quinolines: Transfer Hydrogenation/Cycloaddition Cascade to Construct &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Amines</title>

Abstract
Cascade dearomative functionalization is a robust protocol to convert flat arenes into medicinally relevant three&#8208;dimensional architectures with added new functionality. Herein, a dearomative cycloaddition protocol for synthesizing tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;embedded &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine scaffolds has been developed employing quinolinium salts and sulfonyl azides under metal&#8208;free conditions. An underexplored and mechanistically distinct pathway is unveiled, creating quaternary&#8208;center&#8208;bearing amine skeletons by an amine group migration during the transfer hydrogenation and cycloaddition cascade reaction. This approach provided a broad substrate scope of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine scaffolds from a plethora of C3&#8208;substituted quinolinium and sulfonyl azides. The post&#8208;synthetic modifications have further diversified the &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine core into interesting scaffolds. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested the involvement of aziridine ring formation for the amine migration to the C&#8208;3 position of quinoline to generate the &#945;&#8208;tertiary amine core.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine&#8208;Mediated Regioselective Dearomatization of Non&#8208;Activated Arenes</title>

Abstract
The dearomatizations of non&#8208;activated arenes, particularly those under mild reaction conditions, are highly desired transformations in organic synthesis due to their power in converting flat aromatic rings into three&#8208;dimensional frameworks. Although hypervalent iodine (HVI)&#8208;mediated dearomatization of phenol derivatives has developed rapidly, HVI&#8208;mediated dearomatization of non&#8208;activated arenes remains an urgent and challenging task. To fulfil this task, in this work, we established an HVI&#8208;mediated oxidative dearomatization of non&#8208;activated arenes by using biphenylureas and N&#8208; or O&#8208;nucleophiles as reactants. This electrophilic dearomatization (DEAr) process is highly regioselective, which enabled different N&#8208; and O&#8208;nucleophiles to react at the distal C4&#8208;position of the phenyl ring, thus generating dearomative spiro&#8208;products in a single step under mild conditions with wide substrate scope (43 examples, 22%&#8211;76% yield). This approach not only provides a successful example for dearomatization of non&#8208;activated arenes under mild reaction conditions, but also has overcome the challenges in HVI&#8208;mediated dearomatization of non&#8208;activated arenes, which will enrich the chemistry of dearomatization.

Abstract
The dearomatization of aromatic substrates via photocatalytic methodologies has gained escalating prominence to access molecular complexity. Although much focus has been put on non&#8208;active arenes, naphthols and N&#8208;based heteroaromatics, arylamines have so far remained in the background. Herein, we report a photocatalytic strategy for the aerobic, dearomative hydroxylation of naphthylamines under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Our investigation highlights singlet oxygen generation as a viable mechanism for aromaticity disruption, mitigating selectivity issues deriving from the direct oxidation of targeted arylamines. Finally, we showcased the synthetic value of the obtained dearomatized products in a late&#8208;stage diversification campaign.

Abstract
Daphenylline, a structurally unique triterpenoid Daphniphyllum alkaloid, has attracted considerable attention from the synthetic community since its isolation. Herein, we delineate an enantioselective total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;daphenylline, which is based on a gold&#8208;catalyzed dearomatization reaction of &#946;&#8208;methoxynaphthalene. Other features include installation of the initial chiral stereocenter via an enantioselective rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of an alkylidene&#8208;indane derivative; construction of the other vital stereocenter by organocatalytic asymmetric Mukaiyama&#8211;Michael reaction of a structurally complex benzofused cyclohexanone; and a tandem reductive amination/amidation double cyclization reaction to assemble the distinctive azapolycyclic cage&#8208;like architecture.

         <title>Construction of Spirocyclic Compounds via Electrochemical Intramolecular Dearomatization of Benzene Derivatives</title>

Abstract
The spirocyclic framework is found in many natural products, some of which are biologically active. However, It remains a challenge to develop environmentally friendly and atom&#8208;economic synthetic methods. Herein, we report an intramolecular dearomatization reaction of benzene derivatives enabled by electrochemistry&#8208;mediated two successive single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer (SET) processes, providing an alternative method for the rapid construction of spirocyclic skeletons without using sacrificial reagents. A series of cyclohexadiene products were obtained in 25&#8211;81% yields. Furthermore, a proposed mechanism involving a sequential electron transfer event was supported by cyclic voltammetry experiments. This strategy features transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions and easy handling, which will greatly enhance its practical utility.

         <title>Dearomative 1,2&#8208;(Deutero)Hydrotrifluoromethylation of Chromium&#8208;Bound Arenes</title>

Abstract
Dearomative trifluoromethylation of arenes provides an ideal method for constructing CF3&#8208;containing three&#8208;dimensional architectures which are of increasing interest in drug discovery. However, such transformation is rare and challenging because of the inherently low reactivity of arene &#960;&#8208;systems and selectivity issues. Herein, we disclose a general dearomative 1,2&#8208;hydrotrifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes utilizing activation by temporary &#960;&#8208;complexation to chromium, thus affording convenient access to 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes bearing the privileged CF3 group. The versatility of this strategy further enables a dearomative 1,2&#8208;deuterotrifluoromethylation with high deuterated ratios. The related dearomative 1,2&#8208;(deutero)hydroperfluoroethylation reactions were conducted well for a range of chromium&#8208;bound (hetero)arenes. Finally, a reasonable mechanism was proposed based on the intermediate capture and control experiments.

         <dc:description>We describe a selective preparation of a variety of functionalized pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;c]tetrahydroquinolines and indolo[3,2&#8208;c]tetrahydroquinolines in 40&#8208;82% and 40&#8208;80% yields from alkynyl&#8208;tethered oximes with diaryliodonium triflates, respectively. The one&#8208;pot reaction underwent N&#8208;arylation, intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition, selective [1.3] or [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement of N&#8208;O bond in total three steps. Experimental studies revealed that EtOAc solvent and copper(II)&#8208;catalyst played crucial roles on the formation of these two tetrahydroquinoline scaffolds. Moreover, these two tetrahydroquinoline scaffolds could be converted into various tetrahydroquinoline building blocks by further transformations.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The insertion of diazo carbene into Si&#8722;H bonds with unsupported nanoporous copper (CuNPore) catalyst has been developed. &#945;&#8208;Aryl diazoesters, diazophosphonates, and unstable aryl diazoalkyls can be used as carbene precursors to exquisitely insert into the Si&#8722;H bond of silanes. A variety of &#945;&#8208;silylesters, silylphosphonate, and functionalized arylsilane were obtained in 35&#8722;82% yields. The reusability feature of the CuNPore catalyst for this insertion reaction demonstrated its high heterogeneous catalytic activity and practicality.Further, mechanistic studies revealed that the insertion of carbene from diazo compounds into the Si&#8722;H bond may include a three&#8208;center concerted transition state on CuNPore.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative Cyclization of Indolyl Ynamides for Synthesis of Pentacyclic Spiroindolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dearomatization of indoles with ynamides is a convenient access towards polycyclic spiroindolines, which can be initiated by &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;additions of ynamides. Currently, the related &#946;&#8208;addition initiated dearomative cyclization requires noble&#8208;metal catalyst or stoichiometric oxidant. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed dearomative cyclization of aryl&#8208;substituted indolyl ynamides through 	regioselective &#946;&#8208;addition onto ynamides, providing pentacyclic spiroindolines in 81&#8211;97% yields with &gt;25:1 diastereoselectivities. Moreover, preliminary success has been obtained for the catalytic enantioselective dearomative cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Strategies for the Selective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Functionalized Amines via Hydrofunctionalization of Enamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;functionalized amines are two classes of important compounds, whose structural units are widely present in approved drugs. The hydrofunctionalization of enamides is the most direct and efficient method for constructing these two types of compounds. The regioselectivity was the focus of this conversion, which is largely influenced by the catalytic mode. Therefore, in order to selectively synthesize &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;functionalized amines, the progress in catalytic hydrofunctionalization of enamides over the past decade are reviewed, and the catalytic pathways for the hydrofunctionalization of enamides are discussed in detail. This account aims to objectively evaluate the effects of various catalytic pathways on the regioselectivity of hydrofunctionalization, in order to provide a new perspective on the selection of catalytic methods and the design of catalytic pathways for selective synthesis &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;functionalized amines.
	This review has been divided into the following sections:
1.	Introduction
2.	Organic reagents catalysis
3.	Transition metal catalysis
4.	Photoredox catalysis
5.	Summary and prospect

         <dc:description>Abstract. Borane&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation of levulinic acid and other &#947;&#8208;ketoacids with hydrazines for selective access to hexahydropyridazines and tetrahydropyridazin&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones has been developed. The combination of B(C6F5)3 and Et3SiH allows for synthesis of various hexahydropyridazines and tetrahydropyridazin&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones in 67&#8208;97% yields with tolerance towards various functional groups and easy scale&#8208;up. This reaction can be rendered enantioselective by using a chiral borane catalyst generated in situ from HB(C6F5)2 and a binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral diene and PhMe2SiH, affording the target products in 70&#8208;92% yields with up to &gt;99% ee. The judicious choice of borane catalyst and hydrosilane reductant proves to be critical for catalysis. Mechanistic investigations elucidate the catalytic pathway.</dc:description>

Abstract
In this study, Cs2CO3&#8208;mediated one&#8208;pot tandem dimerization/(3+3) cyclocondensation of 1,3&#8208;acetonedicarboxylates followed by substitution of alkyl or aryl halides was developed to construct functionalized 2,4,6&#8208;trialkoxy&#8208; and triaryloxybenzoates. In the effective reaction, the core benzene system was formed in a single&#8208;step process under open&#8208;vessel conditions. A plausible mechanism for this reaction is proposed and discussed herein.

Abstract
We report sequential wavelength&#8208;selective photochemical transformations of 1&#8208;alkenylpyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazolones to pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a][1,2]diazepines or cyclobuta[c]pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazolones. Irradiation of 1&#8208;alkenylpyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazolones with visible&#8208;light (blue LED, 457&#8197;nm) induced selective &#8216;ring switching&#8217; transformation into pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a][1,2]diazepines, which underwent electrocyclisation yielding cyclobuta[c]pyrazolo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazolones upon irradiation with UV&#8722;A light (black LED, 365&#8197;nm). Due to the very narrow irradiation wavelength now available from OLED sources, the selective formation of either 5,7&#8208;bicyclic or 5,5,4&#8208;tricyclic ring systems from the 5,5&#8208;bicyclic starting material is possible by changing the wavelength of the irradiation source. The transformations took place under mild conditions in the absence of additives or photocatalysts. Mechanistic studies indicate that these transformations proceed through the formation of an excited triplet state of the substrate, followed by selective homolytic C(1)&#8722;N(8) bond cleavage, intersystem crossing, and cyclization of the zwitterionic intermediate on the ground potential energy surface. The subsequent photoinduced disrotatory stereospecific 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization of the 5,7&#8208;bicyclic systems leads to 3D&#8208;rich 5,5,4&#8208;tricyclic products.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report sequential wavelength-selective photochemical transformations of 1-alkenylpyrazolo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyrazolones to pyrazolo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;][1,2]diazepines or cyclobuta[&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]pyrazolo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyrazolones. Irradiation of 1-alkenylpyrazolo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyrazolones with visible-light (blue LED, 457&#8197;nm) induced selective &#8216;ring switching&#8217; transformation into pyrazolo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;][1,2]diazepines, which underwent electrocyclisation yielding cyclobuta[&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]pyrazolo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyrazolones upon irradiation with UV&#8722;A light (black LED, 365&#8197;nm). Due to the very narrow irradiation wavelength now available from OLED sources, the selective formation of either 5,7-bicyclic or 5,5,4-tricyclic ring systems from the 5,5-bicyclic starting material is possible by changing the wavelength of the irradiation source. The transformations took place under mild conditions in the absence of additives or photocatalysts. Mechanistic studies indicate that these transformations proceed through the formation of an excited triplet state of the substrate, followed by selective homolytic C(1)&#8722;N(8) bond cleavage, intersystem crossing, and cyclization of the zwitterionic intermediate on the ground potential energy surface. The subsequent photoinduced disrotatory stereospecific 4&#960;-electrocyclization of the 5,7-bicyclic systems leads to 3D-rich 5,5,4-tricyclic products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Flavin&#8208;dependent nitroreductases are gaining attention as biocatalysts for the synthesis of pharmaceutically active compounds and their precursors. Here, we examined a panel of nitroreductase&#8208;like flavoenzymes for their reductase activity towards a wide variety of aromatic and aliphatic nitro compounds, nitroolefins, and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Several of these flavoenzymes displayed high reductase activity and achieved excellent conversion of diverse nitroarenes, nitroolefins and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds, accomplishing good product yields in semi&#8208;preparative scale reactions (up to 97%). In addition to the catalytic promiscuity of several of these flavoenzymes, being able to perform the reduction of nitro groups (nitroreductase activity) as well as C=C groups (ene&#8208;reductase activity), this study also revealed that some flavoenzymes exhibit high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and/or enantioselectivity, making them attractive enzymes for use in organic synthesis.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced C&#8722;H Silylation of Azauracils with Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
C&#8722;H silylation of azauracils was developed via the combination of organic photoredox and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysis. Using 1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) as the photocatalyst, quinuclidine as the HAT catalyst, and silanes as the silyl radical source, a variety of silylated azauracils were synthesized in 43&#8211;87% yield. Moreover, pyrazinone, cinnolinone, and chromone were also compatible with this catalytic system. The reaction is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization of drugs and complex molecules, and the transformation can be easily scaled up to gram level. Mechanistic studies suggest that the silylation reaction is likely to proceed through a radical mechanism.

An Yb(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed [2+2] cycloaddition /retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE)/bicyclization of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoarylaklynyl)&#8208;naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ols and 3&#8208;alkylideneoxindoles is reported, enabling a direct C=C bond cleavage&#8208;reassembly process to regioselectively synthesize a variety of quinoline&#8208;tethered benzo[5,6]chromeno[2,3&#8208;b]indoles in 31&#8211;84% yields. Exchanging the amino group for a hydroxyl group in the arylalkynyl unit of the naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol substrate resulted in chromenyl chromeno[2,3&#8208;b]indoles via a similar cascade process.

         <title>Gold(III) Catalysis in Ionic Liquids: The Case Study of Coumarin Synthesis</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
Well&#8208;defined (P,C)&#8208;cyclometalated Au(III) complexes proved to be able to catalyze the synthesis of coumarins by intramolecular hydroarylation of a broad range of aryl propiolates under mild and practical conditions (0.1&#8211;2&#8197;mol% catalyst, 25&#8211;40&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8211;24&#8197;hours). The use of an ionic liquid as reaction solvent allowed to drastically decrease the amount of Br&#246;nsted acid used to unlock the catalyst regeneration step. The effect of the nature of the acid additive and of the ionic liquid anion have been assessed. Preliminary results on the extension of this methodology to the cyclization of aryl propargyl ethers are also presented.

         <title>Magnesium and Calcium Bisguanidinates: Catalytic Activity in the Hydroboration of Unsaturated Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The role of ligands in catalytically active metal complexes can be crucial. Herein, we present a study on the synthesis and catalytic behavior of alkaline earth bisguanidinato complexes. The reactivity of trisubstituted guanidines, specifically (iPrHN)2CNR (R=Ph, 2&#8208;Ph2PC6H4, 2&#8208;MeSC6H4), towards magnesium and calcium alkyls or amides was explored. All the compounds were found to be very active in the hydroboration of acetophenone with pinacolborane. Notably, a calcium&#8208;based complex was especially effective in the hydroboration of carbonyl compounds, demonstrating significant chemoselectivity against other reactive functional groups. This complex was also particularly effective in the double hydroboration of nitriles and moderately active in the hydroborative dearomatization of pyridine. Our experimental and DFT studies allow us to propose a mechanism in which the participation of the guanidinato ligands, along with the metal, is key to the activation of both the unsaturated species and borane.

Abstract
A Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral C&#8722;H activation/[3+3] cyclization of 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2H&#8208;indazole&#8208;6&#8208;carboxylic acids with iodonium ylides under microwave irradiation for the synthesis of indazole&#8208;fused chromenes has been reported. The critical feature of this method is that the C&#8722;H activation of the C7&#8722;H bond of 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2H&#8208;indazole&#8208;6&#8208;carboxylic acid proceeds regioselectively in the presence of the proximate C5&#8722;H bond without the need of external oxidant. Microwave irradiation reduced the reaction time as compared to conventional heating. The detailed mechanistic study disclosed the mechanistic pathway of the reaction.

Abstract
When &#947;,&#948;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters were treated with 3&#8197;equiv. of aliphatic Grignard reagents in the presence of 10 and 20&#8197;mol% FeCl2 and N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine, regio&#8208; and stereoselective substitution of the epoxide moiety with the aliphatic Grignard reagent occurred, producing exclusively &#948;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#947;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters. Similarly, &#947;,&#948;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;&#945;,&#946;,&#1013;,&#950;&#8208;unsaturated esters and amides underwent transformation to the corresponding &#948;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#947;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#945;,&#946;,&#1013;,&#950;&#8208;unsaturated esters and amides as single isomers, respectively.

         <title>Electrochemically Promoted Skeleton Transformation of 2,1&#8208;Benzisoxazoles to Alkyl Sulfones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
This study developed an electrochemically promoted skeleton transformation reaction of 2,1&#8208;benzisoxazoles to synthesize alkyl sulfones. Alkyl sulfones were synthesized in 68&#8211;93% yield by using 2,1&#8208;benzisoxazole and sulfonate as substrates, and acetonitrile and water as solvents. Mechanism studies showed that this reaction involves ring opening, removal of the oxygen atom of the 2,1&#8208;benzisoxazoles, and C(sp3)&#8208;sulfonylation under electrochemical conditions.

Abstract
The synthesis of enantiomerically enriched &#947;&#8208;oxobutyric acid and succinic acid derivatives based on asymmetric conjugate addition of allomaltol to chalcones or bis(arylidene)acetones in the presence of readily available and recoverable C2&#8208;symmetric tertiary amine&#8208;squaramide organocatalyst has been developed. Ru(III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative transformation of pyran&#8208;4&#8208;ones bearing the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;enone unit to enantiomerically enriched succinic acid derivatives via a one&#8208;pot oxidative fragmentation of both the &#947;&#8208;pyrone ring and activated C=C bond has been elaborated. The developed methodology was applied for scalable asymmetric synthesis of GABAB receptor agonists precursors, RAR receptor agonists and monoaminooxidase (MAO) inhibitors.

         <title>Ruthenium (II)&#8208;Catalysed Regioselective C6 Alkylation of Indoles with Maleimides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Ruthenium (II)&#8208;catalysed regioselective C6 alkylation of indole&#8208;7&#8208;carboxamides with maleimide has been described. Electronically diverse maleimides reacted with various indoles to furnish corresponding C6 substituted succinimide derivatives of indoles with 46&#8211;89% yields. The reaction shows functional group tolerance. The synthetic utility of the reaction has been demonstrated through the conversion of the obtained product to the corresponding hexahydropyridazinyl derivative. We also studied the kinetics of the reaction through intermolecular competitive experiments with electronically distinct indole&#8208;7&#8208;carboxamides.

Abstract
A Ruthenium catalyzed C4&#8208; aminomethyl alkenylation of indoles using substituted propargylamine as an alkenylating agent and pivaloyl as a weak chelating group has been demonstrated. A variety of substituted indoles and propargylamines furnished the desired product in good yields. Control experiments indicate that the C&#8722;H cleavage step is reversible and suggest the possibility of a base&#8208;assisted internal electrophilic substitution (BIES) pathway.

A strategy for the preparation of 4&#8208;quinoxalinone&#8208;substituted pyrazole derivatives by electrochemical functionalization of pyrazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ones is reported. Quinoxalinones, possessing significant biological activities, serve as aryl sources and participate in the transformation under electrochemical conditions without the necessity of adding extra oxidants and catalysts. This method features one&#8208;pot synthesis, scale&#8208;up and late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecule derivatives. Notably, activity testing reveals that some compounds exhibit superior inhibitory effects on the proliferation of A549 cells compared to 5&#8208;fluorouracil.

         <dc:description>A ruthenium(&#8545;)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H acylmethylation of Trp&#8208;containing peptides with &#945;&#8208;chloro ketones has been reported. This reaction features good C&#8208;2 selectivity and chemoselectivity&#65292;making it suitable for the late&#8208;stage modification of Trp&#8208;containing peptides. Low&#8208;cost metal ruthenium as a catalyst enables the reaction to be conducted on a gram scale. This report also discusses the synthetic applications and presents a method to remove the pyridine	directing group. In addition, a plausible mechanism of the C(2)&#8208;H acylmethylation reaction is proposed in this article.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of AMA Synthase from &lt;i&gt;Pyrenophora teres&lt;/i&gt; f. &lt;i&gt;teres&lt;/i&gt; 0&#8208;1 for the Synthesis of Aspergillomarasmine A Analogues and Non&#8208;canonical Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fungal natural product aspergillomarasmine A (AMA) is an inhibitor of metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamases and a promising co&#8208;drug candidate for reversing bacterial &#946;&#8208;lactam resistance. The biosynthesis of AMA from L&#8208;Asp and O&#8208;phospho&#8208;L&#8208;serine is catalyzed by AMA synthase, which possesses high synthetic potential for the biocatalytic preparation of AMA and related aminopolycarboxylic acids. Here, we identified and structurally characterized an AMA synthase from Pyrenophora teres f. teres 0&#8208;1 (PteAMAS). Crystallographic analysis revealed a unique homotetrameric fold and a highly hydrophilic active site, which supports the PLP&#8208;dependent &#946;&#8208;replacement catalytic mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of PteAMAS for the biocatalytic synthesis of AMA and its analogues, achieving structural diversification of the APA1 moiety   through a modular two&#8208;enzyme system involving PteAMAS and a selective C&#8208;N lyase, namely EDDS lyase or 3&#8208;methylaspartate ammonia lyase variant MAL&#8208;Q73A. In addition, we exhibited the usefulness of PteAMAS for convenient synthesis of various S&#8208;alkyl, &#8208;aryl, and &#8208;arylalkyl substituted L&#8208;cysteines, which are valuable non&#8208;canonical amino acids with broad pharmaceutical applications. The present study has not only provided the structural basis for catalysis and substrate recognition by PteAMAS, but also paved the way for biocatalytic preparation of structurally complex AMA analogues and various non&#8208;canonical amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting the Synthetic Utility of 4,5&#8208;Dehydro[2.2]paracyclophane</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>4,5&#8208;Dehydro[2.2]paracyclophane, an aryne species of [2.2]paracyclophane ([2.2]PCP) was reported more than half a century ago. However, despite its potential usefulness for preparing [2.2]PCP derivatives, this species is rarely considered in synthetic applications, probably because the efficiency of aryne generation and reaction with arynophiles are low under harsh reaction conditions of classical methods involving precursors. We have prepared &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;iodoaryl triflate&#8208; and &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;silylaryl triflate&#8208;type precursors and achieved generation of 4,5&#8208;dehydro[2.2]PCP, which reacted with a diverse range of arynophiles to afford functionalized [2.2]PCP derivatives, including [2.2]PCP&#8208;fused &#960;&#8208;extended polyaromatics. Our results highlight the synthetic utility of the historically overlooked 4,5&#8208;dehydro[2.2]PCP intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Synthesis of Chiral Hydrobenzofuranpyrrolidines by Catalytic Asymmetric Dearomative Cyclization and Controlled Epimerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A rapid and straightforward way to access stereoisomeric sets of products bearing multiple stereogenic centers is still a significant challenge in asymmetric catalysis. We present herein our experimental studies on the stereodivergent synthesis of chiral hydrobenzofuran&#8208;fused pyrrolidines with three stereogenic centers via organocatalytic asymmetric dearomative cyclization and epimerization process. Chiral bifunctional thiourea catalyst could successfully promote the enantioselective dearomatization cyclization of 2&#8208;nitrobenzofurans with o&#8208;hydroxy aromatic aldimines, which enabled the synthesis of (3S,3aR,8bR)&#8208;hydrobenzofuran[3.2]pyrrolidines in 79&#8208;92% yields with &gt;20:1 stereoselectivities and 93&#8208;99% enantio&#8208;	selectivities. While catalytic amount of DBU could induce the direct intramolecular epimerization of (3S,3aR,8bR)&#8208;hydrobenzofuran[3.2] pyrrolidines to its diastereomers (3R,3aR,8bR)&#8208;hydrobenzofuran[3.2] pyrrolidines in 72&#8208;87% yields without loss of stereoselectivities. The mechanistic pathways of the epimerization process were investigated by a series of control experiments study. This work provides an alternative and forward solution for the stereodivergent preparation of functionalized pyrrolidines with potential bioactivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual C2 Synthon Strategy for the Synthesis of Pyrimidines: Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H Bond Difunctionalization of Tertiary Alkylamines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a two&#8208;component methodology developed for the synthesis of pyrimidine derivatives using tertiary alkylamines and amidines. Tertiary alkylamines serve as dual C2 synthons through copper&#8208;catalyzed aerobic difunctionalization of the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds. The process operates under mild conditions and uses atmospheric oxygen as the oxidant. Notably, this methodology yields up to 85% and shows a broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies indicate that the annulation proceeds via a radical&#8208;mediated oxidation and C&#8210;N bond coupling process. This approach provides a pathway for synthesizing various heterocycles by employing tertiary alkylamines as dual C2 synthons.</dc:description>

This reductive coupling most likely involves the compatibility of functional groups such as chlorine, benzyl ether, olefin, and acetylene. Moreover, the corresponding poly&#8208;substituted amines were not observed under these conditions.

         <title>Arylation of Secondary Phosphines with Diaryliodonium Salts under Metal&#8208;Free and Non&#8208;Photochemical Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new, efficient, as well as metal&#8208; and irradiation&#8208;free approach for the direct arylation of secondary phosphines has been developed. The reaction employs diaryliodonium salts as electrophilic aryl&#8208;transfer reagents, effecting the P&#8211;Ar bond&#8208;formation in a single step, under mild conditions, using t&#8208;BuOK as a base and DMSO as a solvent, at room temperature. The protocol furnishes expedient access to diverse unsymmetrical triarylphosphines and, upon a one&#8208;pot oxidation, the corresponding triarylphosphine oxides. Experimental and computational studies support the inner sphere aryl&#8208;transfer mechanism through a reductive coupling at the hypervalent iodine center. The calculations also point to a key role played by potassium ions, providing extra stabilization to the P&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming transition state by binding the reactants via cation&#8208;&#960; interactions.

         <title>Bioactive Molecules from Lignocellulose&#8208;derived Platform Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ever&#8208;increasing prevalence of diseases and inadequate resources on Earth are threats to society. Biomass is an abundant resource, and bioactive compounds produced from biomass are environmentally benign in contrast to conventional chemical synthesis methods, which frequently depend on non&#8208;renewable resources. In addition, the functionalized monomers from biomass allow the atom economical synthesis of bioactive molecules. This review aims to provide insight into the synthesis of bioactive molecules from the lignocellulose&#8208;derived platform chemicals. Existing methodology and catalytic systems are summarized for the synthesis of targeted bioactive molecules from cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin&#8208;derived platform chemicals. The biological activities of bioactive molecules obtained from biomass, such as antioxidant, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and anticancer properties, are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Synthesis of Pyrroles from Nitroarenes with Glycols as Reductants</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of N&#8208;(hetero)aryl pyrroles directly from inexpensive and commonly available (hetero)nitroarenes via reduction with pinacol and annulation with 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyls or cyclobutane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols has been described. The process does not require an inert atmosphere and tolerates the presence of air and water. This non&#8208;noble catalytic system shows high chemoselectivity, allowing a diverse range of potentially reducible functional groups such as alkynes, alkenes, halogens, cyano, and carbonyls. Moreover, this strategy enables the reuse of a waste byproduct as reactant, facilitating the formation of challenging 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyls from accessible cyclobutane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols used as reducing agents.</dc:description>

A series of diaryl diselenides, dialkyl diselenides, and heteroaryl&#8208;substituted ynamides was tolerated in this protocol and delivered 4&#8208;selenyloxazolones in 28&#8208;83% yield.

         <title>Introduction of Phosphinine Ring into Aromatic Systems via Alkyne Cyclization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently developed synthetic protocols for the preparation of &#955;3&#8208;phosphanaphthalenes have broadened the general scope of organophosphorus chemistry, but a versatile protocol is still missing. Here, we describe a scalable synthetic approach for the construction of various substituted phosphanaphthalenes. We have obtained 11 derivatives through rigorous study and have demonstrated the robustness of this method. The optical properties of these phosphorus compounds and their aza and carbo analogues have been experimentally compared. Here, we show the power of the method in extending the synthesis to even larger polycyclic aromatic systems with embedded phosphine rings toward its potential applicability to materials science.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This opinionated review underlines the increasing production of 1,3&#8208;propanediol (1,3&#8208;PDO) by whole cell biocatalytic fermentation of biomass and highlights how production has transitioned from petrochemicals to bio&#8208;renewables. Current uses of 1,3&#8208;PDO are listed. Some future prospects for evolving the current technology and expanding the chemical uses of 1,3&#8208;PDO use are discussed, with emphasis on catalytic and atom efficient chemistries.

         <title>Generation of Sulfamoyl Radicals via Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Fixation of Sulfur Dioxide for the Synthesis of Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Herein, we report a new approach for the light&#8208;mediated generation of sulfamoyl radicals using sulfur dioxide as key building block and the direct application of these radicals in the synthesis of sulfonamides. In the presence of different photoredox catalysts, sulfamoyl radicals can be generated directly from SO2 or the SO2 surrogate DABSO (1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane&#183;bis (sulfur dioxide) adduct) and N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts as nitrogen radical precursors. Trapping of the in situ generated sulfamoyl radicals with selected electron&#8208;rich olefins affords different sulfonamides in up to 86% yield in a three&#8208;component procedure. This transformation provides an attractive and complementary approach for the in situ generation of sulfamoyl radicals as synthetic intermediates for the assembly of the sulfonamide functionality, a motif in active pharmaceutical ingredients.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Electrochemical Functionalization of Imidazoheterocycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imidazoheterocycles have extensive applications in the pharmaceutical industry and agrochemicals. A comprehensive overview has been provided on the current advancements in electrochemical functionalization, which has been classified ten different types of reactions. Electrochemical synthesis has emerged as a highly effective method for producing organic molecules, especially in the context of sustainable development. Employing electrons as the traceless oxidant, several C&#8211;H functionalization reactions of imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycles have been achieved at either the C3 or C5 positions. Electrons may serve as the reducing agent to synthesize pyridine rings that are either partially or fully saturated in imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines. The purpose of the review is to attract the interest of the scientific community and promote additional research on the functionalization of imidazoheterocycles using electrochemical methods.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amine compounds are widely found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides. We propose a base&#8208;facilitated synthesis method of polysubstituted aromatic amines. A simple, rapid, plateau&#8208;utilization, and highly regioselective non&#8208;in&#8208;situ amination reaction was achieved by using aryl thianthrenium salt as the aryne precursor, and the arylynyl distortion induced by the substituents. This method provides new possibilities for organic synthesis.</dc:description>

This reaction goes through a hydroamination of the alkynyl fragment. The yields are governed by the electronic factors. Control experiments and DFT calculations suggest that a radical and polar mechanisms are operating in parallel. This transformation goes through first formation and C&#8208;N bond and 1,2&#8208;hydride shift. Derivatization was also carried out to extend the versatility of this methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Construction of C(sp3)&#8208;Ge Bonds: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Germanium (Ge), a congener of carbon, possesses unique properties that hold extensive potential for applications across multiple domains. Recent years have seen significant progress in the development of carbon&#8208;germanium bond formation strategies, particularly those for more challenging C(sp3)&#8208;Ge bonds. This review systematically summarizes the recent advances in C(sp3)&#8208;Ge bond forming methodologies, with particular emphasis on (1) the versatility of transition&#8208;metals, including iron, nickel, copper, rhodium and palladium, as catalysts in broadening reaction scope and controlling selectivity; (2) the powerfulness of organic photocatalysis in achieving mild and selective bond formation, and (3) the sustainability of catalytic electrosynthesis in facilitating chemical oxidant&#8208;/reductant&#8208;free conversions. Additionally, examples of (4) non&#8208;catalytic strategies are also discussed. The representative scopes, as well as mechanistic proposals, of these protocols are highlighted. Through an overview on the current state of research, this review aims to offer insights into the catalytic construction of C(sp3)&#8208;Ge bonds, and provide perspectives on future research directions to address the current challenges.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Mediated Difluoroalkylation of Alkenes Using Mercaptobenzothiazole&#8208;Derived Sulfide Reagent</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A method for the reductive difluoromethylation of alkenes with 2&#8208;difluoromethylthio(benzothiazole) under photocatalytic conditions is described. The reaction involves the generation of the difluoromethyl radical by means of trimethyltriazinane, which serves as a precursor for the strongly reducing cyclic diaminoalkyl radical.

         <title>Radical Carbocyclization Intercepted Reductive C&#8722;C Bond Formation Between 1,n&#8208;Enynes or Dienes and Electron&#8208;Poor Olefins/Alkynes</title>

Abstract
Metal hydride catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) reaction of 1,6&#8208;enyne and electron&#8208;poor alkene progresses through a radical cascade, involving ene&#8208;yne cyclization and exocyclic C&#8722;C bond formation superseding the direct reductive olefin cross&#8208;coupling; which is realized in the current study. The generality of this reaction manifold is demonstrated with a range of functionalized 1,6&#8208;enyne and dienes and involving structurally distinct electron&#8208;poor olefins and alkynes as partners. Current work unveils a merger of MHAT&#8208;based olefin&#8208;hydro functionalization with radical ene&#8208;one cyclization.

         <title>Formate Salts: The Rediscovery of Their Radical Reaction under Light Irradiation Opens New Avenues in Organic Synthesis</title>

Abstract
Formates are abundantly available and inexpensive commodity chemical, widely used in laboratory and industrial organic synthesis. Formates are promising hydrogen carrier and green C1 source, and have also been a subject of research as SET reductants in recent years. Compared to the toxic and flammable gas carbon monoxide, which also serves as a C1 source, formates are easier to handle, store, and transport, and are more environmentally friendly. Therefore, in recent studies of radical reactions, formate is not only as an ideal source of green carbonyl, which is of great significance to synthesize carboxyl compounds with various structures, but also as a SET reductant for editing organic molecules either in scientific research or industrial production. The activation and conversion of formate, as a source of C1 or a SET reductant, is a very challenging and hot research field in organic synthesis.

         <title>Shaking Up the Friedl&#228;nder Reaction: Rapid, Scalable Mechanochemical Synthesis of Polyaryl&#8208;Substituted Quinolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Quinolines are ubiquitous heterocyclic aromatic scaffolds, which can be found in many natural and synthetic products. They are highly valued for their pharmacological and electrochemical properties, encouraging the discovery of new routes for quinoline synthesis and diversification. In particular, polyaryl&#8208;substituted quinolines have recently surged as useful substrates for a wide variety of applications, yet their synthetic routes remain difficult and inefficient. Herein, we report a rapid and novel mechanochemical Friedl&#228;nder synthesis of polyaryl&#8208;substituted quinolines under basic conditions using ball milling. The optimized reaction conditions resulted in moderate to excellent yields ranging from 48% to &gt;95% and demonstrated broad functional group tolerance at 1&#8197;hour reaction times. We further show a new route for the synthesis of photocatalyst DPQN2,4&#8722;di&#8722;OMe and photo&#8208;ligand PPQN2,4&#8722;di&#8722;OMe as well as OLED donor&#8208;acceptor pCzPPQ, electron transport material oligoquinoline TQB and organic semiconductor DPA. A gram scale reaction was also achieved using Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM), providing an isolated yield of 87% after a simple recrystallization in ethanol.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling between Alkylidenecyclopropanes and Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The combination of a Pd(0) source and a phosphoramidite ligand promotes a formal allylic cross&#8208;coupling between alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) and boronic acids to yield synthetically appealing 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes. Remarkably, the reaction proceeds both under neutral and basic conditions, and works with both aryl&#8208; and alkenylboronic acids. DFT calculations suggest that the reaction entails a C&#8722;C activation/protonation mechanism instead of a hydropalladation pathway, which has been frequently proposed for other metal&#8208;promoted hydrofunctionalizations of ACPs.

Abstract
C&#8208;alkyl glycosides play a crucial role in various bioactive compounds. However, the synthesis of C&#8208;alkyl glycosides poses significant challenges, particularly through C(sp3)&#8722;H glycosylation. Here, we report a set of reactions for constructing C&#8208;alkyl glycosides through directing&#8208;group&#8208;mediated functionalization of unactivated &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds under mild conditions. These reactions not only achieve high regioselectivity and stereoselectivity in glycosylation, but also exhibit a wide substrate scope. They are compatible with both arene and alkane substrates, as well as natural and unnatural amino acid substrates. Mechanistic studies have shown that the directing&#8208;group 8&#8208;aminoquinoline (AQ) and picolinamide (PA) may affect the chirality of the &#946;&#8208;carbon of L&#8208;valine through a sterically favorable trans&#8208;palladacycle intermediate, resulting in (R) or (S) configuration of glycosylated amino acid, respectively. These reactions are promising to provide a convenient and powerful tool for constructing C&#8208;alkyl glycosides and carbohydrate&#8208;based drugs in the future.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl glycosides play a crucial role in various bioactive compounds. However, the synthesis of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl glycosides poses significant challenges, particularly through C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;

Abstract
A copper or silver&#8208;catalyzed cascade addition/5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization/isomerization reaction of isothiocyanate with ynone has been developed. This strategy enables the synthesis of a variety of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene&#8208;5&#8208;aminothiophen&#8208;3&#8208;one derivatives with diverse substitutions in a single vessel. The method is featured with pot&#8208;economy as well as regio&#8208; and Z&#8208;selectivity. Several biologically active molecules could be modified using this strategy. Moreover, the relevant indole&#8208;fused and indole&#8208;substituted thiophenone derivatives were also assembled in one pot by merging this strategy with other bond formation methods. Based on the experiments and the related reports, a cascade pathway triggered by the addition of ynone&#8208;derived radical towards the C(sp)&#8208;atom of isothiocyanate was proposed to elucidate the probable process of the transformation.

Abstract
Scarce dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazinoisoindole framework bearing two points of diversity was prepared through a cascade process based on concomitant Csp3&#8722;N and Csp2&#8722;N bond formation. This approach consists of an amidation in basic medium of a tosyl group by nucleophilic substitution followed by Cu&#8208;mediated Goldberg reaction in the same operation. The required &#946;&#8208;bromoenamide bearing a tosyl group was obtained by tosylation of fused brominated N,O&#8208;acetals for the first time in acidic medium using submolar amounts of PTSA. The obtained piperazines are useful building blocks as illustrated by the formation of a pentacyclic product via the intramolecular interception of the enamide function.

Abstract
A three&#8208;component one&#8208;pot synthesis of substituted azepines was realized by gold/magnesium orthogonal relay catalysis. The one&#8208;pot synthesis involves simply mixing and heating propiolates, imines, and activated cyclopropanes to initiate a gold&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;enyne metathesis between propiolates and imines, followed by a magnesium&#8208;catalyzed [4+3] cycloaddition reaction of the resultant 1&#8208;azabutadienes and the cyclopropanes, yielding substituted azepines. The substituted azepines including 22 derivatives could be successfully prepared in good to excellent yield (61&#8211;95%). The reaction was also conducted on one&#8208;gram scale.

Abstract
Since the review of Yorimitsu and Oshima in 2010, the past 15&#8197;years have witnessed significant progresses in the application of 1&#8208;alkynylphosphorus compounds in organic synthesis. Owing to the reactive carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond in association with the electron&#8208;withdrawing phosphoryl group, they easily undergo transition metal&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic addition reactions at the &#946;&#8208;position with carbon&#8208; and heteroatom&#8208;based nucleophiles to afford structurally diverse 1&#8208;alkenyl phosphorus compounds. Especially, when 1&#8208;alkynylphosphonates or phosphinates are used, intramolecular substitution reactions on P&#8208;atom might occur in some cases, which would result in the formation of P&#8208;based heterocycles. In addition, the existing triple bond makes them prone to go through addition reaction initiated cyclization reactions and [2+2], [2+3], [2+4], [2+5] and [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions with other unsaturated bonds, which provides an efficient access to various P&#8208;based heterocycles and phosphorylated carbon&#8208; and heterocycles.

         <title>Synthesis and HHDH&#8208;Catalyzed Kinetic Resolution of Propargylic Epoxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The versatile reactivity of propargylic epoxides and alcohols, due to the presence of a triple bond, is used in the synthesis of various organic compounds and building blocks. However, there are not many known methods for the preparation of optically pure propargylic epoxides and alcohols, and the existing ones often require specific reagents. Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) can be used to obtain enantiomerically pure compounds from racemic epoxides. These important biocatalysts facilitate epoxide ring&#8208;opening reactions with unnatural nucleophiles such as azides. Here we report the biocatalytic transformation of propargylic epoxides using HHDHs. Six propargylic epoxides with different substituents were synthesized. Kinetic resolution reactions catalyzed by HHDHs in the presence of azide were performed. Two enzymes with opposite stereoselectivities, HheC and HheA2&#8208;N178A were used and yielded azido alcohols (98&#8211;&gt;99% ee, E&#8208;value &gt;200) and epoxides (29&#8211;88% ee). The best performing p&#8208;tolyl propargylic epoxide derivative was used in a sequence of two enzymatic reactions to obtain both enantiomers of the &#946;&#8208;azido alcohol and the (R)&#8208;enantiomer of the &#945;&#8208;azido alcohol, each in &gt;99% ee, through complete conversion of the starting epoxide. The obtained azido alcohols were used in further transformations. The click reactions with terminal acetylenes gave triazolyl propargylic alcohols (&gt;99% ee, 90&#8211;98% yield). In the case of the &#945;&#8208;azido alcohol, the click reaction was followed by intramolecular cyclization to form the dihydrofuranyl triazole motif that is found in biologically active compounds.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Direct Decarboxylative Functionalization of Aromatic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Aryl radicals are important intermediates in organic synthesis. The generation of these reactive species via direct decarboxylation of inexpensive and readily available aromatic carboxylic acids is an attractive goal. However, such a process intrinsically exhibits high energy barriers to overcome, which in consequence usually require precious metal catalysis, stoichiometric oxidants and harsh conditions, suffering from limitations such as poor functional group tolerance and low atom economy. In recent years, photochemical reactions have provided new approaches to address this challenge. Three major strategies have been introduced in this emerging field: 1) one&#8208;pot in&#8208;situ activation of benzoic acids to generate intermediates such as benzoyl hypobromites or hypoiodites; 2) the use of specialized photocatalysts like biphenyl/1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene to promote decarboxylation through photo&#8208;induced electron transfer or charge transfer processes; 3) photo&#8208;induced LMCT (Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer) strategy where copper or iron salts coordinate to the carboxylate anion and generate aromatic radicals upon visible light excitation. On the basis of these three strategies, this review will systematically summarize the development of visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced direct decarboxylative functionalization of aromatic carboxylic acids, focusing on the reaction mechanism and substrate scope, and discuss their prospects in organic synthesis.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Multisubstituted Hydroindole Derivatives via [3+2] Annulations of p&#8208;Quinamines with Nitroalkenes</title>

Abstract
The synthesis of two stereoisomers of hydroindole derivatives was achieved through [3+2] annulations of p&#8208;quinamines with nitroalkenes. Catalyst&#8208;free or in the presence of DMAP, the annulation reactions were employed to produce the target products containing four contiguous stereogenic centers. This method enables the efficient construction of multisubstituted and functionalized hydroindole derivatives from readily accessible building blocks and reagents. Furthermore, the anti&#8208;inflammatory activity of some resulting hydroindoles was evaluated, with three derivative products showing effective inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

Abstract
A molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of N2,C3&#8208;disubstituted 2H&#8208;indazoles from readily available 2&#8208;acylazobenzenes via deoxygenation of C=O and annulation has been described. The non&#8208;noble metal catalytic system has good tolerance of functional groups, and various N2,C3&#8208;disubstituted 2H&#8208;indazoles have been constructed in 24% to 99% yield. This reaction is easy to scale&#8208;up and has shown its applications in deriving valuable fluorescent and bioactive compounds.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A molybdenum-catalyzed synthesis of N2,C3-disubstituted 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indazoles from readily available 2-acylazobenzenes via deoxygenation of C=O and annulation has been described. The non-noble metal catalytic system has good tolerance of functional groups, and various N2,C3-disubstituted 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indazoles have been constructed in 24% to 99% yield. This reaction is easy to scale-up and has shown its applications in deriving valuable fluorescent and bioactive compounds. The plausible mechanism shows the plausible processes of molybdenum-catalyzed deoxygenative annulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxidation State and Halogen Influence on the NHC&#8208;Gold&#8208;Halide&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of Propargylic Amides</title>

Abstract
The homogeneously catalyzed cycloisomerization reaction of propargylic amides was tested as benchmark reaction for two homologous series of Au(I) and Au(III) complexes with NHC ligands. This reaction is known to afford either aromatic oxazoles or dihydrooxazoles, depending on the oxidation state of the applied gold catalysts. For this purpose, symmetric and unsymmetric NHC ligands with mixed alkyl or benzyl substituents (1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;imidazolyl&#8208;2yl or 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;imidazolyl&#8208;2&#8208;yl) and the corresponding Au(I) and Au(III) derivatives were prepared and characterized by analytical methods, IR and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies, and by X&#8208;ray diffraction methods. Ten NHC&#8208;gold(I) and NHC&#8208;gold(III) complexes were tested on the cyclization reactions by adding gold catalysts in the presence and absence of AgPF6. Noteworthy, only the 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;gold(III) trichloride was able to give selectively the aromatic oxazole without the addition of the silver salt. Interestingly, on contrary to what is reported in the literature, the use of gold(I) or gold(III) complexes does not influence the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reaction, while the halide bound to the metal does. In this regard, a mechanism purposing the dihydrooxazole as an intermediate for the formation of aromatic oxazole is proposed.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Interaction Enabled Ru(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of (Multi)&#8208;Substituted Pyridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Herein, we report a cost&#8208;effective synthesis of various multi&#8208;substituted pyridine derivatives, especially 2&#8208;aryl pyridines, using secondary alcohols and 1,3&#8208;diol as the primary feedstock with ammonium acetate serving as nitrogen donor, catalyzed by a new well&#8208;defined singlet mono&#8208;radical Ru(III)&#8208;catalyst featuring a cyclopentadienyl group, one PPh3, and a redox&#8208;active scaffold &#8722;N1&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine having a pendant &#8208;NH2 arm. The &#8208;NH2 arm of the catalyst facilitates the generation of the critical reactive intermediates by enhancing the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon center of the diols or diketones by forming hydrogen bonds, making it more catalytically effective over the similar other Ru&#8208;catalysts having no pendant &#8208;NH2 arm. The Ru&#8208;catalyst also functionalizes 2&#8208;aryl pyridine moieties with different coupling partners, such as aryl iodides, terminal alkynes, and styrene derivatives at the o&#8208;position of the phenyl ring.

Abstract
Photo&#8208;promoted cyanomethyl radical procedures for the preparation of 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;indenes and 2,8&#8208;dihydrocyclopenta[a]indenes from phenyl&#8208;linked 1,6&#8208;enynes with &#945;&#8208;halogenated acetonitriles are reported. The iodocyanomethylation/cyclization is performed via an atom&#8208;transfer radical addition (ATRA) strategy under photocatalyst&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. In particular, the photoinduced cyanomethylative cascade bicyclization is carried out under the fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3/Na2CO3 catalystic symtem and visible light irradiation. These methods offer a one&#8208;step and atom&#8208;economical access to diverse cyano&#8208;group containing five&#8208;membered rings with broad substrate scope and high selectivity. A plausible reaction mechanism is also proposed.

Abstract
Trimethyl phosphite promotes the synthesis of 2,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted 2H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. The protocol developed affords a two&#8208;step method towards triazoles from available reagents. 3,4&#8208;Disubstituted isoxazolones are initially coupled with diazonium tetrafluoroborates. The subsequent reaction is triggered by a single electron transfer from the phosphite to the diazenylisoxazolone under heating or blue LED irradiation at room temperature. The radical anion cascade proceeds via a ring opening/decarboxylation/cyclization sequence. The synthesized triazoles show promising fluorescence in the region from 340&#8197;nm to 450&#8197;nm with a quantum yield up to 81.6%. The emission energy depends slightly on the substituent nature at the triazole carbon atoms. If an electron&#8208;donor group is introduced into the N2 substituent of the triazole ring, it results in a bathochromic shift of the luminescence energy.

         <title>Tandem Electrochemical Redox/Condensation Reaction Between 2&#8208;Amino Nitrobenzenes and Aliphatic Alcohols: An Approach to Benzimidazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Tandem reactions via electrocatalytic annulations have emerged as a strategy for the construction of heterocycles. Herein, a two&#8208;component electrochemical annulation via sequential reduction, oxidation, and condensation steps to synthesize valuable benzimidazoles motifs is reported. This reaction, which utilizes electricity as both the oxidants and reductants, tolerates a broad range of functional groups. Detailed mechanistic studies including control experiments, cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis, and key reaction intermediate characterization, reveals an intermolecular electrochemical redox/cyclization pathway.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted site&#8208;selective difluoroalkoxylation of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines has been achieved using N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) as a fluorinating agent. This practical reaction has a wide range of substrate scope for both imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines and alcohols to give 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;arylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines in 65&#8211;93% yields. The reaction proceeded at room temperature, showed high functional group tolerance, and was amenable to scale&#8208;up. Based on mechanistic investigation, a radical pathway is proposed.

         <title>Enantiocomplementary Synthesis of Tetrahydrofurans by Engineered Halohydrin Dehalogenases</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Chiral tetrahydrofurans are prevalent structural motifs in biologically active compounds, approved drugs and natural products, but relevant enantiocomplementary synthesis remains underdeveloped. In this study, wild type halohydrin dehalogenase HheC from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1, was first discovered to enable the intramolecular substitution of &#948;&#8208;halohydrins for the formation of tetrahydrofurans but with unsatisfied activity and stereoselectivity. Through structure&#8208;guided protein engineering, two completely enantiocomplementary variants T134M and P84L/W139A of HheC were obtained for the synthesis of tetrahydrofurans by the kinetic resolution of &#948;&#8208;halohydrins (both giving products with up to 99% e.e., E&gt;200). This research unveiled the halohydrin dehalogenases&#8217; catalytic ability to form chiral cyclic ethers larger ring size than three&#8208;membered epoxides, which has hitherto been unexplored, and provided an enzymatic synthesis access to valuably enantiocomplementary tetrahydrofurans.

A sage seated by a cascading stream (symbolizing a flow system) holds deuterium and hydrogen atoms and determines the reaction pathway for ClCF2H molecules in the sky. By varying the addition and mixing sequences within a flow system, ClCF2H gas can undergo an SN2 reaction with heteroatom anions to produce X&#8208;CF2H products, or be selectively converted into difluorocarbenes for a carbene&#8208;based fragment coupling, yielding X&#8208;CF2D products.

         <title>Hydrofluoroether Synthesis through One&#8208;Pot Anodic Iodoalkoxylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of carbon&#8208;fluorine bonds can profoundly influence the chemical and physical properties of drugs, agrochemicals, and materials. Different methods allow the installation of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H units and C&#8211;F bonds including trifluoro&#8208; and difluoromethoxylations, reflecting the limited diversity of reactions available to synthetic chemists. We introduce the trifluoroethoxy group through an electro&#8208;oxidative iodination of alkenes as a versatile substituent for fluorine chemists. An iodoarene serves as an unusual iodine source facilitating the 1,2&#8208;iodoalkoxylation of a broad range of industrially relevant aliphatic alkenes in high yields (31&#8211;98%) showing high Markovnikov regioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Fe(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Hydroamination of 1,3&#8208;Dienes Improved by Using Triphenylphosphate as an Additive</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report that the combination of Fe(OTf)3 and triphenylphosphate (TPP, (PhO)3PO) has proven to be an effective catalyst for the intramolecular hydroamination of amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes with an efficiency and scope superior to previously reported methods. This catalytic system demonstrated consistent performance with diverse aminodienes as well as aminoolefins, providing five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles. We propose a Lewis/Br&#248;nsted acid cocatalysis mechanism involving proton transfer through hydrogen bonding with TPP. Catalyst system consisting of inexpensive and nontoxic iron salt and phosphate additive, relatively low loading and recyclability of catalyst, and rapid and high&#8208;yielding reaction are the advantages of this protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Methodology to Control the Regioselective Installation of a Carboxylic Acid for the Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Diarylpropionic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A stepwise copper&#8208;catalyzed boracarboxylation then palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling methodology was developed to access 2,3&#8208;diarylpropionic acid derivatives regioselectively by pre&#8208;setting the position of the carboxylic acid in the boracarboxylation reaction. This method provides access to a wide range of aryl and heteroaryl products in up to 80% isolated yield. Pharmaceutical potential was demonstrated by synthesizing a glucagon receptor antagonist drug in 3&#8208;steps (31% overall yield) from commercially available 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylstyrene.</dc:description>

Pharmaceutical potential was demonstrated by synthesizing a glucagon receptor antagonist drug in 3-steps (31% overall yield) from commercially available 4-tert-butylstyrene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
We have developed a method for the synthesis of thieno[3,2&#8208;b]furans on the basis of a strategy consisting of a formal [3+2] cycloaddition utilizing the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement and a subsequent Br&#248;nsted base&#8208;mediated cyclization. The method streamlines access to a wide range of well&#8208;organized 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted thieno[3,2&#8208;b]furans that are otherwise difficult to synthesize and is also applicable to the syntheses of 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted seleno[3,2&#8208;b]furans.

         <title>Synthesis of Ladderanes by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclodimerization of Allenynes: Scope and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We have developed a Ni&#8208;catalyzed cyclodimerization of 1,6&#8208;allenyenes which affords pentacyclic derivatives containing a [3]&#8208;ladderane. Six new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds are formed in a single operation which is fully atom&#8208;economical. The reaction proceeds with an inexpensive catalyst and shows a broad scope in the alkyne, the allene and the tethering group. A computational and experimental study on the reaction mechanism suggests that this process proceeds by oxidative cyclometallation of the allenyne coordinated to Ni(0) followed by reductive elimination leading to cyclobutenes. Then, two of these molecules are coupled following a related cyclometallation&#8208;reductive elimination sequence, the latter being the rate&#8208;limiting step.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Mediated Carbamoyl Amination of Alkylidenecyclopropane&#8208;Tethered Carbamoyl Chlorides: Synthesis of Functionalized 2&#8208;Quinolones</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
The transition metal catalyzed cyclization of alkene&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chloride has emerged as a tool to construct oxindoles bearing quaternary centers. Most of these reactions proceed via carbometalation&#8208;initiated 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization followed by nucleophilic trapping of the resulting &#963; alkyl&#8208;metal species to achieve diverse functionalized oxindoles. The 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig type cyclization of alkene&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chloride has been rarely reported. Herein, a zinc&#8208;mediated carbamoyl amination of alkylidenecyclopropane&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides with anilines for the synthesis of functionalized 2&#8208;quinolones was developed. A range of different substituted 2&#8208;quinolones were prepared in 65&#8211;89% yield from alkylidenecyclopropane&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides and aniline derivatives using a Zn/TMSCl system.

         <title>Copper Powder&#8208;Mediated Tandem Hydroamination Cyclization&#8208;Hydrocyanation of Alkyne&#8208;Tethered Ketoximes toward Cyano&#8208;Featured Cyclic Nitrones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The copper powder&#8208;mediated tandem hydroamination cyclization&#8208;hydrocyanation of alkyne&#8208;tethered ketoximes is described by using TMSCN as the commercially available cyanating reagent. This methodology provides an alternative strategy for the synthesis of a series of structurally important cyano&#8208;substituted cyclic nitrones. The hydrocyanation process exhibits distinct regioselectivity depending on the substituent pattern of the alkyne moiety. Moreover, the synthesized products were shown to be capable of undergoing various derivatization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition of Alkynes to Form Arenes and Pyridines at Low Catalyst Loadings</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the Ni&#8208;catalyzed cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes at very low loadings of catalysts (0.05 mol% for all substrates). The nickel catalyst containing a terphenyl phosphine ligand allows carrying out the reactions at room temperature in only 30 min, providing the arene products as a single regioisomer in most cases The Ni complex is also competent for the synthesis of polysubstituted pyridines through the cycloadditions of diynes and nitriles at mild temperatures (25 &#186; or 50 &#186;C) and low Ni loadings (1 mol%). Experimental data and computational studies support the involvement of monoligated PNi species in all fundamental steps of the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>DMSO/SOCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Thiomethylnaphthalenes from Propargyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we reported the straightforward synthesis of thiomethylnaphthalenes via the reaction of propargyl alcohols with DMSO/SOCl2, which also provided easy access to deuterated thiomethyl and other thioalkyl scaffolds when deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide and dialkyl sulfoxides were used, respectively. In addition, the thiomethyl group can be readily derivatized to the corresponding sulfoxide, sulfone, and sulfoximine of interesting photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Tropone hydrazides in [10+2]&#8208;hetero&#8208;higher&#8208;order cycloaddition for the synthesis of tetrahydropyridazine derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[10+2]&#8208;Hetero&#8208;higher&#8208;order cycloaddition between tropone hydrazides (acting as 10&#960;&#8208;components) and 3&#8208;alkylidene oxindoles (acting as 2&#960;&#8208;components) has been established. Under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis the reaction proceeded in a fully peri&#8208; and diastereoselective manner with the stereochemical outcome governed mainly by electronic interactions. Following such a strategy, a series of structurally diverse tetrahydropyridazines were prepared in 30&#8208;70% yields. Furthermore, the potential of the obtained cycloadducts has been confirmed in selected chemoselective transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemically Induced Approaches to the Syntheses of &#946;&#8208;Lactams</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactam scaffolds is of paramount importance due to their extensive applications in pharmaceuticals, particularly as antibiotics. Visible light photocatalysis has emerged as a revolutionary approach in this domain, providing a sustainable and efficient pathway for &#946;&#8208;lactam construction. In this review, we meticulously discuss the recent developments in the synthesis of photocatalysed &#946;&#8208;lactam frameworks.A key focus is the Staudinger reaction, traditionally a cornerstone in &#946;&#8208;lactam synthesis, and its adaptation to visible light photocatalysis. We explore the mechanistic intricacies of the Staudinger reaction under photochemical conditions, along with other pivotal cyclization strategies enabled by visible light. By illuminating the novel photocatalytic routes to &#946;&#8208;lactams, this review provides a thorough understanding of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques and sets the stage for future innovations in the green synthesis of these critical compounds.</dc:description>
