         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Four&#8208;Component Tandem Sulfonylation and Carbonylation of 1,6&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component tandem sulfonylation and carbonylation of 1,6&#8208;enynes has been developed for the rapid construction of functionalized succinimides bearing sulfone and carbonyl motifs.

A novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component tandem sulfonylation and carbonylation of 1,6&#8208;enynes has been developed for the rapid construction of succinimide, sulfone, and carbonyl motifs simultaneously. In the presence of very low palladium catalyst loading, the reaction of 1,6&#8208;enynes with nucleophiles proceeded smoothly to afford a wide range of sulfone&#8208; and carbonyl&#8208;containing succinimide derivatives with high yields and excellent selectivity. Notably, modifications of bioactive molecules were also demonstrated by using this method.

         <title>Revisiting the Role of Intramolecular Proton Donation in ATC Foldamer Catalysts for Asymmetric Nitro&#8208;Michael Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterocyclic &#947;&#8208;peptide foldamers are structurally fine&#8208;tuned to improve the enantioselective nitro&#8208;Michael addition of ketones to nitroolefins. Modifications around the catalytic site enhance transition state organization and proton transfer, leading to significantly improved rates and selectivity. This work underscores the potential of &#947;&#8208;peptidic scaffolds in the rational design of chiral organocatalysts. 

The structural optimization of ATC&#8208;based foldamer catalysts for the enantioselective nitro&#8208;Michael addition of ketones to nitroolefins is reported. Building on the previous work with heteroaromatic &#947;&#8208;peptides, the influence of the spatial arrangement and flexibility around the catalytic site is investigated. A series of modified sequences are designed to fine&#8208;tune transition state preorganization while revisiting the contribution of an intramolecular proton donor function in ATC catalysts. These modifications lead to enhanced catalytic performance, with faster reaction rates and improved enantioselectivities under optimized conditions.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Dearomatization of 2,3&#8208;Disubstituted Indoles with &#945;&#8208;(3&#8208;Indolyl)propargylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomatization of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles was achieved through a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition. This reaction employed in situ&#8208;generated alkyne 3&#8208;methylene&#8208;3H&#8208;indoles from &#945;&#8208;(3&#8208;indolyl)propargylic alcohols, providing a route to chiral indole imine&#8208;tetrasubstituted allene skeletons. 

This work presents an efficient strategy for the dearomatization of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles to access chiral indole imine&#8208;tetrasubstituted allene skeletons. The transformation is achieved through a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition with alkyne 3&#8208;methylene&#8208;3H&#8208;indoles, generated in&#8201;situ from &#945;&#8208;(3&#8208;indolyl) propargylic alcohols. A series of chiral compounds possessing both axial and central chirality were synthesized in good to high yields with high asymmetric induction. Supported by control experiments, a plausible mechanism is proposed to elucidate the reaction pathway.

         <title>Glycine Synthesis From Methanol by a Cofactor&#8208;Neutral In&#8201;Vitro Multienzyme Cascade</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cofactor&#8208;neutral in&#8201;vitro multienzyme cascade is developed to allow the synthesis of glycine from methanol and NH3, which surpasses traditional &#8220;cell factory&#8221; paradigms, offering a novel and efficient C1&#8208;to&#8208;amino acid transformation.

The global demand for amino acids continues to rise, yet traditional synthesis methods face environmental and safety challenges. To contribute to a sustainable future vision, we herein report a novel cofactor&#8208;neutral in&#8201;vitro multienzyme cascade that directly converts methanol, a renewable C1 feedstock, into glycine under mild conditions. A two&#8208;step strategy achieves 82.2% methanol&#8208;to&#8208;glycolaldehyde and 86.0% glycolaldehyde&#8208;to&#8208;glycine conversion, respectively. At 500&#8201;mM methanol, it yields 18.8&#8201;mM glycine after 6&#8201;h, which represents a 26.8&#8208;fold improvement over the one&#8208;pot approach. These results demonstrate the potential of modular in&#8201;vitro multienzyme catalysis for efficient C1&#8208;to&#8208;amino acid transformation and establish a foundation for the synthesis of many other complex nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Biocatalytic Construction of a Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer Magnetic Resonance Imaging Nucleoside Probe: Synthesis and Evaluation of 5&#8208;Methyl&#8208;5,6&#8208;Dihydrothymidine</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al&#8208;Hilfi et al. present a biocatalytic strategy for synthesizing 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;5,6&#8208;dihydrothymidine (5&#8208;MDHT), a sensitive MRI contrast agent. The study demonstrates that recombinant enzyme catalysis offers an efficient, sustainable, and eco&#8208;friendly alternative to traditional chemical synthesis for producing clinically relevant imaging probes.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a cornerstone of modern clinical diagnostics, often enhanced by contrast agents. Traditionally, these agents are chemically synthesized, which can involve complex, costly, and environmentally unfriendly processes. Here, we report a novel biocatalytic approach for the efficient, safe, and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis of 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;5,6&#8208;dihydrothymidine (5&#8208;MDHT), a potent chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST)&#8208;MRI probe for imaging in&#8201;vivo expression of the Herpes Simplex Virus Type&#8208;1 Thymidine Kinase (HSV1&#8208;TK) reporter gene. We demonstrate that 5&#8208;MDHT can be biosynthesized via one&#8208; or two&#8208;step enzymatic reactions using human purine nucleoside phosphorylase (hPNPase) and the SgvMVAV SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferase. hPNPase catalyzed the base&#8208;exchange reaction with catalytic efficiencies (kcat/KM) between 138 and 316&#8201;s&#8722;1&#183;M&#8722;1, while SgvMVAV methylation of 5,6&#8208;dihydrothymidine yielded 5&#8208;MDHT with a catalytic efficiency of 26&#8201; s&#8722;1&#183;M&#8722;1. Molecular dynamics simulations supported the enzymatic binding and selectivity observed experimentally. The resulting 5&#8208;MDHT was validated using CEST&#8208;MRI, showing a distinct exchangeable imino proton signal at 5.3&#8201;ppm. These findings highlight the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of the biocatalysts and establish biocatalysis as a viable platform for producing clinically relevant MRI contrast agents.

&lt;p&gt;Al-Hilfi et al. present a biocatalytic strategy for synthesizing 5-methyl-5,6-dihydrothymidine (5-MDHT), a sensitive MRI contrast agent. The study demonstrates that recombinant enzyme catalysis offers an efficient, sustainable, and eco-friendly alternative to traditional chemical synthesis for producing clinically relevant imaging probes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a cornerstone of modern clinical diagnostics, often enhanced by contrast agents. Traditionally, these agents are chemically synthesized, which can involve complex, costly, and environmentally unfriendly processes. Here, we report a novel biocatalytic approach for the efficient, safe, and eco-friendly synthesis of 5-methyl-5,6-dihydrothymidine (5-MDHT), a potent chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST)-MRI probe for imaging in&#8201;vivo expression of the Herpes Simplex Virus Type-1 Thymidine Kinase (HSV1-TK) reporter gene. We demonstrate that 5-MDHT can be biosynthesized via one- or two-step enzymatic reactions using human purine nucleoside phosphorylase (hPNPase) and the SgvM&lt;sup&gt;VAV&lt;/sup&gt; SAM-dependent methyltransferase. hPNPase catalyzed the base-exchange reaction with catalytic efficiencies (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;/K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;) between 138 and 316&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, while SgvM&lt;sup&gt;VAV&lt;/sup&gt; methylation of 5,6-dihydrothymidine yielded 5-MDHT with a catalytic efficiency of 26&#8201; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Based Materials for Electrocatalytic Glycerol Oxidation to Value&#8208;Added C1&#8211;C3 Chemicals</title>

Glycerol, a cheap biodiesel byproduct, offers a sustainable path via electrocatalytic oxidation (GOR). Replacing the oxygen evolution reaction, GOR enables energy&#8208;saving coproduction of high&#8208;value chemicals and green hydrogen under mild conditions, reducing emissions. This review focuses on nanostructuring, defect engineering, and single&#8208;atom catalysts for designing efficient and low&#8208;cost transition metal catalysts for GOR to produce C1&#8211;C3 chemicals.

Glycerol, as the primary by&#8208;product in the biodiesel production process, is abundant and cost&#8208;effective. Its efficient conversion into other chemicals offers a promising strategy for alleviating the energy crisis. Electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) holds significant application potential due to its mild reaction conditions and lack of additional oxidants, enabling the production of various value&#8208;added chemicals such as lactic acid (LA), dihydroxyacetone (DHA), glyceric acid (GLA), oxalic acid (OA), and formic acid (FA). When GOR is used to replace the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), it enables the coproduction of high&#8208;value oxidation products and H2 while minimizing energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. This has important research significance and value for the conversion of biomass resources and the energy&#8208;efficient production of &#8220;green hydrogen.&#8221; Consequently, designing efficient and low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts to achieve high activity and selectivity in GOR is a central research objective. Among these, transition metal materials demonstrate significant advantages. This review introduces the types of transition metal catalysts used for GOR and discusses recent catalyst design strategies to enhance GOR activity and selectivity, including nanostructure regulation, defects and surface engineering, heterostructure construction, and single&#8208;atom catalysts. In addition, the practical applications of GOR as well as sustainability studies are discussed. Finally, we summarize the current challenges facing transition metal catalysts in GOR and discuss future prospects.

         <title>Demonstrating a Folding Strategy Utilizing Phosphine&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Rauhut&#8211;Currier Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic strategies to access new classes of indanes and dibenzocycloheptanes employing an intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier reaction are outlined. In essence, this work contributes to demonstrating the folding strategy of diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis. The scope and generality of the methods have been rigorously validated.

A folding strategy of the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis (DOS) utilizing nucleophilic organophosphine&#8208;promoted intramolecular Rauhut&#8211;Currier reaction is presented. Besides establishing a DOS variant, the strategy facilitates the rapid synthesis of highly substituted indanones and dibenzocycloheptanones under metal&#8208;free and neutral conditions. Phosphines efficiently catalyze the transformation of various tethered bis&#8208;enones, resulting in the formation of &#946;&#8208;alkylated &#945;&#8208;arylidene/allylidene indanones and dibenzocycloheptanones. These scaffolds are commonly found in numerous bioactive natural products and pharmaceutically relevant compounds. The broad applicability of the method across a wide range of substrates is demonstrated, and further enhances the skeletal and stereochemical diversity through several postsynthetic modifications.

An efficient synthesis of pyridyl&#8208;substituted unsymmetrical ureas has been accomplished by the reaction of 2&#8208;aminopyridines with N&#8208;arylmaleimides in the presence of catalytic copper acetate.

         <title>Chiral Phosphoric Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Reductive Amination: Accessing 8&#8208;Arylquinoline Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic asymmetric reductive amination is developed for the synthesis of valuable axially chiral 8&#8208;arylquinoline architectures, which features good&#8208;to,&#8208;high enantioselectivities (up to 96:4 er), broad functionality tolerance, and versatile downstream transformations. DFT calculations reveal a unique racemization mechanism involving the formation of quinolinium cation intermediate. Furthermore, a &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; two&#8208;step procedure of asymmetric transfer hydrogenation is found to be capable of increasing the optical purity of quinoline products by a cascade kinetic resolution step(up&#160;to&#8201;&gt;&#8201;99:1 er).

Disclosed here is an atroposelective dynamic kinetic asymmetric reductive amination catalyzed by chiral phosphoric acid, which provides access to a series of axially chiral 8&#8208;arylquinolines in 50&#8211;97% yields with good&#8208;to&#8208;high enantioselectivities (85.5:14.5&#8208;96:4 er). The formation of quinolinium cation intermediate is found to play a key role in facilitating racemization, thereby enabling a dynamic kinetic resolution scenario. The broad functional group tolerance and versatile downstream functionalization demonstrate utility of current methodology. Interestingly, significant enantiomeric enrichment of 8&#8208;arylquinoline products is achieved by &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; two&#8208;step asymmetric transfer hydrogenation thanks to a &#8220;matched&#8221; cascade kinetic resolution step (up to&#8201;&gt;&#8201;99:1 er)

Deprotonative desymmetrization and asymmetric reduction serve as key steps to enable a concise approach to highly enantiomerically enriched P&#8208;chiral phosphines, which form configurationally stable gold complexes. Application in a [2&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition reaction of a homoallenyl tryptamine demonstrates their promise as catalysts in challenging asymmetric gold catalysis.

In contrast to wide&#8208;ranging applications of axially and planar chiral bidentate phosphine ligands, the development of P&#8208;chiral monophosphine ligands is much less advanced. Here a practical method is outlined for the synthesis of P&#8208;chiral biaryl or ortho&#8208;((diphenyl)methyl)phenyl phosphines by desymmetrizing alkyl(diphenyl)phosphine oxides by directed ortho&#8208;lithiation and electrophilic quenching of the aryllithium intermediates. The biaryl subunit is introduced by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions of ortho&#8208;iodophenyl phosphine oxides in very good yields. Enantiomerically highly enriched phosphine oxides are obtained by crystallization. A widely unsolved problem consists of the asymmetric reduction of P&#8208;chiral phosphine oxides to the corresponding phosphines. Herein, mild and highly selective Ti(OiPr)4/hydrosilane&#8208;mediated stereoretentive reduction reactions of biarylphosphine oxides or stereoinvertive reductions of ortho&#8208;(diphenylmethyl)phenyl phosphine oxides to the corresponding phosphines are described. The mechanism of this reduction method is investigated and most likely proceeds by a Ti(II)&#8208;mediated P&#63743;O bond cleavage in the phosphine oxide. The optically highly enriched P&#8208;stereogenic monophosphine ligands form stable gold(I) complexes. Their initial application in an intramolecular asymmetric [2&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition of an allenyl indole reveals good catalytic activity and promising asymmetric induction.

         <title>Stereoselective Access to &#947;,&#947;&#8208;Dihalo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Enols From Alkynes Combining Visible Light and Biocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
The stereoselective synthesis of optically active &#947;,&#947;&#8208;dihalo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;enols remains unexplored. In this study, efficient biocatalysts are identified to enable their synthesis with high conversion and excellent enantiomeric excess. A one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step sequential process is developed, combining a light&#8208;driven reaction followed by an alcohol dehydrogenase&#8208;catalyzed step. The absolute configuration is determined using Mosher ester analysis.

Merging different strategies in one&#8208;pot processes is attracting considerable attention due to their straightforward and sustainable potential for synthesizing novel organic compounds. In particular, the exquisite selectivity displayed by enzymes and the possibility of coupling biotransformations with metal&#8208;, photo and electrocatalytic processes open new avenues for stereoselective synthesis. Herein, the preparation of chiral (hetero)aryl&#8208;3,3&#8208;dihalopro&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ols is described for the first time. To achieve this, a photochemical and biocatalytic one&#8208;pot sequence is developed, employing visible light irradiation and stereoselective alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) for the transformation of commercially available alkynes into optically active compounds in an aqueous medium. The one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step sequential approach involves a photocatalyst&#8208;free reaction between terminal and internal alkynes with polyhalomethanes, leading to gem&#8208;dihaloenones, which are subsequently reduced using ADHs. After optimizing the individual steps and identifying suitable conditions for combining both processes, the use of complementary ADHs enables the synthesis of a novel family of optically active allylic alcohols with high stereoselectivity. Their chemical derivatization is further explored, allowing the stereoselective synthesis of a chiral propargylic alcohol from the corresponding &#947;,&#947;&#8208;dihalo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;enol.

The process generates tetrasubstituted carbon-centered 4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-3,1-benzoxazine compounds bearing both acyl and phenolic substituents. The method exhibits broad substrate compatibility, high atom economy, and operational simplicity, providing an environmentally benign route to diverse 4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-3,1-benzoxazine derivatives&#8212;privileged scaffolds in medicinal chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoinduced EDA Complex&#8208;Enabled Radical Alkylation/Cyclization Reaction of N&#8208;Arylacrylamides with Katritzky Salts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 21, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated radical alkylation/cyclization reaction is reported between N&#8208;Arylacrylamides and Katritzky salts for the efficient construction of phenanthridines under mild conditions. Triggered by photoexcitation of electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes formed between salts and N, N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine, this strategy circumvents the requirement for photocatalysts and transition&#8208;metal catalysts.

As important structural motifs among N&#8208;heterocycles, phenanthridines are ubiquitous in significant functional compounds. Herein, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated radical alkylation/cyclization reaction between N&#8208;Arylacrylamides and Katritzky salts for the efficient construction of phenanthridines under mild conditions is reported. Triggered by photoexcitation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor complexes formed between salts and N, N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine, this strategy circumvents the requirement for photocatalysts and transition&#8208;metal catalysts. A series of phenanthridine derivatives are smoothly synthesized in up to 86% yield, demonstrating excellent functional group compatibility.

         <title>Mild Electrochemical Decarboxylative Giese Additions with Applications to 18F&#8208;Radiochemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 21, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular electrochemical platform is developed to access alkyl functionalization utilizing decarboxylative radical generation. This platform enables the mild late&#8208;stage modification of privileged saturated fragments which have seen interest in drug discovery. The conditions are translated to a radiochemical workflow to achieve the synthesis of an 18F&#8208;labeled PARP1 inhibitor with subsequent biodistribution imaging to showcase broad applicability toward radiochemistry.

The incorporation of privileged saturated fragments into pharmaceutically relevant scaffolds has seen increased prevalence in drug discovery. Electrochemistry, a single&#8208;electron enabling platform, has demonstrated remarkable synthetic potential, particularly in alkyl functionalizations. However, these two concepts have not yet been fully considered in 18F&#8208;radiochemistry workflows. This work presents the development of a practical late&#8208;stage electrochemical platform that utilizes mild conditions, low voltages, and applications toward the installation of rigid alkyl bioisosteres onto relevant drug scaffolds. The utility of this platform is further demonstrated in the electrochemical synthesis of a PARP1 radiotracer and its application in subsequent biodistribution studies.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Photocatalyzed Decarboxylative Giese&#8208;Type Reaction of &#945;&#8208;N, O or S Carboxylic Acids: Insight into the Mechanism of the Radical Formation</title>

Electron&#8208;deficient alkenes can be functionalized with &#945;&#8208;amino, &#945;&#8208;alkoxy and &#945;&#8208;alkylthio radicals formed by Fe&#8208;photocatalyzed decarboxylation of the corresponding carboxylic acids. The reactions proceed under smooth ligandless conditions with inexpensive base and in the absence of oxidant. A mechanistic computational TD&#8208;DFT study supports the occurrence of homolytic Fe&#63743;O cleavage upon excitation of Fe(III)&#8208;carboxylate complexes by visible light.

Very simple conditions are described for the Fe&#8208;photocatalyzedaddition of &#945;&#8208;amino, &#945;&#8208;alkoxy, and &#945;&#8208;alkylthio radicals to electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. The reactions proceed under smooth ligandless conditions with inexpensive base and in the absence of oxidant. A mechanistic computational TD&#8208;DFT study on the formation and evolution of the electronic excited states supports for the first time that, after Fe(III)&#8208;carboxylate excitation by visible light, homolytic cleavage of the Fe&#63743;O actually takes place, leading to a carboxyl radical.

This study explores stereoconvergent cross&#8208;electrophile couplings of &#945;&#8208;iodoboronic esters via iodine&#8208;metal exchange, enabling their &#945;&#8208;functionalization without the use of transition metals. Highlighted transformations include &#945;&#8208;silylation, &#945;&#8208;borylation, and &#945;&#8208;methylborylation using a common chiral auxiliary. The work broadens access to structurally diverse boronic esters which are key intermediates in drug discovery and synthetic chemistry.

Chiral boronic esters are highly valuable building blocks in organic chemistry and related fields, allowing access to structurally diverse libraries, including those of drug candidates. Herein, stereoselective cross couplings of &#945;&#8208;iodoboronic esters with various commercial electrophiles are reported. These stereoconvergent coupling reactions proceed via iodine&#8208;metal exchange and subsequent stereoselective capture of the generated &#945;&#8208;boryl organometallic species without the use of a transition metal catalyst. The presented reactions allow the &#945;&#8208;silylation, &#945;&#8208;borylation, and &#945;&#8208;methylborylation of boronic esters using a common chiral auxiliary.

A photoredox strategy enables regioselective synthesis of fluoroalkyl 2&#8208;pyrazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ones via radical addition and cyclization. This mild, metal&#8208;free method shows a broad substrate scope, operates in batch and flow systems, and offers a sustainable approach to fluorinated heterocycles with potential applications in medicinal chemistry.

A photoredox&#8208;enabled strategy is developed for the regioselective synthesis of fluoroalkyl 2&#8208;pyrazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ones via radical addition&#8211;cyclization cascades. This metal&#8208;free approach enables the efficient incorporation of perfluoroalkyl and difluoromethylene groups into methacryloyl hydrazide under mild conditions. The protocol demonstrates broad substrate scope, functions in both batch and continuous flow systems, and proceeds through a photo&#8208;oxidative quenching mechanism. This method provides a sustainable and versatile route to fluorinated heterocycles with promising applications in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrative Decarboxylation of Nitroarenes with Alkynyl Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 21, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed denitrative decarboxylation protocol is developed, which couples nitroarenes with terminal alkynyl carboxylic acids bearing silyl, aliphatic, and aryl substituents. 48 aryl alkynes can be directly constructed from readily available nitro precursors and the yield is up to 85%. Significantly, the cost&#8208;effective and ecofriendly protocol permits efficient regiochemical synthesis of 3&#8208;substituted benzofuran or isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives.

A general approach for the decarboxylation of alkynyl carboxylic acids with nitroarenes via denitrative coupling is reported for the first time. The methodology demonstrates broad substrate generality, accommodating diverse nitroaromatics, including electron&#8208;deficient heteroarenes, to deliver aryl alkynes with high efficiency. Notably, this methodology enables the use of nitroarenes and aryl&#8208;substituted carboxylic acids to access diarylacetylene products. Furthermore, this protocol permits efficient synthesis of 3&#8208;substituted benzofuran or isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives, which is a challenging regiochemical outcome unattainable through conventional coupling strategies.

         <title>Water&#8208;Mediated 1,7&#8208;Palladium Aryl&#8208;to&#8208;Aryl Migration in an Unusual Aryne Trimerization Enables the Synthesis of Multihelicenes with Profoundly Hindered Stereogenic Axes</title>

In the presence of a Pd0 catalyst, large &#960;&#8208;extended arynes trimerize in an unusual manner to forge extremely compact and strained chiral benzenoids. This new trimerization reaction involves a 1,7&#8208;Pd isomerization, a rare and poorly understood process that is elucidated.

The nickel(0)&#8208;catalyzed [2&#8201;+&#8201;2&#8201;+&#8201;2] cyclotrimerization of 13,14&#8208;picyne, a &#960;&#8208;extended aryne intermediate having bay regions at both sides of the aryne triple bond, has recently enabled the synthesis of an overcrowded triple [7]helicene. In contrast, it has now been found that under palladium(0) catalysis, the same &#960;&#8208;extended aryne intermediate trimerizes in a very different manner, notably featuring a formal 1,7&#8208;hydrogen shift coupled with a rare 1,7&#8208;palladium aryl&#8208;to&#8208;aryl migration. Remarkably, this new aryne trimerization reaction seems general and reveals possible using a further &#960;&#8208;extended analog of 13,14&#8208;picyne. The two chiral multi[5]helicenes thus obtained have, in addition to helical stereogenic elements, a profoundly hindered stereogenic biaryl axis located in the fjord region of a carbo[5]helicene fragment. Both compounds are characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, which reveals their remarkably compact and severely distorted structures. A thorough mechanistic study, combining experiments and DFT simulations, shows that the observed 1,7&#8208;Pd aryl&#8208;to&#8208;aryl migration is a two&#8208;step 1,4&#8208;to&#8208;1,4&#8217;&#8208;Pd isomerization process enabled by the presence of trace amounts of water, a proton shuttle, in the reaction mixture.

Unleashing the power of Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides with LiCl/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The LiCl/DMSO mixture have an unexplored ability to dramatically increase the solubility of Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides regardless of their molecular structure, which is explored to achieve high chemoselectivity in the Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed interrupted cycloaddition between organic azides, Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides, and diorganoyl dichalcogenides. Insights into this effect and its interplay with the reaction mechanism are discussed.

Herein, an efficient and mild Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed interrupted cycloaddition is described between organic azides and Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides, using diorganoyl dichalcogenides as trapping reagents of the Cu(I) triazolide intermediate to prepare fully substituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles containing an organochalcogen (S, Se, Te) group at C5 position. It is found that chalcogenoacetylenes and 1,4&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles are competitive side products in this reaction, but the use of Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides and LiCl as an additive in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) significantly increased the yields and selectivity for 1,4&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;5&#8208;organochalcogen&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides are well&#8208;known for their low solubility in organic solvents. However, the LiCl/DMSO mixture exhibits an interesting, unexplored ability to dramatically increase the solubility of Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides regardless of their molecular structure. The complete solubilization of Ag(I)&#8208;acetylides is the key to controlling the reaction chemoselectivity, and insights on this effect and its interplay with the reaction mechanism are discussed.

         <title>Heterogeneous Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 1,4&#8208;Conjugate Additions of Grignard Reagents to Cyclic and Linear Enones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 21, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition of Grignard reagents to various cyclic and linear enones using a heterogeneous catalyst is reported. Recyclable copper nanoparticles immobilized on polysaccharide support (e.g., cellulose, chitosan) enable high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. Integrated with asymmetric tandem reactions involving enals and &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, the method produces chiral &#946;,&#948;&#8208;disubstituted ketones with excellent stereoselectivity.

Highly selective conjugate additions of Grignard reagents to cyclic and linear enones catalyzed by recyclable heterogeneous polysaccharide/nanocopper catalysts are disclosed. The method also allows the synthesis of ketones with an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center. When integrated with catalytic asymmetric tandem reactions using enals and &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, it yields chiral &#946;,&#948;&#8208;disubstituted ketones with high stereoselectivity.

The method also allows the synthesis of ketones with an all-carbon quaternary center. When integrated with catalytic asymmetric tandem reactions using enals and &#946;-ketoesters, it yields chiral &#946;,&#948;-disubstituted ketones with high stereoselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A highly atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic palladium&#8208;catalyzed sequential hydrofunctionalization of skipped enynes with phenolic compounds has been developed. This method provided an efficient protocol to construct chromans in good yields with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity, exhibiting good functional group compatibility and gram scalability. Preliminary mechanistic studies show that the same palladium catalyst could well realize both the intermolecular hydroarylation and intramolecular hydroaryloxylation process.

A highly atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic palladium&#8208;catalyzed sequential hydrofunctionalization of skipped enynes with phenolic compounds has been developed. This approach provided an efficient method to construct chromans in moderate to good yields with high regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208;, and stereoselectivities, exhibiting good functional group compatibility and gram scalability. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that the single palladium catalyst is capable of effectively facilitating both the intermolecular hydroarylation and intramolecular hydroaryloxylation process.

         <title>Active&#8208;Site Microenvironments Design of Hydrogenation Catalysts for Enhanced Hydrocracking of Heavy Oil</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 21, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the regulation strategies of hydrogenation catalysts from the molecular scale to atomic scale for slurry phase hydrocracking (SPHC), proposes the design principles of active&#8208;site microenvironment for hydrogenation catalysts to enhance SPHC, and prospects the opportunities and challenges of hydrogenation catalysts for SPHC.

Slurry phase hydrocracking (SPHC) is one of the effective ways to achieve efficient conversion of low&#8208;quality heavy oil. The active&#8208;site structural design of catalysts is crucial to improve the performance but is still challenging. However, up to now, few reviews on the active&#8208;site microenvironments design of catalyst for enhancing SPHC performance have been reported. Herein, this review summarizes the research progress on the active&#8208;site microenvironments regulation strategies of hydrogenation catalysts at the molecular scale for SPHC systematically. Then, based on the problem of low hydrogenation efficiency due to the easy aggregation and low atomic utilization of molecular catalysts, the design strategies for catalysts on the atomic scale are proposed systematically. Subsequently, the design principles of active&#8208;site microenvironment for hydrogenation catalysts to enhance the SPHC are revealed. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of atomically dispersed catalyst for SPHC are prospected. This review provides an important reference for the design and development of high&#8208;performance hydrogenation catalysts for SPHC of heavy oil.

Recent advances in the application of dioxazolones in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroamidation are studied.

In recent years, research on transition metal&#8208;catalyzed amide synthesis has increasingly emerged as a significant focus. Among the efficient amidation reagents, dioxazolones have demonstrated excellent utility in hydroamidation reactions, enabling the rapid conversion of substrates such as alkenes, alkynes, and enynes into enamine or aliphatic amine derivatives. This review summarizes recent advances in dioxazolone&#8208;enabled hydroamidation, with a detailed discussion of diverse substrate types, including various alkenes, alkynes, and enynes as starting materials. Furthermore, the performance and mechanisms of various transition metal catalysts in these processes have been explored. The synthetic strategies, reaction mechanisms, substrate scope, and practical applications of these transformations are comprehensively analyzed, highlighting the versatility and adaptability of dioxazolones in hydroamidation. We anticipate that this review will provide readers with a clearer understanding of this field, inspire further exploratory research, and advance the development and application of hydroamidations.

This article discusses the reports on DG&#8208;assisted site&#8208;selective di&#8208;ortho&#8208;arylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkenylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkynylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;cyanation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;amination, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;thiolation/selenation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;carbonylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;halogenation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;oxygenation, and unsymmetrical di&#8208;ortho C&#63743;H functionalization of inert aryl and heteroaryl C&#63743;H bonds. This unique approach has gotten tremendous attention over the last two decades for the synthesis of complex functionalized aryls.

The directing group (DG)&#8208;assisted transition metal (TM)&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective C&#63743;H activation and functionalization has become a popular approach in the synthesis of natural products, pharmaceuticals, and late&#8208;stage functionalization. In particular, the ortho&#8208;selective C&#63743;H functionalization is frequently addressed. One DG generally directs the mono&#8208;C&#63743;H functionalization. However, over the years, there are some exceptional reactions that have been reported where one DG directs di&#8208;ortho&#8208;C&#63743;H functionalization, offering extra functionalization in one pot. There is no generalization in this type of reaction. In this comprehensive report, the di&#8208;ortho&#8208;C&#63743;H functionalization reactions reported in the recent two decades (2004&#8211;2024) are summarized, and the current status and future perspective for further modifications are provided. This discussion covers DG&#8208;assisted site&#8208;selective di&#8208;ortho&#8208;arylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkenylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkynylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;cyanation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;amination, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;thiolation/selenation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;carbonylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;halogenation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;oxygenation, and unsymmetrical di&#8208;ortho C&#63743;H functionalization of inert aryl and heteroaryl C&#63743;H bonds.

A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenyl esters or ketones has been achieved, affording the disubstituted cis&#8208;gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (up to 99% ee and &gt;20:1 dr). Furthermore, the hydrogenation proceeds smoothly at gram scale without erosion of activity and enantioselectivity. The chiral gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropane products could be transformed into chiral building blocks and bioactive molecule.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Biocatalytic One&#8208;Pot Conversion of 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Alkenes into Optically Enriched Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable one&#8208;pot/two&#8208;step photobiocatalytic cascade to convert &#945;&#8208;methyl terminal alkenes into enantiomerically pure amines is developed. Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven oxidative cleavage of alkenes to prochiral ketones using 9&#8208;fluorenone and molecular oxygen in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is seamlessly coupled with transaminase&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective reductive amination, affording pharmaceutically&#8208;relevant chiral amines in up to 95% overall conversion and &gt;99% ee under mild and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions.

Merging photocatalysis with biocatalysis has recently emerged as a powerful strategy in chemical synthesis. Whereas photocatalysis enables the generation of reactive intermediates under mild conditions, biocatalysis provides exceptional selectivity with minimal byproducts. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot/two&#8208;step photo&#8208;biocatalytic oxidation&#8211;reductive amination cascade that transforms &#945;&#8208;methyl terminal alkenes into enantiomerically pure amines. In the initial step, 1,1&#8208;disubstituted (hetero)aryl alkyl olefins underwent oxidative cleavage to prochiral ketones using molecular oxygen under blue&#8208;light irradiation (427&#8201;nm) with 9&#8208;fluorenone as a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalyst in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which simultaneously serves as solvent and quencher of in situ generated H2O2. Subsequent sequential combination with transaminase&#8208;catalyzed reductive amination furnished the targeted nonracemic amines in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent overall conversions (52%&#8211;95%) and high&#8208;to&#8208;excellent enantiomeric excesses (90%&#8211;99.9%) in a stereocomplementary manner. The photo&#8208;biocatalytic cascade was successfully scaled up with &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene (1.0&#8201;mmol), enabling the synthesis of the pharmaceutically relevant chiral precursor (R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethylamine in 93% conversion, 61% isolated yield, and &gt;99% ee. Further derivatization of this key intermediate delivered the L&#8208;type calcium channel blocker fendiline in 77% isolated yield and 99% ee, without the need for costly transition metal catalysts, hazardous hydrogen gas, and high pressure.

The reaction initially produces the Ugi intermediate. Subsequently, in the presence of K2CO3 and AgNO3, a tandem domino cyclization and ring&#8208;opening reaction occurs. This process, facilitated by the neighboring group, results in the formation of 2&#8208;imino&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydrofurans with a high overall yield.

         <title>Development of a Copper&#8208;Free Click Reaction for Asymmetric Rh Diene Catalysis Under Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;free amino&#8211;yne click reaction enables the selective functionalization of chiral diene ligands with both soluble and immobilized amines. Substituent&#8208;controlled stereoselectivity affords (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;enaminone ligands, which are converted into Rh complexes for asymmetric catalysis under homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions.

We report a copper&#8208;free alkynone&#8208;amine click reaction as a versatile strategy for the immobilization of chiral norbornadiene&#8208;based ligands. This methodology was applied to both soluble amines and amino&#8208;functionalized mesoporous silica support materials. Therefore, a series of (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;configured enaminones were synthesized, revealing a strong substituent&#8208;dependent stereoselectivity: primary amines exclusively formed (Z)&#8208;enaminones, while secondary amines afforded (E)&#8208;isomers with high selectivity (&gt;99:1). The resulting enaminone&#8208;functionalized diene ligands were subsequently applied in Rh catalysis both under homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions. Regarding the enantioselectivity it was found that the catalysts performed well under homogeneous conditions for 1,2&#8208;additions while heterogeneous conditions gave the best results for the Rh&#8208;catalyzed isoxazole ring contraction.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the application of elemental sulfur (S8) for the synthesis of organic compounds. It presents systematization of the diverse methodologies in which S8 serves either as a sulfur source incorporated into the final product, or as a mediator that facilitates product formation.

In recent years, S8 has gained significant attention as a versatile and atom&#8208;economical sulfur atom source in the synthesis of organic compounds. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances (over the past five years) in this field, highlighting the wide spectrum of sulfur&#8208;containing and non&#8208;sulfur&#8208;containing structures that can be constructed using S8.

         <title>Exploring Ligand Effects in the Selective Catalytic Dehydrogenative Borylation of Alkynes with Aluminum</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proper selection of a modified guanidinato ligand allows for the selective catalytic dehydroborylation of terminal alkynes by an air&#8208;stable aluminum complex. A plausible reaction pathway is suggested based on DFT studies, where the auxiliary substituent of the guanidinato ligand actively participates in the activation of the &#963; C&#63743;H bond.

The adequate design of ligands is an essential tool for controlling selectivity in catalytic reactions, particularly as the field shifts toward the use of Earth&#8208;abundant metals. Herein, the synthesis and catalytic evaluation of a series of aluminum guanidinato complexes derived from guanidine ligands bearing diverse donor substituents: (iPrHN)2CNR (R&#8201;=&#8201;2&#8208;Ph2PC6H4, 2&#8208;MeSC6H4, 2&#8208;PhSC6H4, 2&#8208;NCyMeCH2C6H4) is reported. An interesting correlation is identified between selectivity and the hard&#8211;soft donor properties of the substituent. Notably, the complex featuring an additional nitrogen&#8208;based substituent is air&#8208;stable and exhibits high chemoselectivity in the dehydrogenative borylation of alkynes with HBpin, in contrast to the conventional hydroboration pathway. Aromatic and aliphatic alkynes with different substituents have been borylated. This catalyst is also capable of hydroborating and subsequently borylating an aldehyde bearing an alkyne group in a tandem process. The experimental and DFT studies allow to establish bonding situations between the auxiliary group and the metal center ranging from noncovalent interconnections to labile bonds and support a mechanism in which these interactions play a key role in driving this distinct reactivity.

         <title>Stereoselective Control of Iminium Catalysis at Elevated Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective control is achieved through iminium catalysis at elevated temperatures utilizing secondary amine&#8211;strong acid catalytic systems. Through construction of a hydrocarbazole polycyclic skeleton containing continuous chiral centers and all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters, this strategy demonstrates significant advantages in promoting reactions with low&#8208;reactivity substrates.

A significant challenge in the field of organocatalysis is limited scope of substrate applicability, particularly in facilitating efficient reactions involving low&#8208;reactivity substrates. Stereoselective control at elevated temperatures stands out as one of the most effective strategies for mitigating the challenge. We herein report the stereoselective control achieved through iminium catalysis at elevated temperatures utilizing secondary amine&#8208;strong acid catalytic systems. According to the construction of a hydrocarbazole polycyclic skeleton containing continuous chiral centers and all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters, this strategy has demonstrated significant advantages in promoting reactions with low&#8208;reactivity substrates.

         <title>Integrating Vitamin B12 with Immobilized Lipase for a Recyclable Chemoenzymatic Cascade</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating a metallocofactor (Vitamin B12) with an immobilized enzyme enables a recyclable chemoenzymatic cascade. Vitamin B12 first catalyzes the deprotection of allyl ether to alcohol, which is subsequently converted by immobilized lipase into the target ester. The immobilized lipase boosts activity beyond free lipase and Novozym 435, and the cascade retains&#8201;&gt;&#8201;90% of its initial activity after five cycles.

Chemoenzymatic cascades combine the strengths of chemical and biological catalysis, offering tremendous potential for applications in synthetic chemistry, but integrating natural metallocofactors with immobilized enzymes in aqueous media remains underdeveloped. Here, we report the example of a recyclable chemoenzymatic cascade through integrating a natural metal&#8208;based catalyst (vitamin B12) with an immobilized enzyme. By a two&#8208;step&#8208;sequence chemoenzymatic cascade, vitamin B12 first catalyzes a deprotection of allyl ether to release 3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;propanol, which is subsequently converted by immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B (CalB) into the target ester 3&#8208;phenylpropyl butyrate. CalB is immobilized on tailored alkyl&#8208;functionalized silica nanoparticles, creating a hydrophobic microenvironment that enhances enzyme immobilization and good chemoenzymatic cascade activity, outperforming the controls (free enzyme and Novozyme 435). Under optimized conditions, the designed cascade reaction achieves 62% conversion in 24&#8201;h, and interestingly, the system can be reused for at least five cycles while retaining over 90% of its initial activity. As a compelling demonstration of integrating a natural metal complex with immobilized enzymes in a cascade process, this article establishes a good example for chemoenzymatic synthesis, with broad potential for extension to other high&#8208;value chemical transformations.

Nucleophile Promoted Functionalization of Cross&#8208;Conjugated Enynone Gives Sulfonylated Furan</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfonylated furans form serendipitously when cross&#8208;conjugated sulfonyl enynones react under basic conditions in alcohols, with the solvent acting as a nucleophile. Fluorinated alcohols provide optimal yields. Other nucleophiles also participate effectively via a Michael addition&#8211;alkyne to allene isomerization&#8211;oxa&#8208;Michael sequence. The protocol extends to pyrroles, benzofurans, and polyheterocycles. TFE&#8208;substituted furans readily convert into bi&#8208;/triaryl methanes.

Serendipitous formation of sulfonylated furan was observed when cross&#8208;conjugated sulfonyl enynones were reacted under basic conditions in alcohol, with solvent acting as a nucleophile. Fluorinated alcohols gave the best outcomes. Not only alcohols but other nucleophiles also worked well via Michael addition/alkyne to allene isomerization/oxa&#8208;Michael addition reaction sequence. The developed protocol is extended to the synthesis of pyrrole, benzofuran, and polyheterocyclic compounds. The TFE&#8208;substituted sulfonylated furan can be easily transformed into bi&#8208;/triaryl methanes.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Ketones Directly from Ketones with Methanol as a Hydroxymethylating Reagent</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported an electrochemical protocol for the &#945;&#8208;hydroxymethylation of ketones via a dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H of ketones and methanol. The prevalence of methanol also enables the possibility to install deuterated hydroxymethyl groups.

An electrochemical cross coupling for ketones and methanol is developed, providing an efficient access to &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketones. In this protocol, the biofuel methanol is readily used as a hydroxymethylating reagent to couple with ketones with hydrogen as the only by product.

     alt="Electrosynthesis of &#946;-Hydroxy Ketones Directly from Ketones with Methanol as a Hydroxymethylating Reagent"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reported an electrochemical protocol for the &#945;-hydroxymethylation of ketones via a dehydrogenative cross-coupling of &#945;-C(sp3)-H of ketones and methanol. The prevalence of methanol also enables the possibility to install deuterated hydroxymethyl groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An electrochemical cross coupling for ketones and methanol is developed, providing an efficient access to &#946;-hydroxy ketones. In this protocol, the biofuel methanol is readily used as a hydroxymethylating reagent to couple with ketones with hydrogen as the only by product. This sustainable reaction proceeds smoothly in an aqueous medium, giving diverse &#946;-hydroxy ketones in 26%&#8211;92% yields at room temperature in the absence of exogenous oxidants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A triflic acid&#8208;mediated iodocarbocyclization of alkene&#8208;tethered sulfonamides with iodoarenes has been developed. Electrophilic iodine species generated form iodoarenes and triflic acid successfully promote the iodocarbocyclization under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions to afford benzo&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocycles in moderate to good yields.

A triflic acid&#8208;mediated iodocarbocyclization of allylic and homoallylic sulfonamides with iodoarenes has been developed for the synthesis of benzo&#8208;fused saturated N&#8208;heterocycles. The combination of iodoarenes and triflic acid provides an efficient electrophilic iodine species for the iodocarbocyclization under ambient reaction conditions. A variety of sulfonamides derived from benzylamines, phenethylamines, and anilines were successfully transformed into the corresponding iodine&#8208;functionalized benzo&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocycles in good to high yields.

         <title>Zinc Hydride Complexes Stabilized by Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes for Hydrosilylation of Aldehydes and Ketones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neutral zinc hydride complexes supported by anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands containing a weakly coordinating borate anion (WCA&#8208;NHC) are synthesized and structurally characterized. The dimeric and monomeric zinc hydrides act as efficient catalysts for the hydrosilylation of aldehydes and ketones, highlighting solvent&#8208;dependent aggregation and reactivity.

An anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand with a weakly coordinating borate entity in the backbone (WCA&#8208;NHC) is employed in the preparation of zwitterionic zinc complexes. Among these, zinc hydride species [(WCA&#8208;IDipp)ZnH]2 and [(WCA&#8208;IDipp)ZnH(THF)2] (WCA&#8201;=&#8201;B(C6F5)3, IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) were obtained either as a dinuclear zinc complex with two bridging hydrides or as a monomeric complex with a single terminal hydride, respectively. In these zwitterionic complexes, the positive charge at zinc is compensated by the anionic carbene ligand WCA&#8208;IDipp. The overall neutral complexes display excellent solubility in organic solvents and were demonstrated as efficient catalysts in hydrosilylation reactions of aldehydes and ketones.

         <title>Bimetallic Cluster Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Rapid Photocatalytic Water Splitting to Produce Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) incorporating Ce/Ti bimetallic clusters and organic photosensitizers is fabricated. The synergistic effect between the bimetallic clusters and organic linkers facilitates charge carrier separation. This MOF is employed for photocatalytic water splitting and exhibits excellent H2 evolution reaction activity (20,778.7&#8201;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) under the visible&#8208;light irradiation.

A core challenge in photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production, as a clean method of hydrogen fuel generation, lies in simultaneously achieving efficient hydrogen production and long&#8208;term stability of catalysts. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of a novel bimetallic cluster&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) exhibiting exceptional performance for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen production. This unique MOF catalyst demonstrates a remarkably high hydrogen evolution rate of 20,778.7&#8201;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible&#8208;light irradiation, significantly surpassing many MOF photocatalysts. Crucially, the MOF exhibits outstanding stability, maintaining its high catalytic activity over multiple reaction cycles without significant degradation. The synergistic effects within the bimetallic clusters and sensitively light&#8208;responsive linkers are regarded as the key contributors to both the enhanced efficiency and remarkable durability. This work presents a highly promising and stable MOF photocatalyst for efficient solar energy harnessing towards clean hydrogen fuel generation.

         <title>P&#8208;Stereogenic Phosphines via Mn(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrophosphination of Vinyl Sulfones: A Case of Solvent&#8208;Induced Stereoinversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for synthesis of P&#8208;chiral phosphines via manganese&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrophosphination was established. The solvent like iPrOH was found to be able to tune the enantioselectivity of the product, thus providing both enantiomers of P(III)&#8208;stereogenic compounds with a single (Rc, Sp)&#8208;Clarke Mn(I) complex catalyst.

In this work, we report a novel approach for synthesizing P&#8208;chiral phosphines through Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrophosphination of vinyl sulfones. A distinctive feature of this system is its solvent&#8208;dependent stereoinversion, which enables the formation of products with opposite configurations using the same catalyst enantiomer. This phenomenon has been demonstrated across a range of vinyl sulfones and diarylphosphines, providing access to both configurations of P&#8208;stereogenic phosphines with a single catalytic system.

         <title>Ionic Hydrosulfonylation of Alkenes with Sodium Sulfinates for Highly Efficient Synthesis of Benzyl Sulfones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for the ionic hydrosulfonylation of alkenes lacking electron&#8208;withdrawing groups has been developed. This transformation proceeds smoothly to afford benzyl sulfone products, featuring easy operation, a broad substrate scope, good atomic economy, the use of sodium sulfinates as a safe sulfone source, and water/alcohol as green solvents. Furthermore, our strategy enables the synthesis of tertiary carbon sulfone compounds.

         <title>Diazaphospholene&#8208;Catalyzed 1,6&#8208;Conjugate Reduction of Para&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>

         <dc:description>
A 1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholene&#8208;catalyzed 1,6&#8208;conjugate reduction of para&#8208;quinone methides and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;vinylcyclohex&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;one is developed.

In the past 10 years, P&#8208;hydrido&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholenes (DAP&#8208;Hs) have been demonstrated to be able to reduce carbonyls, imines, and enones. However, the 1,6&#8208;conjugate reduction transformations catalyzed by DAP&#8208;Hs have been rarely studied. Herein, we developed a DAP&#8208;catalyzed 1,6&#8208;conjugate reduction of p&#8208;QMs with DAP&#8208;Br as the precatalyst. Furthermore, the dienone could also be well tolerated in this transformation.

         <dc:description>
This review highlights the latest advancements in the synthesis of alkenyl nitriles through the cyanation of alkenes, alkynes, and other starting materials, resulting in functionalized alkenyl nitrile derivatives, while also addressing the remaining challenges and future perspectives.

Alkenyl nitrile derivatives represent important structural motifs found in a variety of natural products, active pharmaceuticals, and functional materials. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in the development of efficient and selective catalytic methods for synthesizing alkenyl nitriles from alkenes, alkynes, and other precursors under relatively mild conditions with new synthetic technologies. However, a comprehensive summary of the synthesis of alkenyl nitriles has yet to be established in recent literature. This perspective highlights the latest advancements in the synthesis of alkenyl nitriles through the cyanation of alkenes, alkynes, and other starting materials, leading to functionalized alkenyl nitrile derivatives. The remaining challenges and future perspectives at the conclusion of the review is also discussed. It is hoped that this overview will inspire the development of novel approaches to access diverse alkenyl nitriles and facilitate their applications in organic chemistry and drug research.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Copper&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;(Styrylsulfonyl)amides via SO2 Incorporation Under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;(Styrylsulfonyl)amides are prepared from &#945;&#8208;bromoamides, SO2, and styrenes in a one&#8208;step photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reaction in the presence of a copper complex. Additionally, related ester analogs could be synthesized following the same procedure. The mechanism of the newly developed method is investigated and model postmodification reactions are carried out.

&#945;&#8208;(Styrylsulfonyl)amides and their related ester analogs are an important class of substances that have been widely used as precursors toward bioactive compounds. While most existing methods for the preparation of related compounds include either multiple steps or the use of precious metals, the method presented in this paper utilizes copper and visible light to produce &#945;&#8208;(styrylsulfonyl)amides and &#945;&#8208;(styrylsulfonyl)esters from &#945;&#8208;bromoamides or esters, SO2 and styrenes in moderate to high yield in a single step. The mechanism of the newly developed method is investigated and likely differs from related methods for the photocatalyzed fixation of SO2 into organic scaffolds.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Photooxidative Benzylic C&#63743;H Azolation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports a transition metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free photooxidative azolation of C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds with azoles using CBr4 under 400&#8211;405&#8201;nm irradiation and at room temperature. The amination reaction exhibits broad substrate scope and is applicable to follow&#8208;up transformation of drug molecules.

Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and radical&#8211;polar crossover (RPC) have emerged as a powerful strategy for the C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization of organic molecules. Herein, we disclose a transition metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free photooxidative azolation of C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds with azoles using CBr4. This amination performed at room temperature under 400&#8211;405&#8201;nm irradiation was operationally simple, and tolerated a variety of functional groups. Its utility in synthesis was demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of a drug molecule. CBr4 acted as a HAT agent and oxidant, undergoing photochemical homolysis to promote this cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction.

         <title>Eco&#8208;Friendly and Additive&#8208;Free Synthesis of C&#63743;P Bonds: Synergistic Catalysis by a Polyoxovanadate&#8208;Based Cu&#8211;Organic Framework Using Molecular Oxygen</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel polyoxovanadate&#8208;based copper&#8211;organic framework (Cu&#8208;POV) featuring dual&#8208;active sites was synthesized and used as a heterogeneous catalyst for the additive&#8208;free cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of N&#8208;aryl tetrahydroisoquinolines with diarylphosphine oxides to form C&#63743;P bonds, using molecular oxygen as an oxidant and green ethanol as the solvent, demonstrating excellent catalytic performance, recyclability, and feasibility for gram&#8208;scale reactions.

Development of environmentally benign methods for C&#63743;P bond formation is of great significance due to the extensive applications of organophosphorus compounds in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Herein, we report a polyoxovanadate&#8208;based Cu&#8211;organic framework, [Cu3(pty)2][V8O23]&#183;H2O (Cu&#8208;POV, pty&#8201;= &#8201;4&#8242;&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine), for catalyzing the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of N&#8208;aryl tetrahydroisoquinolines with diarylphosphine oxides to form C&#63743;P bonds using molecular oxygen (O2) as an oxidant in green ethanol medium. The outstanding efficiency of Cu&#8208;POV stems from a synergistic mechanism involving its structural CuII and VV centers: the two activate the N&#8208;aryl tetrahydroisoquinolines through single&#8208;electron transfer and subsequently react with O2 to generate the key superoxide radical species. The catalyst can be recycled at least six times without compromising performance, and applied in gram&#8208;scale reaction with a turnover number of 2025.

         <title>Photocatalytic Assembly of Structurally Diverse &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Tertiary Amines Using Benign Nitrogen Donors</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed photocatalytic arylamination and alkylamination of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes using nitriles and oximes as benign nitrogen donors instead of toxic azide reagents, providing a green and mild route to diverse &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl tertiary amines. Only N2 or CO2 are emitted as byproducts. Scalability, broad substrate tolerance and high yields highlight their practicality. The products readily convert to valuable &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl amine derivatives via simple reduction and hydrolysis reaction.

&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl amines are privileged motifs in drug design. Traditional assembly of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl amines relies on harsh conditions and toxic reagents, prompting the demand for milder, atom&#8208;economical methods. While alkene carboamination offers a modular access to diverse amines, the aminative difunctionalization of trifluoromethyl alkenes pose challenges due to facile defluorination. Herein, we report two visible light&#8208;induced protocols for the aminative difunctionalization of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes using benign nitrogen sources&#8212;nitriles and oximes&#8212;instead of prior toxic azides. A photoredox approach leads to the arylamination of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes and radical oxidation, leveraging nitriles to capture benzyl carbocations, while a complementary alkylamination strategy exploits the decarboxylative decomposion of alkyl oxime esters and installs C&#8208; and N&#8208;radicals on the double bond with regiospecificity. These two protocols constitute flexible access to diverse &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl tertiary amines under sustainable conditions. Only N2 or CO2 are emitted as byproducts. Scalability, broad substrate tolerance, and high yields highlight the practicality of this methodology.

         <title>The Novel Strategies for the Construction of Homoallylic Alcohols via Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically summarizes recent advances in the synthesis of valuable homoallylic alcohols via photoredox catalysis. We categorize strategies by catalytic method, analyzing substrate scope, mechanisms, and applications in constructing complex targets. The perspective also highlights future challenges and opportunities in this emerging field, underscoring its potential for mild, efficient, and sustainable synthesis. 

The importance of homoallylic alcohols were reflected in the development of remarkable synthetic strategies and the discovery of novel reactivities that enable access to complex molecular targets. Compared to the traditional pathway, the booming single&#8208;electron transfer pathway has demonstrated remarkable potential for the construction of valuable and otherwise difficult to synthesized homoallylic alcohols. Especially, photoredox catalysis has emerged as a alternative and prospective protocol for the synthesis of homoallylic alcohol via radical pathway owing to mild reaction conditions, lower activation energy, eco&#8208;friendly, and excellent compatibility. Thus, this review systematically summarizes the recent important advances in the synthesis of homoallylic alcohols through photoredox catalysis. It categorizes these advancements according to the distinct catalytic methods, providing a concise analysis of substrate scopes, limitations, and mechanistic explores, as well as their applications in the construction of various functionalized molecules, natural products, pharmaceuticals, or bioactive molecules. Furthermore, key challenges and emerging opportunities are highlighted to guide the development of novel strategies and expand their practical applications.

Sc(OTf)3 and Ambient Air Promote Radical&#8208;Based Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling Reactions: Reactivity of &#945;&#8208;Enaminone toward Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes</title>

         <dc:description>
A site&#8208;selective Csp2&#8208;Csp3 cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction is developed for a&#8208;enaminone and donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) in the presence of air and Sc(OTf)3 (30 mol%) through radical pathway, affording tetrahydroquinolinones in good yields with large substrate scope. The utilization of less amount of Sc(OTf)3 (3 mol%) leads to a ring&#8208;opening reaction with good yields and large substrate scope.

A new cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction for tetrahydroquinolinones formation is achieved using &#945;&#8208;enaminones and donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes. Traditional cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions require the presence of a redox&#8208;active metal, and an additional oxidant. This work introduces a new type of catalytic system, which only involves a redox&#8208;inactive rare earth metal and ambient air serving as the oxidant. Mechanistic investigation has revealed a radical pathway for the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative Csp2&#8208;Csp3 coupling reaction and Sc(OTf)3 combined with 3O2 are found to facilitate the critical SET process. When 3 mol% of Sc(OTf)3 is used, &#945;&#8208;enaminone served as nitrogen nucleophile to react with the donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes, resulting in new ring&#8208;opening products. Increasing the catalyst loading to 30 mol%, tetrahydroquinolinones are formed via cross&#8208;dehydrogenative Csp2&#8208;Csp3 coupling reaction. Both reactions give good to excellent yields with broad substrate scopes. Enantiospecific formation of tetrahydroquinolinones is also investigated with high retention of enantiomeric purity (up to 97% ee). The discovery that Sc(OTf)3 and air can promote the formation of &#945;&#8208;enaminone radical and malonic ester radical is unprecedented and is expected to initiate their broad applications in developing novel organic transformations.

         <title>Electrochemical Trifluoromethylchlorosulfonylation of Alkenes via Copper&#8208;Mediated SO2Cl Radical Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports an electrosynthetic method for vicinal trifluoromethylchlorosulfonylation of alkenes using [Cu(MeCN)4]PF6 and triethylamine, without elaborate ligands. The reaction efficiently adds CF3 and SO2Cl across diverse unactivated alkenes with broad functional group tolerance. The resulting sulfonyl chlorides are versatile intermediates, and mechanistic studies support a Cu&#8208;mediated, electrochemically driven SO2Cl radical transfer pathway.

This article describes an electrosynthetic method for vicinal trifluoromethylchlorosulfonylation of alkenes using the readily available copper salt [Cu(MeCN)4]PF6 and triethylamine, without the need for elaborate ligands. This protocol enables efficient and selective addition of CF3 and SO2Cl groups across a wide range of unactivated alkenes with broad functional group tolerance, including pyrrole, furan, thiophene, thioethyl, and silyl substituents. The sulfonyl chloride products can be readily transformed into sulfonamides, sulfonates, sulfonyl fluorides, and thiosulfonates. Mechanistic studies provide evidence in support of an electrochemically driven, Cu&#8208;mediated SO2Cl radical transfer mechanism.

The resulting sulfonyl chlorides are versatile intermediates, and mechanistic studies support a Cu-mediated, electrochemically driven SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl radical transfer pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article describes an electrosynthetic method for vicinal trifluoromethylchlorosulfonylation of alkenes using the readily available copper salt [Cu(MeCN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and triethylamine, without the need for elaborate ligands. This protocol enables efficient and selective addition of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl groups across a wide range of unactivated alkenes with broad functional group tolerance, including pyrrole, furan, thiophene, thioethyl, and silyl substituents. The sulfonyl chloride products can be readily transformed into sulfonamides, sulfonates, sulfonyl fluorides, and thiosulfonates. Mechanistic studies provide evidence in support of an electrochemically driven, Cu-mediated SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl radical transfer mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Merging Single&#8208;Electron Transfer and Strecker Degradation to Access Densely Substituted Pyridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work represents the first example of a [4 + 2] annulation of methyl ketoxime acetates to afford polysubstituted pyridine derivatives. This strategy activates all three substrates, generating imine anions and two different aldehydes through the merging of single electron transfer and Strecker degradation. Mechanism studies reveal that the key &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketimine intermediates, generated in situ from ketoxime acetates and phenylglycine, prevent the homo&#8208; and cross&#8208;merization of two distinct &#945;&#8208;amino acids. Additionally, these intermediates are indispensable for shifting the reaction pathway from [3 + 3] to [4 + 2] annulation of ketoxime acetates.

An I2&#8208;mediated three&#8208;component protocol of readily available ketoxime acetates and two structurally distinct &#945;&#8208;amino acids has been developed, merging single&#8208;electron transfer and Strecker degradation to enable the concise synthesis of densely substituted pyridines. The reaction proceeds via an unprecedented [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] annulation, wherein phenylalanines intercept the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines generated in&#8201;situ from ketoxime acetates and phenylglycines. This process features the simultaneous activation of three substrates, and mild reaction conditions, good functional&#8208;group tolerance.

A stereoselective one&#8208;step (3&#8201;+&#8201;3)&#8208;cycloaddition between in&#8201;situ generated pyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;methides and carbonyl ylides has been developed using cooperative rhodium and chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. The reaction affords oxa&#8208;bridged cyclohepta[1,2&#8208;b]pyrroles bearing three stereogenic centers, including two quaternary ones, in high yields and enantioselectivities. This method provides a straightforward synthetic access to complex heterocyclic scaffolds.

A stereoselective (3&#8201;+&#8201;3)&#8208;cycloaddition between pyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;methides and carbonyl ylides, both generated in&#8201;situ, has been developed to access densely substituted oxa&#8208;bridged cyclohepta[1,2&#8208;b]pyrroles in a single synthetic step. This transformation is enabled by a cooperative dual&#8208;catalytic system comprising rhodium(II) acetate and a chiral phosphoric acid, each operating in separate catalytic cycles to generate the key transient intermediates. The reaction delivers structurally complex products bearing three stereogenic centers, two of which are quaternary. Excellent yields, high levels of enantioselectivity, and low to moderate diastereoselectivity are additional key features of this process. This methodology provides a straightforward synthetic access to valuable heterocyclic scaffolds with potential applications in synthetic and medicinal chemistry.

This research presents a new mild photocatalytic method enables C&#8208;4 alkylation of chroman&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives with primary alkyl radicals. This radicals are generated via oxidative PCET process. Developed approach offers broad substrate scope, scalability under photo&#8208;flow conditions, and mechanistic evidence supports a decarboxylation pathway under polar conditions.

Chroman&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives are biologically relevant structures that present interesting pharmacological and biological properties, being the C&#8208;4 alkylated derivatives of particular interest. The methods described in the literature allow the C&#8208;4 functionalization of coumarins with secondary and tertiary alkyl radicals, as well as aryl radicals produced under reductive photocatalytic conditions. Herein, we present a method that allows the introduction of primary alkyl radicals prepared through the oxidative&#8208;PCET ring opening of cycloalkanols under very mild reaction conditions. The method presents a broad scope and can be carried out on a large scale under photo&#8208;flow conditions. Moreover, mechanistic investigations allow the corroboration of decarboxylation under polar conditions.

         <title>Vinyl and Bromo&#8208;Vinyl Sulfoximine Synthesis via Reactive Sulfonimidoyl Bromide Intermediates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, catalyst&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot protocol is reported for direct synthesis of vinyl sulfoximines from alkenes, sulfonamides, and thiophenols under oxidative conditions using DBDMH. The intrinsic reactivity of the in&#8201;situ&#8208;generated sulfonimidoyl bromide intermediates eliminates the need for pre&#8208;functionalized halogenated precursors. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory calculations support a radical mechanism. Substituting alkynes for alkenes produces bromo&#8208;vinyl sulfoximines, which are new compounds with high reactivity and structural tunability, offering a versatile C&#8211;Br handle for derivatization and drug development.

Vinyl sulfoximines are valuable scaffolds in drug discovery and chemical biology, but their widespread use is limited by a lack of synthetic methods. Here, a catalyst&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot protocol is presented for the direct synthesis of vinyl sulfoximines from readily available alkenes, thiols, and nitrogen&#8208;containing substrates such as sulfonamides or amides under oxidative conditions using 1,3&#8208;dibromo&#8208;5,5&#8208;dimethylhydantoin. This transformation proceeds via the in&#8201;situ generation of reactive sulfonimidoyl bromide intermediates, which are previously unused versatile synthons that eliminate the need for pre&#8208;functionalized halogenated precursors. Mechanistic investigations and density functional theory calculations provide support for a single&#8208;electron transfer process between sulfonimidoyl bromide and phenylthiolate. Furthermore, using alkynes instead of alkenes allows the first synthesis of bromo&#8208;vinyl sulfoximines, which are reactive and structurally tunable and have a synthetically versatile C&#8211;Br handle, making them promising candidates for drug discovery applications.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Neutral Organophotocatalytic Cascade: Difluoromethylation and Radical Truce&#8211;Smiles&#8208;Driven C(sp3)&#8211;H Functionalization to Access Benzothiazine Dioxides and Oxindoles</title>

         <dc:description>
This study presents a redox&#8208;neutral organophotocatalytic cascade for difluoromethylation and cyclization, enabling the efficient synthesis of benzothiazine dioxides. Concurrently, a radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement driven by 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) achieves C(sp&#179;)&#8211;H functionalization to furnish oxindoles. The developed metal&#8208;free protocol provides a mild, sustainable, and broadly applicable route to structurally diverse heterocycles with high efficiency.

A new photochemical approach has been developed that enables the simultaneous difluoromethylation and radical cascade cyclization of alkenes, providing rapid and efficient access to structurally intricate 1,2&#8208;benzothiazine dioxide derivatives. Importantly, strategic substrate modification expands the utility of this platform to an unprecedented distal &#8216;Radical Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement&#8217; enabled by a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. This C(sp3)&#8211;H activation pathway overcomes conventional proximity constraints, allowing for the streamlined synthesis of valuable oxindole frameworks with high selectivity. The organophotocatalyst 4DPNIPN catalyzes the transformation and proceeds via a radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism initiated through oxidative luminescence quenching. Remarkably, the reaction operates under redox&#8208;neutral conditions, eliminating the need for transition metals, stoichiometric oxidants, or external additives. This sustainable protocol exhibits broad functional group compatibility, operational simplicity, and scalability.

         <title>Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two structurally analogous COF photocatalysts of TP&#8208;DADB COF and TP&#8208;TFMB COF with incorporating &#63743;CF3 in the latter is constructed. The introduction of &#63743;CF3 promotes the separation of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs and improves the band structure to enable simultaneous oxygen reduction and water oxidization reactions to produce H2O2. Thereby, TP&#8208;TFMB COF exhibits a 16&#8208;times higher H2O2 production rate than TP&#8208;DADB COF.

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising photocatalysts for the photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, the photocatalytic activity over COFs in pure water is limited due to poor carrier dynamics as well as sluggish oxygen reduction and water oxidation reactions. Herein, two &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COF photocatalysts is designed via solvothermal Schiff&#8208;base condensation: TP&#8208;TFMB COF (with the trifluoromethyl group modification) and TP&#8208;DADB COF (pristine COF). In pure water, TP&#8208;TFMB COF delivers an excellent H2O2 production with a yield rate of 3.83 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 (16 folds higher than that of TP&#8208;DADB COF) under visible&#8208;light irradiation. As demonstrated by experimental results, the superior photocatalytic performance of TP&#8208;TFMB COF stems from the introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing &#63743;CF3 groups, which simultaneously improve charge separation and promoted &#8226;O2&#8722; generation in oxygen reduction as well as critically boost water oxidation. This work provides the insight into the effect of the electron&#8208;withdrawing group on photocatalytic activity for H2O2 generation over COFs and may enlighten the design of catalysts for H2O2 photosynthesis.

         <title>A Mild and Efficient Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Method for Aldimine Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, efficient, and broadly applicable iridium&#8208;catalyzed method for aldimine hydrogenation, facilitating access to an array of corresponding amine products in high isolated yields is reported. The developed methodology employs a bidentate iridium&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphine complex for use at low catalyst loadings, and proceeds under an atmospheric pressure of hydrogen gas, offering a scalable and sustainable route to valuble amine compounds.

A mild and applicable protocol for aldimine hydrogenation has been developed using a bidentate iridium&#8208;N&#8208;hetrocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphine catalyst. Through a series of optimization studies, twenty&#8208;nine aldimine substrates have been successfully reduced to their corresponding amines in high isolated yields up to 99%. The developed methodology employs a low catalyst loading of just 1 mol% and proceeds under mild conditions, including under an atmospheric pressure of hydrogen gas. The process benefits from a broad solvent applicability, including notable green solvents, and tolerates aldimine substrates of varying solubility. Alongside, N&#8208;aryl&#8208;based aldimine substrates, the general protocol also accomodates more challenging N&#8208;alkyl species without the requirement of any further additive. From a mechanistic perspective, density functional theory calculations have been utilized to examine the formation, and subsequent reaction, of a crucial iridacycle intermediate, while also revealing that the C&#63743;H activation step is key for successful imine reduction. This mechanistic insight is then used to significantly elevate the performance of two poorer performing substrates.

         <title>Halogen Atom Transfer Enabled Radical Fluoroalkyl&#8208;Thiolation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an aryl radical&#8208;induced three&#8208;component fluoroalkyl&#8208;thiolation of unactivated olefins is reported through halogen atom transfer process, enabling rapid simultaneous construction of C(sp3)&#63743;Rf and C(sp3)&#63743;S bonds with high regioselectivity. Similarly, direct thiolation of fluoroalkyl iodides in the absence of alkenes affords the fluoroalkylthioethers.

A halogen atom transfer&#8208;enabled radical fluoroalkyl&#8208;thiolation of unactivated alkenes is developed employing fluoroalkyl iodides, TMEDA&#8208;ligated zinc thiolates. Notably, the aryldiazonium salts are utilized as the promoter in the three&#8208;component reaction, providing a powerful tool for simultaneous construction of C&#63743;Rf and C&#63743;S bonds across the C&#63742;C bond. Moreover, direct thiolation of fluoroalkyl iodides without alkene gives the two&#8208;component reaction products. Mechanistic studies support that the interaction between diazonium salt and zinc thiolate plays a crucial role in the transformations.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review surveys dioxazolones as key nitrogen radical precursors for photocatalytic C&#63743;N bond formation. It highlights their application in nitrene transfer reactions toward amide synthesis and mechanistic insights, aiming to guide the development of green heteroatom&#8208;bond&#8208;forming strategies and foster their application in pharmaceutical and materials science.

As efficient nitrogen radical precursors, dioxazolones have emerged as key intermediates in photocatalytic C&#63743;N bond construction due to their mild reaction conditions, and generation of only CO2 as a byproduct. This review summarizes recent advances in the application of dioxazolones in photocatalytic nitrene transfer reactions, with a focus on synthetic methodologies for diverse amides and their derivatives and the mechanistic insights into different catalytic systems. The aim is to provide guidance for developing green and efficient C&#63743;N, S&#63743;N, P&#63742;N, and S&#63742;N bond formation strategies and to promote the application of photocatalytic nitrene transfer reactions in pharmaceutical and materials science.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Confined Pd Nanocatalysts: Tailoring Adsorption Geometry for Enhanced Selectivity in Sustainable Alkylphenol Synthesis via Ketone Hydrodeoxygenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;confined Pd/C&#8208;DMA nanocatalyst enables sustainable synthesis of alkylphenols via selective ketone hydrodeoxygenation. Its polymer layer creates a confinement effect, enforcing a specific end&#8208;on adsorption geometry. This suppresses side reactions and achieves outstanding selectivity (&gt;96%) under mild conditions.

The development of sustainable synthetic routes to access valuable alkylphenols is hampered by the poor selectivity, harsh conditions, and waste associated with traditional methods. Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of readily available aromatic ketones offers a potentially greener alternative, but achieving high chemoselectivity under mild conditions remains challenging. Herein, a simple yet effective strategy is reported employing a polymer&#8208;modified palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst, functionalized with dimethylamine (DMA) polymer chains (Pd/C&#8208;DMA), for the highly efficient and selective HDO of aromatic ketones. This catalyst achieves outstanding selectivity (up to 96.6%) toward alkylphenols with complete conversion under remarkably mild conditions (80 &#176;C, 5&#8201;bar H2), significantly surpassing unmodified Pd/C and representing a substantial improvement in process greenness. Mechanistic insights reveal that the DMA polymer layer creates a confined microenvironment on the catalyst surface. This confinement effect, through steric constraints and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, enforces a specific end&#8208;on adsorption geometry for the ketone substrate, suppressing undesired side reactions like arene ring hydrogenation. The Pd/C&#8208;DMA catalyst demonstrates broad substrate compatibility (&gt;95% yields for diverse ketones) and facilitates the scalable synthesis of valuable intermediates, offering a robust and sustainable platform for alkylphenol production.

         <title>Cleaner Production of Acetals/Ketals Using a Phosphorus&#8208;Doped Biomass&#8208;Based Carbon Catalyst via Acetalization Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of novel phosphorus&#8208;doped carbon catalysts is carried out for the acetalization of aldehydes and ketones toward acetals and ketals under mild conditions (60 &#176;C, atmospheric pressure). This catalyst, showing high conversion (87.1%) and selectivity (&gt;99.9%), offers an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional methods. The work highlights the crucial role of P&#8208;doping in modulating the acid properties of the catalyst for enhanced performance.

The transformation of aldehydes and ketones into acetals and ketals has garnered significant attention due to their wide applications as fragrances, bio&#8208;oil additives, and organic synthetic intermediates. Conventional acetalization methods, however, often rely on corrosive acids or stoichiometric additives, necessitating harsh conditions and increasing production costs. Here, the development of a phosphorus&#8208;doped carbon catalyst is presented, that enables the acetalization of aldehydes and ketones into acetals and ketals under mild conditions (e.g., 60 &#176;C, atmospheric pressure). This catalyst achieves a high yield of 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (87.1%) from benzaldehyde and exhibits exceptional stability, operating continuously for 120&#8201;h in a continuous fixed&#8208;bed reactor. In the continuous reaction, the yield of 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane remains over 96% in the first 18&#8201;h and slightly decreases to 86% after 120&#8201; h of continuous operation. Comprehensive physicochemical characterizations reveal that phosphorus acts as a Lewis acid sites and plays a critical role in modulating the Lewis acid sites of the PC catalysts. This work highlights the significance of optimizing acid properties for the efficient acetalization reaction, offering a promising approach to sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Electrochemical Decarboxylative Functionalizations through Carbocation Intermediates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbocations generated through electrochemical Hofer&#8208;Moest pathways can be trapped by diverse nucleophiles or undergo elimination to form alkenes, significantly expanding synthetic versatility. This review systematically surveys advances in electrochemical Hofer&#8208;Moest reactions since 2019, categorizing transformations by bond&#8208;forming events. The review concludes by highlighting key challenges and proposing strategic research directions in this rapidly evolving field.

In contrast to radical&#8208;mediated electrochemical decarboxylative couplings, electrochemical decarboxylative functionalizations proceeding through carbocation intermediates (Hofer&#8208;Moest pathway) unlock unique reactivity and selectivity. These in&#8201;situ&#8208;generated carbocations can be trapped by diverse nucleophiles or undergo elimination to form alkenes, significantly expanding synthetic versatility. This review systematically surveys advances in electrochemical Hofer&#8208;Moest&#8208;type reactions since 2019, categorizing transformations by bond&#8208;forming events (C&#63743;N, C&#63743;O, C&#63743;P, C&#63743;F, C&#63743;C, and C&#63742;C). Beyond summarizing key breakthroughs, it also provide balanced evaluation of current limitations to delineate the scope and applicability of these methods. Finally, persistent challenges are outlined and future research directions in this emerging field is proposed.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Controlled C&#8211;H Cyanation or Thiocyanation of Indolizines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced method for the C&#8211;H cyanation/thiocyanation of indolizine derivatives has been developed by using NH4SCN as the cyano or thiocyano source.

An efficient and controlled approach for C&#8211;H cyanation/thiocyanation of indolizines is reported under visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced conditions. NH4SCN is used as the cyano or thiocyano source and the presence or absence of H2O2 are found to be the key factor in the selective construction of C&#8208;3 cyano or thiocyano indolizines. A set of control experiments, such as radical trapping experiments and fluorescence quenching studies are conducted to assess mechanistic insights of the reaction.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Azide&#8208;Selenoalkyne Cycloadditions: A Combined Synthetic&#8211;Computational Study into Reaction Scope, Mechanism, and Origins of Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (RuAAC) reaction is reported for the synthesis of selenium&#8208;substituted triazole products. Reaction regioselectivity is dependent on the identity of the non&#8208;selenium substituent of the alkyne, which challenges the perceived understanding of RuAAC regioselectivity. Computational modeling has accurately reproduced the experimental results and provided insights into the origins of regioselectivity.

A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (RuAAC) reaction involving selenoalkynes is reported for the synthesis of selenium&#8208;substituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazole products (26 examples, up to 89% yield). The reaction works well with a wide range of alkyl and aryl azides bearing both electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing groups. This contrasts RuAAC reactions using regular terminal and internal alkynes, where aryl azides bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups are not generally tolerated. The regioselectivity of the cycloaddition is highly dependent on the identity of the non&#8208;selenium substituent of the alkyne. This challenges earlier reports on RuAAC reactions involving thioalkynes and questions the perceived understanding of the regioselectivity of these reactions. Computational modeling of the reaction profiles for four alkyne substrates that provided contrasting regioselectivities accurately reproduces the experimental results. The observed regioselectivity is primarily attributed to the relative nucleophilicity of the alkyne carbons upon coordination to ruthenium and an approach is proposed in which reaction regioselectivity may be predicted.

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation on an NHC&#8208;Catalyzed [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] Annulation of 2&#8208;Bromoenals with &#946;&#8208;Oxodithioester: Mechanism, Origins of Stereoselectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism and origin of selectivities of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] annulation reaction have been systematically investigated using density functional theory method. The key roles of Lewis acid are also elucidated through the solvent&#8211;solute interaction model.

An increasing number of studies have demonstrated the cooperative use of chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and Lewis acid to enhance catalytic efficiency in stereoselective annulation reactions. Herein, molecular&#8208;level insights into the NHC&#8208;catalyzed [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] annulation of 2&#8208;bromoenals with &#946;&#8208;oxodithioester are elucidated through density functional theory calculations. The reaction proceeds via multiple key steps: formation of the Breslow intermediate, C&#63743;Br bond cleavage, &#945;&#8208;protonation generating &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acylazolium, stereoselective Si&#8208;face addition between the acylazolium and LiCl&#8208;coordinated &#946;&#8208;oxodithioester, intramolecular proton transfer, and catalyst regeneration. The stereoselectivity&#8208;determining C&#63743;C bond formation step exhibits enhanced facial control through cooperative effects. Noncovalent interaction (NCI) and atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules analyses reveal that hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, LP&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;, and O&#183;&#183;&#183;S interactions preferentially stabilize the RS&#8208;configured isomer. Notably, LiCl plays dual roles: (1) it amplifies stereocontrol by facilitating multiple NCIs during the C&#63743;C bond formation, and (2) reduces transition&#8208;state polarity through solvent&#8211;solute interactions, thereby lowering the activation barrier. The work deepens the understanding of how Lewis acid additive modulate both electronic and steric landscapes in NHC catalysis, offering valuable insights for stereocontrolled annulation reactions.

         <title>Recent Advances in Terminal Alkyne&#8208;Involved Alkynylation and Alkynylation&#8208;Triggered Tandem Reactions</title>

Substituted internal alkynes are one of the most important functional groups in organic chemistry, with broad applications ranging from biochemistry to material science, medicinal chemistry, and pharmaceutical research. Much effort has been made to explore efficient methodologies to introduce an alkyne moiety into molecules. Among alkynylation reagents, terminal alkynes are considered to be the ideal reagent compared to other substrates like halogenated alkynes and alkynyl hypervalent iodine since it avoids multistep synthesis of these substrates from terminal alkynes to meet the atom&#8208;economy criteria. In this review, we summarized recent achievements in the application of terminal alkynes for the alkynylation to afford substituted internal alkynes and alkynylation&#8208;triggered tandem reactions to yield carbo&#8208; and heterocycles, which exist abundantly in the nature as synthetic drugs, biologically active natural and non&#8208;natural products.

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Chloro and &#945;,&#945; &#8208;Dichloro acetamidines via the Carbenoids Addition to Inherently Low Electrophilic Carbodiimides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hitherto few explored &#945;&#8208;halomethyl amidine motif has been assembled through the addition of a lithiated (di)&#8208;halomethane (i.e. carbenoid) to easily accessible N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl substituted carbodiimides. Despite the inherent low electrophilicity of these heterocumulenes &#8211; as quantitatively determined in Mayr&#8217;s previous studies &#8211; their sp&#8208;hybridized carbon atom acts as a competent site of attack for these tamed nucleophiles. The overall high&#8208;yielding transformation featuring a genuine chemoselective profile &#8211; as documented by employing variously functionalized materials &#8211; is adaptable to the addition of dihalogenated carbenoids. Reaction products could be advantageously employed in nucleophilic substitution sequences, as well as, in further functionalization of the nitrogen atoms due to the constitutive heteroallyl&#8208;type skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>eAmidation: An Electrochemical Amidation of Aldehydes via the Oxidation of N&#8208;Aryl Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the use of electrochemistry has emerged as a powerful yet sustainable means of enabling key transformations. Amidation is one of the most frequently executed transformations in synthetic chemistry, and using an electrochemical approach, the current study has demonstrated the synthesis of amides from aldehydes and amines. Mechanistic work indicates that the reaction proceeds via the oxidation of an intermediate hydrazone to generate an acyl diazene as the acylating species. The protocol developed has enabled the synthesis of a broad range of amides, including access to pharmaceutically relevant products, directly from aldehydes without recourse for hazardous chemical oxidants and activating agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand controlled regio&#8208;divergent [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of alkynes by merging electrochemistry and nickel catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions between three alkynes, a diyne and an alkyne, or a triyne offer a straightforward and typical protocol toward all kinds of polysubstituted benzens. Herein, the synthesis of polysubstituted aromatics through electrochemical nickel catalyzed cyclotrimerization of alkynes is developed. The regio&#8208;divergent cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes was achieved by judicious choice of ligands. And tributylphosphine, sterically hindered bipyridine or &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands delivered 1,2,4&#8208; and 1,3,5&#8208;substituted aromatics with high regioselectivities respectively. Besides, the semi&#8208;intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between	diynes and alkynes are also amenable under this catalytic system. This approach operates without metal reductant, exhibits wide functional groups tolerance, ease of scalability and furnishes 75 examples with moderate to good yields, including some biorelevant compounds. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculation revealed the catalytic pathways of 1,3,5&#8208; and 1,2,4&#8208;cyclotrimerizations, and the origin of the ligand controlled regioselectivity.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;carboalkoxy&#8208;3&#8208;substituted&#8208;cyclohexenones are powerful building blocks for the synthesis of a variety of bioactive target molecules. Their preparations requires multi&#8208;steps sequence involving the use of stoichiometric quantities of various reagents, while the catalytic approaches are limitited to trisubstituted cyclohexenones. We describe here an efficient catalytic approach based on gold(I)&#8208;catalysis starting from unsymmetrical diynyl mono&#8208;ester or symmetrical diynyl di&#8208;ester substrates. The carbon chain linking the two alkyne functions can bear two or one substituent, or even be unsubstituted. Regardless of the nature of the substrates and independently of its substitution, the cyclohexenone derivatives are cleanly produced.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(II) complex dispersed in imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid: Recyclable catalyst system for regioselective and chemoselective hydrobromination and hydrochlorination of alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a recyclable catalyst system combining Cu(II)O and 4,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline in a 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid for the hydrohalogenation of alkynes. The reaction efficiently yields alkenyl bromides and chlorides with good functional group tolerance and regioselectivity across a range of functionalized alkynes. Remarkably, the reaction exhibits unprecedented chemoselectivity for alkyne over alkenes in polyenynes and enables late&#8208;stage modifications to rapidly synthesize brominated polyenes. The catalyst system could be recycled for up to six runs without significant reduction of the reaction yield.</dc:description>

</title>

         <dc:description>Click reactions display many of the goals desired for more sustainable chemical
conversions.  Yet, the solvent used is an often overlooked aspect in determining the
environmental impact of reactions. In the current paper we develop the first
mechanochemical method for the efficient and solvent&#8208;free SuFEx reaction of sulfonyl
fluorides with a wide range of phenols.  After outlining the optimization process, which
yields an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use and robust method, we provide indications of the very wide
scope of this approach, and demonstrate this potential via the application to a range of
natural phenols that also display other functionalities, and several gram&#8208;scale
syntheses.</dc:description>
