         <title>Aryldiazonium Salts in Photoredox Catalysis &#8211; Recent Trends</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Aryl diazonium salts are an important class of organic compounds that are now widely used as arylating agents in photoredox catalysis owing to their lower redox potential, broad substrate scope, and atom economy. They have successfully been used in many interesting organic transformations to introduce an aryl group. They serve as good alternatives for aryl halides and other aryl organometallic reagents primarily used as aryl group surrogates. New reactions using aryl diazonium salts are continually emerging, and in this review, we have highlighted some recent developments in photoredox arylations and their applications.

Abstract
Recalling the serious hazards imposed by the &#8220;ungreen&#8221; techniques used over the years, chemists are now expected to adopt synthetic tactics that strictly adhere to the three E's of green chemistry: Environmental, Economical and Energy efficient. Among the various measures undertaken to improve the benignity of a chemical system, top priority has been given for identifying abundant, non&#8208;toxic and non&#8208;flammable greener solvents such as water, replacing detrimental organic solvents. Despite the safer aspects, reactions in aqueous solutions hardly meet the green chemical standards, particularly due to the challenging product isolation and purification techniques. Sharpless's demonstration of, until then almost unknown, &#8220;on water&#8221; effect was a major breakthrough in the realm of sustainable organic chemistry. Needless to say, integration of homo&#8208;/heterogeneous water&#8208;compatible catalysts under &#8220;on water&#8221; conditions without deteriorating its efficiency, has also awakened the industrial prospects of the protocol. Among the various transition metals, copper complexes or salts are considered as first line catalysts due to their irrevocable contributions to the synthetic world. Also, due to the water tuneable nature of these catalysts, many copper&#8208;catalysed organic transformations that once required harsh conditions, could now be obtained using clean and safe protocols. This review comprehends the recent advancements in the copper&#8208;catalysed &#8220;on water&#8221; reactions covering literatures since 2006.

         <title>Glycosyltransferase Co&#8208;immobilization for Natural Product Glycosylation: Cascade Biosynthesis of the C&#8208;Glucoside Nothofagin with Efficient Reuse of Enzymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sugar nucleotide&#8208;dependent (Leloir) glycosyltransferases are synthetically important for oligosaccharides and small molecule glycosides. Their practical use involves one&#8208;pot cascade reactions to regenerate the sugar nucleotide substrate. Glycosyltransferase co&#8208;immobilization is vital to advance multi&#8208;enzyme glycosylation systems on solid support. Here, we show glycosyltransferase chimeras with the cationic binding module Z&lt;sub&gt;basic2&lt;/sub&gt; for efficient and well&#8208;controllable two&#8208;enzyme co&#8208;immobilization on anionic (ReliSorb SP400) carrier material. We use the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;glycosyltransferase from rice (&lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;/i&gt;Os&lt;/i&gt;CGT) and the sucrose synthase from soybean (&lt;i&gt;Glycine max&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;i&gt;Gm&lt;/i&gt;SuSy) to synthesize nothofagin, the natural 3&#8217;&#8208;&lt;/i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucoside of the dihydrochalcone phloretin, with regeneration of uridine 5&#8217;&#8208;diphosphate (UDP) glucose from sucrose and UDP. Exploiting enzyme surface tethering via Z&lt;sub&gt;basic2&lt;/sub&gt;, we achieve programmable loading of the glycosyltransferases (~18 mg/g carrier; 60%&#8208;70% yield; ~80% effectiveness) in an activity ratio (&lt;/i&gt;Os&lt;/i&gt;CGT:&lt;i&gt;Gm&lt;/i&gt;SuSy = ~1.2) optimal for the overall reaction rate (~0.2 mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8208;1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8208;1&lt;/sup&gt; catalyst; 30&#176;C, pH 7.5). Using phloretin solubilized at 120 mM as inclusion complex with 2&#8208;hydroxypropyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin, we demonstrate complete substrate conversion into nothofagin (~52 g/L; 21.8 mg product h&lt;sup&gt;&#8208;1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8208;1&lt;/sup&gt; catalyst) at 4% mass loading of the catalyst. The UDP&#8208;glucose was recycled 240 times. The solid catalyst showed excellent reusability, retaining ~40% of initial activity after 15 cycles of phloretin conversion (60 mM) with a catalyst turnover number of ~273 g nothofagin/g protein used. Our study presents important progress towards applied bio&#8208;catalysis with immobilized glycosyltransferase cascades.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Tetrahydro&#8208;furanyl Spirooxindoles via [3+2] Annulations of 3&#8208;Hydroxyoxindoles and Cyclic Ketolactams</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric construction of pharmacologically interesting tetrahydrofuranyl spirooxindole frameworks has been achieved through organocatalytic [3+2] annulations of the readily available 3&#8208;hydroxyoxindoles and pyrrolidone&#8208;derived cyclic ketolactams. A variety of chiral spiro tetrahydrofuranyl products, which contain four contiguous stereocenters including two tetrasubstituted carbon centers, have been rapidly synthesized with remarkable results (up to 99% yield, &gt;95:5 dr, and 99:1 er). Synthetic derivatization of the hemiketal moiety enables the installation of various halogen atoms into the structurally complex molecules in a stereospecific manner. Preliminary screening of anticancer bioactivity was performed, and 4w showed obvious inhibitory capacity to the proliferation on a panel of cancer cell lines.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Synthesis of Rotationally Hindered C12&#8208;Naphthylated Tribenzo[a,c,j]xanthenes through Catalytic Tricyclization of Yne&#8208;Allenones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed tricyclization of yne&#8722;allenones with 1&#8208;alkynylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ols has been developed, and used to produce a wide range of rotationally hindered tribenzo[a,c,j]xanthenes with generally good yields and stereoselectivity. This process involves a complex [2 + 2] cycloaddition relay and [4 + 2] cyclization cascade, enabling scission/recombination of C&#8722;C triple bonds to access unprecedented hexaheterocyclic architectures. The reaction also features good compatibility with different types of substituents, high annulation efficiency and the efficient control of regio&#8208; and stereochemistry.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this study, visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced [3+2] cyclization reactions of hydrazones with hypervalent iodine diazo reagents as diazomethyl radical precursors are reported. Mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group compatibility were observed. Furthermore, the synthetic utility was demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis and elaboration to several value&#8208;added products. This protocol broadens the scope of diazo chemistry, and is applicable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium Catalyzed Aminocarbonylation of Benzylic Ammonium Triflates with Nitroarenes: Synthesis of Phenylacetamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A palladium catalyzed reductive aminocarbonylation of benzylic ammonium triflates with nitroarenes for the synthesis of phenylacetamides was developed. Using Pd(acac)2/DPPF catalyst system, a range of different substituted phenylacetamides were prepared in moderate to good yields from benzylic ammonium triflates and nitroarenes through Csp3&#8722;N bond cleavage. A variety of alkyl, aryl, and halide substituents on both substrates can be used, and many useful functional groups can be tolerated.

         <title>Access to Trisubstituted Fluoroalkenes by Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Metathesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the olefin metathesis reaction is a well&#8208;known and powerful strategy to get alkenes, this reaction remained highly challenging with fluororalkenes, especially the Cross&#8208;Metathesis (CM) process. Our thought was to find an easy accessible, convenient, reactive and post&#8208;functionalizable source of fluoroalkene, that we found as the methyl 2&#8208;fluoroacrylate. We reported herein the efficient Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed CM reaction of various terminal and internal alkenes with methyl 2&#8208;fluoroacrylate giving access, for the first time, to trisubstituted fluoroalkenes stereoselectively. Unprecedent TON for CM involving fluoroalkene, up to 175, have been obtained and the reaction proved to be tolerant and effective with a large range of olefin partners giving fair to high yields in metathesis products.</dc:description>

Abstract
We herein report the ammonium salt&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted isoindolinones bearing a heteroatom functionality in the 3&#8208;position. A broad variety of differently substituted CF3S&#8208; and RS&#8208;derivatives were obtained with often high enantioselectivities when using Maruoka's bifunctional chiral ammonium salt catalyst. In addition, a first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the racemic synthesis of the analogous F&#8208;containing products was obtained as well, giving access to one of the rare examples of a fairly stable &#945;&#8208;F&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid derivative.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Supported, Well&#8208;Defined Metal&#8208;Based Catalysts for C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization and Related Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The use of graphenic materials as support for transition metal&#8208;based catalysts in reactions involving the functionalization of carbon&#8208;hydrogen bonds is reviewed. In many cases, the catalytic activities reported are comparable or better than the homogeneous counterparts, a feature which adds to a substantial degree of recyclability of the materials.

Abstract
Phenanthridine derivatives are one of the most intensively studied families of biologically active compounds. There has been considerable scientific interest in the turn of this century in the synthesis of these N&#8208;containing heterocycles as they are prevalent in many alkaloids and also possess striking biological activities including antibacterial, antifungal, antitumor activities. In this regard, a number of synthetic approaches toward the construction of phenanthridine moieties with various substituents, and to increase their yield have been developed by the synthetic organic community. Even though many researchers have developed various innovative methods for the synthesis of phenanthridine derivatives for the past few years, still there is substantial scope for the discovery of novel synthetic methods. In this review, the latest developments in the diverse synthetic strategies of phenanthridine derivatives in the presence and absence of metals were described. The present review also enlightens the use of different reagents, the diversity of the substrates identified, and the plausible mechanisms unravelled towards the construction of these biologically relevant scaffolds.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Sulfonyl&#8208; and Bromo&#8208;Substituted Indolo[2,1&#8208;&#945;]isoquinoline Derivatives through Electrochemical Radical Cascade Cyclization</title>

Abstract
A tunable electrosynthesis of sulfonyl&#8208; and bromo&#8208;substituted indolo[2,1&#8208;&#945;]isoquinoline derivatives has been disclosed. In this reaction, a variety of easily available 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl indoles can readily react with sulfonyl and/or bromine radicals, which are generated from arylsulfonyl hydrazides and potassium bromide respectively, to furnish the valuable sulfonyl&#8208; and bromo&#8208;substituted benzindolo&#8208;fused polycyclic compounds in moderate to good yields. Control experiment indicated that the reaction proceeds via a radical cascade cyclization pathway. This protocol features broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance under transition metal&#8208;free and oxidant&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>A Catalytic Construction of Indoles via Formation of Ruthenium Vinylidene Species from N&#8208;Arylynamides</title>

Abstract
Treatment of ynamides with a catalytic amount of TpRuCl(PPh3)2 resulted in the construction of indole scaffolds known as privileged structure motifs. This reaction involved a cascade of 1,2&#8208;rearrangement and cyclization carrying out C&#8722;C bond formation via a ruthenium vinylidene intermediate, as revealed by a deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments. Furthermore, the transformation of multi&#8208;functionalized ynamide, derived from a practical drug molecule, showed a high functional group tolerance of this reaction.

Abstract
A pyridine&#8208;catalysed desulfonylative addition of &#946;&#8208;diketones to arylazosulfones was developed to obtain diazenyl &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. The aryldiazenyl group was observed in the desired product from arylazosulfones, and this diazenylation reaction was achieved via a possible rearrangement process based on diaziridine ring cleavage. The scope of the protocol was investigated and a plausible mechanism was given.

Abstract
A protocol was described to access diverse isothiazoles with functionalization potential via transition metal&#8208;free three&#8208;component annulation of alkynones, potassium ethylxanthate (EtOCS2K) and ammonium iodide (NH4I). A sequential regioselective hydroamination/thiocarbonylation/intramolecular cyclization cascade achieved the efficient formation of consecutive C&#8722;N, C&#8722;S and N&#8722;S bonds in a one&#8208;pot process.

Abstract
A protocol for the synthesis of 10&#8208;phenanthrenol from 1&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylethanone bearing an electron&#8208;withdrawing group through metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H arylation has been established. The electrochemical intramolecular cycloaromatization avoids the use of excess amounts of chemical oxidizing agents, and provides concise and regio&#8208;selective access to a variety of valuable 10&#8208;phenanthrenol derivatives.

&lt;p&gt;A protocol for the synthesis of 10&#8208;phenanthrenol from 1&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylethanone bearing an electron&#8208;withdrawing group through metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H arylation has been established. The electrochemical intramolecular cycloaromatization avoids the use of excess amounts of chemical oxidizing agents, and provides concise and regio&#8208;selective access to a variety of valuable 10&#8208;phenanthrenol derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Selective Synthesis of Benzothiophene&#8208;Fused Polycyclic, Eight&#8208;Membered N&#8208;Heterocycles via Amine&#8208;Mediated Three&#8208;Component Domino Strategy</title>

Abstract
A product&#8208;selective strategy was used to synthesize benzothiophene&#8208;fused polycyclic, eight&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles via a three&#8208;component domino reaction of thioisatins under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The reaction between tryptamine, thioisatin, and bromoacetophenone produced benzothiophene&#8208;fused polycyclic compounds. In contrast, using D&#8208;tryptophan methyl ester hydrochloride instead of tryptamine afforded benzothiophene&#8208;fused eight&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles. DFT calculations showed that the benzothiophene&#8208;fused polycyclic compounds formed via the Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. However, the ester group in D&#8208;tryptophan methyl ester hydrochloride changed the reaction pathway and produced benzothiophene&#8208;fused eight&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles.

Abstract
Visible light promoted fluoroalkylation of hydrazones using 4&#8208;perfluoropyridine sulfides as fluoroalkyl radical sources is described. The process can proceed in neutral and reductive modes delivering either hydrazones or hydrazines, respectively, depending on structure of starting substrates and reaction conditions. For the reductive process, ascorbic acid is used as a terminal reductant, which recycles the photocatalyst and serves as a source of hydrogen towards nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals.

         <title>Effective C5&#8208;Arylation of Peptide&#8208;Integrated Oxazoles: Almazole&#8197;D</title>

Abstract
An efficient functionalization approach of oxazoles by using Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions is reported. Oxazolone formation and subsequent sulfamoylation in&#8197;situ are facilitated by employing N,N&#8208;diethylsulfamoyl imidazolium triflate. Cross&#8208;couplings provide both oxazole&#8208;arenes and oxazole&#8208;heteroarenes and were compatible with sensitive and epimerization&#8208;prone substrates, as exemplified by the total synthesis of the natural product almazole D.

Abstract
Stabilised arylzinc iodide, prepared by direct insertion of zinc into aryl iodides, were used as nucleophiles in the Hayashi Rh&#8208;catalysed enantioselective conjugate addition to enones. The reaction conditions were optimized in the addition of phenylzinc iodide to 2&#8208;cyclohexen&#8208;1&#8208;one, obtaining good yields and 99% ee of the addition product. The general applicability of the protocol was checked using different arylzinc iodides and enones. Organometallic reagents endowed with both halogen and electrophilic groups were also successfully used.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective C5&#8208;dicarbonylation reaction of anthranils has been developed for synthesis of 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds using methyl ketone as a commercially available carbonylation reagent. This process represents the first example to implement the C5&#8208;dicarbonylation of anthranils, which involves an oxidative Csp3&#8208;H/Csp2&#8208;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction along with thermolytic N&#8722;O bond cleavage.

Abstract
Synthesis of triazolo[1,5&#8208;a][1,4]diazepin&#8208;6&#8208;ones on solid support is reported in this article. Amino acids immobilized on Wang resin were nosylated and alkylated with propargyl alcohol, but&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ol or different 3&#8208;phenylprop&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ols using Mitsunobu alkylation conditions. After denosylation, acylation with Fmoc&#8208;azidoalanine yielded linear precursors that were thermally cyclized on resin to give immobilized triazolodiazepinones. After cleavage from the polymer support, the target compounds were obtained in high crude purities and good overall yields. Furthermore, the synthetic approach was applied to convenient solid&#8208;phase synthesis of oligopeptide containing the triazolodiazepinone moiety as the peptidomimetic heterocyclic constraint.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthesis of triazolo[1,5&#8208;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;][1,4]diazepin&#8208;6&#8208;ones on solid support is reported in this article. Amino acids immobilized on Wang resin were nosylated and alkylated with propargyl alcohol, but&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ol or different 3&#8208;phenylprop&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ols using Mitsunobu alkylation conditions. After denosylation, acylation with Fmoc&#8208;azidoalanine yielded linear precursors that were thermally cyclized on resin to give immobilized triazolodiazepinones. After cleavage from the polymer support, the target compounds were obtained in high crude purities and good overall yields. Furthermore, the synthetic approach was applied to convenient solid&#8208;phase synthesis of oligopeptide containing the triazolodiazepinone moiety as the peptidomimetic heterocyclic constraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
A type of 2,2&#8208;disubstituted N&#8208;sulfonylaziridines bearing OTBS groups and aryl groups at two different substitutions of the aziridine ring has been prepared. Based on them, a stepwise strategy involving ring opening of aziridines and C&#8722;H activation/cyclization has been developed for the general synthesis of spiroindoline pyrans and spiroindoline furans.

         <title>The Synthesis of Pyridyl[2.2]paracyclophanes by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Pyridine Sulfinates</title>

Abstract
Substituted planar chiral pyridyl[2.2]paracyclophanes were prepared by the palladium&#8208;catalyzed desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling of bromo[2.2]paracyclophanes and pyridine sulfinate salts. Pyridine&#8208;substituted [2.2]paracyclophanes are useful building blocks in the preparation of catalysts, functionalized materials, and luminescent molecules. Yet the synthesis of many pyridine&#8208;substituted [2.2]paracyclophanes is more challenging than expected due to the instability of traditional coupling partners. Pyridine sulfinates offer a solution to this shortcoming, permitting pyridyl[2.2]paracyclophanes to be prepared from readily available bromo[2.2]paracyclophanes. Our preliminary results indicate the potential of this chemistry. Amine, bromine and ester substituted planar chiral pyridines that are hard to synthesize by other methods were formed but formation of (bis)pyridines is still problematic.

Abstract
Dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;thiazine skeletons bearing olefin fragment at their &#945;&#8208;position were prepared through a Pd(OAc)2&#8208;catalysed Fujiwara&#8208;Moritani type reaction via C&#8722;H alkenylation with olefins. This approach is selective, generalizable to a wide range of olefins and requires only 1&#8197;eq. of Ag2CO3 without the need of co&#8208;oxidant. The C&#8722;H bond activation proved to be strongly dependent on the olefin's substitution while unfused dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;thiazines seemed to be affected by the oxidation state of the sulfur atom. The utility of olefins obtained was demonstrated by their implication in the dipolar cycloaddition reaction with a non&#8208;stabilized azomethine ylide.

Abstract
The preparation of homoallylic alcohols by addition of organometallic allyl compounds to carbonyls is an important strategy in organic chemistry. Allylating organometallic cobalt species can be generated employing stoichiometric quantities of Zn acting as reductant. To avoid the employment of stoichiometric amount of Zn, we have developed an allylation reaction of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes promoted by photoredox catalysis in the presence of a cobalt complex, and we present herein a full account of our research. In the presence of the abundant CoBr2 (10&#8197;mol&#8201;%), 4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl (dtbbpy, 10&#8197;mol&#8201;%), allyl acetate (3&#8197;equiv.), [Ir(dtbbpy)(ppy)2]PF6 (ppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridine, 2&#8197;mol&#8201;%), and N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (4&#8197;equiv.), an allylation of aldehydes is taking place, in moderate to good yields. Substrates scope, limitations, and photophysical investigations of this new process are reported.

Abstract
Benzofused lactams, especially indolin&#8208;2&#8208;one and dihydroquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;one are popular structural motives in durgs and natural products. Herein, we developed a room temperature and robust synthesis of benzofused lactams through cobalt(III)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H amidation. In this protocol, in&#8208;situ formation of Cp*Co(III)(ligand) catalyst from Cp*Co(CO)I2 and ligand simplify the synthetic effort of cobalt complexes. Simple and readily synthesized 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones underwent room temperature intramolecular C&#8722;H amidation and afforded a wide variety of functionalized benzofused lactams in up to 86% yield. The scalability of the reaction is also be demonstrated.

         <title>Selective Construction of C&#8722;C and C=C Bonds by Manganese Catalyzed Coupling of Alcohols with Phosphorus Ylides</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report the manganese catalyzed coupling of alcohols with phosphorus ylides. The selectivity in the coupling of primary alcohols with phosphorus ylides to form carbon&#8208;carbon single (C&#8722;C) and carbon&#8208;carbon double (C=C) bonds can be controlled by the ligands. In the conversion of more challenging secondary alcohols with phosphorus ylides the selectivity towards the formation of C&#8722;C vs. C=C bonds can be controlled by the reaction conditions, namely the amount of base. The scope and limitations of the coupling reactions were thoroughly evaluated by the conversion of 21 alcohols and 15 ylides. Notably, compared to existing methods, which are based on precious metal complexes as catalysts, the present catalytic system is based on earth abundant manganese catalysts. The reaction can also be performed in a sequential one&#8208;pot reaction generating the phosphorus ylide in&#8197;situ followed manganese catalyzed C&#8722;C and C=C bond formation. Mechanistic studies suggest that the C&#8722;C bond was generated via a borrowing hydrogen pathway and the C=C bond formation followed an acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling pathway.

The front cover picture illustrates the cascade cyclization of propargylic alcohols with diverse nucleophiles for the construction of heterocyclic compounds via the allenyl carbocation intermediate. In this review, these reactions can be divided into four categories based on the types of nucleophiles, such as C&#8208;nucleophiles, O,S&#8208;nucleophiles, N,P&#8208;nucleophiles, and halo&#8208;nucleophiles. A series of functionalized heterocyclic compounds were constructed under mild reaction conditions. Details can be found in the review by Qiang Xiao and co&#8208;workers (X.&#8208;R. Song, R. Yang, Q. Xiao, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2021, 363, 852&#8211;876; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202001142).

Abstract
The photochemistry of organophosphorus compounds and their reactions with carbon&#8208;centred radicals was studied from the 1950s to the 70s, but has not been well exploited in synthetic chemistry until very recently. This review discusses the various modes of reactivity that phosphorus compounds display in radical C&#8722;C bond forming reactions, including the role of phosphonium salts as radical precursors, phosphines and phosphites as deoxygenating agents from oxygen&#8208;centred radicals and phosphines in electron&#8208; and charge&#8208;transfer chemistry. We also highlight the potential that these processes have in the future development of new reactions and cascade processes.

Abstract
The use of diazo compounds in the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions to form C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (X=O, S, N, Si, P etc.) bonds have been a well established approach in organic synthesis. In this context, various transition metals such as Pd, Cu, Rh, Ni, Co, Fe, Ir etc. have proved useful to generate a metal&#8208;carbene intermediate which subsequently undergoes carbene transfer or insertion to form C&#8722;C, C&#8722;Si or C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. However, the use of most abundant, cheaper and environmentally benign metal such as iron to catalyze carbene&#8208;transfer reactions has attracted considerable attention in the last few years. Iron is the second most abundant transition metal in nature and also an integral part of various biological systems which make it highly valuable to use as a catalyst in organic chemistry. This review summarizes the efforts made after 2013 in the area of iron&#8208;catalyzed chemical and enzymatic carbene&#8208;transfer reactions using diazo compounds as carbene precursor.

Abstract
The development of versatile methods for the formation of carbon&#8208;nitrogen bonds has significant impact on the synthetic chemistry community. However, it remains challenging owing to the utilization of costly catalyst systems and harsh reaction conditions. Compared to conventional methods, photoredox catalysis which harnesses the energy from light has emerged as an environmentally benign and cost&#8208;effective strategy for promoting challenging C&#8722;N bond constructions. Furthermore, the synergistic action of photoredox catalysis with another catalytic process has a profound impact on the reactivity profiles of many traditional synthetic routes. Over the recent years, immense progress has been made towards expediting photocatalysis in dual&#8208;catalysis for achieving various industrially important C&#8722;N bond formation processes under milder conditions. This review highlights the advancement of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art achieved in these dual&#8208;catalytic platforms for the construction of C&#8722;N bonds over the last decade.

Abstract
Heterocyclic compounds are important organic compounds and have emerged as key scaffolds in numerous drugs, natural products, vitamins, biologically and pharmaceutically active compounds. Over the past few decades, the development of versatile methodologies employing propargylic alcohols as synthons for the construction of heterocyclic skeletons has attracted great attention from synthetic chemists. In this review, recent developments in the cascade cyclization of propargylic alcohols with diverse nucleophiles to construct heterocyclic compounds are summarized. According to the types of nucleophiles, these reactions can be divided into four categories: 1) Reactions involving C&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation; 2) Reactions involving O, S&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation; 3) Reactions involving N, P&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation; 4) Reactions involving halo&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterocyclic compounds are important organic compounds and have emerged as key scaffolds in numerous drugs, natural products, vitamins, biologically and pharmaceutically active compounds. Over the past few decades, the development of versatile methodologies employing propargylic alcohols as synthons for the construction of heterocyclic skeletons has attracted great attention from synthetic chemists. In this review, recent developments in the cascade cyclization of propargylic alcohols with diverse nucleophiles to construct heterocyclic compounds are summarized. According to the types of nucleophiles, these reactions can be divided into four categories: 1) Reactions involving C&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation; 2) Reactions involving O, S&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation; 3) Reactions involving N, P&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation; 4) Reactions involving halo&#8208;nucleophiles to capture allenyl carbocation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
Quinoxalines represent bicyclic nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles with a wide array of applications. They exhibit a multitude of biological activities relevant in medicinal chemistry as well as a plethora of luminescence properties. Quinoxaline syntheses exploit the whole raft of multicomponent syntheses from domino to sequential or consecutive reactions, harvesting well&#8208;known synthetic concepts and reactions, such as Ugi&#8208;reactions, but also leading to the development of novel reactions and sequences. Diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis and transition metal catalyzed multicomponent reactions open efficient pathways to quinoxalines and quinoxaline&#8208;containing moieties in a one&#8208;pot fashion. This review outlines the underlying reaction&#8208;based principles of multicomponent syntheses of quinoxalines and summarizes recent developments quinoxaline&#8208;directed MCRs, illustrating their scopes.

Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles have attracted considerable attention due to their extensive applications in the fields of organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science. This review focuses on the recent advances in the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles via the cyclization of alkynyl imines. By using this protocol, a variety of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, mainly including four&#8208;, five&#8208;, six&#8208;, and seven&#8208;membered nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, aza&#8208;spirocycles, and fused aza&#8208;heterocycles, could be obtained efficiently under mild conditions. Additionally, mechanistic features of these transformations are also discussed.

Abstract
A general and effective protocol to synthesize &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dibromo aryl ketones has been developed via an electrochemical oxidative method. The reaction proceeds smoothly at room temperature in an undivided cell without the addition of external oxidants. In the reaction process, LiBr acts as both bromine source and supporting electrolyte. This electrooxidation strategy has good substrate applicability and functional group compatibility. Moreover, the reaction could be scaled up efficiently in a continuous flow cell. The target product could undergo further functionalization for the synthesis of some useful heterocyclic compounds.

         <title>A Visible Light and Iron&#8208;mediated Carbocationic Route to Polysubstituted 1&#8208;Halonaphthalenes by Benzannulation using Allylbenzenes and Polyhalomethanes</title>

Abstract
A wide array of polysubstituted 1&#8208;bromo and chloronaphthalenes are obtained from coupling of allylbenzenes and polyhalomethanes. The reaction is mediated by iron metal under visible light irradiation and proceeds via a Kharasch addition intermediate followed by intramolecular FeIII mediated Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation, with the formation of two Csp2&#8722;Csp2 bonds in the process. This method gives easy access to 1&#8208;halonaphthalenes with substituent(s) at C&#8208;5 to C&#8208;8 that are otherwise hard to synthesize.

Abstract
Furfurylamines are important building blocks for the synthesis of many pharmacologically active compounds and polymers. In this work, direct reductive amination of biobased furans to N&#8208;substituted furfurylamines by reductive aminase from Aspergillus oryzae (AspRedAm) was reported. Besides the reductive aminase activity, AspRedAm also showed a promiscuous, yet low alcohol dehydrogenase activity. The variant W210F proved to be a good catalyst for the synthesis of N&#8208;substituted furfurylamines. Furans were transformed to the target products with the conversions up to &gt;99% and selectivities up to &gt;99%. In addition, N&#8208;substituted furfurylamines were synthesized in the total turnover number (TTN) up to 3200 on a preparative scale, indicating the applicability of this biocatalytic route in synthetic chemistry.

Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Ketothioesters undergo triphenylphosphine (PPh3)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization with acetylenedicarboxylate esters smoothly, in contrast to &#945;&#8208;ketooxoesters which require more drastic conditions with the limited substrate scope. The reaction works well with a wide range of &#945;&#8208;ketothioesters, delivering highly functionalized &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones in moderate to excellent yields. The higher reactivity of the thioester derivatives is seemingly due to a favourable intramolecular non&#8208;bonding electrostatic 1,4&#8208;interaction involving C&#8722;S &#963;* orbital on the sulphur atom and the lone pair of electrons in the electron&#8208;donating oxygen atom. This is apparent from the X&#8208;ray crystallographically determined internuclear distance between the sulphur and ketone (C=O) oxygen atoms (2.71&#8211;2.85&#8197;&#197;), which is significantly less than the sum of their van der Waals radii (3.25&#8211;3.30&#8197;&#197;). The substitution on the S atom is oriented diametrically away from the ketone O atom to maximize the interaction between them. The trend is also seen in the 1,4&#8208;S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O contact between the S and furan O atoms (2.70&#8197;&#197;) in the &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone products.

Abstract
An approach to 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzo[f]isoindolones by a Ag&#8208;catalyzed Ugi 4CR/cascade radical cyclization sequence under mild conditions has been developed. The reaction of (E)&#8208;2&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;4&#8208;arylbut&#8208;3&#8208;ynoic acids, aldehydes, amines, and isocyanides produced 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;benzo[f]isoindolones regioselectively in 60&#8211;85% yields via sequential Ugi 4CR/cascade radical cyclization reaction in the presence of Cs2CO3 and AgOTf. The method achieved the formation of two C&#8722;C bonds under air atmosphere in one&#8208;pot fashion.

Abstract
A rhodium catalyzed allylic cyanation of 3&#8208;fluoroallylic trifluoroacetates with TMSCN and a bulky phosphite ligand gives 3&#8208;fluoroallylic nitriles with a good substrate scope and high Z/E&#8208;selectivity. For dialkylated substrates the fluorine substituent controls the regioselectivity in favor of the distal product. For the stereoselectivity of the allylic cyanation selected scalemic substrates showed inversion of the stereocenter and some or no stereoerosion.

         <dc:description>








Abstract
The utilization of carbon dioxide as a building block in organic synthesis has become a highly sought&#8208;after research area. In this minireview, an overview of recent advances on carboxylations using carbon dioxide via visible light photoredox and transition&#8208;metal dual catalysis is given. The merging of these methods provides new avenues to construct carboxylates.

Abstract
C4&#8208;C5 periannulation of 1&#8208;naphthols and ynones via BF3.Et2O mediated one&#8208;pot cascade under metal and solvent&#8208;free conditions have been developed for the synthesis of perinaphthenones. Furthermore, this strategy features the formation of new periannulation at C4&#8208;C5 positions of &#945;&#8208;naphthol, synthesis of highly substituted perinaphthenones, broad substrate scope, readily available starting materials and good to moderate yields. The perinaphthenones products synthesized here have exhibited interesting photo physical properties

Abstract
Pauson&#8208;Khand reactions (PKR) with concomitant C&#8722;O bond cleavage have been developed for construction of 5,5&#8208; 5,6&#8208; and 5,7&#8208;bicyclic ring systems bearing complex stereochemistry. The chemistry generates intermolecular PKR&#8208;type products in an absolute regio&#8208; and stereochemical control which is hardly achievable through real intermolecular Pauson&#8208;Khand reactions. A mechanism for this Pauson&#8208;Khand reaction has been proposed based on deuterium labelling experiments.

         <title>Photochemical and electrochemical strategies towards benzylic C&#8208;H functionalization: a recent update</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalysed processes have been widely used for the functionalization of inert C&#8208;H bonds. Strategies for the functionalization of the benzylic C&#8208;H position having a relatively weak C&#8208;H bond (bond dissociation energy  &#820; 80 &#8208; 90 kcal/mol) differ from the inert aliphatic and aromatic C&#8208;H positions with stronger C&#8208;H bonds. The recent advances in the direct activation of the benzylic position through the generation of C(sp3) radicals have demonstrated the potential of electrochemistry and photochemistry as a means for constructing new chemical bonds. This review will cover the recent progress of benzylic C&#8208;H functionalization through organic radical strategies employing photochemistry and electrochemistry as sustainable tools. In addition, the mechanistic details of the typical reactions have been included which, in turn, will help the researchers to look at this promising area from a different perspective towards new discoveries and often hidden opportunities.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Synthesis of Difluoromethylene Phosphonates for Biological Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
For almost 40&#8197;years, difluoromethylene phosphonates have proven to be versatile molecular tools in biochemical studies owing to their close resemblance to naturally occurring phosphates and phosphonates. As bioisosteric, non&#8208;hydrolyzable analogs of these essential molecules, difluoromethylene phosphonates can target the critical parts of the cellular machinery and therefore exhibit a diverse spectrum of biological activity. In the past ten years, there have appeared many new methods for the synthesis of difluoromethylene phosphonates. Most notably, photoredox catalysis has firmly entered the field, while cross&#8208;coupling and nucleophilic strategies have met considerable elaboration and refinement, entirely in accord with the current trends in synthetic organic chemistry. Herein, we introduce difluoromethylene phosphonates as a distinct, high&#8208;tech subclass of synthetic phosphonates resulting from the research efforts on the cross&#8208;section of organophosphorus, organofluorine, and bioorganic chemistry. We then proceed to the discussion of general methods for the preparation of difluoromethylene phosphonates, comprehensively reviewing reactions developed in the past 15&#8197;years while providing the context of earlier works where appropriate. Finally, we present selected examples of molecules with high biological activity, their biological targets, and the synthetic steps employed for their preparation.

Abstract
Herein, we developed a copper&#8208;mediated Chan&#8208;Lam type O&#8208;arylation of arylhydroxylamines with arylboronic acids to generate transient N,O&#8208;diarylhydroxylamines that could rapidly undergo cascade [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement and rearomatization to afford NOBIN (2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl) analogues under mild conditions. The newly synthesized racemic biaryl products can be further resolved by a chiral DMAP&#8208;catalyzed O&#8208;acylation/kinetic resolution protocol.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Preparations and Synthetic Applications of Oxaziridines and Diaziridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Oxaziridines and diaziridines have been used as versatile intermediates due to their high ring strain as well as the reactive C&#8722;O/N bond, for the synthesis of diverse range of nitrogen containing compounds. In the past few decades, numerous novel and handy methodologies on the preparations and utilizations of both the oxaziridines and diaziridines have been developed. In spite of few published reviews in the area (almost a decade back), the synthetic communities have made tremendous progress in their preparations and utilizations. This review has demonstrated the comprehensive advancement in the chemistry of oxaziridines and diaziridines for the last few years (almost a decade).

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Pyrrole&#8208;imidazole Alkaloids via a Tandem C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C coupling Protocol</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we present a strategy for the synthesis of pyrrole alkaloid derivatives through a tandem C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C coupling reaction employing 2&#8208;pyrrole formaldehyde and proline as starting materials. This cyclization protocol is successfully applied to polarity&#8208;controlled site&#8208;selective and stereoselective C(sp3)&#8722;H hydrocarboxylation of proline derivatives, allowing for a remarkably streamlined synthesis of pyrrole alkaloid derivatives which have shown promising biological activities.

         <title>Recent Advances in Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Couplings (CDC) of C&#8722;H Bond in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
To develop highly efficient synthetic reactions is quite important in organic chemistry. Cross dehydrogenative couplings (CDC) utilize C&#8722;H bonds of substrates to construct new C&#8722;X (X=C, S, O, N, P) bonds. For CDC, the pre&#8208;functionalization of reaction substrates can be avoided and the C&#8722;X (X=C, S, O, N, P) bonds can be newly formed by simple and efficient synthesis routes. Meanwhile, water is increasingly used as a substitute for organic solvents in cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling because of its rich content, non&#8208;toxicity, and non&#8208; flammability. In recent years, organic chemists are devoted their efforts to explore the cross dehydrogenative couplings (CDC) in aqueous phase which feature high atom utilization rate and environmental friendliness. Herein, we summarized the recent advances in the construction of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;S, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;P bonds through CDC reactions of C&#8722;H bonds in water.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Alkylselenation of Propiolic Acids with Se Powder and Epoxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative alkylselenation of propiolic acids with Se powder and epoxides leading to alkynyl selenides is developed. This protocol not only provides an approach to obtain alkynyl selenides with the formation of double C&#8722;Se bonds, but also expands the applicability of alkynyl carboxylic acid.

         <title>Practical Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylated Pyridines Based on Regioselective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition using Trifluoromethylated Diynes with Nitriles</title>

Abstract
Regioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition using fluorine&#8208;containing diynes with nitriles was described. Cycloaddition of fluorinated diynes with nitriles under the influence of CoCl2(phen), zinc bromide, and zinc dust in dichloroethane at 80&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8197;h took place smoothly, exclusively affording the corresponding &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkylated pyridines in excellent yields. In addition, dinitriles as substrate were also found to be suitable for this reaction, giving the corresponding fluoroalkylated bipyridine derivatives in excellent yields.

         <title>Advances in Transition&#8208;Metal Catalyzed Carbonylative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling Reaction: An Update</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Transition metals have been an indispensable component of modern catalysis and among these palladium is the top&#8208;ranked choice of chemists as a catalyst. After the several important developments of palladium catalysed C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions, carbonylative transformations have been realised as an attractive post modification of these reactions. Carbonylative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reaction is among such transformations for direct incorporation of CO fragment for the preparation of biaryl or aryl/alkyl ketones via transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Ketone functionality is basically a valuable building block having huge pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications. Moreover, carbonylative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling is also used in the synthesis of various natural bioactive molecules through the direct joining of molecular fragments via CO bridge. In this review, the past decade developments in the carbonylative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions are documented in detail with modern approaches in transition&#8208;metal catalysis.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Cycloisomerization of 1,3&#8208;Diketones with Keto&#8208;Vinylidenecyclopropanes: Synthesis of Enantiomerically Enriched Cyclic &#946;&#8208;Amino Alcohols</title>

Abstract
We report here an effective and atom&#8208;economical method to synthesize enantiomerically enriched cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols via a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloisomerization of 1,3&#8208;diketones with keto&#8208;vinylidenecyclopropanes. The reactions proceed through a Rh&#8208;catalyzed transformation of keto&#8208;vinylidenecyclopropanes via cleavage of the distal C&#8722;C bond of the three&#8208;membered ring as a three&#8208;carbon synthon, allowing the generation of a range of enantiomerically enriched cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols tethered to an alkene and an 1,3&#8208;dione moiety in good yields with high ee values under mild conditions. Derivatizations including allylation of the functionalized &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols and subsequent RCM reaction as well as the preparation of a pyrazole derivative were carried out as well.

         <title>De Novo Construction of Substituted Terephthalates via Phosphine Catalyzed Domino Benzannulation Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The robustness of phosphine catalysis enabling the domino benzannulation reactions of allenoates with enamines is described. A broad array of substituted terephthalates were delivered under simple and practical reaction conditions. Furthermore, the reaction could be carried out on a gram scale with higher yield, and various conversions of the terephthalate products demonstrate the versatility of this transformation.

         <title>PPTS&#8208;Catalyzed Bicyclization Reaction of 2&#8208;Isocyanobenzaldehydes with Various Amines: Synthesis of Diverse Fused Quinazolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A PPTS (pyridinium p&#8208;toluenesulfonate)&#8208;catalyzed bicyclization reaction of 2&#8208;isocyanobenzaldehydes as 1,5&#8208;dielectrophiles with various amines has been developed. The reaction not only provides a simple and efficient strategy for the assembly of structurally diverse fused quinazoline derivatives from readily available substrates under metal&#8208;free and mild conditions in a single step with only water and hydrogen as the by&#8208;products, but also opens the way to the application of o&#8208;formyl arylisocyanides in the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles.

         <title>Engineering an Alcohol Dehydrogenase from Kluyveromyces polyspora for Efficient Synthesis of Ibrutinib Intermediate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
(S)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypiperidine [(S)&#8208;NBHP] is a key intermediate for the synthesis of mantle cell lymphoma drug, ibrutinib. Here, KpADH, an alcohol dehydrogenase from Kluyveromyces polyspora, exhibits evolutionary potential in the asymmetric reduction of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;3&#8208;piperidone (NBPO) to (S)&#8208;NBHP. By screening key residues in substrate binding pocket of KpADH, an excellent variant Y127W was obtained with 6&#8208;fold improved activity of 119.3&#8197;U&#8201;mg&#8722;1, 1.8&#8208;fold enhanced half&#8208;life of 147&#8197;h and strict S&#8208;stereoselectivity (&gt;99% ee). When catalyzed by Y127W, a complete conversion of 600&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 NBPO was achieved at a substrate to catalyst ratio (S/C) of 30 in 10&#8197;h. Based on crystal&#8208;structure of Y127W, molecular docking and dynamic simulations reveal hydrogen bonds formed between W127 and Boc group of NBPO, as well as improved structural stability mainly contribute to the increased catalytic activity and stereoselectivity of Y127W. This study offers guidance for engineering ADHs for biosynthesis of chiral heterocyclic alcohols, and provides insights into mechanisms in catalytic activity and stereoselectivity toward carbonyl&#8208;containing heterocyclic substrates.

         <title>Efficient and Clean Nickel Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;Allylation Reaction of Nitriles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A clean method has been developed for the &#945;&#8208;allylation of phenyl and alpha alkyl phenyl acetonitrile with allylic alcohols. The reaction is catalyzed by nickel complexes in&#8197;situ generated from a combination of Ni(cod)2 and the dppf ligand and performed at 80&#8201;&#176;C in methanol as reaction solvent.	Accordingly to this simple and base&#8208;free protocol that only yields water as a side&#8208;product, many allylic nitriles were synthetized with good yields.

         <title>Salicylic Acid&#8208;Promoted Three&#8208;Component Annulation of Benzimidazoles, Aryl Nitroalkenes and Elemental Sulfur</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, a three&#8208;component cyclization reaction of benzimidazoles, aryl nitroalkenes and elemental sulfur has been developed. Cheap and easily available salicylic acid found to be an efficient mediator for the present transformation. This protocol provides a facile access to structurally significant imidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazole skeleton from simple raw materials with a range of compatible synthetically useful functionalities. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale preparation of this method is effective, which enables potential applications of it in broader fields of molecule synthesis. Mechanistically, a reaction cascade involving sequential aza&#8208;Michael addition, nucleophilic sulfuration, and deaminative aromatization was proposed.

         <title>High&#8208;Level Production of Phenylacetaldehyde using Fusion&#8208;Tagged Styrene Oxide Isomerase</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude improvement in the production of phenylacetaldehyde to 3.37&#8197;M (405&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1) from the enzymatic isomerisation of styrene oxide was achieved. A small ubiquitin&#8208;related modifier (SUMO) tag increases the productivity of the whole&#8208;cell biocatalytic system by enhancing the expression of active membrane&#8208;bound styrene oxide isomerase (SOI) while retaining enzyme catalytic efficiency and broad natural substrate scope. The isomerisation was performed by using Escherichia coli expressing SUMO&#8208;tagged SOI in an organic&#8208;aqueous biphasic system to yield 96% of phenylacetaldehyde.

Abstract
[2.2]Paracyclophane (PCP) derivatives have been promising platforms to study the element of planar chirality and through&#8208;space electronic communications in &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular systems. To access enantiomerically pure derivatives thereof, a kinetic resolution of 4&#8208;acetyl[2.2]&#8208;PCP employing a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrogenation process was developed. This method can be performed on a multigram&#8208;scale and gives access to enantiomerically pure derivatives with planar and central chirality of (Rp)&#8208;4&#8208;acetyl&#8208;PCP (&#8805;97% ee, 43%) and (Sp,S)&#8208;PCP derivatives (&#8805;97% ee, 46%), which are useful intermediates for the synthesis of sterically demanding PCP&#8208;based ligand/catalyst systems and chiral synthons for engineering cyclophane&#8208;based chiroptical materials.

         <title>Electronic Effect&#8208;Guided Rational Design of Candida antarctica Lipase B for Kinetic Resolution Towards Diarylmethanols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Herein, we developed an electronic effect&#8208;guided rational design strategy to enhance the enantioselectivity of Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) mutants towards bulky pyridyl(phenyl)methanols. Compared to W104A mutant previously reported with reversed S&#8208;stereoselectivity toward sec&#8208;alcohols, three mutants (W104C, W104S and W104T) displayed significant improvement of S&#8208;enantioselectivity in the kinetic resolution (KR) of various phenyl pyridyl methyl acetates due to the increased electronic effects between pyridyl and polar residues. The electronic effects were also observed when mutating other residues surrounding the stereospecificity pocket of CALB, such as T42A, S47A, A281S or A281C, and can be used to manipulate the stereoselectivity. A series of bulky pyridyl(phenyl) methanols, including S&#8208;(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl) methanol (S&#8208;CPMA), the intermediate of bepotastine, were obtained in good yields and ee values.

         <title>Electrochemical Thiolation and Borylation of Arylazo Sulfones with Thiols and B2pin2</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An efficient electrochemical synthesis approach of various unsymmetrical thioethers and arylboronates has been developed. Bench stable arylazo sulfones were used as radical precursors for carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond formation under electrochemical conditions. Moreover, the scalability of this approach was evaluated by performing the electrochemical thiolation and borylation of arylazo sulfones with thiols and B2pin2 on a gram scale. This protocol not only avoided the use of stoichiometric oxidants, metal catalysts, activating agents and even added bases, but also exhibited favorable functional group tolerance.

Abstract
An asymmetric (4+1) annulation of 3&#8208;diazooxindoles/4&#8208;diazooxisoquinolines with para&#8208;quinone methides, catalyzed by a chiral phosphoric acid, has been described. A wide range of spiro[dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;oxindoles/2,4&#8242;&#8208;oxisoquinoline] derivatives were afforded with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. In this study, the possible reaction pathway was proposed and the synthetic applications were shown by a tenfold scale&#8208;up conversion as well as the further transformations into other structurally more complex spirocyclic compounds. The significance of this protocol is highlighted by its metal&#8208;free participation with heterocyclic diazo compounds as the direct nucleophile and extremely high efficiency in a straightforward and mild reaction process to access the structurally&#8208;diverse spiro&#8208;heterocyclic 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran derivatives with good to excellent stereocontrol.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An asymmetric (4+1) annulation of 3&#8208;diazooxindoles/4&#8208;diazooxisoquinolines with &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;quinone methides, catalyzed by a chiral phosphoric acid, has been described. A wide range of spiro[dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;oxindoles/2,4&#8242;&#8208;oxisoquinoline] derivatives were afforded with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. In this study, the possible reaction pathway was proposed and the synthetic applications were shown by a tenfold scale&#8208;up conversion as well as the further transformations into other structurally more complex spirocyclic compounds. The significance of this protocol is highlighted by its metal&#8208;free participation with heterocyclic diazo compounds as the direct nucleophile and extremely high efficiency in a straightforward and mild reaction process to access the structurally&#8208;diverse spiro&#8208;heterocyclic 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran derivatives with good to excellent stereocontrol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
The rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H/diazo coupling and tandem annulation of 3&#8208;oxopent&#8208;4&#8208;enenitriles have been proposed for the synthesis of polysubstituted phenols. Most products of phenols are obtained in good yields. Several preliminary mechanistic studies and derivatization reactions of phenol products were also performed. This method offers an alternative approach for the synthesis of useful diverse phenols.

Abstract
A Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed Csp2&#8722;Csp3 bond cleavage/carbonylethylation of &#945;&#8208;indolyl alcohols with allylic alcohols has been reported. This transformation involved a cascade C&#8722;C bond cleavage/C&#8722;C bond formation, and provides a novel approach to assemble 2&#8208;carbonylethylindole skeletons.

Abstract
A simple and efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted selenylation/cyclization of enaminones have been realized for the practical synthesis of 3&#8208;selanyl&#8208;4H&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;ones. This reaction is performed in the mild conditions, no transition metal catalyst or photocatalysts and no additional oxidants are required. In addition, the 3&#8208;selanyl&#8208;4H&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;ones could be easily converted to selanyl&#8208;functionalized pyrimidines by reacting with benzamidine substrates.

         <title>Synthesis of Oxazolidinones by a Hypervalent Iodine Mediated Cyclization of N&#8208;Allylcarbamates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The preparation of oxazolidinones by the hypervalent iodine mediated cyclization of allylcarbamates is described. A versatile range of substrates can be converted into substituted oxazolidinones primed for further transformations. Derivatization of the products at both ends is demonstrated. A preliminary attempt at the enantioselective formation of an oxazolidinone using a chiral iodane is also presented.

Abstract
Herein, we describe a practical protocol for efficient, mild, visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component intermolecular trifluoromethyl&#8208;alkenylation reactions of unactivated alkenes. The protocol has good functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope. Using this protocol, we not only introduced a trifluoromethyl group into alkenes but also converted unactivated alkenes to styrene&#8208;based activated alkenes, in addition to accomplishing late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical intermediates.

         <title>Synthesis of Fluorescent 4&#8208;Azapyrenes by Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Dual C&#8722;H Bond Activation and Annulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Unique dual&#8208;emissive and deep&#8208;blue/green fluorescent multi&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;azapyrenes with bathochromic shift emission, quantum yields up to 0.60 and long excited&#8208;state lifetime were synthesized successfully by annulative &#960;&#8208;extension reactions. This synthesis constitutes a palladium&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative annulation of N&#8208;acyl&#8208;2&#8208;aminobiaryls with in&#8197;situ 1,3&#8208;diynes as a key step, giving substituted phenanthrenes via a rollover C&#8722;H bond activation, followed by Bischler&#8208;Napieralski cyclization. Further &#960;&#8208;extension by superacid&#8208;mediated cyclization produced a blue fluorescent naphtho 4&#8208;azapyrene.

Abstract
In recent years, great improvements have been made on palladium&#8208;catalyzed radical reactions. Emerging elegant methodologies of radical involved palladium&#8208;catalyzed transformations provide more and more effective strategies for the construction of complex heterocyclic compounds and applications in drug discovery. It is universally known that Pd(0)/(II)/(IV)&#8208;mediated reactions usually undergo two&#8208;electron transfer processes, while the Pd(I) and Pd(III) involved reactions usually occur via single electron transfer processes. Since our review on palladium radical was published, numurous methodolgies involving palladium radical have sprung up in the past five years. This review further summarized the up&#8208;to&#8208;date transformations toward palladium radical from 2015. For most of these catalytic cycles strategies, plausible mechanisms are demonstrated in detail to give better insight for chemists in need.

Abstract
Chiral 2&#8208;alkylquinazolinones are key synthetic intermediates, but their preparation in high optical purity is challenging. Thus, a multicomponent procedure integrating anthranilic acids, N&#8208;Boc&#8208;amino acids, and amines in the presence of methanesulfonyl chloride, N&#8208;methylimidazole, and copper(II) chloride was developed to mildly afford N&#8208;Boc&#8208;2&#8208;alkylaminoquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones with excellent preservation of enantiomeric purity (&gt;99% ee). Copper(II) chloride was essential to retaining enantiopurity, and reaction component structural changes were well tolerated, resulting in an efficient, all&#8208;in&#8208;one procedure that promotes sequential coupling, lactonization, aminolysis, and cyclization in good yields. The method was applied to the rapid assembly of four key intermediates used in the synthesis of high profile quinazolinones, including several PI3K inhibitor drugs.

         <title>Recent Developments in Remote Meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Bond Functionalizations</title>

Abstract
In the past decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the developments of novel methods for the activation/functionalization of inert C&#8722;H bonds as these protocols are not only competent, reduce the waste materials in addition to the reaction time and multiple steps but also allows the reaction to be carried out in a highly regio&#8208;specific manner under operationally simple yet effective reaction conditions. Although, in recent years, a remarkable progress has been made in the field of ortho&#8208;and para&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds functionalization but to our best knowledge, the distal meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation/functionalization is still infancy and is yet to be explore to the advanced level. Hence, we feel that there is an urgent need to aware the research community about where the field of meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization stand at present and where it might be going in near future. To this context, we strive to compile the significant achievements made in the selective meta&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds functionalization since 2018 to till date. More interestingly, we have also displayed an overview of the earlier reports related to the meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation/functionalization at the beginning of this particular manuscript, and hopefully the present review article will open diverse opportunities for the advancement of both academia as well as industry.

         <dc:description>








Abstract
In this review, the pivotal achievements and recent advances in catalytic asymmetric aza&#8208;DAR reported up to 2020 are retrospectively considered and their potency for enantioselective synthesis of useful chiral piperidine, quinoline, pyridazine, oxazine and oxadiazine derivatives and fused compounds of higher molecular complexity bearing these pharmacology&#8208;relevant heterocyclic scaffolds is demonstrated. The reported data are systematized according both to key electron transfer modes (normal or invers electron demand reactions) and to main types of attainable heterocyclic products. Of significant attention are an analysis of activation strategies (complexation, enamine or enolate formation, H&#8208;bonding, etc.) applicable to reactions with particular types of dienes and dienophiles and identification of plausible reaction pathways (either concerted or stepwise) over stereoselective cyclization processes. The review contains 310 references and 122 synthetic schemes.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Assisted Grinding Mechanochemistry in the Synthesis of Pharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Mechanochemical reactions by milling, grinding or other types of mechanical action have emerged as a salient green approach because of its wide applications towards academic and industrial chemical communities in sustainable solvent&#8208;free/solvent&#8208;less processes. Liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG) as an extension of traditional solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical techniques by which a small amount of liquid is used as an additive to enhance and/or control reactivity, has been fruitfully applied in the screening of inclusion compounds, cocrystals, salts, solvates, and polymorphs. However, utilization of this important technique in the synthesis of pharmaceutically and biologically relevant targets was not adequately investigated. This review article summarizes an overview of the latest development of LAG mechanochemical approaches in the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and drug&#8208;like fragments, highlights its superiority versus conventional syntheses.

         <title>Unraveling the C&#8722;H Arylation of Benzo&#8208;Fused Cycloalkanones: Combined Experimental and Computational Evidence</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The C&#8722;H functionalization of benzo&#8208;fused cycloalkanones represents a synthetic challenge, since such scaffolds display different activation sites, at sp2 and sp3 carbons, a bicyclic structure, and various sizes of the cycloalkanone ring. Anticipating the outcome of C&#8722;H functionalization and the impact of the presence and size of the cycloalkanone ring would help to foresee synthetic routes to more complex molecular architectures. The mechanism of C&#8722;H arylation was studied using DFT calculations for tetralone, benzosuberone, and indanone and compared to acetophenone. Comparison of energetic profiles allowed identifying key steps of the process. Analysis of the topology of key intermediates allowed correlating the deformation of palladacycles to the potential reactivity of the benzo&#8208;fused cycloalkanone family members. The experimental results were in full agreement with the trend provided by the theoretical study. A wide panel of diversely substituted benzo&#8208;fused cycloalkanones has been successfully obtained using optimized conditions. Moreover, an approach towards polycyclic molecules has been illustrated featuring a C&#8722;H arylation and a second step taking advantage of the remaining ketone fragment and its ability to undergo diverse transformations leading to alternative pathways to more complex molecular architectures

         <title>Use of Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene as a Platform for Metal&#8208;Imidazole Cooperative Catalysis: Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of Alkyne&#8208;Tethered Carboxylic Acids</title>

Abstract
Silver complexes with 5&#8208;(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene ligands were synthesized as metal&#8208;imidazole acid&#8208;base cooperative catalysts. Single crystal XRD analysis revealed that the silver atom was located in the vicinity of the imidazole ring and that cationic silver complexes formed dimers through coordination between the silver metal and the imidazole pendant. These cationic silver complexes served as catalysts for cyclization of alkyne&#8208;tethered carboxylic acids. NMR experiments indicated that the dimeric cationic silver complex dissociated to a monomer upon protonation of the imidazole moiety, resulting in coordination of an acetonitrile to the silver atom. DFT calculations supported the acid&#8208;base cooperative action of the silver&#8208;imidazole for the efficient alkyne&#8208;carboxylic acid cyclization.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of &#960;&#8208;Extended Carbazole&#8208;Based Systems and their Application as Organic Semiconductors</title>

Abstract
Herein we describe a gold&#8208;catalyzed bidirectional synthesis of N&#8208;heteropolycyclic compounds bearing carbazole moieties &#8211; namely &#960;&#8208;extended benzodicarbazoles and &#960;&#8208;extended indolocarbazoles. Overall, four previously unknown core structures were synthesized. This approach is convergent, modular and the gold&#8208;catalyzed key step comprises of a cascade reaction starting from stable di&#8208;azido compounds. The obtained molecules were fully characterized and their optical and electronic properties as well as their performance in organic thin&#8208;film transistors generated by vacuum deposition were studied. Charge&#8208;carrier mobilities of up to 0.3&#8197;cm2/Vs were measured.

Abstract
We report the first synthesis of 2&#8208;alkenylquinolines from 2&#8208;allylquinolines and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The reaction proceeds in a highly regioselective and enantioselective way and shows a broad tolerance of functionalities both in the aromatic ring of the enal and on the quinoline.

         <title>Catalyst and Additive&#8208;Free Selective Ring&#8208;Opening Selenocyanation of Heterocycles with Elemental Selenium and TMSCN</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A catalyst and additive&#8208;free strategy for selective ring&#8208;opening selenocyanation of saturated heterocycles with elemental selenium and TMSCN is developed, affording a series of aliphatic selenocyanates and selenaheterocycles. In the case of unprotected unstrained N&#8208;heterocycles, the reactions offer ammonium selenonitriles that prove to be an efficient selenonitrile reagent.

         <title>Boron Reagents and Catalysts for the Functionalization of Strained Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The particular nature of boron compounds allows an ample modularity of their properties ranging from Lewis acids, C&#8208;nucleophiles, B&#8208;nucleophiles, or even conjunctive reagents for new synthetic manipulations. Moreover, the increasing demand for functionalized boron derivatives for pharmaceutical or material science applications requires the development of new synthetic methods for boron introduction in organic compounds. This review summarizes the possible combinations of boron derivatives with a variety of strained heterocycles reported in the most recent literature.

Abstract
The Rh(III)&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H couplings of 1&#8208;naphthols with gem&#8208;difluoromethylene alkynes have been realized for the direct construction of difluorinated dihydrobenzo[de]chromenes with broad substrate/functional group compatibility and good regio&#8208;/chemoselectivity and in an atom&#8208;economic manner. The unique fluorine effects account for the unconventional reaction path involving intramolecular 1,3&#8208;hydrogen migration process to afford the exo&#8208;methylene fragment.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroarylation of Homopropargyl Iodoindoles with Concurrent Alkyl and Iodonium Migrations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp) arylation/carbocyclization/iodonium migration reaction sequence has been accomplished. Novel 2&#8208;iodo&#8208;1&#8208;aryl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazoles are now easily available. As this result is contrary to the selectivity observed using gold catalysis, the formation of 2&#8208;iodocarbazoles is noticeable, suggesting a metal&#8208;controlled cyclization through chemo&#8208; and regioselective 1,2&#8208;alkyl migration and 1,4&#8208;iodonium migration.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;) arylation/carbocyclization/iodonium migration reaction sequence has been accomplished. Novel 2&#8208;iodo&#8208;1&#8208;aryl&#8208;9&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;carbazoles are now easily available. As this result is contrary to the selectivity observed using gold catalysis, the formation of 2&#8208;iodocarbazoles is noticeable, suggesting a metal&#8208;controlled cyclization through chemo&#8208; and regioselective 1,2&#8208;alkyl migration and 1,4&#8208;iodonium migration.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fluorinated Aryl Boronates as Building Blocks in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Organoboron compounds are well known building blocks for many organic reactions. However, under basic conditions, polyfluorinated aryl boronic acid derivatives suffer from instability issues that are accelerated in compounds containing an ortho&#8208;fluorine group, which result in the formation of the corresponding protodeboronation products. Therefore, a considerable amount of research has focused on novel methodologies to synthesize these valuable compounds while avoiding the protodeboronation issue. This review summarizes the latest developments in the synthesis of fluorinated aryl boronic acid derivatives and their applications in cross&#8208;coupling reactions and other transformations.

Abstract
A procedure on palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative reaction of trifluoroacetimidoyl chlorides and nitro compounds for the construction of pharmaceutically valuable 2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones has been achieved. In this transformation, Mo(CO)6 has been used both as a convenient CO source and a reducing reagent. This newly developed protocol is compatible with various nitro compounds and can be readily scaled up to 1&#8197;mmol scale.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Base&#8208;Controlled C&#8722;N Coupling Reactions: Selective Mono Versus Diarylation of Primary Amines with 2&#8208;Chlorobenzimidazoles</title>

Abstract
Herein, a base&#8208;controlled protocol was developed for the C&#8722;N coupling of primary amines and 2&#8208;chlorobenzimidazoles, affording a handful of secondary or tertiary amines in a selective fashion. Moreover, this protocol was realized under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, and the variation of the base from iPr2NH to LiOtBu completely switched the selectivity from monoarylation to diarylation. Further investigations elucidated that the variety, intrinsic basicity and amount of the utilized bases considerably affected these reactions.

         <title>Zirconium Oxide&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Amidation of Unactivated Esters under Continuous&#8208;Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A sustainable and environmentally benign direct amidation reaction of unactivated esters with amines has been developed in a continuous&#8208;flow system. A commercially available amorphous zirconium oxide was found to be an efficient catalyst for this reaction. While the typical amidation of esters with amines requires a stoichiometric amount of a promoter or metal activator, the present continuous&#8208;flow method enabled the direct amidation reaction under additive&#8208;free conditions with an extensive diversity towards various functional groups. High yields of the products were obtained with a nearly equimolar proportion of starting materials to reduce byproduct formation, which renders this process applicable for use in a sequential&#8208;flow system.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of Aryl Halides with Primary and Secondary Aliphatic Alcohols Catalyzed by an O,N,N&#8208;Coordinated Nickel Complex</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A synthesis of alkyl aryl ethers was achieved via the cross&#8208;coupling of aryl halides with primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols catalyzed by a bench&#8208;stable nickel complex supported by a monoanionic O,N,N&#8208;tridentate ligand. This nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction proceeds smoothly in the absence of a phosphine ligand, affording alkyl aryl ethers in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Catalytic Approach to Diverse &#945;&#8208;Aminoboronic Acid Derivatives by Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Trifluoroborate&#8208;Iminiums</title>

Abstract
A series of structurally diverse benzyl protected trifluoroborate&#8208;ammoniums were prepared in good to high yields by an efficient hydrogenation of corresponding trifluoroborate&#8208;iminiums using Crabtree's catalyst. Subsequent N&#8208; and B&#8208;deprotections were demonstrated on selected examples to provide several &#945;&#8208;aminoboronic acids. Preliminary experiments on asymmetric version of the reaction indicated a correlation between E/Z&#8208;ratio in the trifluoroborate&#8208;iminium substrate and enantioselectivity. The broad scope, operational simplicity and efficiency of the presented method imply its high potential for a facile access to libraries of &#945;&#8208;aminoboronic acid derivatives that can be used in medicinal chemistry applications and beyond.

         <title>Recent Trends and Prospects in Homogeneous Manganese&#8208;Catalysed Epoxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Epoxidation of alkenes is a significant reaction in organic chemistry due to its opportunities in producing compounds of biochemical interest. Catalytic epoxidation with first&#8208;row transition elements has gained attention in the latest years wherein manganese based catalysts stand superior by satisfying numerous principles of green chemistry. In this review, we have summarized the recent developments in olefin epoxidation using homogeneous manganese catalysts. Manganese complexes with porphyrin, Schiff base, salen, and other non&#8208;heme ligands made efficient catalytic systems during the last five years. Notably, we witnessed greener approaches in recent reports wherein photo&#8208;catalysis is a promising strategy. We anticipate that the review will benefit the researchers to get a better understanding of the reaction and to choose the best catalysts for their reactions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epoxidation of alkenes is a significant reaction in organic chemistry due to its opportunities in producing compounds of biochemical interest. Catalytic epoxidation with first&#8208;row transition elements has gained attention in the latest years wherein manganese based catalysts stand superior by satisfying numerous principles of green chemistry. In this review, we have summarized the recent developments in olefin epoxidation using homogeneous manganese catalysts. Manganese complexes with porphyrin, Schiff base, salen, and other non&#8208;heme ligands made efficient catalytic systems during the last five years. Notably, we witnessed greener approaches in recent reports wherein photo&#8208;catalysis is a promising strategy. We anticipate that the review will benefit the researchers to get a better understanding of the reaction and to choose the best catalysts for their reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted synthesis of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones has been developed using 9&#8208;mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methylacridinium perchlorate as an organo&#8208;photocatalyst. The atmosphere&#8208;controlled method (Ar/air) enabled the selective synthesis of hydroxyl&#8208; and acyl&#8208;containing quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones under mild reaction conditions without the use of any metal catalysts or toxic reagents. A fluorescent labelling experiment showed that hydroxyl&#8208;containing quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones may have utility in various biological applications as potent fluorophores.
