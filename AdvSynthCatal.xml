         <title>Palladium Catalyzed Aminocarbonylation of Benzylic Ammonium Triflates with Nitroarenes: Synthesis of Phenylacetamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium catalyzed reductive aminocarbonylation of benzylic ammonium triflates with nitroarenes for the synthesis of phenylacetamides was developed. Using Pd(acac)2/dppf catalyst system, a range of different substituted phenylacetamides were prepared in moderate to good yields from benzylic ammonium triflates and nitroarenes through Csp3&#8211;N bond cleavage. A variety of alkyl, aryl, and halide substituents on both substrates can be used, and many useful functional groups can be tolerated.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Synthesis of Difluoromethylene Phosphonates for Biological Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
For almost 40&#8197;years, difluoromethylene phosphonates have proven to be versatile molecular tools in biochemical studies owing to their close resemblance to naturally occurring phosphates and phosphonates. As bioisosteric, non&#8208;hydrolyzable analogs of these essential molecules, difluoromethylene phosphonates can target the critical parts of the cellular machinery and therefore exhibit a diverse spectrum of biological activity. In the past ten years, there have appeared many new methods for the synthesis of difluoromethylene phosphonates. Most notably, photoredox catalysis has firmly entered the field, while cross&#8208;coupling and nucleophilic strategies have met considerable elaboration and refinement, entirely in accord with the current trends in synthetic organic chemistry. Herein, we introduce difluoromethylene phosphonates as a distinct, high&#8208;tech subclass of synthetic phosphonates resulting from the research efforts on the cross&#8208;section of organophosphorus, organofluorine, and bioorganic chemistry. We then proceed to the discussion of general methods for the preparation of difluoromethylene phosphonates, comprehensively reviewing reactions developed in the past 15&#8197;years while providing the context of earlier works where appropriate. Finally, we present selected examples of molecules with high biological activity, their biological targets, and the synthetic steps employed for their preparation.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Preparations and Synthetic Applications of Oxaziridines and Diaziridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Oxaziridines and diaziridines have been used as versatile intermediates due to their high ring strain as well as the reactive C&#8722;O/N bond, for the synthesis of diverse range of nitrogen containing compounds. In the past few decades, numerous novel and handy methodologies on the preparations and utilizations of both the oxaziridines and diaziridines have been developed. In spite of few published reviews in the area (almost a decade back), the synthetic communities have made tremendous progress in their preparations and utilizations. This review has demonstrated the comprehensive advancement in the chemistry of oxaziridines and diaziridines for the last few years (almost a decade).

         <title>Cascade Chan&#8208;Lam C&#8722;O Coupling/[3,3]&#8208;Rearrangement of Arylhydroxylamines with Arylboronic Acids Toward NOBIN Analogues</title>

Abstract
Herein, we developed a copper&#8208;mediated Chan&#8208;Lam type O&#8208;arylation of arylhydroxylamines with arylboronic acids to generate transient N,O&#8208;diarylhydroxylamines that could rapidly undergo cascade [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement and rearomatization to afford NOBIN (2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl) analogues under mild conditions. The newly synthesized racemic biaryl products can be further resolved by a chiral DMAP&#8208;catalyzed O&#8208;acylation/kinetic resolution protocol.

Abstract
Herein, we present a strategy for the synthesis of pyrrole alkaloid derivatives through a tandem C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C coupling reaction employing 2&#8208;pyrrole formaldehyde and proline as starting materials. This cyclization protocol is successfully applied to polarity&#8208;controlled site&#8208;selective and stereoselective C(sp3)&#8722;H hydrocarboxylation of proline derivatives, allowing for a remarkably streamlined synthesis of pyrrole alkaloid derivatives which have shown promising biological activities.

         <title>Recent Advances in Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Couplings (CDC) of C&#8722;H Bond in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
To develop highly efficient synthetic reactions is quite important in organic chemistry. Cross dehydrogenative couplings (CDC) utilize C&#8722;H bonds of substrates to construct new C&#8722;X (X=C, S, O, N, P) bonds. For CDC, the pre&#8208;functionalization of reaction substrates can be avoided and the C&#8722;X (X=C, S, O, N, P) bonds can be newly formed by simple and efficient synthesis routes. Meanwhile, water is increasingly used as a substitute for organic solvents in cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling because of its rich content, non&#8208;toxicity, and non&#8208; flammability. In recent years, organic chemists are devoted their efforts to explore the cross dehydrogenative couplings (CDC) in aqueous phase which feature high atom utilization rate and environmental friendliness. Herein, we summarized the recent advances in the construction of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;S, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;P bonds through CDC reactions of C&#8722;H bonds in water.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recalling the serious hazards imposed by the &#8220;ungreen&#8221; techniques used over the years, chemists are now expected to adopt synthetic tactics that strictly adhere to the three E&#8217;s of green chemistry: Environmental, Economical and Energy efficient. Among the various measures undertaken to improve the benignity of a chemical system, top priority has been given for identifying abundant, non&#8208;toxic and non&#8208;flammable greener solvents such as water, replacing detrimental organic solvents. Despite the safer aspects, reactions in aqueous solutions hardly meet the green chemical standards, particularly due to the challenging  product isolation and purification techniques. Sharpless&#8217;s demonstration of, until then almost unknown, &#8220;on water&#8221; effect was a major breakthrough in the realm of sustainable organic chemistry. Needless to say, integration of homo&#8208;/heterogeneous water&#8208;compatible catalysts under &#8220;on water&#8221; conditions without deteriorating its efficiency, has also awakened the industrial prospects of the protocol. Among the various transition metals, copper complexes or salts are considered as first line catalysts due to their irrevocable contributions to the synthetic world. Also, due to the water tuneable nature of these catalysts, many copper&#8208;catalysed organic transformations that once required harsh conditions, could now be obtained using clean and safe protocols.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Alkylselenation of Propiolic Acids with Se Powder and Epoxides</title>

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative alkylselenation of propiolic acids with Se powder and epoxides leading to alkynyl selenides is developed. This protocol not only provides an approach to obtain alkynyl selenides with the formation of double C&#8722;Se bonds, but also expands the applicability of alkynyl carboxylic acid.

         <title>Practical Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylated Pyridines Based on Regioselective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition using Trifluoromethylated Diynes with Nitriles</title>

Abstract
Regioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition using fluorine&#8208;containing diynes with nitriles was described. Cycloaddition of fluorinated diynes with nitriles under the influence of CoCl2(phen), zinc bromide, and zinc dust in dichloroethane at 80&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8197;h took place smoothly, exclusively affording the corresponding &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkylated pyridines in excellent yields. In addition, dinitriles as substrate were also found to be suitable for this reaction, giving the corresponding fluoroalkylated bipyridine derivatives in excellent yields.

         <title>Advances in Transition&#8208;Metal Catalyzed Carbonylative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling Reaction: An Update</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Transition metals have been an indispensable component of modern catalysis and among these palladium is the top&#8208;ranked choice of chemists as a catalyst. After the several important developments of palladium catalysed C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions, carbonylative transformations have been realised as an attractive post modification of these reactions. Carbonylative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reaction is among such transformations for direct incorporation of CO fragment for the preparation of biaryl or aryl/alkyl ketones via transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Ketone functionality is basically a valuable building block having huge pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications. Moreover, carbonylative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling is also used in the synthesis of various natural bioactive molecules through the direct joining of molecular fragments via CO bridge. In this review, the past decade developments in the carbonylative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions are documented in detail with modern approaches in transition&#8208;metal catalysis.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Cycloisomerization of 1,3&#8208;Diketones with Keto&#8208;Vinylidenecyclopropanes: Synthesis of Enantiomerically Enriched Cyclic &#946;&#8208;Amino Alcohols</title>

Abstract
We report here an effective and atom&#8208;economical method to synthesize enantiomerically enriched cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols via a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloisomerization of 1,3&#8208;diketones with keto&#8208;vinylidenecyclopropanes. The reactions proceed through a Rh&#8208;catalyzed transformation of keto&#8208;vinylidenecyclopropanes via cleavage of the distal C&#8722;C bond of the three&#8208;membered ring as a three&#8208;carbon synthon, allowing the generation of a range of enantiomerically enriched cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols tethered to an alkene and an 1,3&#8208;dione moiety in good yields with high ee values under mild conditions. Derivatizations including allylation of the functionalized &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols and subsequent RCM reaction as well as the preparation of a pyrazole derivative were carried out as well.

         <title>De Novo Construction of Substituted Terephthalates via Phosphine Catalyzed Domino Benzannulation Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The robustness of phosphine catalysis enabling the domino benzannulation reactions of allenoates with enamines is described. A broad array of substituted terephthalates were delivered under simple and practical reaction conditions. Furthermore, the reaction could be carried out on a gram scale with higher yield, and various conversions of the terephthalate products demonstrate the versatility of this transformation.

         <title>PPTS&#8208;Catalyzed Bicyclization Reaction of 2&#8208;Isocyanobenzaldehydes with Various Amines: Synthesis of Diverse Fused Quinazolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A PPTS (pyridinium p&#8208;toluenesulfonate)&#8208;catalyzed bicyclization reaction of 2&#8208;isocyanobenzaldehydes as 1,5&#8208;dielectrophiles with various amines has been developed. The reaction not only provides a simple and efficient strategy for the assembly of structurally diverse fused quinazoline derivatives from readily available substrates under metal&#8208;free and mild conditions in a single step with only water and hydrogen as the by&#8208;products, but also opens the way to the application of o&#8208;formyl arylisocyanides in the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles.

         <title>Engineering an Alcohol Dehydrogenase from Kluyveromyces polyspora for Efficient Synthesis of Ibrutinib Intermediate</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
(S)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypiperidine [(S)&#8208;NBHP] is a key intermediate for the synthesis of mantle cell lymphoma drug, ibrutinib. Here, KpADH, an alcohol dehydrogenase from Kluyveromyces polyspora, exhibits evolutionary potential in the asymmetric reduction of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;3&#8208;piperidone (NBPO) to (S)&#8208;NBHP. By screening key residues in substrate binding pocket of KpADH, an excellent variant Y127W was obtained with 6&#8208;fold improved activity of 119.3&#8197;U&#8201;mg&#8722;1, 1.8&#8208;fold enhanced half&#8208;life of 147&#8197;h and strict S&#8208;stereoselectivity (&gt;99% ee). When catalyzed by Y127W, a complete conversion of 600&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 NBPO was achieved at a substrate to catalyst ratio (S/C) of 30 in 10&#8197;h. Based on crystal&#8208;structure of Y127W, molecular docking and dynamic simulations reveal hydrogen bonds formed between W127 and Boc group of NBPO, as well as improved structural stability mainly contribute to the increased catalytic activity and stereoselectivity of Y127W. This study offers guidance for engineering ADHs for biosynthesis of chiral heterocyclic alcohols, and provides insights into mechanisms in catalytic activity and stereoselectivity toward carbonyl&#8208;containing heterocyclic substrates.

         <title>Efficient and Clean Nickel Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;Allylation Reaction of Nitriles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A clean method has been developed for the &#945;&#8208;allylation of phenyl and alpha alkyl phenyl acetonitrile with allylic alcohols. The reaction is catalyzed by nickel complexes in&#8197;situ generated from a combination of Ni(cod)2 and the dppf ligand and performed at 80&#8201;&#176;C in methanol as reaction solvent.	Accordingly to this simple and base&#8208;free protocol that only yields water as a side&#8208;product, many allylic nitriles were synthetized with good yields.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A tunable electrosynthesis of sulfone&#8208; and bromo&#8208;substituted indolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives has been disclosed. In this reaction, a variety of easily available 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl indoles can readily react with sulfonyl and/or bromine radicals, which are generated from arylsulfonyl hydrazides and potassium bromide respectively, to furnish the valuable sulfone&#8208; and bromo&#8208;substituted benzindolo&#8208;fused polycyclic compounds in moderate to good yields. 
Control experiment indicated that the reaction proceeds via a radical cascade cyclization pathway, and this protocol features broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance under metal&#8208;free and oxidant&#8208;free conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Salicylic Acid&#8208;Promoted Three&#8208;Component Annulation of Benzimidazoles, Aryl Nitroalkenes and Elemental Sulfur</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, a three&#8208;component cyclization reaction of benzimidazoles, aryl nitroalkenes and elemental sulfur has been developed. Cheap and easily available salicylic acid found to be an efficient mediator for the present transformation. This protocol provides a facile access to structurally significant imidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazole skeleton from simple raw materials with a range of compatible synthetically useful functionalities. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale preparation of this method is effective, which enables potential applications of it in broader fields of molecule synthesis. Mechanistically, a reaction cascade involving sequential aza&#8208;Michael addition, nucleophilic sulfuration, and deaminative aromatization was proposed.

         <title>High&#8208;Level Production of Phenylacetaldehyde using Fusion&#8208;Tagged Styrene Oxide Isomerase</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude improvement in the production of phenylacetaldehyde to 3.37&#8197;M (405&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1) from the enzymatic isomerisation of styrene oxide was achieved. A small ubiquitin&#8208;related modifier (SUMO) tag increases the productivity of the whole&#8208;cell biocatalytic system by enhancing the expression of active membrane&#8208;bound styrene oxide isomerase (SOI) while retaining enzyme catalytic efficiency and broad natural substrate scope. The isomerisation was performed by using Escherichia coli expressing SUMO&#8208;tagged SOI in an organic&#8208;aqueous biphasic system to yield 96% of phenylacetaldehyde.

Abstract
[2.2]Paracyclophane (PCP) derivatives have been promising platforms to study the element of planar chirality and through&#8208;space electronic communications in &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular systems. To access enantiomerically pure derivatives thereof, a kinetic resolution of 4&#8208;acetyl[2.2]&#8208;PCP employing a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrogenation process was developed. This method can be performed on a multigram&#8208;scale and gives access to enantiomerically pure derivatives with planar and central chirality of (Rp)&#8208;4&#8208;acetyl&#8208;PCP (&#8805;97% ee, 43%) and (Sp,S)&#8208;PCP derivatives (&#8805;97% ee, 46%), which are useful intermediates for the synthesis of sterically demanding PCP&#8208;based ligand/catalyst systems and chiral synthons for engineering cyclophane&#8208;based chiroptical materials.

         <title>Electronic Effect&#8208;Guided Rational Design of Candida antarctica Lipase B for Kinetic Resolution Towards Diarylmethanols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Herein, we developed an electronic effect&#8208;guided rational design strategy to enhance the enantioselectivity of Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) mutants towards bulky pyridyl(phenyl)methanols. Compared to W104A mutant previously reported with reversed S&#8208;stereoselectivity toward sec&#8208;alcohols, three mutants (W104C, W104S and W104T) displayed significant improvement of S&#8208;enantioselectivity in the kinetic resolution (KR) of various phenyl pyridyl methyl acetates due to the increased electronic effects between pyridyl and polar residues. The electronic effects were also observed when mutating other residues surrounding the stereospecificity pocket of CALB, such as T42A, S47A, A281S or A281C, and can be used to manipulate the stereoselectivity. A series of bulky pyridyl(phenyl) methanols, including S&#8208;(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl) methanol (S&#8208;CPMA), the intermediate of bepotastine, were obtained in good yields and ee values.

         <title>Electrochemical Thiolation and Borylation of Arylazo Sulfones with Thiols and B2pin2</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An efficient electrochemical synthesis approach of various unsymmetrical thioethers and arylboronates has been developed. Bench stable arylazo sulfones were used as radical precursors for carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond formation under electrochemical conditions. Moreover, the scalability of this approach was evaluated by performing the electrochemical thiolation and borylation of arylazo sulfones with thiols and B2pin2 on a gram scale. This protocol not only avoided the use of stoichiometric oxidants, metal catalysts, activating agents and even added bases, but also exhibited favorable functional group tolerance.

Moreover, the scalability of this approach was evaluated by performing the electrochemical thiolation and borylation of arylazo sulfones with thiols and B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pin&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on a gram scale. This protocol not only avoided the use of stoichiometric oxidants, metal catalysts, activating agents and even added bases, but also exhibited favorable functional group tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
An asymmetric (4+1) annulation of 3&#8208;diazooxindoles/4&#8208;diazooxisoquinolines with para&#8208;quinone methides, catalyzed by a chiral phosphoric acid, has been described. A wide range of spiro[dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;oxindoles/2,4&#8242;&#8208;oxisoquinoline] derivatives were afforded with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. In this study, the possible reaction pathway was proposed and the synthetic applications were shown by a tenfold scale&#8208;up conversion as well as the further transformations into other structurally more complex spirocyclic compounds. The significance of this protocol is highlighted by its metal&#8208;free participation with heterocyclic diazo compounds as the direct nucleophile and extremely high efficiency in a straightforward and mild reaction process to access the structurally&#8208;diverse spiro&#8208;heterocyclic 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran derivatives with good to excellent stereocontrol.

Abstract
The rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H/diazo coupling and tandem annulation of 3&#8208;oxopent&#8208;4&#8208;enenitriles have been proposed for the synthesis of polysubstituted phenols. Most products of phenols are obtained in good yields. Several preliminary mechanistic studies and derivatization reactions of phenol products were also performed. This method offers an alternative approach for the synthesis of useful diverse phenols.

Abstract
A Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed Csp2&#8722;Csp3 bond cleavage/carbonylethylation of &#945;&#8208;indolyl alcohols with allylic alcohols has been reported. This transformation involved a cascade C&#8722;C bond cleavage/C&#8722;C bond formation, and provides a novel approach to assemble 2&#8208;carbonylethylindole skeletons.

Abstract
A simple and efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted selenylation/cyclization of enaminones have been realized for the practical synthesis of 3&#8208;selanyl&#8208;4H&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;ones. This reaction is performed in the mild conditions, no transition metal catalyst or photocatalysts and no additional oxidants are required. In addition, the 3&#8208;selanyl&#8208;4H&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;ones could be easily converted to selanyl&#8208;functionalized pyrimidines by reacting with benzamidine substrates.

         <title>Synthesis of Oxazolidinones by a Hypervalent Iodine Mediated Cyclization of N&#8208;Allylcarbamates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The preparation of oxazolidinones by the hypervalent iodine mediated cyclization of allylcarbamates is described. A versatile range of substrates can be converted into substituted oxazolidinones primed for further transformations. Derivatization of the products at both ends is demonstrated. A preliminary attempt at the enantioselective formation of an oxazolidinone using a chiral iodane is also presented.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Three&#8208;Component Intermolecular Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Alkenylation Reactions of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we describe a practical protocol for efficient, mild, visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component intermolecular trifluoromethyl&#8208;alkenylation reactions of unactivated alkenes. The protocol has good functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope. Using this protocol, we not only introduced a trifluoromethyl group into alkenes but also converted unactivated alkenes to styrene&#8208;based activated alkenes, in addition to accomplishing late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical intermediates.

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we describe a practical protocol for efficient, mild, visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component intermolecular trifluoromethyl&#8208;alkenylation reactions of unactivated alkenes. The protocol has good functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope. Using this protocol, we not only introduced a trifluoromethyl group into alkenes but also converted unactivated alkenes to styrene&#8208;based activated alkenes, in addition to accomplishing late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis of Fluorescent 4&#8208;Azapyrenes by Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Dual C&#8722;H Bond Activation and Annulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Unique dual&#8208;emissive and deep&#8208;blue/green fluorescent multi&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;azapyrenes with bathochromic shift emission, quantum yields up to 0.60 and long excited&#8208;state lifetime were synthesized successfully by annulative &#960;&#8208;extension reactions. This synthesis constitutes a palladium&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative annulation of N&#8208;acyl&#8208;2&#8208;aminobiaryls with in&#8197;situ 1,3&#8208;diynes as a key step, giving substituted phenanthrenes via a rollover C&#8722;H bond activation, followed by Bischler&#8208;Napieralski cyclization. Further &#960;&#8208;extension by superacid&#8208;mediated cyclization produced a blue fluorescent naphtho 4&#8208;azapyrene.

         <title>Recent Progress in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
In recent years, great improvements have been made on palladium&#8208;catalyzed radical reactions. Emerging elegant methodologies of radical involved palladium&#8208;catalyzed transformations provide more and more effective strategies for the construction of complex heterocyclic compounds and applications in drug discovery. It is universally known that Pd(0)/(II)/(IV)&#8208;mediated reactions usually undergo two&#8208;electron transfer processes, while the Pd(I) and Pd(III) involved reactions usually occur via single electron transfer processes. Since our review on palladium radical was published, numurous methodolgies involving palladium radical have sprung up in the past five years. This review further summarized the up&#8208;to&#8208;date transformations toward palladium radical from 2015. For most of these catalytic cycles strategies, plausible mechanisms are demonstrated in detail to give better insight for chemists in need.

Abstract
Chiral 2&#8208;alkylquinazolinones are key synthetic intermediates, but their preparation in high optical purity is challenging. Thus, a multicomponent procedure integrating anthranilic acids, N&#8208;Boc&#8208;amino acids, and amines in the presence of methanesulfonyl chloride, N&#8208;methylimidazole, and copper(II) chloride was developed to mildly afford N&#8208;Boc&#8208;2&#8208;alkylaminoquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones with excellent preservation of enantiomeric purity (&gt;99% ee). Copper(II) chloride was essential to retaining enantiopurity, and reaction component structural changes were well tolerated, resulting in an efficient, all&#8208;in&#8208;one procedure that promotes sequential coupling, lactonization, aminolysis, and cyclization in good yields. The method was applied to the rapid assembly of four key intermediates used in the synthesis of high profile quinazolinones, including several PI3K inhibitor drugs.

         <title>Recent Developments in Remote Meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Bond Functionalizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
In the past decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the developments of novel methods for the activation/functionalization of inert C&#8722;H bonds as these protocols are not only competent, reduce the waste materials in addition to the reaction time and multiple steps but also allows the reaction to be carried out in a highly regio&#8208;specific manner under operationally simple yet effective reaction conditions. Although, in recent years, a remarkable progress has been made in the field of ortho&#8208;and para&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds functionalization but to our best knowledge, the distal meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation/functionalization is still infancy and is yet to be explore to the advanced level. Hence, we feel that there is an urgent need to aware the research community about where the field of meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization stand at present and where it might be going in near future. To this context, we strive to compile the significant achievements made in the selective meta&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds functionalization since 2018 to till date. More interestingly, we have also displayed an overview of the earlier reports related to the meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation/functionalization at the beginning of this particular manuscript, and hopefully the present review article will open diverse opportunities for the advancement of both academia as well as industry.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction: Pivotal Milestones and Recent Applications to Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
In this review, the pivotal achievements and recent advances in catalytic asymmetric aza&#8208;DAR reported up to 2020 are retrospectively considered and their potency for enantioselective synthesis of useful chiral piperidine, quinoline, pyridazine, oxazine and oxadiazine derivatives and fused compounds of higher molecular complexity bearing these pharmacology&#8208;relevant heterocyclic scaffolds is demonstrated. The reported data are systematized according both to key electron transfer modes (normal or invers electron demand reactions) and to main types of attainable heterocyclic products. Of significant attention are an analysis of activation strategies (complexation, enamine or enolate formation, H&#8208;bonding, etc.) applicable to reactions with particular types of dienes and dienophiles and identification of plausible reaction pathways (either concerted or stepwise) over stereoselective cyclization processes. The review contains 310 references and 122 synthetic schemes.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Abstract. The use of graphenic materials as support for transition metal&#8208;based catalysts in reactions involving the functionalization of carbon&#8208;hydrogen bonds is reviewed. In many cases, the catalytic activities reported are comparable or better than the homogeneous counterparts, a feature which adds to a substantial degree of recyclability of the materials.

Abstract
An efficient approach to regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of (Z)&#8208;vinylsulfonylated quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;ones has been developed. This oxidative reaction involves copper&#8208;catalyzed vinylsulfonylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with alkynes and sulfonyl hydrazides. Various functionalized vinylsulfonylated quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives have been synthesized in excellent yields. The reaction proceeds via sulfonyl radicals generated from sulfonyl hydrazides.

Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;glycosylation reaction was developed by allyl&#8208;allyl coupling process using Achmatowicz rearrangement products as donors and methylcoumarins as acceptors under mild conditions. This method featured regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities, stereodivergent synthesis of C&#8208;glycosides. The glycosyl donors with controlled stereodiversity and glycosyl acceptors with fluorescent performace further highlighted this methodology.

Abstract
An enantioselective total synthesis of pentacyclic proaporphine alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;misramine has been achieved. The synthetic route features a Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization to construct the fused B and C rings and a sequence of Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation, Pinnick oxidation, and pinacol&#8208;type cyclization to install the &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketal moiety. The absolute configuration of the pentacyclic framework was elucidated by X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal analyses of (&#8722;)&#8208;11&#8208;demethoxymisramine.

Abstract
A direct synthesis of spiro[5.5]and [5.4]&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines has been developed through C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization triggered by sequential [1,5]&#8208; hydride shift /cyclization sequence using ortho amino benzaldehydes and active methylene compounds such as 2&#8208;coumaranone, 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin, 3&#8208;coumaranone, and 3&#8208;isochromanone. This protocol provides a Lewis acid catalyst&#8208;free straight forward one&#8208;pot reaction in cases of 2&#8208;coumaranone and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin, Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed stepwise reaction for 3&#8208;coumaranone and 3&#8208;isochromanone to access a wide range of spiro&#8208;heterocycles in excellent to good yields and diastereoselectivity.

Abstract
A palladium catalyzed ring expansion reaction of isoxazolones with isocyanides was disclosed. In the reaction, a cascade process involving ring&#8208;opening/cyclization was suggested. The reaction features high atomic economy due to no elimination of CO2 occurred. Moreover, products obtained demonstrate aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties with relatively high solid&#8208;state emission efficiencies.

         <title>NaHSO3&#8208;Mediated Direct Synthesis of Sulfinic Esters from Sulfonyl Hydrazides under Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>

Abstract
We have developed a protocol for the NaHSO3&#8208;promoted esterification of sulfonyl hydrazides with alcohols for the synthesis of sulfinic esters. Various sulfonyl hydrazides could be converted to the corresponding sulfinic esters in good to high yields. The merits of this protocol include mild transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free reaction conditions, an inexpensive and available reagent, and operational simplicity. Controlled experiments reveal that this transformation probably undergoes via a radical pathway.

Abstract
A general and efficient photocatalytic annulation&#8208;carbohalogenation of 1,7&#8208;enynes with a wide variety of alkyl halides was reported, which led to the atom&#8208;economic synthesis of functionalized 3,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalen&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones with good yields and high stereoselectivity under the mild and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. The reaction demonstrated remarkable compatibility regarding alkyl halides as bifunctional reagents, such as ethyl 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoroacetate, ethyl 2,2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;iodoacetate, perfluorobutyl iodide, bromotrichloromethane, and diethyl 2&#8208;bromomalonate, and enabled wide substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and 100% atom utilization.

Abstract
A simple and efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;initiated cascade reaction of 2&#8208;isothiocyanatonaphthalenes and amines with ambient dioxygen as the sole oxidant under additive&#8208;, external photocatalyst&#8208;free and ambient conditions was developed. 38 Examples of N&#8208;substituted naphtho[2,1&#8208;d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines were regioselectively constructed in good to excellent yields.

Abstract
A direct carbocyclization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophthalazine&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones is achieved using isocyanates as carbonyl source via Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed sequential ortho&#8208;amidation followed by intramolecular nucleophilic substitution, delivering substituted indazolo[1,2&#8208;b]phthalazine&#8208;triones in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. For ortho&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophthalazine&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones, the corresponding amidated products were also isolated in excellent yields by modifying the reaction parameters. Application of isocyanates as carbonyl source, high functional group tolerance on the two coupling partners and diverse chemical transformation of the synthesized fused and functionalized phthalazinones are the key highlights of the work.

         <title>Synthesis of Metallocene Analogues of the Phenethylamine and Tetrahydroisoquinoline Scaffolds via Regioselective Ring Opening of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;N&#8208;sulfonyl Aziridines</title>

Abstract
The Lewis (or Br&#248;nsted) acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridines with ferrocene and ruthenocene provided new amino&#8208;functionalized metallocene derivatives arising from a regioselective ring opening of the aziridine. The functionalized metallocene derivatives available by this methodology are suitable precursors for the stereoselective synthesis of metallocene analogues of the relevant tetrahydroisoquinoline motif by a Pictet&#8208;Spengler type reaction. These isoquinoline analogues are also accessible by a TfOH&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridines, ferrocene (or ruthenocene) and formaldehyde.

Abstract
Described herein is a continuous&#8208;flow strategy for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8722;H arylation of indole&#8208;3&#8208;acetic acid derivatives with arenediazonium salts. A fully autonomous self&#8208;optimizing flow platform was used to efficiently optimize the coupling reaction in a three&#8208;dimensional space. The flow methodology developed is experimentally simple, mild, broad in scope, and safer than traditional batch approaches. Our continuous&#8208;flow approach is particularly convenient to prepare precursors of pharmaceutically relevant compounds.

A fully autonomous self&#8208;optimizing flow platform was used to efficiently optimize the coupling reaction in a three&#8208;dimensional space. The flow methodology developed is experimentally simple, mild, broad in scope, and safer than traditional batch approaches. Our continuous&#8208;flow approach is particularly convenient to prepare precursors of pharmaceutically relevant compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Bulky 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Bipyridine and (S)&#8208;Pyridine&#8208;Oxazoline Ligands</title>

Abstract
Bulky N,N&#8217;&#8208;bidentate ligands can furnish catalysts with enhanced catalytic activity compared to commercially available ligands. Straightforward methods to effectively synthesize a broad range of these ligands, however, are uncommon. In this work, a simple and efficient method is developed for the synthesis of bulky N,N&#8217;&#8208;bidentate ligands, including 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridines and enantioenriched pyridine&#8208;oxazolines. The Pd/NIXANTPHOS catalyst system enabled synthesis of a series of bulky 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;based ligands and (S)&#8208;pyridine oxazoline&#8208;based enantioenriched ligands with good to excellent yields. The ligands have been benchmarked in the aminofluorination of styrene.

The front cover picture illustrates recent advances on selective dearomatization and functionalization of aromatic rings via &#951;3&#8208;benzyl palladium intermediates. The importance of this topic relies on providing efficient strategy for dearomatization and functionalization of arenes and heteroarenes in mild conditions. A series of C&#8722;C or C&#8208;heteroatom bond formation reactions is summarized. Theoretical calculations are also introduced in details, accounting for the reactions occurring regioselectively in the benzene ring, rather than benzylic position. Details can be found in the review by Ming Bao and co&#8208;workers (S. Zhang, Y. Yamamoto, M. Bao, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2021, 363, 587&#8211;601; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202000838).

Abstract
The asymmetric Mannich reaction is one of the most straightforward methodologies for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral amines. In general, asymmetric Mannich reactions involve the use of imines as electrophiles. However, in recent years, several asymmetric oxidative Mannich reactions have been reported using amines as electrophiles. This review provides an overview of these recent publications, including the different oxidants used and the scope and limitations of the different catalytic systems.

Abstract
Aromatic functionalizations are of current interest and importance in organic chemistry, recent transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reactions can transform inert C&#8722;H bond into C&#8722;X (X=C, O, N, etc.) bonds, greatly enriching aromatic chemistry and related fields. Some well&#8208;known palladium&#8208;containing intermediates such as palladacycles and allylpalladium intermediates play an important role in organic conversions. Similar with allyl group, benzyl group also possesses the capability of stabilizing palladium through &#951;3&#8208;binding. In the process of the formation of benzyl palladium intermediate, there is a transition state of dearomatization. Therefore, it is a challenging and meaningful research topic to seize these aromatic destruction intermediates, realize selective functionalization reaction on aromatic ring via them, and inhibit the formation of traditional benzylated products. Herein, we summarized the recent efforts on expanding the synthetic utility, as well as exploring the mechanism in aromatic functionalization via reactive benzyl palladium intermediates. We envision that the transformation via benzyl palladium intermediates will help promote the development in the field of palladium&#8211;catalyzed aromatic regioselective functionalization.

Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions in aqueous media are experiencing a constant increase in interest. In homogenous catalysis the use of water as a solvent offers advantages in cost, safety, the possibility of two&#8208;phase catalysis and simplified separation strategies. In the life sciences, transition metal catalysis in aqueous systems enables the ligation or modification of biopolymers in buffer systems or even in their cellular environment. In biocatalysis, aqueous systems allow the simultaneous use of enzymes and transition metal catalysts in cascade reactions. The use of water&#8208;soluble phosphine ligands still represents the most reliable and popular strategy for transferring metal catalysts into the aqueous phase. This review summarizes the recent advancements in this field since 2009 and describes current synthetic strategies for the preparation of hydrophilic phosphines and phosphites.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions in aqueous media are experiencing a constant increase in interest. In homogenous catalysis the use of water as a solvent offers advantages in cost, safety, the possibility of two&#8208;phase catalysis and simplified separation strategies. In the life sciences, transition metal catalysis in aqueous systems enables the ligation or modification of biopolymers in buffer systems or even in their cellular environment. In biocatalysis, aqueous systems allow the simultaneous use of enzymes and transition metal catalysts in cascade reactions. The use of water&#8208;soluble phosphine ligands still represents the most reliable and popular strategy for transferring metal catalysts into the aqueous phase. This review summarizes the recent advancements in this field since 2009 and describes current synthetic strategies for the preparation of hydrophilic phosphines and phosphites. In addition, recent applications of transition metal catalysis in aqueous solvents using these hydrophilic ligands are presented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Abstract
Chiral amino acids featuring a phosphonate pendant arm are an important type of biologically active scaffold. Here in this review, we comprehensively summarize the modern synthetic methods towards asymmetric construction of chiral amino carboxylic&#8208;phosphonic acid derivatives. The main streams of such interesting compounds include phosphono&#8208;containing &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;amino acid derivatives, amino acid fluorophosphonate derivatives, amino acid cyclopropanylphosphonate derivatives, and bisphosphono&#8208;amino acid derivatives. Chiral resolution protocols, chiral auxiliary&#8208;directed syntheses, and valorization of the pool of abundant chiral amino acid resources remain contemporary concerns, and meanwhile catalytic enantioselective synthesis has also emerged as a potent strategy as demonstrated by the latest advances.

         <title>Recent Development of Recoverable MacMillan Catalyst in Asymmetric Organic Transformations</title>

Abstract
Chiral imidazolidinone as an organocatalyst was developed by MacMillan and co&#8208;workers in 2000 and they evaluated this organocatalyst originally in the enantioselective Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. Later, this catalyst was used in a number of other asymmetric organic transformations. Chiral organocatalysts are expensive, therefore their recoverability and reusability are highly desirable to make the organic transformation economically viable for industrial application. Hence, the chiral imidazolidinone was modified and attached to different supports for its recoverability and reusability. A number of recoverable imidazolidinones have been reported in asymmetric Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. In this review, we have summarized the reports on reusable and recoverable imidazolidinones (MacMillan catalysts) as organocatalysts in asymmetric organic transformations.

Abstract
Aryl phosphorus compounds have found versatile applications in materials, medicinal and synthetic chemistry. As a powerful tool, aryne chemistry has been widely utilized in constructing aryl C&#8722;P bonds under mild conditions; this has enabled facile access to a variety of structurally diverse aryl&#8211;phosphorus compounds with good efficiency. The present review aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the chemistry between arynes and organophosphorus compounds, with emphasis placed on reactivity modes and mechanistic aspects. According to the valency of phosphorus atoms, this paper is divided into two main sections, reactions of arynes with organophosphorus(III) compounds and those with organophosphorus(V) compounds.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed tandem trifluoromethylation/cyclization/remote oxidation of 1,6&#8208;dienes has been achieved. A broad range of trifluoromethyl group&#8208;containing tetrahydrofurans or tetrahydropyrroles could be generated in good yields and with excellent diastereoselectivity by using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the oxidant. The mild and facile protocol affords direct access to trifluoromethyl group&#8208;bearing tetrahydrofurans and tetrahydropyrroles via difunctionalization of olefins.

Abstract
We disclose a unprecedented riboflavin promoted Nef reaction of primary nitroalkanes coupled with a nitroaldol reaction. This tandem process allows the synthesis of functionalized nitro alcohols under mild reaction conditions. Secondary nitroalkanes fail to give the expected nitroaldol products although they are consumed under the reaction conditions.

Abstract
Sulfoximines with nitrogen&#8208;bound &#945;&#8208;ketoester units are efficiently prepared by an operationally simple one&#8208;pot reaction sequence in air starting from methoxy(mesyloxy)iodobenzene, NH&#8208;sulfoximines, and cyanoacetates. Key of the process is the in&#8208;situ formation of hypervalent iodine reagents, which serve as electrophilic sulfoximidoyl sources.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Calothrixin B via an Intramolecular Baylis&#8208;Hillman Cyclization/6&#960; Electrocyclization/Dehydro&#8208;aromatization Sequence and a Specific Oxidative Quinone Formation</title>

Abstract
A short total synthesis of bioactive alkaloid calothrixin B have been accomplished with atom and step economy from commercially available starting materials. The key cyclization involved a Baylis&#8722;Hillman/6&#960; electrocyclization/dehydroaromatiz&#8208;ation sequence to construct the pentacyclic skeleton. Reduction of the resulting lactam followed by oxidation led to the characteristic quino[4,3&#8208;b]carbazole framework. This intermediate underwent a direct oxidation with high regioselectivity to yield the final product.

Abstract
Herein, a hydroxyl assisted, photoredox/cobalt co&#8208;catalyzed semi&#8208;hydrogenation and tandem cyclization of o&#8208;alkynylphenols is developed towards direct assembly of 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans. Moderate to good yields were obtained for a range of sterically and electronically diverse 2&#8208;propynolphenols under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies demonstrated the inevitable role of the alcoholic hydroxyl group with (Z)&#8208;alkene as the real intermediate. Finally, a key low&#8208;valent cobalt catalyzed intramolecular hydroetherification of alkene is proposed.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Assisted Grinding Mechanochemistry in the Synthesis of Pharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Mechanochemical reactions by milling, grinding or other types of mechanical action have emerged as a salient green approach because of its wide applications towards academic and industrial chemical communities in sustainable solvent&#8208;free/solvent&#8208;less processes. Liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG) as an extension of traditional solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical techniques by which a small amount of liquid is used as an additive to enhance and/or control reactivity, has been fruitfully applied in the screening of inclusion compounds, cocrystals, salts, solvates, and polymorphs. However, utilization of this important technique in the synthesis of pharmaceutically and biologically relevant targets was not adequately investigated. This review article summarizes an overview of the latest development of LAG mechanochemical approaches in the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and drug&#8208;like fragments, highlights its superiority versus conventional syntheses.

         <title>Unraveling the C&#8722;H Arylation of Benzo&#8208;Fused Cycloalkanones: Combined Experimental and Computational Evidence</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The C&#8722;H functionalization of benzo&#8208;fused cycloalkanones represents a synthetic challenge, since such scaffolds display different activation sites, at sp2 and sp3 carbons, a bicyclic structure, and various sizes of the cycloalkanone ring. Anticipating the outcome of C&#8722;H functionalization and the impact of the presence and size of the cycloalkanone ring would help to foresee synthetic routes to more complex molecular architectures. The mechanism of C&#8722;H arylation was studied using DFT calculations for tetralone, benzosuberone, and indanone and compared to acetophenone. Comparison of energetic profiles allowed identifying key steps of the process. Analysis of the topology of key intermediates allowed correlating the deformation of palladacycles to the potential reactivity of the benzo&#8208;fused cycloalkanone family members. The experimental results were in full agreement with the trend provided by the theoretical study. A wide panel of diversely substituted benzo&#8208;fused cycloalkanones has been successfully obtained using optimized conditions. Moreover, an approach towards polycyclic molecules has been illustrated featuring a C&#8722;H arylation and a second step taking advantage of the remaining ketone fragment and its ability to undergo diverse transformations leading to alternative pathways to more complex molecular architectures

Abstract
Silver complexes with 5&#8208;(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene ligands were synthesized as metal&#8208;imidazole acid&#8208;base cooperative catalysts. Single crystal XRD analysis revealed that the silver atom was located in the vicinity of the imidazole ring and that cationic silver complexes formed dimers through coordination between the silver metal and the imidazole pendant. These cationic silver complexes served as catalysts for cyclization of alkyne&#8208;tethered carboxylic acids. NMR experiments indicated that the dimeric cationic silver complex dissociated to a monomer upon protonation of the imidazole moiety, resulting in coordination of an acetonitrile to the silver atom. DFT calculations supported the acid&#8208;base cooperative action of the silver&#8208;imidazole for the efficient alkyne&#8208;carboxylic acid cyclization.

Abstract
Herein we describe a gold&#8208;catalyzed bidirectional synthesis of N&#8208;heteropolycyclic compounds bearing carbazole moieties &#8211; namely &#960;&#8208;extended benzodicarbazoles and &#960;&#8208;extended indolocarbazoles. Overall, four previously unknown core structures were synthesized. This approach is convergent, modular and the gold&#8208;catalyzed key step comprises of a cascade reaction starting from stable di&#8208;azido compounds. The obtained molecules were fully characterized and their optical and electronic properties as well as their performance in organic thin&#8208;film transistors generated by vacuum deposition were studied. Charge&#8208;carrier mobilities of up to 0.3&#8197;cm2/Vs were measured.

         <title>Highly Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Organocatalytic &#947;&#8208;Allylic Alkylation of Quinolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We report the first synthesis of 2&#8208;alkenylquinolines from 2&#8208;allylquinolines and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The reaction proceeds in a highly regioselective and enantioselective way and shows a broad tolerance of functionalities both in the aromatic ring of the enal and on the quinoline.

         <title>Catalyst and Additive&#8208;Free Selective Ring&#8208;Opening Selenocyanation of Heterocycles with Elemental Selenium and TMSCN</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A catalyst and additive&#8208;free strategy for selective ring&#8208;opening selenocyanation of saturated heterocycles with elemental selenium and TMSCN is developed, affording a series of aliphatic selenocyanates and selenaheterocycles. In the case of unprotected unstrained N&#8208;heterocycles, the reactions offer ammonium selenonitriles that prove to be an efficient selenonitrile reagent.

         <title>Boron Reagents and Catalysts for the Functionalization of Strained Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The particular nature of boron compounds allows an ample modularity of their properties ranging from Lewis acids, C&#8208;nucleophiles, B&#8208;nucleophiles, or even conjunctive reagents for new synthetic manipulations. Moreover, the increasing demand for functionalized boron derivatives for pharmaceutical or material science applications requires the development of new synthetic methods for boron introduction in organic compounds. This review summarizes the possible combinations of boron derivatives with a variety of strained heterocycles reported in the most recent literature.

         <title>Synthesis of Difluorinated Dihydrobenzo[de]chromenes via Rh(III)&#8208;Catalysed C&#8208;H Couplings of 1&#8208;Naphthols with Gem&#8208;Difluoromethylene Alkynes</title>

Abstract
The Rh(III)&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H couplings of 1&#8208;naphthols with gem&#8208;difluoromethylene alkynes have been realized for the direct construction of difluorinated dihydrobenzo[de]chromenes with broad substrate/functional group compatibility and good regio&#8208;/chemoselectivity and in an atom&#8208;economic manner. The unique fluorine effects account for the unconventional reaction path involving intramolecular 1,3&#8208;hydrogen migration process to afford the exo&#8208;methylene fragment.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroarylation of Homopropargyl Iodoindoles with Concurrent Alkyl and Iodonium Migrations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp) arylation/carbocyclization/iodonium migration reaction sequence has been accomplished. Novel 2&#8208;iodo&#8208;1&#8208;aryl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazoles are now easily available. As this result is contrary to the selectivity observed using gold catalysis, the formation of 2&#8208;iodocarbazoles is noticeable, suggesting a metal&#8208;controlled cyclization through chemo&#8208; and regioselective 1,2&#8208;alkyl migration and 1,4&#8208;iodonium migration.

         <title>Fluorinated Aryl Boronates as Building Blocks in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Organoboron compounds are well known building blocks for many organic reactions. However, under basic conditions, polyfluorinated aryl boronic acid derivatives suffer from instability issues that are accelerated in compounds containing an ortho&#8208;fluorine group, which result in the formation of the corresponding protodeboronation products. Therefore, a considerable amount of research has focused on novel methodologies to synthesize these valuable compounds while avoiding the protodeboronation issue. This review summarizes the latest developments in the synthesis of fluorinated aryl boronic acid derivatives and their applications in cross&#8208;coupling reactions and other transformations.

Abstract
A procedure on palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative reaction of trifluoroacetimidoyl chlorides and nitro compounds for the construction of pharmaceutically valuable 2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones has been achieved. In this transformation, Mo(CO)6 has been used both as a convenient CO source and a reducing reagent. This newly developed protocol is compatible with various nitro compounds and can be readily scaled up to 1&#8197;mmol scale.

         <title>Recent Advances in Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Chemical and Enzymatic Carbene&#8208;Transfer Reactions</title>

Abstract
The use of diazo compounds in the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions to form C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (X=O, S, N, Si, P etc.) bonds have been a well established approach in organic synthesis. In this context, various transition metals such as Pd, Cu, Rh, Ni, Co, Fe, Ir etc. have proved useful to generate a metal&#8208;carbene intermediate which subsequently undergoes carbene transfer or insertion to form C&#8722;C, C&#8722;Si or C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. However, the use of most abundant, cheaper and environmentally benign metal such as iron to catalyze carbene&#8208;transfer reactions has attracted considerable attention in the last few years. Iron is the second most abundant transition metal in nature and also an integral part of various biological systems which make it highly valuable to use as a catalyst in organic chemistry. This review summarizes the efforts made after 2013 in the area of iron&#8208;catalyzed chemical and enzymatic carbene&#8208;transfer reactions using diazo compounds as carbene precursor.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Base&#8208;Controlled C&#8722;N Coupling Reactions: Selective Mono Versus Diarylation of Primary Amines with 2&#8208;Chlorobenzimidazoles</title>

Abstract
Herein, a base&#8208;controlled protocol was developed for the C&#8722;N coupling of primary amines and 2&#8208;chlorobenzimidazoles, affording a handful of secondary or tertiary amines in a selective fashion. Moreover, this protocol was realized under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, and the variation of the base from iPr2NH to LiOtBu completely switched the selectivity from monoarylation to diarylation. Further investigations elucidated that the variety, intrinsic basicity and amount of the utilized bases considerably affected these reactions.

         <title>Zirconium Oxide&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Amidation of Unactivated Esters under Continuous&#8208;Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A sustainable and environmentally benign direct amidation reaction of unactivated esters with amines has been developed in a continuous&#8208;flow system. A commercially available amorphous zirconium oxide was found to be an efficient catalyst for this reaction. While the typical amidation of esters with amines requires a stoichiometric amount of a promoter or metal activator, the present continuous&#8208;flow method enabled the direct amidation reaction under additive&#8208;free conditions with an extensive diversity towards various functional groups. High yields of the products were obtained with a nearly equimolar proportion of starting materials to reduce byproduct formation, which renders this process applicable for use in a sequential&#8208;flow system.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of Aryl Halides with Primary and Secondary Aliphatic Alcohols Catalyzed by an O,N,N&#8208;Coordinated Nickel Complex</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A synthesis of alkyl aryl ethers was achieved via the cross&#8208;coupling of aryl halides with primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols catalyzed by a bench&#8208;stable nickel complex supported by a monoanionic O,N,N&#8208;tridentate ligand. This nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction proceeds smoothly in the absence of a phosphine ligand, affording alkyl aryl ethers in moderate to good yields.

Abstract
A series of structurally diverse benzyl protected trifluoroborate&#8208;ammoniums were prepared in good to high yields by an efficient hydrogenation of corresponding trifluoroborate&#8208;iminiums using Crabtree's catalyst. Subsequent N&#8208; and B&#8208;deprotections were demonstrated on selected examples to provide several &#945;&#8208;aminoboronic acids. Preliminary experiments on asymmetric version of the reaction indicated a correlation between E/Z&#8208;ratio in the trifluoroborate&#8208;iminium substrate and enantioselectivity. The broad scope, operational simplicity and efficiency of the presented method imply its high potential for a facile access to libraries of &#945;&#8208;aminoboronic acid derivatives that can be used in medicinal chemistry applications and beyond.

Abstract
Epoxidation of alkenes is a significant reaction in organic chemistry due to its opportunities in producing compounds of biochemical interest. Catalytic epoxidation with first&#8208;row transition elements has gained attention in the latest years wherein manganese based catalysts stand superior by satisfying numerous principles of green chemistry. In this review, we have summarized the recent developments in olefin epoxidation using homogeneous manganese catalysts. Manganese complexes with porphyrin, Schiff base, salen, and other non&#8208;heme ligands made efficient catalytic systems during the last five years. Notably, we witnessed greener approaches in recent reports wherein photo&#8208;catalysis is a promising strategy. We anticipate that the review will benefit the researchers to get a better understanding of the reaction and to choose the best catalysts for their reactions.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted synthesis of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones has been developed using 9&#8208;mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methylacridinium perchlorate as an organo&#8208;photocatalyst. The atmosphere&#8208;controlled method (Ar/air) enabled the selective synthesis of hydroxyl&#8208; and acyl&#8208;containing quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones under mild reaction conditions without the use of any metal catalysts or toxic reagents. A fluorescent labelling experiment showed that hydroxyl&#8208;containing quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones may have utility in various biological applications as potent fluorophores.

Abstract
A highly efficient cascade Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation/intramolecular chemodivergent cyclization reaction of N&#8208;carbamoylindoles and sulfoxonium ylides has been successfully achieved for the first time. This synergistic process provides rapid access to functionalized dihydropyrimidoindolone and tricyclic [1,3]oxazino[3,4&#8208;a]indol&#8208;1&#8208;ones skeletons under redox neutral conditions with broad substrate scope and remarkable functional&#8208;group compatibility. Further late&#8208;stage modification of structurally complex drug molecules and mechanistic studies were also accomplished.

Abstract
A series of pyridine functionalized porous organic polymers (POPs&#8208;Py&amp;PPh3) have been synthesized by polymerizing tris(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)phosphane and 4&#8208;vinylpyridine. The pyridine moieties in the copolymer materials contribute to CO2 adsorption and promote the subsequent conversion of CO2. The POP supported Ru catalyst (Ru/POP3&#8208;Py&amp;PPh3) shows a high catalytic activity (TON up to 710) in the N&#8208;formylation of various primary and secondary amines with CO2/H2, affording the corresponding formamides in good yields (55&#8211;95%) under mild reaction conditions. The heterogeneous catalyst can be easily separated from the reaction system and reused for at least eight cycles in the N&#8208;formylation of morpholine.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylation in the Synthesis of N&#8208;Ynonylsulfoximines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation reactions with Cr(CO)6 as carbonyl source are key for the preparation of N&#8208;ynonylsulfoximines from NH&#8208;sulfoximines and bromoalkynes. The couplings proceed at room temperature with a wide range of substrate combinations affording the corresponding products in good yields.

         <title>1,2&#8208;Benzothiazine Derivatives from Sulfonimidamides by Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation Reactions in Solution and under Solvent&#8208;Free Mechanochemical Conditions</title>

Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional aza&#8208;analogues of 1,2&#8208;benzothiazine 1,1&#8208;dioxides have been prepared from sulfonimidamides. Two different protocols are presented. The first is a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed annulation reaction with &#945;&#8208;sulfonyloxyketones leading to 4&#8208;unsubstituted benzothiazine derivatives. By selective bromination with NBS the heterocyclic ring can further be functionalized. In the second approach, an iridium catalyst is applied under solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical conditions providing products with 3,4&#8208;disubstituted thiazine rings from diazoketo esters and diazoketo sulfones.

         <title>Recent Developments in Z&#8208;Selective Olefin Metathesis Reactions by Molybdenum, Tungsten, Ruthenium, and Vanadium Catalysts</title>

Abstract
This review article summarizes reports for Z&#8208;selective olefin metathesis reactions by molybdenum, tungsten, ruthenium, and vanadium catalysts. It is clearly demonstrated that the ligand modifications play essential roles in achieving the stereospecific olefin metathesis reactions. In particular, Mo&#8208; and W&#8208;alkylidene based complex catalysts having pyrrolide&#8208;aryloxide [or bis(aryloxide)] were highly effective in the efficient enantioselective ring opening/cross&#8208;metathesis (EROCM), cross metathesis (CM), homodimerization, ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), and in ring closing metathesis (RCM) with high Z&#8208; selectivities (&#8764;&gt;98%). Ruthenium&#8208;carbene catalysts having cycloadamantyl, catechothiolate, phenolate and thiophenolate ligands display pronounced Z&#8208;selectivity (&gt;98%) in efficient CM, ROCM, AROCM, RCM, ROMP reactions. Halogenated (arylimido)&#8208;alkoxo vanadium&#8208;alkylidenes were thermally robust and effective for efficient highly cis&#8208;specific ROMP of cyclic olefins to afford end&#8208;functionalized ring&#8208;opened polymers.

Abstract
An approach to 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzo[f]isoindolones by a Ag&#8208;catalyzed Ugi 4CR/cascade radical cyclization sequence under mild conditions has been developed. The reaction of (E)&#8208;2&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;4&#8208;arylbut&#8208;3&#8208;ynoic acids, aldehydes, amines, and isocyanides produced 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;benzo[f]isoindolones regioselectively in 60&#8211;85% yields via sequential Ugi 4CR/cascade radical cyclization reaction in the presence of Cs2CO3 and AgOTf. The method achieved the formation of two C&#8722;C bonds under air atmosphere in one&#8208;pot fashion.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrosilylation of Cyclic Imines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates the application of Zn&#8208;complex as a key catalyst for enantioselective hydrosilylation of cyclic imines. As the replacement of platinum&#8208;group metals is currently an interesting challenge in catalysis, a promising alternative in asymmetric hydrosilylation, is to use environmentally benign and easily accessible chiral Zn&#8208;based catalysts. I. W&#281;glarz, K. Michalak and J. Mlynarski show that in situ generated zinc&#8208;ProPhenol complex with silane affords pharmaceutically relevant enantioenriched 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted pyrrolidines in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). Details can be found in the communication by Jacek Mlynarski and co&#8208;workers (I. W&#281;glarz, K. Michalak, J. Mlynarski, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2021, 363, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202001043).

Abstract
In the presence of PhCO2H (20&#8197;mol%), the formal [3+2] cycloaddition between in&#8197;situ formed 1,4&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;one&#8208;based azomethine ylides and azodicarboxylic acid derivatives proceeded readily, thus leading to the formation of trans&#8208;configured spiro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones in up to 98% chemical yield with &gt;20:1&#8197;dr. The relative configuration of the title compounds was unambiguously determined by means of X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis. The reaction mechanism was hypothesized to account for the diastereoselective formation of the isolated spiro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Heterocyclics via Cascade Cyclization of Propargylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover picture illustrates the cascade cyclization of propargylic alcohols with diverse nucleophiles for the construction of heterocyclic compounds via the allenyl carbocation intermediate. In this review, these reactions can be divided into four categories based on the types of nucleophiles, such as C&#8208;nucleophiles, O,S&#8208;nucleophiles, N,P&#8208;nucleophiles, and halo&#8208;nucleophiles. A series of functionalized heterocyclic compounds were constructed under mild reaction conditions. Details can be found in the review by Qiang Xiao and co&#8208;workers (X.&#8208;R. Song, R. Yang, Q. Xiao, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2021, 363, XXXX&#8211;YYYY; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202001142).

         <title>Recent Trends in the Synthesis and Mechanistic Implications of Phenanthridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenanthridine derivatives are one of the most intensively studied families of biologically active compounds. There has been considerable scientific interest in the turn of this century in the synthesis of these N&#8208;containing heterocycles as they are prevalent in many alkaloids and also possess striking biological activities including antibacterial, antifungal, antitumor activities. In this regard, a number of synthetic approaches toward the construction of phenanthridine moieties with various substituents, and to increase their yield have been developed by the synthetic organic community. Even though many researchers have developed various innovative methods for the synthesis of phenanthridine	derivatives for the past few years, still there is substantial scope for the discovery of novel synthetic methods. In this review, the latest developments in the diverse synthetic strategies of phenanthridine derivatives in the presence and absence of metals were described. The present review also enlightens the use of different reagents, the diversity of the substrates identified, and the plausible mechanisms unraveled towards the construction of these biologically relevant scaffolds.</dc:description>
