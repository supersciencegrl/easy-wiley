Abstract
A base&#8208;mediated one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step, four&#8208;component reaction has been developed to synthesize imidazole&#8208;4(2H)&#8208;ones, utilizing commercially available amino acid esters, aldehydes, alkynes, and amino alcohols. Control experiments and isolation of the intermediate revealed the mechanistic details. This four&#8208;component reaction proceeds via imine formation, followed by the nucleophilic addition of alkyne to form a propargylamine precursor. Subsequently, the propargylamine precursor under undergoes base&#8208;mediated conversion into 1&#8208;azadiene, followed by in situ ketene formation to generate (allylideneamino)prop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;one. The nucleophilic addition of amino alcohol and subsequent intramolecular cyclization provides imidazole&#8208;4 (2H)&#8208;ones exclusively.

         <title>Imidazolium&#8208;Dithiocarboxylate Zwitterions Catalysed Ring&#8208;Opening Additions of Cyclopropenones</title>

Abstract
Imidazolium&#8208;dithiocarboxylate zwitterions (NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2), a novel organocatalyst that derived from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC), was used to activate cyclopropenones. Under the catalysis of 10&#8197;mol% NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2, a range of phenols, alcohols, primary and secondary amines react with cyclopropenones to produce trisubstituted &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters and amides in 46&#8211;95% yield. More than 68 products, including 7 natural product derivatives have been synthesized through this method. Mechanism study showed NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2 act as a Lewis base to activate the C=C double bond of cyclopropenones and trigger the ring&#8208;opening reaction. HRMS analysis indicated the formation of the key adduct of NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2 and cyclopropenone. More importantly, this study demonstrated completely different catalytic activity of NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CS2 and NHC catalysts, the latter one cannot catalyse these reactions.

         <title>Au(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Hydroarylation of Allenes for the Synthesis of Tetrahydrodiazepines or Tetrahydrodiazonines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Allenes tethered to pyrroles undergo Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation leading to tetrahydrodiazepines or tetrahydrodiazonines. The regioselectivity of the reaction is governed by both the substitution pattern of the allene and the nature of the Au(I) ligand. Hence, alkyl&#8208;gem&#8208;disubstituted allenes preferentially lead to tetrahydrodiazepines via 7&#8208;exo&#8208;cyclizations, while aryl&#8208;substituted allenes preferentially lead to tetrahydrodiazonines via 9&#8208;endo&#8208;cyclization when a phosphite ligand is used. Enantioselective reactions have been developed with the SEGPHOS chiral ligand, leading to chiral heterocycles with high enantioselectivity (up to 96% ee). In addition, DFT calculations have streamlined the regioselectivity (7&#8208;exo vs 9&#8208;endo) of these gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations.

         <title>Metal&#8208;free, Selective Ortho&#8208;Deuteration of N&#8208;heterocyclic Oxides
</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Replacing hydrogen with deuterium raises the activation energy for C&#8210;D bond cleavage. This approach has gained attention in drug design, especially to protect the ortho&#8208;position of pyridines, which are susceptible to enzymatic oxidation. Until now, direct hydrogen isotope exchange has been largely restricted to the use of reactive organolithium reagents or metal&#8208;catalysed deuteration methods. In this work, we present a metal&#8208;free, selective ortho&#8208;deuteration of N&#8208;heterocycles starting from their N&#8208;oxides, proceeding at room temperature in just 5 minutes. This method achieves high deuterium incorporation across a broad range of N&#8208;heterocycles, including bioactive compounds. Experimental and computational studies have elucidated the mechanism of the reaction, showing that regioselectivity is driven by a successful increase in acidity at the ortho&#8208;position, enabling deprotonation by the in&#8208;situ generated dimsyl anion.

Abstract
A chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of axially chiral alkenes was developed via an enantioselective and para&#8208;selective Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction between phenols and 1&#8208;alkynylnaphth&#8208;2&#8208;ols. This methodology features an efficient hydroarylation with high functional group tolerance, complete para&#8208;selectivity, excellent yields (up to 99%), and enantioselectivities (up to 94% ee) in the presence of a N&#8208;triflylphosphoramide catalyst. DFT calculations were performed to investigate para&#8208;selectivity and results indicate that both kinetics and thermodynamics parameters are more favorable compared to ortho&#8208;selectivity.

Abstract
The amination of aryl halides with palladium catalysts (Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination) is a widely used transformation in synthetic and drug discovery chemistry. In this report, we demonstrate that a monometallic 2&#8208;phosphinoimidazole Pd catalyst exhibits comparable or enhanced reactivity when compared to all ligands screened for room temperature amination of aryl chlorides with secondary amines. The di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine derivative showed extremely high reactivity while the di&#8208;isopropyl variant led to almost complete loss of catalytic activity. Computational and experimental mechanistic and kinetic studies indicate that a monometallic Pd structure rather than a bimetallic Pd structure is key to fast catalysis. The di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine ligand has fast catalysis because it thermodynamically disfavors the formation of a much less active bimetallic Pd complex. A wide substrate scope is demonstrated for the arylation of secondary amines with aryl chlorides using our new catalyst system.

In this report, we demonstrate that a monometallic 2-phosphinoimidazole Pd catalyst exhibits comparable or enhanced reactivity when compared to all ligands screened for room temperature amination of aryl chlorides with secondary amines. The di-tert-butylphosphine derivative showed extremely high reactivity while the di-isopropyl variant led to almost complete loss of catalytic activity. Computational and experimental mechanistic and kinetic studies indicate that a monometallic Pd structure rather than a bimetallic Pd structure is key to fast catalysis.

         <dc:description>The electrochemical catalyst&#8208;free generation of carbon radicals bearing three electron&#8208;withdrawing groups from the corresponding C&#8208;H nucleophiles remains unexplored. To this end, we report a direct electro&#8208;oxidation strategy to access these electrophilic carbon radicals under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. Enabled by this strategy, the radical 1,2&#8208;alkylarylations of allylic alcohols was realized, affording &#946;&#8208;quaternary ketones with high functional group compatibility.

Abstract
A general protocol for the efficient synthesis of a variety of highly functionalized pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ones has been developed through a sequential Wolff rearrangement and [3+3] annulation reaction of enaminones and diazo compounds. This straightforward approach features wide substrate applicability, good substrate tolerance, moderate to excellent yields, and without any catalyst, and enables access to structurally diverse pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;one skeletons. Additionally, scale&#8208;up experiments and synthetic derivatizations demonstrated the potential synthetic utility of the transformations.

         <title>Alkylation of Imines with Alkyl Halides under Electrochemical Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An electrochemical protocol for the alkylation of imines was developed by using easily available alkyl halides as the alkyl sources, graphite felt (GF) as anode and zinc plate as cathode. Various substituted imines, alkyl bromides and alkyl iodides were suitable for this reaction and a series of &#945;&#8208;branched amines were obtained in moderate to good yields. This method provides a green way for the addition of imines to avoid the need for metal reagents, chemical oxidants and reductants, which makes it has a good application prospect in drug synthesis.

Abstract
A cascade reaction involving 2&#8208;isocyanophenyl propargylic ester and 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2H&#8208;chromen&#8208;2&#8208;one has been documented. This reaction leads to the formation of a highly strained cyclopropen&#8208;imine species, thereby offering an efficient route to synthesize quinoline&#8208;fused polycyclic skeletons.

         <title>Organic Photoredox Catalytic Sulfonylation of Enaminones to Access 3&#8208;Sulfonyl Chromones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we disclose a readily available phenothiazine derivative as an oxidizing organic photocatalyst, that serves to induce radical cascade sulfonylation/cyclization reaction of enaminones. A variety of 3&#8208;sulfonyl chromones have been obtained with moderate to excellent yields. This catalytic platform proceeds under metal&#8208;free conditions with a wide substrate scope and broad functional group compatibility, which unlocks the new reactivity of phenothiazine derivatives and adds significant synthetic values to O&#8208;heterocycles.

Abstract
A 1,3&#8208;iodoesterification of 2&#8208;substituted indoles with trihaloacetic acid, iodination reagent, and hypervalent iodine(III) compound was developed as an acid&#8208;promoted Csp2&#8722;H/Csp3&#8722;H dual functionalization reaction to furnish 3&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8208;trihaloacetoxymethyl indoles. The one&#8208;pot 1,3&#8208;iodoesterification/hydrolysis of the trihaloester group provided 3&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8208;pivaloylmethyl indoles via the rearrangement of the pivaloyl group. The reaction proceeded through a trihaloacetic acid&#8208;assisted electrophilic activation of the iodination reagent after the formation of an indolyl(mesityl)iodonium trihaloacetate.

         <title>Photoinduced Catalytic Alkylation of Active Methine Compounds with Nonactivated Alkenes Using Yttrium Triflate as a Lewis Acid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Photoinduced catalytic alkylation reactions of active methine compounds with nonactivated alkenes have been developed using an organophotocatalyst, a metal Lewis acid, an arylthiol, and an amine base catalyst system. The alkylation reactions proceeded smoothly under ambient conditions with blue light irradiation, affording the desired products bearing quaternary carbon centers in high yields. Furthermore, enantioselective alkylation with an nonactivated alkene was achieved using a chiral Lewis acid.

         <title>Mg(SPh)2 as a Catalyst for Efficient Photocatalytic Alkylation Reactions of Active Methylene Compounds with Nonactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Mg(SPh)2 has been found to be a highly active catalyst in photocatalytic alkylation reactions of active methylene compounds with nonactivated alkenes. The desired reactions proceeded smoothly to afford the corresponding alkylated products in high yields with low catalyst loadings (0.2&#8211;0.3&#8197;mol%). This protocol is applicable to a continuous&#8208;flow system. Notably, magnesium is an earth&#8208;abundant metal, and Mg(SPh)2 exhibits higher catalytic activity than the previously reported LiSPh.

         <title>2&#8208;Aminoindoles and 2&#8208;Iminoindolines as Viable Precursors of Indole&#8208;Fused Nitrogenated Polyheterocycles</title>

Abstract
The synthesis of architecturally complex polyheterocyclic structures embedding the indole ring represents a growing field of interest. Carbolines and their partially dehydro derivatives, pyrazinoindoles, indoloindoles, azepinoindoles and other medium&#8208;sized derivatives are only some examples of indole&#8208;containing polycyclic compounds featured by enhanced pharmacological and photophysical properties. Among various synthetic protocols to prepare these important target compounds those based on the utilization of 2&#8208;aminoindoles and 2&#8208;iminoindolines are gaining increasing interest because of the ease of their preparation. The presence of a couple of reactive sites in these derivatives is instrumental for the assembling of polyheterocyclic structures exploiting single step operations featured by efficient cascade or tandem processes. Several of these methods employ catalyzed reactions which can be developed for the asymmetric synthesis of enantiopure compounds. This review provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date report on the currently available methods for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aminoindoles and 2&#8208;iminoindolines and their application to the preparation of polyheterocyclic derivatives.

         <title>Preparation of Mesoporous Cu2O Nanospheres for Green Synthesis in the Enantioselective Boron Conjugate Addition of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Chiral Compounds in Aqueous Phase</title>

Abstract
Chiral organoboron compounds are essential intermediates in various significant reactions. However, there are still few efficient catalysts for their synthesis. This paper reports a novel catalytic material for chiral asymmetric boron conjugate addition reactions: mesoporous Cu2O nanospheres (M&#8722;Cu2O). M&#8722;Cu2O is approximately 0.55&#8197;&#956;m, exhibiting dense and uniformly distributed worm&#8208;like pores. It features a specific surface area of 15.7&#8197;m2/g and an average pore size of 14.3&#8197;nm. Under the conditions of Toluene:H2O=9:1, with a chiral ligand amount of 3.6&#8197;mol% and no additional base, it achieves a high yield (98% yield) and impressive enantioselectivity (99% ee) for the template substrate chalcone using only 3.0&#8197;mol% of the catalyst. Notably, the catalyst can be easily recovered and maintains robust catalytic performance after seven cycles, yielding 92% and an ee value of 90%. This work presents a mild and effective method for synthesizing chiral boron compounds in an aqueous phase, significantly enhancing the application potential of mesoporous copper oxide nanospheres.

         <dc:description>We reported an electrochemical oxidative carbonylation of N&#8208;phenylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amine derivatives under mild condtions without an external oxidant. Our approach demonstrated a novel electrochemical oxidative carbonylation reaction mode in which the simultaneous reaction of catalyst and substrate with the anode has been developed. Furthermore, an electrochemical C&#8208;H activation for the synthesis of cyclized pyridinium ion has also been realized. Mechanistic investigations suggested that the process involved a &#8220;PdII/PdIII/PdI/PdII&#8221; catalytic cycle, and H2 was generated at the cathode.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for the direct 3&#8208;alkylation of coumarins utilizing alkyl halides as the alkylating agents has been achieved. This versatile reaction is compatible with a range of alkyl halides, including activated alkyl bromides, perfluoroalkyl iodides, and unactivated alkyl iodides. We propose a mechanism involving photoinduced electron transfer between alkyl halides and coumarins in the first singlet excited (S1) state, which generates alkyl radicals essential for the 3&#8208;alkylation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Analysis of Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Semihydrogenations of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes has historically been an essential technique in organic chemistry. In this context, researchers often employ transition metal complexes to achieve this conversion. Given the pronounced polarization of results, often yielding either very high or very low values, it remains challenging to discern the factors influencing reactivity and selectivity in many cases. In this work, we combine different sub&#8208;disciplines of digital chemistry with experimental outcomes to rationalize the results of a model Ni&#8208;catalyzed semihydrogenation that leads to E&#8208;alkenes. First, we analyze the main factors behind successful reactions using a machine learning classification model. The descriptors are computed directly from the SMILES strings of the reacting alkynes using an automated protocol that relies on structural features, molecular mechanics, and semi&#8208;empirical techniques. This workflow requires minimal human intervention and provides a fast yet useful approach. Next, we couple the same descriptors with activation barriers calculated with density functional theory, generating a regression model that explains reactivity based on the properties of the alkyne substrates. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of using a combination of digital chemistry techniques to uncover reaction trends in Ni&#8208;catalyzed semihydrogenations of alkynes, an area where human intuition proves limited in application.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Functionalized pyridines and 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines are crucial organic entities in natural products, organic materials, drugs and catalysts. Despite progress, a facile and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis remains desirable so far. In this context, we disclose a novel visible light&#8208;promoted radical cascade sulfonylation&#8208;cyclization&#8208;aromatization of N&#8208;propargyl enamides with selenosulfonates. This approach avoids the use of metal&#8208; or photocatalyst, bases and external oxidants, marking a significant advance in sustainable and green chemistry accords. Utilizing this protocol, we successfully synthesized a diverse range of sulfonated 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines and pyridines, featuring good functional group compatibility, simple operation and mild condition.</dc:description>

         <title>Combined Electrooxidation and Proline Catalysis for Asymmetric Formal Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling of Benzylic Alcohols with Ketones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article presents a method for asymmetric formal cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of benzylic alcohols with ketones through combined electrooxidation and organocatalysis. Employing inexpensive and environmentally friendly proline as a chiral organocatalyst, various benzylic alcohols and simple ketones serve as substrates to directly obtain diverse chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxycarbonyl compounds with moderate to good yields (up to 85%) and excellent stereoselectivity (up to 99% ee and 99:1 dr). The reaction proceeds under mild conditions at room temperature in air, without oxidants or additives, demonstrating robust functional group tolerance and atom efficiency. Hydrogen gas released at the cathode is the sole byproduct. Using L&#8208; or D&#8208;proline allows straightforward access to both chiral configurations of &#946;&#8208;hydroxycarbonyl compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Layered Copper&#8208;based 2D&#8208;MOFs for Enhanced Catalytic Regioselective Phosphorylation of Alkynes and P&#8208;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A functionalized heterogeneous Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Cu&#8208;2D&#8208;MOF) was synthesized through the reaction of Cu(NO3)2&#183;3H2O with 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoroterephthalic acid and 4,4'&#8208;bipyridine. The synthesized material underwent comprehensive characterization using various techniques, including FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy, N2 physical adsorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Subsequently, the catalytic performance of Cu&#8208;2D&#8208;MOFs was assessed in the hydrophosphorylation and aerobic oxidative dehydrogenative coupling reactions involving alkynes and P&#8208;H bonds. The catalyst demonstrated remarkable catalytic activity in both transformations, effectively yielding a wide variety of (E)&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;phosphoryl and alkynyl&#8208;phosphoryl compounds, respectively. Notably, the incorporation of this MOF material facilitated the phosphorylation reaction to proceed seamlessly, eliminating the necessity for supplementary small molecular organic ligands. Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrated ease of recovery and recyclability through a simple recovery process. Employing a systematic approach of sequential control experiments, we have delineated the potential transformation pathway of the reaction and consequently hypothesized a probable reaction mechanism for the observed transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Rutaecarpine Analogues by Borrowing Hydrogen Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 2, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A series of rutaecarpine analogues were synthesized in 11&#8211;90% yields via an iron (II) phthalocyanine&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;alkylation reaction of 3&#8208;hydroxyethyl quinazolinone&#8208;linked indole. Mechanistic investigation revealed that the formation of C&#8722;N bonds in the cyclization reaction occurs through intramolecular borrowing hydrogen annulation. The crucial intermediates in this process were verified by LC&#8211;MS analysis and DFT calculations, further supporting the proposed mechanism. Furthermore, biological evaluation demonstrated that some of the synthesized rutaecarpine analogues exhibited good anti&#8208;inflammatory activity.

Abstract
Aerobic oxidative tandem C(sp3)&#8722;H imination and amination between pyridylmethane and aminomethane derivatives was demonstrated using a flavin&#8211;iodine&#8208;coupled catalyst. This method provides a simple and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of various 1,3&#8208;substituted imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines with fluorescent properties. The flavin&#8211;iodine catalyst efficiently promoted multiple reactions, including the oxygenation of pyridylmethane and subsequent oxidative C&#8722;N bond formation, utilizing only molecular oxygen, which is a sustainable ideal oxidant. The resulting 1&#8208;ester&#8208;substituted imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives exhibited dual&#8208;state emission in both solution and solid states. In particular, imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine with a bulky 2,6&#8208;dichlorophenyl substituent showed an apparent blue emission with good photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields (0.49 in CH2Cl2 solution and 0.39 in the solid state), making it promising candidate for use in optoelectronic devices.

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot strategy to C3&#8208;functioanlized benzofurans is achieved from o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl propargylamines (o&#8208;HPPAs). 3&#8208;Aminobenzofurans were obtained in 64&#8211;96% yields through the cascade alkyne&#8208;allene tautomerization and 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig annulation of o&#8208;HPPAs in the presence of KOH/NaOtBu as the fruitful base combination. Moreover, with benzenesulfinates and diphenylphosphine oxide as nucleophiles, a one&#8208;pot protocol towards these derivatives was also demonstrated through a cascade 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition/5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig annulation/aromatization process. Additionally, a gram&#8208;scale synthesis and further transformation into other valuable functionalized benzofurans were conducted to show the potential in organic synthesis of these developed synthetic approaches.

         <title>Synthesis of Aza&#8208;S(VI) Fluorides and Primary Sulfonimidamides from Sulfinylamines</title>

Abstract
Aza&#8208;S(VI) fluorides are crucial compounds in the synthesis of various S(VI) derivatives, which find broad applications in drug discovery. However, the synthesis of sulfonimidoyl and sulfondiimidoyl fluorides have been relatively underexplored, often requiring lengthy reaction sequences and/or the use of hazardous gaseous reagents. In this study, we present a rapid one&#8208;pot method for producing sulfonimidoyl fluorides from sulfinylamines via a nucleophilic addition/electrophilic fluorination sequence. Similarly, sulfondiimidoyl fluorides can be synthesized using the same sequence, preceded by the formation of unsymmetrical sulfurdiimides readily generated in&#8197;situ from sulfinylamines. Whereas isolation of sulfondiimidoyl fluorides was not feasible, they could be efficiently converted into primary sulfonimidamides by base hydrolysis in a one&#8208;pot process. Furthermore, we explored the reactivity of aza&#8208;S(VI) fluorides with various nucleophiles, demonstrating a versatile synthetic platform for the synthesis of aza&#8208;S(VI) compounds.

Abstract
A three&#8208;component reaction of 1,3&#8208;diketones with H2O2 and alcohols was discovered. 3,5&#8208;Dialkoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxolanes are formed in yields ranging from 13% to 83% using an excess of acids such as H2SO4, MeHSO3, p&#8208;TsOH&#8901;H2O or BF3&#8901;Et2O. This reaction proceeds with the formation of 3,5&#8208;dialkoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxolanes despite the diversity of possible reaction pathways leading to different types of peroxides, oligomers, polymers or hydrolysis. 3,5&#8208;Dimethoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxolanes exhibit high activity against phytopathogenic fungi.

         <title>Controllable Synthesis of Oxa&#8208;/Thia&#8208;Spirohydroquinolines by [3+(2+1)] Annulation of Aromatic Amines with Bimolecular O/S&#8208;Heterocyclic Ketones</title>

Abstract
[3+(2+1)] Annulation represents the most straightforward and atom&#8208;economical strategies in organic synthesis for the efficient construction of diverse cyclic structural units and complex molecules. Herein, we present a Lewis acid Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed controlled synthesis of two different regioselective oxa/thia&#8208;spirohydroquinolines (C=C at the &#945;/&#946;&#8208;site of O/S&#8208;atom) from aromatic amines and bimolecular O/S&#8208;heterocyclic ketones via intermolecular [3+(2+1)] annulation. This method features mild reaction conditions, high step economy and atom utilization, and the O/S&#8208;heterocyclic ketone can act as both two&#8208; and one&#8208;carbon synthons. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the intrinsic cause of this unique regioselectivity is caused by the proton abstraction step.

         <title>Solvent&#8208; and Temperature&#8208;Switched Chemoselectivity: Controlled Synthesis of Diverse Pyrazolo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines</title>

Abstract
Divergent synthesis of two types of functionalized pyrazolo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines was established via a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol involving a tunable dehydrogenation process and deacylative oxidation accompanied by elimination of the HNO2 pathway. Key attributes of the procedure included the initial formation of C,N&#8208;cyclic&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;acyl azomethine imines and subsequent switchable chemoseletivity that either led to aroyl&#8208; and nitro&#8208;substituted pyrazolo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines or proceeded via deacylative oxidation and elimination of HNO2 pathway to afford the aromatized pyrazolo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines. The present approach features the use of readily available amines and aldehydes as raw materials, switchable chemoselectivity, wide functional group tolerance such as nitro, halide, aryl, aroyl and sulfonyl group, and easy separation and purification. A combination of control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided important insights into the possible mechanism.

         <title>Intermolecular Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Nitrene Transfer Employing Aryl Azides: An Access to 7&#8208;Functionalized 2&#8208;Aminoindoles</title>

Abstract
We report on intermolecular gold&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer, utilizing o&#8208;functionalized aryl azides as nitrene transfer reagents. This catalytic reaction provides a modular route to 7&#8208;functionalized 2&#8208;aminoindoles. Due to the optimized reaction conditions (toluene, 80&#8211;100&#8201;&#176;C), a variety of functional substituents proved compatible (36 examples; yields up to 98%). The reaction can be performed using both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic variants with a low catalyst loading (1&#8197;mol %). The synthetic potential of the obtained products was illustrated by post&#8208;modifications of the indole backbone and peripheral substituents. A plausible reaction mechanism includes the generation of intermediate &#945;&#8208;imino carbenes directly from the o&#8208;functionalized aryl azides or other nitrene sources, such as anthranils or benzofuroxans, which form during the reaction in the cases of the specific aryls.

Abstract
A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective cycloisomerization of bis(indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;ynamides for the rapid construction of five&#8208;membered ring linked bisindole derivatives has been reported, affording the desired products in the range of 72%&#8211;94% yields under mild conditions along with broad substrate scope. Moreover, DFT calculation of the NBO (natural bond orbital) charge supports the origin of its regioselectivity.

Abstract
A series of 4&#8208;sulfoximinocyclopent&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones was prepared in 35 to 99% yield through a calcium(II)&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;Piancatelli reaction, including in enantioenriched form. Depending on their substitution pattern, diverse diastereoselective chemical transformations can be applied to these scaffolds, allowing access to cyclopentane derivatives. This study opens synthetic routes to cyclopentane&#8208;based scaffolds and also paves the way for the exploration of the associated chemical space in drug discovery.

Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed methodology for regioselective cycloisomerization and tandem Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of 1,7&#8208;enynes has been described, enabling the synthesis of diverse polycyclic heterocycles with four stereocenters. This stereoselective protocol demonstrates compatibility with various substituted enynes and alkenes, yielding products in 46&#8211;90% yield while tolerating a wide range of functional groups, including esters, ketones, and halides. Notably, the reaction with naphthoquinones retains the moiety in the final product, which acts as essential core structures in various natural products and bioactive compounds.

Abstract
Recently developed synthetic protocols for the preparation of &#955;3&#8208;phosphanaphthalenes have broadened the general scope of organophosphorus chemistry, but a versatile protocol is still missing. Here, we describe a scalable synthetic approach for the construction of various substituted phosphanaphthalenes. We have obtained 11 derivatives through rigorous study and have demonstrated the robustness of this method. The optical properties of these phosphorus compounds and their aza and carbo analogues have been experimentally compared. Here, we show the power of the method in extending the synthesis to even larger polycyclic aromatic systems with embedded phosphine rings toward its potential applicability to materials science.

         <title>Photoinduced Radical Borylation of Robust Carbon&#8211;Heteroatom Bonds</title>

Abstract
Photoinduced borylation has emerged as a valuable strategy for synthesizing arylboronic esters. However, photochemical transformations involving inert bonds such as C(sp2)&#8722;F bonds are still challenging. Herein, we report a straightforward and operationally simple method for the activation of various inert carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds, enabling the synthesis of diverse arylboronic esters without the need for transition metals or catalysts. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the deprotonation of DMSO plays a pivotal role in the reaction, and the excited DMSO anion can undergo electron transfer to the aryl substrates activated by anionic sp2&#8211;sp3 diboron compounds, i.&#8201;e., [FB2pin2]&#8722;, thereby facilitating the cleavage of carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds. The reaction allows the conversion of diverse Caryl&#8211;hetero bonds in batch and flow reactors into the corresponding arylboronic esters. The products can be used in a subsequent Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling without isolation.

The reaction allows the conversion of diverse C&lt;sub&gt;aryl&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;hetero bonds in batch and flow reactors into the corresponding arylboronic esters. The products can be used in a subsequent Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling without isolation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthesis of 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208; substituted chroman&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives via deaminative alkylation of amino acid derived Katritzky salts and tandem cyclization with o&#8208;(allyloxy)arylaldehydes has been developed. This approach exhibits functional&#8208;group compatibility with 31 examples and affords the desired products in yields of 16&#8211;88%. Mechanistic research results suggest that the formation of EDA complexes between the Katritzky salts and a base is the main reason for initiating the reaction.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of 2&#8208;Substituted&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethyloxazoles from Amides and Acetylene Gas in the KOH/MeOH/DMSO Catalytic Triad</title>

Abstract
Pharmaceutically prospective 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethyloxazoles are synthesized in 16&#8211;58% yield via cascade assembly of one molecule of primary amide with two molecules of acetylene gas in the KOH/MeOH/DMSO catalytic triad (90&#8201;&#176;C, 2&#8197;h). This self&#8208;organization of oxazoles demonstrates unexpected successful competition with the alkaline hydrolysis of amides. The mechanism involving amide N&#8208;vinylation, enamine&#8208;imine isomerization, imine ethynylation and intramolecular O&#8208;vinylation cascade sequence has been deduced and supported by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations using the B2PLYP&#8722;D3/6&#8208;311+G**//B3LYP/6&#8208;31+G*+IEF PCM (B3LYP/6&#8208;31+G*) approach.

Abstract
An approach to the synthesis of arylthiolated quinolino[2,1&#8208;b]quinazolinones has been developed using unactivated alkynes containing quinazolinones and diaryldisulfides under visible light irradiation. The procedure entails a sequential radical arylthiolation and cyclization reaction. A possible radical mechanism has been investigated and proven as a single electron transfer (SET) process.

Abstract
Isochromenes, oxygen&#8208;containing bicyclic compounds, have gained significant attention in organic synthesis due to their versatile reactivity and prominence in biologically active natural products. This review highlights recent developments in the synthesis of isochromenes, with a focus on efficient and selective methodologies. Traditional metal&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular ring&#8208;closure reactions have been the cornerstone for isochromene formation, but recent efforts have expanded to include new strategies that enhance functionalization and scalability. By examining key advancements in the field, this article provides a critical assessment of the current state of the art involving isochromene synthesis and its ongoing challenges.

Abstract
We describe a selective preparation of a variety of functionalized pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;c]tetrahydroquinolines and indolo[3,2&#8208;c]tetrahydroquinolines in 40&#8211;82% and 40&#8211;80% yields from alkynyl&#8208;tethered oximes with diaryliodonium triflates, respectively. The one&#8208;pot reaction underwent N&#8208;arylation, intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition, selective [1.3] or [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement of N&#8722;O bond in total three steps. Experimental studies revealed that EtOAc solvent and copper(II)&#8208;catalyst played crucial roles on the formation of these two tetrahydroquinoline scaffolds. Moreover, these two tetrahydroquinoline scaffolds could be converted into various tetrahydroquinoline building blocks by further transformations.

&lt;p&gt;We describe a selective preparation of a variety of functionalized pyrrolo[2,3-&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]tetrahydroquinolines and indolo[3,2-&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]tetrahydroquinolines in 40&#8211;82% and 40&#8211;80% yields from alkynyl-tethered oximes with diaryliodonium triflates, respectively. The one-pot reaction underwent &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-arylation, intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition, selective [1.3] or [3,3]-rearrangement of N&#8722;O bond in total three steps. Experimental studies revealed that EtOAc solvent and copper(II)-catalyst played crucial roles on the formation of these two tetrahydroquinoline scaffolds. Moreover, these two tetrahydroquinoline scaffolds could be converted into various tetrahydroquinoline building blocks by further transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Revisiting the Synthetic Utility of 4,5&#8208;Dehydro[2.2]paracyclophane</title>

Abstract
4,5&#8208;Dehydro[2.2]paracyclophane, an aryne species of [2.2]paracyclophane ([2.2]PCP) was reported more than half a century ago. However, despite its potential usefulness for preparing [2.2]PCP derivatives, this species is rarely considered in synthetic applications, probably because the efficiency of aryne generation and reaction with arynophiles are low under harsh reaction conditions of classical methods involving precursors. We have prepared o&#8208;iodoaryl triflate&#8208; and o&#8208;silylaryl triflate&#8208;type precursors and achieved generation of 4,5&#8208;dehydro[2.2]PCP, which reacted with a diverse range of arynophiles to afford functionalized [2.2]PCP derivatives, including [2.2]PCP&#8208;fused &#960;&#8208;extended polyaromatics. Our results highlight the synthetic utility of the historically overlooked 4,5&#8208;dehydro[2.2]PCP intermediate.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Nitro Compounds with Grignard and Organozinc Reagents for Synthesis of Functionalized Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 2, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The treatment of nitro compounds with Grignard reagents in the presence of a catalytic amount of FeCl2/t&#8208;BuMgCl produced various types of secondary amines in good yields. This reductive coupling most likely involves the compatibility of functional groups such as chlorine, benzyl ether, olefin, and acetylene. Moreover, the corresponding poly&#8208;substituted amines were not observed under these conditions. When the Grignard reagents were replaced with organozinc reagents, functionalized secondary amines containing ester and nitrile groups were obtained in good yields.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Cascade Trifluoromethylation of Dienes and Enynes Using a Perylene Diimide (PDI) Organophotocatalyst</title>

Abstract
The perylene diimide (PDI) is an underexplored synthetic organic dye with significant potential in photoredox catalysis. We have developed a good chemo&#8208; and regioselective, atom&#8208;economical methodology for synthesizing trifluoroethylated saturated heterocyclic derivatives and trifluoroethyl&#8208;containing cyclobutane derivatives. This process involves the generation of trifluoromethyl radical from the Langlois (CF3SO2Na) reagent under photoredox conditions, which selectively reacts with the electron&#8208;rich terminal double/triple bonds in the diene/enyne framework. The resulting intermediate undergoes a cascade cyclization, yielding the desired compounds in a redox&#8208;neutral manner. Our methodology operates under very mild conditions, eliminating the need for transition metals and external oxidizing agents. It is broadly applicable across various substrates and is supported by comprehensive mechanistic insights from regular photophysical experiments.

         <title>Trifluoroacetic Acid Promotes Umpolung of 2&#8208;Methylindole to Achieve C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation</title>

Abstract
An umpolung strategy for the C(sp3)&#8722;H aminomethylation of 2&#8208;methylindole has been developed using trifluoroacetic acid to induce the transformation, with aminals serving as precursors of iminium ion. Mechanistic studies have clearly shown that trifluoroacetic acid may play a pivotal role in this strategy. The utilization of readily available starting materials, mild reaction conditions, tolerance to complex functional groups, combine with yields of up to 98% and potential biological applications render this protocol applicable and useful for organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry.

Abstract
Electrosynthesis of selenylated&#8208;oxazolone derivatives via cascade selenylation/cyclization of ynamides was disclosed. A series of diaryl diselenides, dialkyl diselenides, and heteroaryl&#8208;substituted ynamides was tolerated in this protocol and delivered 4&#8208;selenyloxazolones in 28&#8211;83% yields. The scale&#8208;up reaction and the oxidation of selenylated&#8208;oxazolone was performed to showcase the practicability of this method. Furthermore, mechanistic experiments indicated that a cationic pathway instead of a radical pathway was probably involved.

Abstract
An iodine&#8208;mediated C=C double bond&#8208;forming reaction has been established to access various fused quinolinone derivatives under transition metal&#8208;free conditions. The present reaction is also applicable to the synthesis of fused quinolinium frameworks from the corresponding precursors and can be conducted on a gram scale.

Abstract
The C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization via intramolecular hydride transfer initiated cascade annulation for the synthesis of spiro&#8208;fused succinimide&#8208;containing tetrahydroquinolines induced by iminium intermediates is described. A series of diastereoselective 2,7&#8208;diazaspiro[4.5]decanes&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones were achieved using ortho&#8208;amino&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;succinimide using Lewis acid catalysis. This scandium triflate Sc(OTf)3 catalysed, oxidant&#8208;free protocol leads to the diastereoselective synthesis of a class of 2,7&#8208;diazaspiro[4.5]decanes&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones derivatives with 48&#8211;98% yield in a single step.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative Cyclization of Indolyl Ynamides for Synthesis of Pentacyclic Spiroindolines</title>

Abstract
The dearomatization of indoles with ynamides is a convenient access towards polycyclic spiroindolines, which can be initiated by &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;additions of ynamides. Currently, the related &#946;&#8208;addition initiated dearomative cyclization requires noble&#8208;metal catalyst or stoichiometric oxidant. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed dearomative cyclization of aryl&#8208;substituted indolyl ynamides through regioselective &#946;&#8208;addition onto ynamides, providing pentacyclic spiroindolines in 81&#8211;97% yields with &gt;25:1 diastereoselectivities. Moreover, preliminary success has been obtained for the catalytic enantioselective dearomative cyclization.

         <title>Dual NHC/HAT&#8208;Promoted Esterification to Access &#945;&#8208;Aryl Glycines</title>

Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Aryl glycines are among the most important carbonyl compounds, particularly as nonproteinogenic &#945;&#8208;amino acids present in many pharmacophores. As such, many strategies have been developed to access this motif, but direct carboxylation methods remain underdeveloped. Herein, we employ a dual NHC/HAT catalysis strategy to access 2&#8208;azaallyl radicals, which subsequently couple with in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated ester azolium radical intermediates. Base&#8208;mediated collapse of the ensuing tetrahedral intermediate liberates the NHC catalyst and benzophenone&#8208;protected aryl glycine. This methodology was employed to esterify a variety of aryl&#8208;substituted glycine derivatives, as well as allylic and benzylic sites. Mechanistic studies reveal that this radical process operates under both oxidative and reductive quenching cycles, while preliminary experiments employing a chiral NHC and Lewis acid additive demonstrate modest enantioselectivity.

Abstract
A six&#8208;membered ring bromo&#8208;etherification of &#1013;&#8208;alkenyl alcohols using an N&#8208;oxide catalyst was developed to furnish 2&#8208;bromomethyl&#8208;6&#8208;substituted tetrahydropyrans with cis&#8208;selectivity and 3&#8208;bromomethyl isochromans in high yields. DFT calculations indicate that the NMO catalyst enhances the electrophilicity of the bromine atom on NBS via two hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions after the formation of the NMO&#8208;NBS complex.

Abstract
Herein, an iron&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the aromatization&#8208;driven deconstruction and decarboxylation of ketone&#8208;derived dihydroquinazolinones in reaction with unsaturated carboxylic acids is reported. A diverse range of fluoroacrylic acids and cinnamic acids reacted effectively with dihydroquinazolinones, yielding essential monofluoroalkenes and alkenes with excellent stereoselectivity. Additionally, spiro&#8208;dihydroquinazolinones served as suitable substrates, facilitating the synthesis of valuable quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones featuring alkene motifs. This protocol is notable for its operational simplicity and versatility, enabling the chemical diversification of active molecules.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Deoxygenation of Nitroarenes to Access N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>

Abstract
Herein, we present the example of iron&#8208;catalyzed reductive amination of nitroarenes under the iron/borane system, providing diverse N&#8208;heterocycles in moderate to good yields. This transformation has high efficiency, broad substrate scope, and good functional group compatibility. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that hydroxylamines derived from nitrosoarenes may serve as crucial intermediates rather than anilines, and free organic radicals may not participate in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Intramolecular Crossed [2+2] Cycloaddition through Visible&#8208;Light Triplet Sensitization: Expedient Access to Bridged Bicyclic Alkene</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced intramolecular crossed [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of allene&#8208;tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes was reported in this paper. The reactions were conducted under mild conditions using Iridium(III) catalyst FirPic as a photosensitizer for energy transfer, affording bridged bicyclic alkenes in moderate to good yields with excellent regioselectivity and stereoselectivity through the regulation of substituents at the olefin's terminal position. Meanwhile, the computational study explained the special region control assisted by sulfonyl radicals in detail.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization Amination of Propargylamine and 1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A novel and efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization amination of propargylamines and 1,3&#8208;dienes is reported for the first time, yielding a series of chloromethylene pyrrolidines with high efficiency and excellent selectivity. This method was successfully applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and drug molecules, providing molecular backbones with potential applications. The reaction was shown to achieve regioselective modulation of the product molecules through the resonance between the solvent and allylpalladium. Additionally, the E&#8208;form products were found to be thermodynamically stable.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Cascade Synthesis of 5&#8208;Alkylidene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;Lactams via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Hydro&#8208;Oxycarbonylation</title>

Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrofunctionalization of alkynes and, more precisely, the intramolecular hydro&#8208;oxycarbonylation (cycloisomerization) of acetylenic acids, has been widely employed as a key step in cascade processes for the construction of valuable and complex molecules. However, in contrast with other aminonucleophiles, no method has been reported for the reaction between primary monoamines and non&#8208;activated alkynoic acids. Hence, a procedure has been devised for the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective preparation of 5&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams via a copper&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction between alkynoic acids and amines. The developed protocol proves to be scalable and demonstrates significant tolerance to a wide range of structurally diverse alkynoic acids and amines bearing various functional groups, as evidenced by 60 high&#8208;yielding examples. An exhaustive experimental and computational analysis of the reaction is also provided to unravel the nature and role of the copper catalyst, the observed regioselectivity and the mechanism of the reaction.

         <title>Divergent Hydroelementation of Unsaturated C&#8722;C Bonds Using 3d Transition Metal Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Divergent hydroelementation reactions offer a cost&#8208;effective synthetic protocol to prepare two or more products starting from same set of reactant molecules by altering one or more reaction parameters. This strategy is quite helpful in functionalizing unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds into several value&#8208;added chemical compounds by using various organic and metal&#8208;based catalysts. In this regard, catalysts derived from 3d metals have come to the fore, providing an alternative to heavier transition metals and rare&#8208;earth elements. In this review, we summarize and elucidate the recent developments of divergent hydroelementation of alkenes and alkynes using the first&#8208;row transition metal complexes by categorizing them into three classes: (1) Catalyst and ligand&#8208;controlled; (2) Reaction component&#8208;controlled and (3) Substrate&#8208;controlled. Given the importance of hydroelementation reactions, we hope this review will be helpful to the organic chemistry community.

         <title>Multifunctionalization of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Boranes by a Single Metal&#8208;free Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Selective access to densely functionalized boranes, with identical or distinct functional groups at the boron center, has great potentials in materials science, organic synthesis and drug discovery. However, assembling multifunctional boranes was heavily dependent on hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (HAT) at high temperatures, hazardous radical initiators, metal photocatalysts and HAT reagents, respectively. Simultaneously, competitive side reactions such as polymerizations and regioisomers formation remain highly challenging. Herein, a programmable multifunctionalization of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) boranes is developed for the first time powered by a single, metal&#8208;free photocatalyst, in which boryl radicals from sequential substituted boranes are generated instead of polymerizations. This robust and versatile catalytic system leads to an extremely broad variety of boranes incorporated with diverse alkyl or alkenyl groups in high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities.

&lt;p&gt;Selective access to densely functionalized boranes, with identical or distinct functional groups at the boron center, has great potentials in materials science, organic synthesis and drug discovery. However, assembling multifunctional boranes was heavily dependent on hydrogen-atom-transfer (HAT) at high temperatures, hazardous radical initiators, metal photocatalysts and HAT reagents, respectively. Simultaneously, competitive side reactions such as polymerizations and regioisomers formation remain highly challenging. Herein, a programmable multifunctionalization of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) boranes is developed for the first time powered by a single, metal-free photocatalyst, in which boryl radicals from sequential substituted boranes are generated instead of polymerizations. This robust and versatile catalytic system leads to an extremely broad variety of boranes incorporated with diverse alkyl or alkenyl groups in high chemo- and regioselectivities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzymatic Asymmetric Synthesis of All Stereoisomers of Aliphatic, Vicinal Diols in Conventional and Non&#8208;Conventional Media</title>

Abstract
Chiral, vicinal diols are of high interest for academic research and industrial applications. For synthesizing chiral diols, enzymes are important catalysts due to their high selectivity and ability to work under tolerable temperature and no pressure. In this study, two consecutive enzyme&#8208;catalyzed steps were used for the asymmetric synthesis of aliphatic, vicinal diols with high product concentrations and chiral purity. The reaction comprised a ligation step employing lyases and a subsequent reduction step using oxidoreductases. Either in an aqueous buffer or an organic solvent, the potentially biobased aldehydes acetaldehyde, propanal, butanal, and pentanal were used as substrates. Here, all possible stereoisomers of 2,3&#8208;butanediol, 3,4&#8208;hexanediol, 4,5&#8208;octanediol, and 5,6&#8208;decanediol were produced with isomeric content values between 72% and &gt;99%, and concentrations between 4.1 and 115&#8197;mM. This work shows how four symmetric, chiral, vicinal diols can be synthesized by combining enzymes in a modular way, including exemplarily scaling.

         <title>Photoinduced Hydrogen Atom Transfer Activation of Benzylic C&#8722;H Bonds Functionalization</title>

Abstract
Visible light, as an efficient and renewable resource, has gained significant attention in organic synthesis due to its mild, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly nature. Among the various photocatalytic processes, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) has become a crucial mechanism for the activation of C&#8722;H bonds, with a particular focus on the functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. This review shows recent developments in the area of photoinduced HAT and its use in benzylic C&#8722;H bonds functionalization. We discuss halogen atom radicals, N&#8208;centered radical, O&#8208;centered radical, S&#8208;centered radical and C&#8208;centered radical in HAT processes, and influence on reaction selectivity and substrate versatility. The potential of photoinduced HAT to bypass the need for transition metal catalysts and directing groups positions it as a promising approach for constructing intricate organic molecules with high atom economy and sustainability. This review aims to offer a detailed summary of the current state of photoinduced HAT, providing insights into its potential uses in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aminoquinazolines through I2&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of 2&#8208;Aminoaryl Ketone Oximes and Isocyanides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
An I2/cumene hydroperoxide (CHP)&#8208;mediated tandem cyclization of 2&#8208;aminoaryl ketone oximes with isocyanides has been developed. Various 2&#8208;aminoquinazolines were obtained in 49&#8211;96% yields under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, and the resulting 4&#8208;phenylquinazolin&#8208;2&#8208;amines show typical fluorescent emission properties. The key to the success of this strategy involves the formation of iminyl radical via the N&#8722;O bond cleavage of hydroxy oxime.

Abstract
Phosphorus Fluoride Exchange (PFEx) is a new click chemistry technology that hinges on the creation of innovative hubs to unlock its potential and broaden its applications. In this study, we outline some guiding principles for PFEx hub development and validate these principles by developing a new hub, 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyclotriphosphazenes (SACPs). These SACPs serve as versatile PFEx hubs with stable functionality and orthogonal reactivity, exemplifying their utility within the Diversity Oriented Clicking (DOC) framework. We demonstrate that SACPs interact with various 1,3&#8208;dipoles, enabling the synthesis of phosphorus&#8208;rich compounds through sequential cycloaddition and PFEx reactions, thus pioneering new synthetic routes for wide application of click chemistry.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The latest insights into multiply selective Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) reactions is presented, where a chiral&#8208;cavity&#8208;structured Lewis&#8208;acidic boron catalyst is employed. The catalyst ((R)&#8208;1) is capable of recognizing both dienes and dienophiles, primarily due to the influence of the suitable steric factors of its cavity. By taking advantage of the structural and exo&#8208;product&#8208;inducing properties of (R)&#8208;1, even in the presence of a mixture of inseparable dienes, the target products were successfully obtained in high yield with high enantioselectivity. As (R)&#8208;1 exhibited the capacity to differentiate between three&#8208;dimensional isomeric transition&#8208;state structures in DA reactions, this work contributes to the advancement of artificial enzyme&#8208;like catalysis, which has so far remained elusive.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Unsymmetrical Synthesis of Diaryl 1, 2&#8208;Diketones from Terminal Alkynes/ Alkenes and Aryl Halides under the Formate&#8208;Air&#8208;DMSO Condition</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method has been developed for the synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical aryl 1, 2&#8208;diketones at room temperature, without the need for transition metals or photocatalysts. This protocol employs aromatic terminal alkynes or alkenes to react with aryl iodides under conditions involving formate, air,  and DMSO. Mechanistic studies indicate that formate, air, and DMSO are all necessary conditions, and that the highly reactive carbon dioxide radical anion (CO2&#8226;&#8722;) generated under these conditions plays a key role in the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Co(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective C&#8208;H Dienylation of Indolines and Indoles with Allenyl Carbinol Acetates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective C7&#8208;H dienylation of indolines at room temperature employing allenyl carbinol acetate as an efficient dienylating reagent. The reaction proceeds via C&#8208;H activation, regioselective 2,1&#8208;migratory insertion of the allene followed by &#946;&#8208;acetate elimination, resulting in a diverse array of C7&#8208;dienylated indolines. The methodology was further extended to C2&#8208;H dienylation of indoles, affording either branched or linear dienes, contingent on the nature of the substituent present at the allenylic carbon. In addition, hydroarylation of allenes was also successfully achieved with tri&#8208;substituted allenes, which was elusive so far under cobalt catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>&#947;&#8208;Terpinene: Biorenewable Reductant for the Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Reduction of Sulfoxides, N&#8208;Oxides and Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenation of sulfoxides, pyridine and quinoline N&#8208;oxides, N&#8208;hydroxybenzotriazoles, as well as the reduction of nitroarenes to anilines, has been developed using monocyclic terpenes such as &#947;&#8208;terpinene as an environmentally benign hydrogen surrogate. The only byproducts generated are water and p&#8208;cymene, under neat reaction conditions in which the terpene acts as both solvent and reducing agent. These features make this approach a highly attractive and sustainable alternative for the reduction of S&#8722;O and N&#8722;O containing compounds. Additionally, the reaction exhibited excellent chemoselectivity, tolerating a wide variety of functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Electrochemical Dehalogenative Carboxylation without a Sacrificial Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A scalable electrochemical procedure for the synthesis of carboxylic acids from organic halides has been developed using a spinning cylinder electrode electrochemical reactor. The electrochemical process is based on the reductive dehalogenation of the starting material followed by trapping of the resulting carbanion with CO2. The protocol is compatible both with organic chlorides and bromides and uses inexpensive graphite and stainless steel as electrode materials. As sacrificial metal anodes are avoided, the method can be readily scaled up in flow mode. The procedure is compatible with a wide range of substrates (24 examples), including aryl and alkyl halides as well as heterocyclic compounds. Multigram scale preparations in flow mode have been demonstrated by processing 600 mL of reaction mixture in an electrolyte recirculation setup.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual HATs&#8208;mediated Catalyst&#8208;free sp3 C&#8208;H Bond Functionalization for Regioselective Radical Hydroalkylation of Ynazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct hydroalkylation of ynazoles, facilitating the efficient synthesis of linear N&#8208;&#946;&#8208;vinylazoles, is accomplished through the functionalization of sp3 C&#8208;H bonds using trace amounts of dioxygen as an initiator. This reagent&#8208;free method eliminates the need for exogenous reagents and proceeds through a radical chain mechanism involving dual hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes. Its application potential is exemplified through the implementation of scale&#8208;up operations.</dc:description>

         <title>NFSI&#8208;TEMPO Catalysed Stereoselective Synthesis of 2&#8208;Deoxyglycosides from Glycals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;deoxyglycosides are prominent constituents of diverse naturally occurring glycans and are known to participate in crucial biological pathways. We herein demonstrate NFSI&#8208;TEMPO as an efficient organocatalyst for the formation of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glycosides from glycals. For the first time a catalytic behaviour of NFSI&#8208;TEMPO combination has been observed. The reaction conditions have been found suitable for the generation of glycosides from commercial alcohols, amino acid, sterol, phenols and monosaccharide derived alcohols. Broad range of protecting groups on both glycal and glycosyl acceptors as well as alcohols of varied reactivity were found to be compatible for the generation of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glycosides in moderate to good yields. The synthetic potential of the newly established transformation was illustrated by application in trisaccharide synthesis and gram&#8208;scale reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Engineering of Oleate Hydratase for the Synthesis of Small Chiral Alcohols without Decoy Molecule</title>

Abstract
Small and chiral secondary alcohols are sought&#8208;after compounds that are frequently used in the synthesis of biologically active compounds. However, their stereochemically correct synthesis remains a challenge for the chemical industry. Synthetic routes are restrained by multiple steps and thus low atom efficiency. Here we employ engineered variants from the oleate hydratase from E. meningoseptica to produce chiral C5&#8208;C8 secondary alcohols within a single step. First, we established a two&#8208;phase system (2&#8208;PS) to trap the volatile substrates/products which facilitated semi&#8208;rational mutagenesis in the active site and tunnel of the enzyme. These efforts led to variants with an up to 20&#8208;fold increase in catalytic activity and &gt;99% ee, notably, without the use of a decoy molecule. Computational analysis indicated structural changes in the tunnel radius, ligand transport and energy profiles, which gave us hints to explain the enhanced performance of the variants. Interestingly, scaling up the reaction volume demonstrated significant increases in product concentrations, leading up to a 100&#8208;fold increase in comparison to the current benchmark. This new 2&#8208;PS and the engineered enzyme variants offer a promising approach for a scalable, asymmetric hydration of small unactivated alkenes, which would drastically ease the access to chiral alcohol&#8208;based pheromones or drugs.

         <title>Organophotocatalytic Site&#8208;Selective Radical Deuteration at Sterically Hindered Benzylic Positions by Consecutive Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond activation or exchange labeling with hydrogen isotope are of vital importance, in particular for high&#8208;specific&#8208;selectivity deuteration of pharmaceuticals. While catalytic approaches relying on closed&#8208;shell manifolds have been well documented for efficient delivery of deuterium at sterically less hindered benzylic positions, complementary strategies target sterically bulky benzylic positions remain a long&#8208;standing challenge. We herein disclose a mild, versatile approach to achieve efficient and selective radical deuteration by merging organophotoredox catalysis and bromine radical catalysis. This open&#8208;shell strategy provides the unparalleled ability of the convergent unification of readily available quinoxalinones and para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) and D2O through a simultaneous highly cross&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and chem&#8208;selective radical coupling&#8208;H/D exchange approach. Furthermore, the long&#8208;standing challenge of the incorporation of deuterium to sterically bulky benzylic positions has been addressed through this approach.

         <title>Photoredox Hydroacylative Dearomatization of Indoles with Aromatic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein we reported for the first time a photocatalytic dearomative hydroacylation reaction of electron&#8208;deficient indoles with readily available aromatic acids through a phosphoranyl radical&#8208;assisted deoxygenative process. A range of racemic and optically active 2&#8208;acylindoline derivatives were obtained in good yields (up to 94%) with good diastereoselectivity. The synthetic robustness is highlighted by the enantioselective dearomatization of indoles and the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and pharmaceutical molecules. This protocol features broad substrate scope and mild reaction conditions, providing a reliable entry to developing deoxygenative strategies in dearomatization reactions. Preliminary mechanistic studies and DFT calculations suggest that a Giese&#8208;type radical addition pathway should be involved.

         <title>Disclosing the Intra&#8208;Catalyst Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in Tetrahydropyran&#8208;Based Dipeptidic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we describe how minor structural modifications to our bifunctional organocatalysts based on sugar amino acids (SAAs) can alter the network of non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) within the catalyst, leading to significant changes in their catalytic activity. This is attributed to the intra&#8208;catalyst NCIs, which induce conformational changes that are reflected in the transition state of the rate&#8208;determining step of the Michael addition of aldehydes to trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes. Through kinetic experiments, conformational analysis, and DFT calculations, we found that the presence of a methoxy group at the C4 position of the tetrahydropyran ring reduces the catalytic activity by a factor of five compared to the catalyst without the methoxy group. Additionally, we have identified the different intra&#8208;catalyst NCIs, both attractive and repulsive, that drive the conformational changes, ultimately modifying the energy levels of the transition states of the rate&#8208; and enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step of the reaction.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;C Coupling of Alkenyl Boronates and Bromodifluoroacetates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The reaction of alkenyl boronates and bromodifluoroacetates in the presence of copper powder and TMEDA as the catalytic system was developed. The corresponding C&#8722;C coupling products were obtained in 35&#8211;93% yield. The method tolerated a variety of functional groups, namely, phenol, (thio)ether, protected amino&#8208;, hydroxy&#8208;, ketone, and carboxylic acid moieties, as well as various saturated carbo&#8208; and heterocycles, and was compatible with multigram scale&#8208;up (to 76&#8197;g). The diastereoselectivity of the process was typically low so that ca. 1:1 E/Z isomeric mixtures were formed from pure E or Z alkenyl boronates. Further functional group transformations demonstrated the utility of the prepared compounds as valuable building blocks for synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Based on the obtained results and the literature data, a plausible reaction mechanism was proposed involving the formation of radical and organocopper intermediates.

Abstract
A series of 3,5&#8208;diaryl&#8208;4&#8208;selanylisoxazoles were synthesized in 56&#8211;97% yields (most cases&gt;80% yield), which was first accomplished via bromide&#8208;catalyzed selenylation of 2&#8208;alkyn&#8208;1&#8208;one O&#8208;methyloximes using element Se and boronic acids as the selenyl source. Compared to traditional strategies, this method proceeded under simple catalytic system. Broad substrate scope, good functional group compatibility, metal&#8208;free conditions, and easy operation was showed in this protocol. Additionally, this method was easily amendable to gram&#8208;scale reaction and synthetic transformations. Furthermore, preliminary mechanistic experiments demonstrated that a radical pathway was possibly involved in this work.

         <title>Selective Synthesis of 2&#8208;(Indol&#8208;3&#8208;Yl)Phenols via Iodine&#8208;Catalyzed C3&#8208;Arylation of Indoles with Cyclohexanones</title>

Abstract
An iodine&#8208;catalyzed C3&#8208;arylation of indoles with cyclohexanones to selectively synthesize 2&#8208;(indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenols has been described. Mechanism studies indicate that the oxygen atom in 2&#8208;(indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenols is originally from DMSO. This cascade involving dehydration condensation, selective oxygenation, dehydrogenation, and aromatization was achieved in one pot under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Organoselenyl Quinolines through the Reduction of Alkynes Mediated by Electrophilic Organoselenium Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A methodology for the synthesis and functionalization of quinolines was developed. This approach involves the cyclization of 2&#8208;amino arylalkynyl ketones to 3&#8208;(organoselanyl)&#8208;4&#8208;iodoquinolines through a sequential reaction pathway. The process includes: (i) in&#8197;situ formation of an electrophilic organoselenyl species, (ii) activation of the alkyne&#8216;s carbon&#8208;carbon bond via a seleniranium ion intermediate, (iii) anti&#8208;nucleophilic attack of iodide on the activated triple bond, and (iv) subsequent condensation. The resulting 3&#8208;(organoselanyl)&#8208;4&#8208;iodoquinolines were demonstrated to be versatile substrates, efficiently undergoing Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling to produce 4&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;quinolines and Ullmann&#8208;type reactions to yield the corresponding sulfides. Furthermore, the 4&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;quinolines were readily converted into selenophene derivatives via halogen&#8208;promoted electrophilic cyclization, highlighting the broad applicability of the developed method.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Difluoroalkylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds with Trimethylsilyl Chloride as a Dual&#8208;Function Reagent</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a mild, operationally simple method for synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroketones through selective single defluorination of trifluoroketones and subsequent difluoroalkylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds at room temperature within a single step. By successfully difluoroalkylating unfunctionalized ethers and benzyl radical precursors, we demonstrated the broad applicability of this method. The mechanistic study supports that the success of the reaction is probably attributed to the dual roles of trimethylsilyl chloride under the photocatalyzed conditions: 1) fluoride anion scavenger; and 2) chlorine radical source which promote hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction.

         <title>Research Progress on Organocatalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Atropisomeric Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The burgeoning field of asymmetric catalysis has significantly advanced the construction of axially chiral compounds, recognized for their distinct three&#8208;dimensional structures that are relevant in drug discovery, catalyst design and material science. Particularly, the atropisomeric aldehydes, characterized by a chiral axis and the presence of an aldehyde functionality, are of increasing value and interest in chemistry&#8208;related domains, such as serving as privileged chiral catalysts for activation of amines. In recent years, elegant environmentally&#8208;friendly metal&#8208;free catalytic asymmetric methodologies based on de novo formation of (hetero)aromatic rings, dynamic kinetic resolution and desymmetrization have been established to build this fascinating class of atropisomers. In this review, we would like to highlight recent research progress on enantioselective synthesis of atropisomeric aldehydes by means of organocatalysis and biocatalysis, including their scopes, limitations, mechanisms, synthetic applications and provide some insights into future development.

Abstract
Owing to multiple reactive sites, such as an acidic &#945;&#8208;carbon and an isocyano group, isocyanide esters can successfully participate in the synthesis of various five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles through the cycloaddition reactions under metal&#8208;catalyzed systems. Considering the unique and versatile functionality of this synthon, in this review, we have highlighted silver and copper&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions of isocyanide esters over the last decade.

Abstract
A variety of structurally diverse spirocyclohexane oxindoles featuring a quaternary carbon centre have been successfully constructed through an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation of isatin&#8208;derived enals with &#945;&#8208;cyano&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methylenones. This domino process exhibits a wide substrate tolerance, operates under mild conditions, and yields products with high enantioselectivities.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;powder&#8208;mediated tandem hydroamination cyclization&#8211;hydrocyanation of alkyne&#8208;tethered ketoximes is described by using TMSCN as a commercially available cyanating reagent. This methodology provides an alternative strategy for the synthesis of a series of structurally important cyano&#8208;substituted cyclic nitrones. The hydrocyanation process exhibits distinct regioselectivity depending on the substituent pattern of the alkyne moiety. Moreover, the synthesized products were shown to be capable of undergoing various derivatization reactions.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Acyl and Thiocyano Pyridylation of Alkenes with Aldehyde and NH4SCN</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
&#946;&#8208;pyridinyl ketones and &#946;&#8208;pyridinyl thiocyanates are commonly used as an essential organic synthesis intermediate and widely present in various drug molecules and bioactive molecules. Herein, a photoredox catalyzed acyl and thiocyano pyridylation of alkenes with aldehydes and NH4SCN via HAT and SET strategy respectively is described. This protocol employs more readily accessible aldehydes and NH4SCN as radical precursors under redox&#8208;neutral conditions. Moreover, high atom economy, simple and accessible starting materials, late&#8208;stage modification and wide substrate scope including primary, secondary alkyl aldehydes and aromatic aldehydes enable the potential application in the organic synthesis.

Abstract
An approach for the synthesis of quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diamines is reported using a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction of o&#8208;phenylenediamines and isocyanides. Various quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diamines could be obtained in 25%&#8211;95% yields at 100&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8197;h. The key to the success of this protocol involves the formation of two C&#8722;N and one C&#8722;C bonds via the double insertion of isocyanide.

         <title>Efficient Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Alkylation and Application in the Total Synthesis of Phallotoxins and Virotoxins</title>

Abstract
Asymmetric alkylation is one of the most important methods for synthesis of chiral unnatural &#945;&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;amino acids. Herein, we reported the asymmetric alkylation catalyzed by Cu/(4S,2R)&#8208;tBu&#8208;Phosferrox catalyst. This catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic performance in the asymmetric alkylation at catalyst loading as low as 1.0&#8197;mol %, giving the desired products with up to 95% yield and &gt;99% ee, which is the best result to date. Furthermore, this method was successfully applied to the scalable practical synthesis of unnatural amino acid 4,5&#8208;OH&#8208;Leu, which could be directly used in the total syntheses of phalloidin, phallacidin, other four phallotoxins and six virotoxins.

         <title>Decyanative Arylation via Radical Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Arenes, especially heteroarenes, are crucial structural motifs in organic chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, and materials science. The introduction of (hetero)aryl groups using readily available feedstocks to modify organic chemicals is a significant topic. Nitriles are ubiquitous and versatile building blocks in organic synthesis. This review summarizes recent advances in decyanative arylation via radical cross&#8208;coupling reactions. In these transformations, (hetero)aromatic nitriles undergo one&#8208;electron reduction to form persistent radical anion intermediates. Simultaneously, transient carbon centered radicals are generated through cleavage of C&#8722;H, C&#8722;C, C&#8722;X (where X=B, N, Si, S, Br) bonds through single electron transfer or hydrogen atom transfer processes. Finally, a radical&#8208;radical coupling reaction followed by CN elimination leads to the formation of aromatized products.

         <title>Manganese Promoted Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Phosphine Chlorides with Disulfides for the Synthesis of Thiophosphanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein we reported a manganese promoted reductive cross&#8208;coupling approach to construct P&#8722;S bond. This is a practical method for the synthesis of mono&#8208;thiophosphanes, bis&#8208;thiophosphanes and tri&#8208;thiophosphanes under mild conditions. The strategy featured a wide range of substrate scope including various disulfides and phosphine chlorides, constructing diverse sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds from inodorous and readily available starting materials. The employment of reductive conditions avoided the generation of phosphorothioates (PV) by&#8208;products. Ultimately, gram&#8208;scale synthesis and applications were explored. Extensive experiments indicated that the phosphine radical cascade process was involved in the catalytic cycle.

Abstract
Herein, we report regiodivergent nucleophilic attack of Grignard reagents to 2&#8208;alkynyl aziridines. Under the catalysis of a Cu(I)&#8208;diphosphine complex, benzylic Grignard reagents add to the carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond of the aziridines to deliver &#945;&#8208;allenylamines in moderate to excellent yields; the direct addition of the Grignard reagents to the aziridines in the absence of catalyst provided homopropargylic amine derivatives. Both reactions could proceed in highly enantiospecific ways. Further synthetic manipulations of these products enable rapid access to diverse useful heterocyclic molecular scaffolds.

Abstract
Here, we present an innovative approach to achieve Minisci&#8208;type alkylation of cyclic N&#8208;ketimines, enabling access to a diverse range of valuable alkylated sulfonyl ketimines via iron hydride hydrogen atom transfer. More than 35 examples are shown with a wide range of substrates. Additionally, this system is easy to operate and can be efficiently scaled up. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the alkyl radical process involved and the air acts as the sole oxidant in this system.

         <title>Mechanochemical Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of In&#8208;Situ Generated Reformatsky Zn&#8208;Enolates</title>

Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;arylations of carbonyl compounds have shown to be a useful strategy for the late&#8208;stage synthesis of &#945;&#8208;arylesters. However, the use of strong basic conditions and difficult handling necessary for the in&#8208;situ preparation of enolates is a major disadvantage. On the other hand, using Reformatsky zinc&#8208;enolates can overcome these challenges. Moreover, mechanochemical in&#8208;situ activation of zinc is even more beneficial. Herein, we report mechanochemical Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling between in&#8208;situ generated Reformatsky Zn&#8208;enolates and aryl halides. This operationally simple procedure affords &#945;&#8208;arylated esters or amides using an affordable catalytic system. Reactions were carried under air and ambient conditions using granulated zinc without the need for its pre&#8208;activation. Less reactive and commercially more affordable aryl bromides afforded the desired products in good to excellent yields in comparison to aryl iodides. The optimized conditions were applied in scale&#8208;up reaction and in the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;arylated esters, amides, and derivatives of natural products.

Abstract
A copper and DMAP relay&#8208;catalyzed strategy has been achieved for the modular synthesis of 2&#8208;alkoxy quinolines from a three&#8208;component coupling of terminal alkynes, anthranils, and alcohols. In this protocol, a novel quinoline pyridine salt is formed and serves as a key intermediate in the formation of 2&#8208;alkoxy quinolines. The reaction has a broad substrate scope of each reaction partners, affording diversified 2&#8208;alkoxy quinoline products in generally good yields.

         <title>Regioselective Hydrothiolation of Terminal Alkynes using Half&#8208;Sandwich Ni(ii) Catalysts bearing Bidentate NHC&#8208;Carboxylate Ligands</title>

Abstract
A half&#8208;sandwich nickel complex containing an NHC&#8208;carboxylate chelate ligand (i.&#8201;e., [Ni(&#951;5&#8208;Cp)(&#954;2&#8208;C,O&#8208;NHC)]) derived from the (S)&#8208;leucine has been identified for the selective hydrothiolation of terminal acetylenes toward challenging Markovnikov&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;vinyl thioethers, even with aryl alkynes. The activity and selectivity exhibited by the nickel complex are comparable, if not superior, to those of complexes of rhodium reported to be the best catalysts to date for the Markovnikov addition in the thiol&#8208;yne reaction. The experimental data are consistent with the participation of the coordinated carboxylate group in the catalytic reaction as an intermolecular acid&#8208;base co&#8208;catalyst, favoring the formation of nickel&#8208;thiolate intermediates.

Abstract
The visible light&#8208;induced one&#8208;pot tandem photolysis of areneazo&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;nitro)propanes was achieved to give carbazole and indole derivatives. The aryl azidation followed by an intramolecular C&#8722;H amination smoothly proceeded under visible light irradiation without any photocatalyst, demonstrating the synthetic versatility of areneazo&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;nitro)propanes. The in&#8197;situ generation of aryl azide intermediates was executed under mild visible light photolysis conditions, showcasing the synthetic versatility of areneazo&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;nitro)propanes, a safe alternative of diazonium salts.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Nitroalkanes with Aliphatic Grignard/Cerium and Organozinc Reagents for Synthesis of Functionalized Nitrones</title>

Abstract
This study aims to develop a more efficient, functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant approach using stable nitroalkanes and reductive coupling reactions with aliphatic Grignard/cerium and organozinc reagents. The treatment of nitroalkanes with aliphatic Grignard reagents in the presence of a catalytic amount of CuF2 and stoichiometric amount of CeCl3 affords various nitrones in good yields as single isomers. The reaction of tertiary nitroalkanes with organozinc reagents affords various functionalized nitrones without CuF2 or CeCl3. These reductive coupling reactions proceed without the loss of functional groups such as alkene, alkyne, benzyl ether, chlorine, ester, and nitrile moieties. Nitrones can also be used as precursors for [3+2] cyclizations with electron&#8208;withdrawing alkenes and alkynes.

         <title>Three&#8208; and Seven&#8208;membered Annulenones as a Lewis Base Catalyst for Enantioselective meso&#8208;Epoxide Opening</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
This is the report on the Lewis base catalysis of annulenones. Additionally, the synthesis of chiral annulenone catalysts and their application in asymmetric ring&#8208;opening reactions of meso&#8208;epoxides is shown. Annulenones, such as cyclopropenones and tropones, function as Lewis bases owing to their inherent polarity caused by aromaticity, resulting in the activation of silicon tetrachloride, which catalyzes the ring&#8208;opening reaction of meso&#8208;epoxides. Moreover, various chiral annulenone catalysts have been designed and synthesized, and microwave irradiation has been shown to improve the synthetic efficiency of chiral tropones. The chiral annulenones successfully catalyzed the asymmetric ring&#8208;opening reaction of meso&#8208;epoxides, resulting in the formation of 1,2&#8208;chlorohydrins in a high yield and high enantioselectivity (up to 90% ee in 96% yield). These results represent the example of three&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered annulenones as a chiral Lewis base catalyst.

Abstract
In this paper, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition has been revealed to synthesize the bishomocubanone derivatives in moderate to excellent yield under mild conditions. This method demonstrated a broad substrate scope and excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, affording cubane precursors and a series of bishomocubanones. Meanwhile, a hundred&#8208;gram scale experiment of this method has been employed to synthesize cubane precursors with 98% yield.

         <title>Diverse Synthesis of Azoles: Construction of ortho&#8208;Azidotetrazoles/Triazoletetrazoles through N&#8722;N Cleavage of 2H&#8208;Indazoles</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a conceptually new, general, and efficient approach for the synthesis of valuable ortho&#8208;azido&#8208;1,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole and one&#8208;pot synthesis of ortho&#8208;triazoletetrazole derivatives mainly via PIDA mediated N&#8722;N cleavage of the azole ring of 2H&#8208;indazoles using TMSN3. This current methodology represents an array of unsymmetrical ortho&#8208;azidotetrazole and ortho&#8208;triazoletetrazole derivatives with wide functional group tolerance in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. The practical utility of this reaction was showcased through successful scale&#8208;up synthesis and a variety of subsequent derivatizations of ortho&#8208;azidotetrazole products. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the reaction proceeds through a radical pathway.

Abstract
The manuscript describes a formal [10+2] higher&#8208;order cycloaddition between 2&#8208;arylideneindan&#8208;1&#8208;ones and &#945;&#8208;alkylidene azlactones as higherene precursors and higherenofiles respectively. The reaction is realized under Br&#248;nsted&#8208;base catalysis utilizing the phase transfer catalysis approach. The key intermediate is an isobenzofulvene&#8208;derived polyenolate which acts as a 10&#8208;electron component in the higher&#8208;order cycloaddition. By using this strategy, a series of structurally diverse compounds containing a polycyclic hydrocarbon scaffold was prepared in 79&#8211;99% yields. In addition, the potential of the obtained [10+2]&#8208;cycloadducts has been confirmed by transformations, including the synthesis of a highly&#8208;valuable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted N&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;aminoester.

Abstract
This work provides an in&#8208;depth analysis of the factors governing the different reaction pathways in the acid&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of gem&#8208;vinylsilyl alcohols with aldehydes. The study evaluates the impact of both the ligands attached to silicon and the choice of the Lewis acid on the reaction outcome. Additionally, computational studies offer valuable insights into the mechanism that control these distinct pathways. The process enables the chemo&#8208; and stereocontrolled formation of a variety of structural frameworks, offering significant potential for the generation of a broad range of molecular architectures.

Abstract
Herein, we report a novel and practical strategy to access &#945;&#8208;chloroketones from esters bearing diverse (hetero)aromatic, aliphatic, alkynyl and alkenyl substituents with transient chloromethyllithium under continuous flow conditions. This highly chemoselective method enables a fast (on a time scale of &lt;5 s), efficient and straightforward access to a broad substrate scope (up to 99% yield) with a remarkable throughput of &#8764;10.6 g/h.

         <title>Photoinduced Cu&#8208;Catalyzed C2&#8208;H Functionalization of Azoles using Aryl Thianthrenium Salts</title>

Abstract
Development of a mild approach for the highly efficient synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl azoles, which are typically synthesized using high temperature, ligands and preactivated substrates, is highly desirable. Here, we report a mild and efficient photo&#8208;induced Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling to obtain C2&#8208;functionalized azoles using aryl thianthrenium salt (Ar&#8208;TTs). The reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope and an excellent functional group compatibility and serves as an ideal strategy for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals. Additionally, this method enables the efficient synthesis of azole&#8208;based polycyclic compounds.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Aliphatic &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids by Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Hydroamination&#8208;Hydrodesulfurisation</title>

Abstract
Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) enzymes have been extensively exploited to produce differently substituted arylalanine analogues, but their use in the stereoselective synthesis of aliphatic fatty amino acids has never been addressed. In this work, a two&#8208;step hydroamination&#8208;hydrodesulfurisation process has been investigated for the production of aliphatic L&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids from thienylacrylic acids, easily accessible by condensation from the corresponding arylaldehydes. Wild&#8208;type PALs from Planctomyces brasiliensis and Streptomyces rimosus were selected as the most promising candidates and improved by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, thus unlocking the hydroamination of a broad panel of 10 different thienylacrylic acids bearing aliphatic and aromatic substituents. The subsequent hydrodesulfurisation step, accomplished by means of inexpensive Raney nickel in mild conditions and aqueous medium, afforded the corresponding aliphatic &#945;&#8208;amino acids in 10&#8211;63% overall isolated yield and perfect enantiopurity. This chemo&#8208;enzymatic process represents the first example of aliphatic amino acid production using PALs, circumventing a major limitation of those biocatalysts.

         <title>Recent Advances in Photoredox/Chromium dual&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonyl Addition Reactions: A Review</title>

Abstract
The chromium&#8208;catalysed Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama&#8208;Kishi (NHK) reaction is a very dependable technique for alcohol synthesis and is extensively used in the complete synthesis of natural compounds. The majority of these reactions occur via a reductive&#8208;radical&#8208;polar crossover (RRPCO) mechanism, which is crucial for the transformation of reactive radical intermediates. The production of radicals using photoinduced catalytic reactions is now among the most effective approaches. The photoinduced chromium&#8208;catalysed addition reaction to carbonyl compounds is an effective technique for alcohol synthesis that integrates the benefits of photocatalysis with chromium catalysis. Photocatalysis significantly enhances the diversity of radical production, hence broadening the substrate scope in the chromium&#8208;catalysed NHK reaction. This paper primarily examines the photoredox chromium dual&#8208;catalysed carbonyl addition process for alcohol synthesis, including numerous methods for radical generation.

         <dc:description>Described herein is the discovery of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed chlorocylization strategy for the synthesis of 3&#8209;chloroindoles tolerated with a wide range of functional groups in moderate to excellent yields. In this transformation, the solvent effect is so important that only THF presents the positive effect. Furthermore, the present method provides an essay access to the N&#8208;unprotected 3&#8208;chloroindoles. A mechanism study showed that 2&#8208;alkynlanilines were catalyzed by palladium to from corresponding indoles, followed by copper&#8208;mediated oxidation chlorination to deliver the 3&#8208;chloroindoles products.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deuterium&#8208;labeled compounds play a pivotal role in physical organic chemistry, life sciences, and materials science. This has resulted in a surge of interest in deuterium&#8208;labeled active pharmaceutical ingredients in recent years. In this study, we present a continuous flow Raney nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange process that boasts compatibility with a wide spectrum of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles and pharmaceutical compounds. The broad applicability of the developed method was demonstrated through successful labeling of various purine bases, imidazoles, pyridines, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including complex structures like abacavir and remdesivir. Control experiments revealed Raney nickel's crucial role in the exchange process, showcasing the superiority of the continuous flow approach over batch reactions. Furthermore, a scaled&#8208;up experiment demonstrated the robustness of the catalyst.</dc:description>
