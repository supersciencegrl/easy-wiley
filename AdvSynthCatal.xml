         <title>Deazaflavin&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation of White Phosphorus with Aryl Bromides and Chlorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 5&#8208;aryldeazaflavin photocatalyst o&#8208;Me&#8208;dFl catalyzes the arylation of white phosphorus with aryl chlorides and bromides under near UV&#8208;LED irradiation, affording triarylphosphines and tetraarylphosphonium salts. Nuclear magnetic resonance&#160;studies and density functional theory&#160;calculations offer insights into the reaction pathway.

A substantial improvement in the challenging photocatalytic arylation of white phosphorus (P4) with aryl chlorides and bromides is reported. Using the readily accessible deazaflavin&#8208;based photocatalyst o&#8208;Me&#8208;dFl, valuable triarylphosphines (PAr3) and tetraarylphosphonium salts ([PAr4]X, X&#8201;=&#8201;Br, Cl) are synthesized from P4 under near UV&#8208;LED (365&#8201;nm) irradiation in up to 87% combined yield with drastically reduced reaction times compared to previous protocols. 31P nuclear magnetic resonance&#160;spectroscopic monitoring studies and density functional theory calculations provide insights into the reaction pathway. The results represent an important step toward more atom&#8208;efficient and economical photocatalytic P4 functionalization reactions.

         <title>CO2 Conversion in Water Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water microdroplets significantly accelerate CO2 conversion reactions and enable otherwise unfavorable processes due to their unique physicochemical environment&#8212;characterized by strong interfacial effects, intrinsic electric fields, localized super acidic or basic conditions, radical formation, and enhanced reducing power.

Microdroplet chemistry is gaining recognition as a powerful tool and promising platform due to its unique physicochemical environment, suitable for a wide range of applications. When scaled down to the nano&#8208; or micrometer range, microdroplets possess a high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio and exhibit several distinctive properties, such as strong interfacial effects, electric fields, super acidic or basic environments, radical generation, and enhanced reducing power. These characteristics contribute to accelerated reaction rates and enable reactions that are otherwise unfavorable. This minireview explores and discusses the applications of microdroplet chemistry in CO2 conversion processes.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Directed Selectivity in Vinylcarbene Reactions: A Comparative Study of Ag, Rh, and Cu Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals that ligand stereoelectronic effects, rather than vinylogous electrophilicity, govern selectivity in Ag&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Cu&#8208;catalyzed vinylcarbene C(sp3)&#63743;H insertions. These insights guide the design of more selective catalysts for C&#63743;H functionalization.

A comprehensive mechanistic investigation is conducted to uncover the factors governing the selectivity of Ag, Rh, and Cu catalysts in vinylcarbene&#8208;mediated reactions. The study examines the preference for carbenic versus vinylogous C(sp3)&#63743;H bond insertion, highlighting the critical roles of the electronic and steric properties of transition metal catalysts. Contrary to previous assumptions that the enhanced electrophilic character of the vinylogous position in metal vinyl carbenes is the primary determinant, the findings demonstrate that the stereoelectronic effects of the ligand play a more dominant role. These insights inform the design of catalytic systems with tailored selectivity, advancing predictive catalysis and C&#63743;H bond functionalization.

         <title>Green&#8208;Light Photocatalytic Synthesis of Non&#8208;Proteinogenic Isothiocyanate&#8208;Decorated Amino Acids from Lysine Residues and Carbon Disulfide</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable and mild approach for the synthesis of unnatural isothiocyanate&#8208;decorated amino acids from lysine residues and carbon disulfide via green&#8208;light photocatalysis is presented. A series of pharmacologically interesting isothiocyanate&#8208;containing amino acids and oligopeptides is obtained through the desulfurization strategy with the wide tolerance of protected groups and amino acid residues, which can be further converted into thiocitrulline derivatives.

A sustainable and mild approach for the synthesis of nonproteinogenic isothiocyanate&#8208;decorated amino acids from lysine residues and carbon disulfide via green&#8208;light photocatalysis is described. A series of pharmacologically interesting isothiocyanate&#8208;containing amino acids and oligopeptides are synthesized for the first time through the desulfurization method with the wide tolerance of protected groups and amino acid residues.

&lt;p&gt;A sustainable and mild approach for the synthesis of unnatural isothiocyanate-decorated amino acids from lysine residues and carbon disulfide via green-light photocatalysis is presented. A series of pharmacologically interesting isothiocyanate-containing amino acids and oligopeptides is obtained through the desulfurization strategy with the wide tolerance of protected groups and amino acid residues, which can be further converted into thiocitrulline derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;

A doubly chemoselective and switchable diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of the indanedione&#8208;tethered benzofurans and &#946;&#8208;acylated arylidene indandiones is reported. The key features of this approach include chemoselective acylation by changing the addition sequence of acylating agents with distinct reactivities, and efficient control over the competition between catalytic and stoichiometric processes.

An efficient, chemoselective, and switchable diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of &#946;&#8208;acylated arylidene indandiones and the indanedione&#8208;based formal cross&#8208;coupling benzofuran adducts is reported, which is challenging to realize by conventional strategies. It is achieved via a chemoselective acylation by altering the addition sequence of acylating agents with distinct reactivities, followed by &#946;&#8208;acylation or chemoselective intramolecular Wittig reactions, with the in&#8201;situ&#8208;generated bis&#8208;acylated phosphorus ylides as the key intermediates.

         <title>Electrochemical [3+2] Cycloaddition to Access 5&#8208;Aryl(alkyl)thiotetrazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
5&#8208;Aryl(alkyl)thiotetrazoles were synthesized via an electrochemical three&#8208;component cascade reaction of thiophenols/thiols, isocyanides and azides.

An electrochemical three&#8208;component reaction of thiophenols/thiols, isocyanides and azides is developed. By using carbon felt (GF) as anode and platinum plate as cathode, a series of 5&#8208;aryl(alkyl)thiotetrazoles are obtained in moderate to good yields. The reaction is proposed to occur through cascade radical addition, oxidation, and [3+2] cycloaddition. The method could be further extended to the synthesis of 5&#8208;alkyl(aryl)selenyltetrazoles. The simple and mild reaction conditions, good substrate scope and scalability make this reaction have a good application prospect in organic synthesis.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Amide Synthesis from Alcohols: An Ammonia&#8208;Free Approach with Dihydrogen Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and selective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed method for synthesizing primary amides directly from alcohols, with the concurrent release of molecular hydrogen, is reported.

A highly efficient and selective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed method for synthesizing primary amides directly from alcohols, with the concurrent release of molecular hydrogen, is reported. The reaction proceeds through tandem dehydrogenative coupling, oxime ether and nitrile as intermediate using methoxyamine as the amine source. The present strategy simplifies traditional processes, offering a more direct route to primary amides. Mechanistic investigations are conducted to elucidate and support the proposed reaction pathway.

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Chloro and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Dichloro Acetamidines via the Carbenoids Addition to Inherently Low Electrophilic Carbodiimides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbodiimides act as competent electrophilic synthons for the chemoselective addition of lithium mono&#8208; and di&#8208;halocarbenoids. The transformation is provided through a single synthetic operation&#8212;hitherto elusive&#8212;halogenated acetamidines. Interestingly, the constitutively tamed electrophilicity of the starting materials is effectively counterbalanced by the usage of the highly reactive halogenated organolithiums.

The hitherto few explored &#945;&#8208;halomethyl amidine motif has been assembled through the addition of a lithiated (di)&#8208;halomethane (i.e., carbenoid) to easily accessible N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl&#8208;substituted carbodiimides. Despite the inherent low electrophilicity of these heterocumulenes&#8212;as quantitatively determined in Mayr's previous studies&#8212;their sp&#8208;hybridized carbon atom acts as a competent site of attack for these tamed nucleophiles. The overall high&#8208;yielding transformation featuring a genuine chemoselective profile&#8212;as documented by using variously functionalized materials&#8212;is adaptable to the addition of dihalogenated carbenoids. Reaction products could be advantageously used in nucleophilic substitution sequences as well as in further functionalization of the nitrogen atoms due to the constitutive heteroallyl&#8208;type skeleton.

         <title>Electrolyte&#8208;Free Electrochemical C3&#8208;Arylmethylation of Indoles with Tertiary/Secondary N&#8208;Methyl Anilines using N&#8208;Methyl as the Methylene Source</title>

         <dc:description>
This study presents an electrochemical C3&#8208;arylmethylation of indoles with tertiary/secondary N&#8208;methyl anilines using the N&#8208;methyl as the methylene donor to link indoles and anilines under electrolyte&#8208;, oxidant&#8208;, and catalyst&#8208;free conditions, producing various C3&#8208;arylmethylated indoles in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields after the cleavage of the C&#63743;N bond in presumed C3&#8208;aminomethylated indoles.

An electrochemical approach devoid of electrolytes, oxidants, metals, and light is established for the C3&#8208;arylmethylation of indoles using tertiary/secondary N&#8208;methyl anilines, demonstrating a wide substrate scope, with N&#8208;methyl serving as the methylene donor. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the presumed C3&#8208;aminomethylated indole acts as a reactive intermediate, facilitating the formation of the arylmethylated product via radical/electrophilic addition, anodic oxidation/deprotonation, fragmentation, and cathodic reduction/protonation processes.

Mechanistic studies suggest that rongalite may act as a precursor of a super electron donor to activate difluoromethyl bromides for C&#63743;C bond formation, as well as a source of protons to facilitate the cleavage of the C&#63743;F bond for C&#63742;O bond formation. The cascade reaction exhibits remarkable efficiency, broad substrate compatibility, and scalability. Moreover, the products can be further transformed into valuable heterocyclic structures and pharmacologically active compounds.

         <dc:description>
This review summarizes transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations of isocyanates via C(sp2)&#8208;H activation (2006&#8211;2025). It categorizes advances by substrate type, and provides a concise analysis of substrate scopes, limitations, molecular modifiability, mechanistic studies, and their applications in the synthesis of diversely functionalized molecules. Future challenges are outlined.

Nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds represent the core structures of natural products and drugs, and their efficient synthesis is of great significance for the development of medicinal chemistry and functional materials. Isocyanates, owing to their high electrophilicity and multifunctionality, have become a universal building block for constructing complex nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of isocyanates through C(sp2)&#63743;H bond activation to construct heterocyclic frameworks has emerged as an atom&#8208;economical alternative. This review systematically summarizes the research progress of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of isocyanates through C(sp2)&#8208;H activation from 2006 to 2025. It categorizes these advancements according to the substrates involved in the cyclization reaction, providing a concise analysis of substrate scopes, limitations, molecular modifiability, mechanistic studies, and their applications in the precise synthesis of diversely functionalized molecules. Moreover, the main challenges and future opportunities are also succinctly elucidated with the goal of expanding the application range of these reactions.

We report the diazo&#8208;transfer from Hypervalent Iodine Diazo Reagents to azocarboxylates under photocatalytic conditions. The subsequent intramolecular decarboxylative cyclization leads to the divergent access to 1&#8201;H&#8208;diazirines and 1H&#8208;tetrazoles depending upon the substituents in the azo&#8208;substrate. The control experiments suggested that the diazo&#8208;group transfer may take place through photocatalytically generated diazomethyl radical intermediate or through electrophilic diazomethylation of azocarboxylate radical anion

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Enantiopure (R)&#8208;Citronellal from Geraniol via a Short&#8208;Chain Dehydrogenase and Ene Reductase</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic cascade with two consecutive biocatalytic steps consisting of a short&#8208;chain alcohol dehydrogenase and an ene reductase in a biphasic system provides (R)&#8208;citronellal with &gt;90% conversion and &gt;99% enantiomeric excess from inexpensive geraniol.

The development of synthetic routes to produce enantiopure (R)&#8208;citronellal as a key intermediate for the synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;menthol and other valuable terpenoids is highly relevant in the pharmaceutical, flavor, and fragrance industries. Herein, we showcase a cascade with two consecutive biocatalytic steps performed separately using the inherent selectivity of a short&#8208;chain alcohol dehydrogenase (SDR) and an ene reductase (ERED) from the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) family. The first reaction involves the AaSDR1&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of relatively inexpensive geraniol in a biphasic system, providing geranial as an intermediate. The organic phase containing geranial is then extracted and transferred to the second step, where the ERED variant OYE2_Y83V catalyzes the asymmetric reduction of geranial to produce (R)&#8208;citronellal, achieving &gt;90% conversion and &gt;99% enantiomeric excess. The use of n&#8208;heptane in a two&#8208;liquid phase system not only facilitates substrate and product solubilization but also minimizes geranial isomerization. This biocatalytic cascade therefore enables the synthesis of enantiopure (R)&#8208;citronellal.

&lt;p&gt;The development of synthetic routes to produce enantiopure (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-citronellal as a key intermediate for the synthesis of (&#8211;)-menthol and other valuable terpenoids is highly relevant in the pharmaceutical, flavor, and fragrance industries. Herein, we showcase a cascade with two consecutive biocatalytic steps performed separately using the inherent selectivity of a short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase (SDR) and an ene reductase (ERED) from the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) family. The first reaction involves the &lt;i&gt;Aa&lt;/i&gt;SDR1-catalyzed oxidation of relatively inexpensive geraniol in a biphasic system, providing geranial as an intermediate. The organic phase containing geranial is then extracted and transferred to the second step, where the ERED variant OYE2_Y83V catalyzes the asymmetric reduction of geranial to produce (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-citronellal, achieving &amp;gt;90% conversion and &amp;gt;99% enantiomeric excess. The use of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-heptane in a two-liquid phase system not only facilitates substrate and product solubilization but also minimizes geranial isomerization. This biocatalytic cascade therefore enables the synthesis of enantiopure (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-citronellal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxidative Rearrangement of 3&#8208;Aryl Azo Indoles in Water: Synthesis of C3&#8208;Oxo&#8208;C2&#8208;Amino Indoles and their Application as Fluorophores for Lipid Droplet Detection</title>

         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free, sustainable oxidative rearrangement of 3&#8208;azo indoles in water is described to C3&#8208;oxo&#8208;C2&#8208;amino indoles, which are used as fluorescent probes to detect lipid droplets.

A novel oxidative rearrangement of the diazene moiety in 3&#8208;aryl azo indoles is reported, leading to the formation of C3&#8208;oxo&#8208;C2&#8208;amino indoles with excellent regioselectivity. This transformation, achieved using oxone in water at ambient temperature, proceeds in good yields with broad functional group tolerance, including toward azaindoles. Mechanistic insights are gained through control experiments, crystal structures, and density functional theory calculations. Experimental and theoretical photophysical studies, along with cellular uptake and colocalization experiments, demonstrate that the resulting compounds selectively bind to lipid droplets (LDs), highlighting their potential as fluoroprobes for LD detection.

         <title>Integrating Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis and Enzymes for the Stereoselective Synthesis of Alcohols and Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration between visible&#8208;light photocatalysis and biocatalysis has the potential to greatly improve modern organic synthesis by combining the production of valuable synthetic intermediates under mild photochemical conditions with the high degree of stereoselectivity reached by enzymes. The review collects the recent efforts in the photoenzymatic asymmetric synthesis of alcohols and amines.

The stereocontrolled formation of C&#63743;O and C&#63743;N bonds is important for the preparation of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, fragrances, and flavors. In this field, enzymes have become a valid alternative to transition metal complexes and organocatalysts due to their high degree of stereoselectivity and desirable sustainability features. In this scenario, the increasing interest toward sustainable and efficient chemical processes has also led to the combination of complementary catalytic systems. The merge of biocatalysis and photocatalysis is among the most recent approaches. While photocatalysis allows the production of valuable synthetic intermediates and reactive species under mild conditions, biocatalysis exploits highly specific enzymes to catalyze reactions with high (stereo)&#8208;selectivity and minimal byproduct formation. This review summarizes the progress in photoenzymatic catalysis (also photobiocatalysis), emphasizing their complementary mechanisms in producing chiral alcohols and amines, and highlights how such integration not only enhances the sustainability of catalytic systems but also expands the scope of reactions accessible under milder and ultimately more sustainable conditions.

         <title>Borane&#8208;Catalyzed Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Ring Opening of 2&#8208;Substituted Aziridines with Phenols for Direct Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines</title>

Boron&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208; and ortho&#8208;selective C&#63743;H bond substitution of phenols with 2&#8208;alkyl/aryl aziridines to access the branched selective ortho&#8208;phenolic&#8208;&#946;&#8208;arylethylamines is achieved. N&#8208;heterocyclic arenes can also act as carbon nucleophiles to open the aziridine ring selectively to afford the branched products. This protocol is demonstrated for the synthesis of serotonin and tryptamine.

A metal&#8208;free chemo&#8208; and regioselective nucleophilic ring opening of 2&#8208;substituted aziridines with ortho&#8208;C(sp2) atom of phenols enables facile access to medicinally relevant &#946;&#8208;arylethylamine derivatives. In this approach, phenols act as aryl nucleophiles that favor C&#63743;C bond formation selectively at the ortho&#8208;C(sp2) position with the more substituted carbon of aziridines to generate branched, selective arylated products. Despite the significant advancement of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling and nucleophilic ring opening of 2&#8208;substituted azirines, only linear arylated products are widely demonstrated. The first metal&#8208;free branched selective nucleophilic ring opening of 2&#8208;alkyl and 2&#8208;aryl aziridines with phenols is reported to address this challenge. Furthermore, the diversity of the substrate scope by using N&#8208;heterocycles as nucleophiles empowers the generation of &#946;&#8208;heteroarylethylamine derivatives. A combination of computational and experimental investigation reveals that the reaction proceeds via a borane&#8208;promoted proton transfer, followed by aziridine ring opening and Fridel&#8211;Crafts alkylation involving a &#960;&#8208;complex of carbocation&#8208;anion ion pair. This protocol is further applicable for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant compounds like serotonin and tryptamine.

         <title>Noncovalent&#8208;Interaction&#8208;Dictated Product Selectivity in Intermolecular and Intramolecular Controllable Oxidation of Aromatic Amines Using 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Diperoxyphenic Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving controllable generation and effective interception of relevant intermediates during intermolecular and intramolecular oxidation of aromatic amines by noncovalent interactions is an attractive objective. It has been reported herein the means to enable a family of intermolecular and intramolecular controllable selective oxidation of aromatic amines that create opportunities for the synthesis of symmetric or unsymmetric nitrosobenzenes, nitrobenzenes, azoxybenzenes, and azobenzenes.


Selective oxidation of aromatic amines is a valuable transformation in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry as well as materials science. However, the efficient means to reach its full potential remain a formidable challenge because meticulous perturbations on the oxidation states can potentially lead to dramatically different product selectivity and efficacy profiles. Herein, by identifying bench&#8208;stable and easily prepared 2,2&#8242;&#8208;diperoxyphenic acid as oxidant and/or I2 as additive, a general and divergent oxidation is developed to reliably form a wide assortment of nitrosobenzenes, nitrobenzenes, azobenzenes, and azoxybenzenes in an intermolecular and intramolecular controllable manner, avoiding the use of stoichiometric metal oxidants and transition metal&#8208;based catalysts. Mechanistic studies reveal that the imposing of noncovalent interactions enables the achievement of reagent&#8208; and additive&#8208;dependent reordering of N&#63743;H bond reactivity and the rate of corresponding elementary steps.

         <title>Cu/Ru Sequential Catalysis via In Situ Directing Group Formation for Site&#8208;Selective C&#63743;H Arylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu/Ru sequential catalysis enables in situ formation of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles as directing groups for site&#8208;selective C&#63743;H arylation.Combining click chemistry with Ru&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H activation bypasses prefunctionalization, ensures high regioselectivity, and accommodates diverse substrates.Applications include late&#8208;stage drug modification and functional material synthesis.

A Cu/Ru bimetallic sequential catalytic strategy combining copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) with Ru&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H activation is developed, enabling the in&#8201;situ formation of nitrogen&#8208;containing triazoles and their ortho C&#63743;H arylation in a one&#8208;pot dual&#8208;functional transformation. This system innovatively employs the 1,2,3&#8208;triazole formed via CuAAC as an endogenous directing group, facilitating sequential [3+2] cycloaddition and Ru&#8208;mediated C&#63743;H functionalization through a stepwise catalytic approach. The strategy overcomes the limitations of traditional preactivation and exhibits excellent regioselectivity and broad substrate compatibility. This approach has been successfully applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceutical molecules, offering a new paradigm for the modular synthesis of complex compounds.

         <title>Electrochemically Driven Hydroxy&#8208;Thiocarbamation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces an electrochemical method for multi&#8208;component hydroxy&#8208;thiocarbamation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, using (hetero)aryl alkenes, KSCN, and H2O to produce &#946;&#8208;hydroxy primary S&#8208;thiocarbamates. The process is highly atom&#8208;economical, and demonstrates excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, enabling diverse product synthesis and late&#8208;stage natural product modification.

This article reports the first example of multi&#8208;component hydroxy&#8208;thiocarbamation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes in an electrochemical undivided cell. Simple and readily available electron&#8208;deficient (hetero)aryl alkenes, KSCN and H2O are used as starting materials to produce &#946;&#8208;hydroxy primary S&#8208;thiocarbamate derivatives in moderate to good yields. H2O is involved in the formation of carbamoyl and hydroxyl groups, making the method highly atom&#8208;economical. The reaction introduces multiple functional groups under mild and environmentally friendly conditions, without the need for metals or external oxidants. The reaction exhibits good functional&#8208;group tolerance and excellent product diversity. The procedure is operationally simple, and late&#8208;stage modification of natural products further demonstrates the practical application of the method.

         <title>Electrochemical Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Heterofunctionalization of Tropones via C(sp2)&#63743;H Derivatization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and selective. The electrochemical heterofunctionalization of activated tropones is achieved using readily available inorganic salts. A theoretical model, based on cyclic voltammetry and quantum chemistry calculations, predicts both reactivity trends and site selectivity. This model is supported by the rapid synthesis of densely functionalized tropones and tropolones (35 examples, with yields up to 95%).

A general electrochemical synthetic procedure for the site&#8208;selective heterofunctionalization of activated tropones is documented. Detailed voltametric analysis and quantum chemistry calculations enabled&#160;the development of a predictive model for the process efficiency, accounting for both reactivity and regioselectivity. Mono&#8208; and poly&#8208;halogenation, nitration, sulfonation, and thiocyanation protocols are successfully executed starting from inexpensive sodium salts under oxidative electrolytic conditions (35 examples, isolated yields up to 95%, faradaic efficiencies up to 95%). The implementation of an iterative electrochemical/metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling synthetic strategy, along with the adaptation of the protocol for the preparation of biologically relevant tropolone derivatives, underscores the generality and robustness of the methodology.

         <title>Electrochemically Driven Diastereoselective Dearomative 2,3&#8208;Diesterification of Indoles with Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein an electrochemical radical cation&#8208;mediated dearomative 2,3&#8208;difunctionalization of indoles with carboxylic acids for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;diesterified indolines with excellent trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity is reported.

An electrochemically driven radical cation&#8208;mediated dearomative 2,3&#8208;difunctionalization of indoles with carboxylic acids is described, which provides an efficient and straightforward route for the construction of a range of 2,3&#8208;diesterified indolines with excellent trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields. This metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free electrochemical protocol proceeds in an undivided cell, exhibiting broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies reveal that the anodic single&#8208;electron oxidation of indoles is the initial step and oxocarbenium ion formation is the key to controlling trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity.

         <dc:description>
Solvent&#8208; and transition metal&#8208;free synthetic pathways for obtaining 2&#8208;thiazolines and S&#8208;thiocarbamates, based on the mechanochemical process of addition of chloroalkyl iso(thio)cyanates to thiols catalyzed by cheap and commercially available K2CO3, are designed and optimized. This approach has been successfully applied to obtain 39 materials with significant medicinal potential in yields above 95%.

For the first time, the mechanochemical synthesis of five&#8208;membered N,S&#8208;heterocyclic 1,3&#8208;thiazolines and S&#8208;thiocarbamates has been performed starting from chloroalkyl iso(thio)cyanates, thiols, as well as dithiols, in the presence of cheap and commercially available potassium carbonate (K2CO3) as a catalyst. The experimental conditions are optimized to allow the effective formation of attractive materials with significant medicinal potential in yields above 95% in transition metal&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free conditions. The reactions are efficient and easily scalable to gram quantities, offering substantial benefits for practical applications.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling Reaction of Diazo Reagent with Formamide for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Formyloxy Ketones and &#945;&#8208;Ketoamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct coupling reaction of diazo reagent with formamide has been developed to construct &#945;&#8208;formyloxy ketones and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides in moderate to excellent yields with a broad substrate scope. The synthetic protocol features mild reaction conditions and simple operation under air, which can enable the installation of aldehyde and amine group into the target molecule via C&#63743;N bond cleavage.

A copper&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction of diazo reagents with formamides is reported. Under the optimal reaction conditions, this reaction leads to a wide range of &#945;&#8208;formyloxy ketones and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides in moderate to good yields. This strategy enables the installation of two important functional groups, aldehyde and amine group, into the target molecule in the presence of formamide via C&#63743;N bond cleavage. Mechanism studies indicate that this conversion reaction may undergo a radical process.

         <dc:description>
The unconventional annulations between pent&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones and vinyl diketones has been achieved to afford bicyclo[3.2.1]octanediones in high yields, which are ubiquitous in bioactive substances but are challenging to synthesize using traditional methods

The bicyclo[3.2.1]octanone and bicyclo[3.2.1]octanedione scaffolds, along with their derivatives, are ubiquitous in natural products and synthetic pharmaceuticals. However, the synthetic routes to access these scaffolds have been relatively underdeveloped. Herein, this study introduces a unique reaction between pent&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones and vinyl diketones, which serves as a versatile platform for the efficient synthesis of a wide array of bicyclo[3.2.1]octanediones in good to excellent yields. Furthermore, this study method facilitates diverse downstream transformations of these products, underscoring the versatility and potential of diketone&#8208;based chemistry in constructing complex molecules.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of 2,5&#8208;Disubstituted Furans through a C&#63742;C Double Bond Cleavage Radical Cascade</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic cyclization of two enaminone molecules is conducted to 2,5&#8208;disubstituted furans from a C&#63742;C double bond cleavage radical cascade under exogenous oxidation and transition metal free, mild, and practical conditions. The desired products are produced with the leaving of DMF and dimethylamine.

An electrochemically oxidative cyclization between two molecules of enaminones to give 2,5&#8208;disubstituted furans had been established through the leaving of DMF and dimethylamine under mild and practical reaction conditions. Attributing to the electrolysis process, the exogenous oxidation and transition metal are avoided. Moreover, this electrosynthesis is highlighted by good yields obtained, good functional group compatibility and high step economy. In addition, based on the intermediate monitoring, intermediate verification, radical&#8208;trapping, and cyclic voltammetry experiments, a possible mechanism is proposed.

         <title>Insights into Alkene Hydroselenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the hydroselenation reactions of alkenes with selenols or their surrogates for the synthesis of valuable organoselenium compounds, with a special emphasis on the mechanisms of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed and radical hydroselenation.

Selective hydrofunctionalization of alkenes enables the efficient construction of structurally diverse and value&#8208;added molecules with new functionalities. The past few decades have witnessed rapid applications of organoselenium compounds in pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and materials. Alkene hydroselenation represents one of the most promising strategies for the highly regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208;, and stereoselective synthesis of selenium&#8208;containing substances. This review outlines the hydroselenation reactions of alkenes with selenols or their surrogates developed over the past five decades and discusses the origin of selectivity based on representative examples. These developments are categorized according to the reactivity patterns exhibited by the selenium nucleophiles. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, light&#8208;induced, and electrocatalytic hydroselenation are highlighted to enhance the understanding of the mechanism.

         <dc:description>











A novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven iron&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative cyclization reaction of 2&#8208;carboxymethoxybenzaldehyde and aryl amines under mild conditions is developed. This highly efficient transformation enables the quick construction of various substituted 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran derivatives in one&#8208;pot operation with good to excellent yields as well as broad functional group tolerance and will provide versatile short approaches to motifs and/or analogues of numerous medicinally interesting 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran natural products. Preliminary mechanistic investigations show that iron catalyst can readily realize decarboxylation of alkyl carboxylic acids to alkyl radicals through a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven protocol, thus leading to one&#8208;pot decarboxylation and cyclization cascade reactions.

A dual synthetic approach of three&#8208;component carboamination reactions has been developed in the presence of visible&#8208;light photocatalysis as well as hypervalent iodine(III) reagent to afford the C(sp2)&#63743;H difunctionalization. The main keynote of our approaches is metal&#8208;free, base&#8208;free, mild reaction conditions, room temperature synthesis with high yields, and broad substrate scope. Apart from this, the protocols described herein are also helpful for constructing and transforming complex molecules.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Promoted Esterification of Carboxylic Acids via Photoacid Generation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel, environmentally friendly photochemical method for the esterification of carboxylic acids with alcohols using arylazo sulfones as photoacid generators was developed. This approach avoids traditional acidic catalysts, purification did not require chromatography and the method proved effective under continuous flow conditions for enhanced productivity.

The ester functionality is ubiquitously found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and perfumes. Among the various methods of ester synthesis, the acid&#8208;catalyzed coupling of carboxylic acids with alcohols is the most common approach. Herein, a mild photochemical method is introduced, leveraging a photoacid generation approach utilizing an arylazo sulfone as the sulfonic acid precursor. A broad substrate scope of carboxylic acids or alcohols is reported, while a continuous flow process has been also implemented.

         <title>Dual Photoredox/Cu&#8208;Catalysis Enables Diastereoselective Synthesis of 3&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Ethynyltropanes via Decarboxylative Alkynylation</title>

         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative alkynylation of tropanes is developed. This approach works under mild conditions and selectively produces a range of 3&#8208;&#946;&#8208;alkynylated tropanes. Moreover, it provides a versatile and convergent platform for further functionalization of the triple bond.

An efficient decarboxylative alkynylation of a tropane redox&#8208;active ester with terminal alkynes is described, yielding ethynyltropanes with exclusive &#946;&#8208;configuration. This cost&#8208;effective process utilizes mild, nontoxic copper&#8208;catalyzed, photoinduced reaction conditions. Beyond introducing a novel pathway for the catalytic alkynylation of nortropanes, this method offers a versatile and convergent approach for synthesizing complex nortropane derivatives through further functionalization of the triple bond, including reductions, and inverse demand Diels&#8211;Alder reactions.

         <title>Synergistic Visible Light Nanophotocatalysis and Asymmetric Organocatalysis for the Stereoselective &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedent dual catalytic nanophotocatalytic and asymmetric organocatalytic system for the &#945;&#8208;functionalization of aldehydes is developed using carbon nanodots as photosensitizers. The optimized methodology yields the alkylated products with up to 94% yield and up to 98:2 e.r., evidencing the possible recycling of the nanocatalysts. This procedure can serve as pivotal starting point for the use of carbon dots in asymmetric photocatalysis.

Carbon dots (CDs) are privileged carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials which they have been extensively studied in recent years in catalysis. In fact, their peculiar photoluminescence features have found applications in nanophotocatalysis as well as bioimaging and sensing. Nevertheless, their application as nanophotoredox catalysts in stereoselective transformations is still unexplored. Herein, this study reports the combination of carbon dots as nanophotocatalysts and asymmetric organocatalysis for the stereoselective &#945;&#8208;functionalization of aldehydes. Employing various bromo&#8208;derivatives as alkylating agents, it achieves the corresponding enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;alkylated derivatives with excellent yields (up to 94%) and enantioselectivities (up to 98:2 e.r.). With a series of control experiments, cyclic voltammetry and fluorescence quenching studies, it is possible to postulate a synergistic dual catalytic cycle that involves a photo&#8208;oxidative quenching of the excited stated of CDs paired with an enamine activation promoted by the MacMillan organocatalyst followed by radical alkylation. This study successfully demonstrates that carbon dots can efficiently replace metal&#8208;based photocatalysts, promoting photoredox catalytic stereoselective transformations even at low concentrations (down to 0.1&#8201;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1), paving the way to more sustainable and possibly recyclable catalytic systems.

         <title>Multiphoton Multicomponent Reactions: Discovery of the 2&#8208;Photon Ketene 4&#8208;Component Reaction (2P&#8208;K&#8208;4CR)</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent reactions triggered by multiple photons: complex heterocycles can be synthesized in a regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner via a double photoactivation using visible light from simple building blocks, exploiting the combination of ketene 3&#8208;component reaction and Patern&#242;&#8211;B&#252;chi cycloaddition.

Herein, the first multiphoton, multicomponent approach for synthesizing highly functionalized oxetanes using diazoketones, isocyanides, silanols (or carboxylic acids), and 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives (benzils) is presented as starting materials. Blue light irradiation initiates the Wolff rearrangement of diazoketones, generating ketenes that promptly react with isocyanides and silanols (or carboxylic acids) to afford captodative olefins. Concurrently, excitation of benzils promotes a [2&#8201;+&#8201;2] photocycloaddition between the activated carbonyl group and the captodative olefin. This newly developed two&#8208;photon ketene four&#8208;component reaction has been thoroughly investigated, also through chemometric analysis, including its substrates scope and the extension to mixed benzils. Furthermore, the observed stereochemical outcomes, validated by X&#8208;Ray diffraction analysis, are elucidated through detailed computational studies, providing insights into the underlying reaction mechanism.

An electrochemical oxidative [3 + 2] annulation of p&#8208;methoxy anilines with enaminones is reported for the synthesis of 3&#8208;acyl indoles in a moderate to good yields under mild conditions, which features excellent functional group tolerance, operational simplicity, and gram&#8208;scale scalability.

An electrochemical oxidative [3&#8201;+&#8201;2] annulation of p&#8208;methoxy anilines with enaminones is reported. This protocol enables facile synthesis of 3&#8208;acyl indoles in moderate to good yields under mild conditions, featuring excellent functional group tolerance, operational simplicity, and gram&#8208;scale scalability. Based on the cyclic voltammetry and control experiments, a plausible mechanism involving the aniline radical pathway is proposed.

An efficient, metal&#8208;free method for synthesizing C3&#8208;alkylated indoles via B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed reductive C&#63743;C bond cleavage of bisindolylmethanes (BIMs) under mild conditions is reported, offering broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance.

In this study, B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed reductive C&#63743;C bond cleavage of bisindolylmethanes (BIMs) is reported as an efficient strategy for preparing C3&#8208;alkylated indoles. In the presence of silane, B(C6F5)3 selectively activates Csp2&#8208;Csp3 bonds of BIMs under mild conditions. Moreover, this sustainable process exhibits a broad substrate scope, highly functional group tolerance, and excellent regioselectivity. Preliminary mechanistic studies disclose that the formation of stabilized ion&#8208;pair intermediates is crucial to achieving the desired transformation. Notably, the strategy provides a metal&#8208;free alternative to transition metal catalysis, enabling the sustainable synthesis of valuable indole derivatives.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Photoredox Synthesis of Sulfonylated Benzimidazoisoquinolines via 10 H&#8208;Phenothiazine&#8208;Catalyzed Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free photocatalytic strategy using unmodified 10 H&#8208;phenothiazine is presented for the synthesis of sulfonylated benzimidazoisoquinolines. Visible light activates catalytic electron donor&#8211;acceptor complexes between phenothiazine and sulfonyl chlorides, driving a sulfonation/cyclization cascade with broad substrate scope, high efficiency, and mild conditions.

An unmodified 10 H&#8208;phenothiazine is directly utilized as an efficient photocatalyst to enable ready access to sulfonylated benzo[4,5]imidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives from N&#8208;allyl benzimidazoles and sulfonyl chlorides. The reaction involves the formation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor complexes between phenothiazine and sulfonyl chloride, which, upon visible light irradiation, undergo single&#8208;electron transfer to generate sulfonyl radicals. The reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and high efficiency.

This article discusses the reports on DG&#8208;assisted site&#8208;selective di&#8208;ortho&#8208;arylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkenylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkynylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;cyanation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;amination, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;thiolation/selenation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;carbonylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;halogenation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;oxygenation, and unsymmetrical di&#8208;ortho C&#63743;H functionalization of inert aryl and heteroaryl C&#63743;H bonds. This unique approach has gotten tremendous attention over the last two decades for the synthesis of complex functionalized aryls.

The directing group (DG)&#8208;assisted transition metal (TM)&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective C&#63743;H activation and functionalization has become a popular approach in the synthesis of natural products, pharmaceuticals, and late&#8208;stage functionalization. In particular, the ortho&#8208;selective C&#63743;H functionalization is frequently addressed. One DG generally directs the mono&#8208;C&#63743;H functionalization. However, over the years, there are some exceptional reactions that have been reported where one DG directs di&#8208;ortho&#8208;C&#63743;H functionalization, offering extra functionalization in one pot. There is no generalization in this type of reaction. In this comprehensive report, the di&#8208;ortho&#8208;C&#63743;H functionalization reactions reported in the recent two decades (2004&#8211;2024) are summarized, and the current status and future perspective for further modifications are provided. This discussion covers DG&#8208;assisted site&#8208;selective di&#8208;ortho&#8208;arylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkenylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkynylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;cyanation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;amination, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;thiolation/selenation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;carbonylation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;halogenation, di&#8208;ortho&#8208;oxygenation, and unsymmetrical di&#8208;ortho C&#63743;H functionalization of inert aryl and heteroaryl C&#63743;H bonds.

         <title>eAmidation: An Electrochemical Amidation of Aldehydes via the Oxidation of N&#8208;Aryl Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The indirect electrochemical oxidation of N&#8208;aryl hydrazones offers an efficient approach to access amides from aldehydes and amines. The AZADO&#8208;mediated reaction enables the selective synthesis of a broad range of valuable amides using readily available aldehydes.

In recent years, the use of electrochemistry has emerged as a powerful yet sustainable means of enabling key transformations. Amidation is one of the most frequently executed transformations in synthetic chemistry, and using an electrochemical approach, the current study has demonstrated the synthesis of amides from aldehydes and amines. Mechanistic work indicates that the reaction proceeds via the oxidation of an intermediate hydrazone to generate an acyl diazene as the acylating species. The protocol developed has enabled the synthesis of a broad range of amides, including access to pharmaceutically relevant products, directly from aldehydes without recourse for hazardous chemical oxidants and activating agents.

&lt;p&gt;The indirect electrochemical oxidation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aryl hydrazones offers an efficient approach to access amides from aldehydes and amines. The AZADO-mediated reaction enables the selective synthesis of a broad range of valuable amides using readily available aldehydes.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of the multidendate ligand (H2L) with lanthanide metal salts leads to the formation of one&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers (CP). The structural analysis of the molecule suggests the formation of CP with ladder&#8208;type arrangements of ligands with metal centers. The polymers CP&#8208;1 and CP&#8208;2 with europium and terbium were found to be anionic and coordinatively unsaturated with the existence of solvent molecules in the vacant sites. The CPs were found to be suitable catalysts for the regioselective annulation of aza&#8208;MBH adducts with N,N, cyclic azomethine imines that lead to the formation of N,N&#8217;&#8208;bicyclic pyrazolidine scaffolds via [3+2] cycloaddition. The protocol tolerates a wide substrate scope with different functionalities by producing the bicyclic scaffold with better yield and excellent diastereoselectivity. The X&#8208;ray and NMR analysis suggests the formation of cis diastereomer which is stabilized by N&#8722;H&#8212;O interaction. The synthetic utility of the pyrazolidine scaffolds is attempted for various functional group interconversions.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Diboron&#8208;Substrate Cooperatively Facilitate Direct Amidation of Carboxylic Acids and Amines</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report that an efficient and practical organocatalyzed strategy enables direct amidation of a wide range of carboxylic acids and variety of amines. The organocatalyzed system is proved to be suitable for the synthesis of small molecular peptides from protected amino acids, and the method was successfully applied to the late stage functionalization of drug molecules or pharmaceutical intermediates. Mechanistic studies by control experiments, in&#8197;situ infrared spectroscopy, 11B nuclear magnetic resonance (11B NMR), and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, reveal that N&#8208;propyl&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylamino)phenyl) formamide reacts with B2pin2 to form the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;diboron adduct, and the boron atom of NHC&#8208;diboron adduct is able to coordinate to the carboxyl oxygen atom of the carboxylic acid to generate the true active species of NHC&#8208;diboron&#8208;carboxylic acid for catalyzing the amidation of carboxylic acids and amines. The discovery of in&#8197;situ generation of catalytic system in combination of multi&#8208;catalytic components with substrates may open the door to cooperative catalysis for the synthesis of important organic molecules.

Abstract
This work presents a detailed mechanistic study of a quininium&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;Michael reaction, providing essential information for advancing chiral proton catalysis (CPC). The use of cinchona derivatives as chiral proton catalysts demonstrates their potential beyond their conventional roles as base&#8208;promoted and phase&#8208;transfer catalysts. Competitive reaction pathways are explored using density functional theory (DFT), wavefunction theory, and microkinetic simulations. Theoretical analyses are complemented with experimental titration and kinetic techniques to verify the intrinsic details of the reaction. This study reveals an intricate hydrogen bond network formed in the rate&#8208; and selectivity&#8208;determining step, involving four noncovalently attached components that favor a stronger substrate&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;catalyst interaction in the R transition state. Significantly, this research emphasizes the pivotal role of carboxylate anions as nucleophile&#8208;activating bases impacting reaction yield and enantioselectivity. Therefore, this work introduces cinchonium derivatives as new options for CPC and provides a thorough mechanistic analysis significant in expanding this underdeveloped catalytic domain.

Abstract
Azo compounds as a class of privileged molecules continue to attract significant attention in many fields including drug discovery, organic synthesis, and materials science. Despite notable progress in their synthesis, the use of visible light to directly construct azo compounds under photocatalytic conditions from amine precursors remains a challenging endeavour. Herein, we report the first instance of photo&#8208;dual catalytic Cu/photosensitizer (PS) synthesis of symmetric and non&#8208;symmetric azo compounds from readily available amines using renewable light energy input, ambient conditions, and ubiquitous air as a stoichiometric oxidant. This reliable and efficient photo&#8208;driven procedure is scalable and tolerates a variety of functional groups with broad substrate scope and allows for the preparation of azo&#8208;based photoswitches, arylazopyrazoles, and diazocines. The origin of this remarkable reactivity is delineated by in&#8208;depth experimental and computational studies.

Abstract
The synthesis of 5&#8211;7 membered oxygenated heterocycles by intramolecular aminooxygenation of unsaturated alkenes using commercially available N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide as amination reagent and TpiPr2Cu(NCCH3) as precatalyst is reported. With unsaturated aliphatic carboxylic acids, the corresponding lactones are obtained from moderate to almost quantitative yields employing a catalyst loading of 2.5&#8197;mol% under mild conditions, whereas 2&#8208;vinylbenzoic acids originate lower yields.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of 2H&#8208;imidazoles from 1,2&#8208;Diketones, Ketones, and Ammonium Acetate</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a multicomponent reaction for the efficient synthesis of polysubstituted 2H&#8208;imidazoles from readily available 1,2&#8208;diketones, ketones, and ammonium acetate under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. Both nitrogen atoms in the resulting 2H&#8208;imidazole products are derived from the cost&#8208;effective inorganic ammonium acetate. This protocol achieves the cleavage of three C&#8722;O bonds and the formation of four C&#8722;N bonds in a single operation. The advantages of this protocol include low cost, broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and high atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy.

         <title>Constant Enzymatic in&#8197;situ Production of H2O2 for an Unspecific Peroxygenase by an l&#8211;Amino Acid Oxidase</title>

Abstract
Unspecific Peroxygenases have been the subject of a lot of research in the recent past as they offer opportunities for green hydroxylation reactions using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as donor. A striking problem of UPOs is their low stability against their own co&#8208;substrate H2O2. In order to prevent the deactivation, we developed an enzyme cascade with an l&#8208;amino acid oxidase (LAAO) to produce hydrogen peroxide in&#8197;situ at a constant low concentration, aiming for much higher lifespan and therefore longer working time of the enzyme. This way, we are able to convert a variety of substrates with conversion rates up to 95%.

         <title>Synergistic Radical Markovnikov Hydroselenization of Alkenes</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a new synergistic radical Markovnikov hydroselenization of alkenes by in&#8208;situ generated selenium cluster that absorbs hydride under mild conditions. In this protocol, a formal &#8220;metal hydride&#8221; mechanism is proposed, in which the hydrogen atom is added into the alkene, then undergoing SH2 radical substitution to give the dialkyl selenides products that previously are inaccessible. This metal&#8208;free double selenium&#8208;ene reaction enables smoothly the installation of the bioactive Se atom into a remarkably wide scope of aliphatic and aromatic alkenes and pharmaceuticals&#8208;derived alkenes along with high functional groups compatibility.

Abstract
A novel, synthetically straightforward, selective DMAP&#8208;promoted [4+2]/[3+3] annulation domino reaction of o&#8208;acylamino&#8208;aryl Morita&#8722;Baylis&#8722;Hillman (MBH) carbonates with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines to construct complex fused [2,7]naphthyridine frameworks has been developed. The reaction provides a step&#8208;economic strategy for the direct synthesis of functionalized benzo[c][2,7]naphthyridines containing three stereogenic centers in high yields with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and diastereoselectivity under mild reaction conditions. More importantly, this transformation enables the simultaneous formation of four new bonds and two new six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles in only one step. Additionally, the synthetic utility of this method has been demonstrated through its application in the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceutically active molecules.

Abstract
Multifunctional arenes play a crucial role in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, yet their synthesis remains a significant synthetic challenge. In this study, we introduce a novel one&#8208;step strategy for the efficient synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted phenols containing hydroxy, halogen, and sulfonamido groups, all of which demonstrate notable biological activity. This work represents the first example of an aromatization&#8208;driven approach to 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted benzene derivatives. Remarkably, the resulting 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted benzene scaffold is amenable to multiple late&#8208;stage modifications, facilitating the synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzene derivatives&#8212;compounds that are typically challenging to obtain using conventional synthetic methods. Furthermore, the method offers compatibility with diverse functional groups, it proceeds under mild reaction conditions, and it uses readily available starting materials, positioning it as a highly promising tool for pharmaceutical and materials research.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multifunctional arenes play a crucial role in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, yet their synthesis remains a significant synthetic challenge. In this study, we introduce a novel one-step strategy for the efficient synthesis of multi-substituted phenols containing hydroxy, halogen, and sulfonamido groups, all of which demonstrate notable biological activity. This work represents the first example of an aromatization-driven approach to 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivatives. Remarkably, the resulting 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene scaffold is amenable to multiple late-stage modifications, facilitating the synthesis of 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted benzene derivatives&#8212;compounds that are typically challenging to obtain using conventional synthetic methods. Furthermore, the method offers compatibility with diverse functional groups, it proceeds under mild reaction conditions, and it uses readily available starting materials, positioning it as a highly promising tool for pharmaceutical and materials research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Highly enantioselective transfer hydrogenation of &#947;&#8208;indolyl &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;keto amides and &#945;&#8208;keto esters with Hantzsch ester catalyzed by chiral zinc complex is reported. Using 5&#8197;mol% of Zn(OTf)2&#8208;imidazolidine&#8208;pyrroloimidazolone pyridine as the catalyst, the C=C bond in &#947;&#8208;indolyl &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;keto amides is selectively reduced, affording hydrogenation products in high yields (up to 99% yield) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). Using the same catalyst system, the C=O bond in &#945;&#8208;keto esters is reduced, generating &#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters in good results (up to 99% yield and 98% ee). A retro&#8208;Michael pathway and subsequent transfer hydrogenation reaction are proposed for the explanation of the side products in the transfer hydrogenation of &#947;&#8208;indolyl &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;keto amides.

Abstract
Reaction of sulfinamides with in&#8197;situ generated N&#8208;trifluoromethanesulfonyl ketimines occurs rapidly at room temperature in the presence of KOt&#8208;Bu. The precursor N&#8208;H imines are accessible by organolithium addition to nitriles or condensation of HMDS with ketones. This protocol avoids work&#8208;up and reactor cleaning challenges encountered in the traditional Ti(OEt)4 mediated condensation approach. The reaction works well for extremely hindered substrates, some of which were inaccessible with the Ti(OEt)4 procedure.

         <title>Synthesis of Furans/Pyrroles through Palladium&#8208;Gold Relay Catalyzed Skeletal Editing of Carbonates or Carbamates via a Decarboxylative&#8208;Aromatization Strategy</title>

Abstract
A novel Pd(0)/Au(I) relay catalysis strategy for converting propargylic cyclic carbonates into furans is reported. The method capitalizes on the sequential transformation of a palladium&#8208;stabilized alkoxide&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate into a gold&#8208;stabilized dihydrofuran species, enabled by the cooperative action of palladium and gold catalysts. This approach is notable for its simplicity, broad functional group compatibility, and use of readily available substrates. By extending the methodology to five&#8208;membered carbamates substrates, the construction of pyrrole frameworks is also demonstrated. Additionally, the method facilitates the synthesis of polycyclic furans and pyrroles via Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, achieving high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cyclization of propargyl alcohol with carbon dioxide (CO2) as a carbonyl source has been reported for the first time, which provides an efficient and straightforward route to a range of valuable butenolides in moderate to high yields. The reaction can be performed in one step and features good functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. The application of the new method was also demonstrated by direct carbonylative cyclization of biologically active molecules.

Abstract
A general, efficient and economic copper&#8208;catalyzed &#945;, &#946;&#8208;enones allylic oxidation to 1,4&#8208;enedione has been developed. The protocol only requires a small amount of cheap copper catalyst with air as the sole oxidant. The advantages of the approach are mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, good tolerance of functional groups, and easy experimental operation. The approach has been demonstrated to be compatible for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drugs and natural products.

Abstract
Herein, we provide two nickel complexes and a series of control experiments to study the mechanism of the nickel&#8208;catalyzed transannulation reaction of 1,2,3,4&#8208;benzo&#8208;thiatriazin&#8208;1,1(2H)&#8208;dioxide with aryne and alkyne in detail. In addition, we provide a new protocol for the cycloaddition of 1,2,3,4&#8208;benzothiatriazin&#8208;1,1(2H)&#8208;dioxide with alkyne on the basis of a similar reaction pathway.

Abstract
The development of efficient and sustainable catalytic systems for CO2 fixation is crucial for carbon&#8208;neutral chemical processes. We now report a&#160;high&#8208;performance and recyclable multisite catalytic system&#160;based on a&#160;crown ether&#8208;linked Schiff base&#160;in combination with&#160;alkali halides&#160;for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and CO2. The designed catalyst features&#160;multiple active sites, including a&#160;Lewis acidic alkali ion center and a nucleophilic iodide source, enabling the efficient activation of epoxides under solvent&#8208;free conditions with atmospheric pressure. Systematic studies on the effects of cations and calcium salts revealed that the&#160;multi&#8208;activation mechanism&#160;plays a critical role in enhancing the catalytic performance. The catalyst exhibited&#160;a high selectivity and activity, achieving up to&#160;a 97% yield&#160;of cyclic carbonates at&#160;atmospheric CO2 pressure and 70&#8201;&#176;C. The simulated post&#8208;combustion exhaust gas (CO2: 7.5%, N2: 92.5%, relative humidity: 90%) was concentrated to 97% and used as the material for the reaction to yield 90% of styrene carbonate from styrene oxide. Furthermore, the catalyst was&#160;easily recovered and reused for multiple cycles&#160;without any significant loss of activity. This study provides a practical and environmentally&#8208;friendly approach for CO2 utilization, contributing to the advancement of sustainable catalytic processes.

Abstract
This study developed a novel strategy based on visible&#8208;light photocatalysis for the construction of 3&#8208;chlorobenzo[b]thiophenes. The photocatalytic system exhibits multiple advantages, including mild reaction conditions, cascade reaction, and good tolerance. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that the chlorine radicals, generated from polychloromethanes, are the key to initiating the tandem reaction.

Abstract
A photoinduced energy transfer strategy has been developed for the direct 1,2&#8208;thiocyanato&#8208;imination of alkenes using N&#8208;SCN reagents. The methodology facilitates the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;aminothiocyanates through N&#8722;S bond cleavage, with over 30 examples exhibiting yields up to 88%. Mechanistic studies reveal a radical pathway involving the generation of thiocyanate and iminyl radical species. The resulting &#946;&#8208;aminothiocyanate serves as valuable building blocks for diverse transformations, particularly in the construction of SCN&#8208;containing bioactive molecules with potential pharmaceutical applications.

         <title>Recent Advances in Annulation Reactions of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketoximes for the Synthesis of Structurally Diversified Heterocycles</title>

Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed or metal&#8208;free&#8208;mediated annulation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketoximes with unsaturated coupling partners has emerged as a powerful protocol for the assembly of diverse functionalized heterocycles, which is attributed to the ability of the oxime functionality to serve as a directing group for C&#8722;H activation, to undergo reductive N&#8722;O bond cleavage, and be activated by Lewis acids or reduced by iodide salt. In this review, we summarize the coupling reactions of three types of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketoximes with various organic compounds containing unsaturated bonds such as alkenes, alkynes, carbonyls, nitriles and so on over the past decades. The reaction conditions, selected examples of the reaction scope, limitations, and reasonable mechanisms are critically described. Furthermore, the prospects for future challenges and opportunities are also explored.

&lt;p&gt;Transition metal-catalyzed or metal-free-mediated annulation of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-unsaturated ketoximes with unsaturated coupling partners has emerged as a powerful protocol for the assembly of diverse functionalized heterocycles, which is attributed to the ability of the oxime functionality to serve as a directing group for C&#8722;H activation, to undergo reductive N&#8722;O bond cleavage, and be activated by Lewis acids or reduced by iodide salt. In this review, we summarize the coupling reactions of three types of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-unsaturated ketoximes with various organic compounds containing unsaturated bonds such as alkenes, alkynes, carbonyls, nitriles and so on over the past decades. The reaction conditions, selected examples of the reaction scope, limitations, and reasonable mechanisms are critically described. Furthermore, the prospects for future challenges and opportunities are also explored.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Skeletal Editing of 6&#8208;(Hetero)arenes via Single&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Atom Insertion</title>

Abstract
The skeleton editing strategy has emerged as a transformative approach in drug discovery and agrochemical innovation, enabling precise modifications through the insertion, elimination, or substitution of specific atoms within the core carbon&#8208; or heterocyclic frameworks of molecules. Recent advancements in carbene chemistry have led to significant breakthroughs in single&#8208;carbon&#8208;atom insertion reactions, particularly in the context of five&#8208;membered carbon&#8208; and heterocyclic systems. However, the application of this strategy to six&#8208;membered arenes and heteroarenes has faced considerable challenges, largely due to the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers associated with disrupting the inherent aromaticity of these systems and driving their conversion to seven&#8208;membered rings. In recent years, the development of novel catalytic paradigms, including photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;catalytic methods, has catalyzed groundbreaking progress in this area. Notably, the design and implementation of asymmetric skeletal editing systems for arenes have significantly expanded the scope and versatility of this methodology, offering new avenues for the rational manipulation of molecular architectures. This review aims to offer a detailed summary and analysis of recent progress in skeletal editing reactions associated with single&#8208;carbon&#8208;atom insertion and outlining the future potential applications of this technology.

         <title>Impact of the Substitution Pattern in N&#8211;heterocyclic Olefin&#8208;Substituted Phosphines on Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of olefin backbone substitution in N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin&#8208;substituted phosphines is investigated. While these ligands are highly electron&#8208;donating, their catalytic activity in Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions decreases as the size of the backbone substituent increases. Stoichiometric reactions reveal unfavorable side reactions that reduce steric congestion, explaining the observed differences in catalytic activities.

In recent years, N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) have been recognized for their strong electron&#8208;donating properties. These properties have been utilized in the design of phosphine ligands (NHOPs) to enhance the electron density in palladium complexes, thereby promoting palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. In this study, the impact of the substituent in the olefin backbone was investigated. NHOP ligands with methyl and phenyl moieties have been prepared and their catalytic performance compared with the hydrogen&#8208;substituted analogs. The increased ligand bulk in the backbone results in a reduced catalytic activity in selected Pd&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig aminations. The unfavorable steric profile, as revealed by the crystal structures of the ligands and the observation of various decomposition products, is proposed as the reason for the diminished activity.

         <title>Bifunctional Reagents for Photochemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively explores bifunctional reagents in photocatalysis, which integrate radical activation sites and coupling modules within a single molecule. It systematically categorizes them (radical precursor&#8208;radical precursor/nucleophile/electrophile/acceptor) based on reaction modes and active sites, detailing mechanisms like energy/electron transfer. Emphasis is placed on their advantages for precise, efficient, and selective molecular construction under mild conditions.

Bifunctional reagents in photochemistry integrate radical activation sites with coupling modules within a single molecular framework, enabling precise construction of sophisticated moleculars. This review systematically summarizes recent advancements and reaction mechanisms of these reagents in photocatalysis regulated by energy transfer or photoinduced electron transfer. It emphasizes how kinetic matching and electronic modulation achieve selective activation of radical precursors. Cutting&#8208;edge developments, including diverse metal&#8208;based and metal&#8208;free systems, and innovative mechanisms like strain&#8208;release and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, have expanded complex molecular synthesis. The review categorizes progress based on active sites and reaction modes into four classes: radical precursor&#8208;radical precursor, radical precursor&#8208;nucleophile, radical precursor&#8208;electrophile, and radical precursor&#8208;radical acceptor. Subclassifications are defined by the central atom type of radicals and transformation patterns, revealing intrinsic correlations between reagent parameters (e.g., bond dissociation energy, electronic distribution, steric effects) and reaction pathways. This review aims to establish precise yet universal methodologies for guiding drug synthesis and functional material development.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;Oxokolavenol: A Natural Neoclerodane Diterpene with Farnesoid X Receptor Transcriptional Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The natural neoclerodane diterpene (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol shows significant Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) transcriptional activity. Herein, the first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol is reported. The synthetic route takes a 15&#8208;step sequence from the known Wieland&#8211;Miescher ketone with 0.85% overall yield. In addition, the synthesis allows (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol with 12 synthetic intermediates for biological evaluations of FXR transcriptional activity.

The natural neoclerodane diterpene (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol is isolated from the twigs of Amoora stellato&#8208;squamosa, and exhibited significant Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) transcriptional activity with an EC50 value of 1.877 &#956;M. However, the scarcity of its natural sources poses a considerable challenge for further biological studies. To address this limitation, herein, the first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol is reported. This synthesis features stereoselective alkylation, regioselective redox transformations (including late&#8208;stage allylic oxidation), and strategic installation of methyl groups. The overall synthesis delivers (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol in 15 steps from the cheap and readily available Wieland&#8211;Miescher ketone. In addition, this approach allows (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol with 12 synthetic intermediates for biological evaluations by using dual&#8208;luciferase reporter assay. Preliminary investigations confirm the nuclear receptor selectivity of (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;oxokolavenol as a FXR agonist, underscoring its potential for further bioactivity studies.

         <title>C&#8211;H Homocoupling of Arenes via Pd/S,O&#8208;Ligand Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient C&#8208;H homocoupling of arenes via Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand catalytic system is reported. This method can be applied to a series of arenes using O2 as oxidant under room temperature and is also applicable for late&#8208;stage homocoupling of pharmaceutical derivatives. Homocoupling of o&#8208;xyleneexhibits near&#8208;perfect chemoselectivity, offering an industrially favorable route to a Upilex&#174; monomer precursor .

Non&#8208;directed Pd&#8208;catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenative homocoupling of arenes is achieved in the presence of an S,O&#8208;ligand. The reaction proceeds under aerobic and mild reaction conditions with a wide range of anisole derivatives, providing direct access to symmetric biaryls with excellent ortho&#8208;ortho or para&#8208;para regioselectivity. Notably, the use of the arene as the limiting reagent enables late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex pharmaceutical molecules. The industrial applicability of this methodology is demonstrated through the synthesis of the Upilexmonomer via the homocoupling of unactivatedo&#8208;xylene.

         <title>High&#8208;Order Cascade Transformations on Tertiary &#946;&#8208;Enaminones for Step&#8208;Economical Construction of Molecular Diversity and Complexity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the recent development of enaminone&#8208;based high&#8208;order cascade single cyclization reaction and bicyclic annulation reaction via the formation of four or more new chemical bonds are summarized.

The generation of molecular diversity and complexity constitutes the major task of synthetic organic chemistry. In contrast, to achieve the maximum complexity and/or diversity of organic compound with minimum operational steps is of high significance by saving consumption of both the chemicals and the time for synthesis, enhancing the synthetic efficiency and sustainability. Based on our longstanding interest in the enaminone&#8208;based organic synthesis, herein, the research advances in high&#8208;order cascade reactions are reviewed, which involve in the formation of at least four new chemical bonds, including sigma&#8208;, pi&#8208;bonds and C&#63743;H bond, in one reaction of enaminones, showing how the high&#8208;step economy is achieved in the enaminone&#8208;based synthetic reactions. Since the known results all involves in the cyclization, the contents of the current manuscript are divided into two main sections: the single cyclization reaction and bicyclic annulation reaction.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Ring&#8208;Opening Hydrosulfonylation of Methylenecyclopropanes for Branched Allylic Sulfones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and stereoselective ring&#8208;opening hydrosulfonylation reaction of sulfonyl hydrazides with methylenecyclopropane derivatives was developed, which produced a series of branched (E)&#8208;allylic sulfones in good yields. Meanwhile, the corresponding asymmetric reactions provided the optically active products in moderate yields with good enantioselectivity.

A Pd&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydrosulfonylation reaction of methylenecyclopropanes with sulfonyl hydrazides was developed, which produced a series of branched (E)&#8208;allylic sulfones in 52&#8722;91% yields. In addition, the asymmetric variant was also investigated, and the optically active products were obtained in moderate yields with good enantioselectivities (up to 94:6 er). Mechanistic studies suggested that the reaction proceeds through the formation of an allyl hydrazine intermediate and subsequent rearrangement to the branched (E)&#8208;allylic sulfone products. Generally, the reaction was completed in one pot under mild reaction conditions, which also featured in good functional group tolerance, broad substrate scope, high regiospecificity, branched selectivity, as well as atom and step economy.

         <title>Photochemical Preparation of (Aza&#8722;)Indolines: Diastereoselective Synthesis and Polarity Reversal Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we present the first light&#8208;mediated, diastereoselective de novo synthesis for 2,3&#8208;substituted indolines, a privileged scaffold in pharmaceuticals. The protocol was tested with various aryl and alkyl groups, maintaining high yields up to 85% across different substituents. The approach was further extended to enantioselective synthesis, yielding trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;substituted indolines with high enantiomeric excesses (94%&#8208;96%&#8197;ee). Drawbacks resulting from low efficiencies for nucleophilic radicals in previous studies were addressed by a polarity reversal strategy, incorporating electron&#8208;withdrawing groups to improve the efficiency of the initial radical addition. Finally, the methodology was utilized for the synthesis of azaindolines, a highly valuable target in pharmaceutical research. Our approach now encompasses modifications to the aromatic backbone, the use of both nucleophilic and electrophilic radicals as coupling partners, the synthesis of indolines, azaindolines, and tetrahydroquinolines, variation of protecting groups, and the diastereoselective synthesis of 2,3&#8208;substituted indolines.

Abstract
Methodology for direct fluoroalkenylation of phenolic OH function was developed using a fluorinated electrophilic reagent derived from HFO1234ze gas. Besides various functionalized phenols, tyrosine and tyrosine&#8208;based peptides were successfully conjugated under the optimized reaction conditions. Furthermore, the transformability of the fluoroalkenyl bromide motif was demonstrated to expand the space of bioconjugation via palladium catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

         <title>Titanium Catalyzed the Cross&#8208;Coupling of Nitriles and Alkyl Halides for the Synthesis of Ketones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Here, a titanium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl halides with nitriles under mild reaction conditions for the synthesis of ketones is reported. This reaction is applicable in benzyl halides, allyl halides, which are inactive substrates in the past reports, as well as non&#8208;activated alkyl halides. Mechanistic studies have suggested that Ti(III) acts both as a carbon radical initiator and a cyanoactivator. The gram&#8208;scale and derivatisation experiments also further demonstrate the potential application of the methodology.

Abstract
We reported an electrochemical oxidative carbonylation of N&#8208;phenylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amine derivatives under mild condtions without an external oxidant. Our approach demonstrated a novel electrochemical oxidative carbonylation reaction mode in which the simultaneous reaction of catalyst and substrate with the anode has been developed. Furthermore, an electrochemical C&#8722;H activation for the synthesis of cyclized pyridinium ion has also been realized. Mechanistic investigations suggested that the process involved a &#8220;PdII/PdIII/PdI/PdII&#8221; catalytic cycle, and H2 was generated at the cathode.

Abstract
Photo&#8208;induced radical silylation cyclization of N&#8208;propargylindoles/(3&#8208;phenoxyprop&#8208;1&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzenes with silylboronates or tris(trimethylsilyl)silane was finished, which gave diverse silylated fused cycles. This cascade system featured simple/mild conditions, and good substrate scopes/yields. Meanwhile, a range of scaled&#8208;up experiments, preparation of one silylated active molecule, and mechanistic exploration were performed to examine the application and reaction process.

         <title>Intermolecular 1,4&#8208;Difunctionalization of Conjugated Dienes Enabled by Palladium/Copper/Iodide Cooperation: Regioselective Construction of 3&#8208;Pyrrolines</title>

Abstract
3&#8208;Pyrrolines are important nitrogen&#8208;containing five&#8208;membered heterocycles. In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing synthetic methods for 3&#8208;pyrrolines, including direct and efficient strategy for the 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of conjugated dienes. However, most existing approaches typically require pre&#8208;activated nitrogen sources (nitrene precursor or imine) or rely on intramolecular reactions to enhance reactivity, enabling the construction of 3&#8208;pyrrolines. The synthesis of 3&#8208;pyrrolines via intermolecular reactions without using pre&#8208;activated nitrogen sources remains a challenging task. In this study, we present an intermolecular 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of conjugated dienes for the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;disubstituted 3&#8208;pyrrolines, using a tosylamide (NH2Ts) as the nitrogen source. The reaction was facilitated through the cooperation of palladium(II), copper(I) and iodide. The resulting 3&#8208;pyrrolines can be readily converted into various pyrroles and pyrrolidines through simple transformations.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Alkenylative Cyclization of 1,6&#8208;Allenynes&#8224;</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of allenynes is regarded as an efficient approach for the synthesis of versatile cyclic frameworks. However, catalytic asymmetric cascade cyclizations of allenynes are still uncommon. Herein, we present the first cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective alkenylative cyclization of 1,6&#8208;allenynes with readily available alkenylboronic acids, providing five&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles with high efficiency (up to 97% yield), broad substrate scope, and moderate to good enantioselectivities (up to 95:5 er).

         <title>Synthesis and Applications of 9/9,9&#8208;Substituted Fluorene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Fluorene derivatives have obtained broad interest in organic synthesis, materials chemistry, and pharmaceutical fields due to their unique structure, physical, chemical and photoelectric properties. Moreover, the bare fluorene molecule has a variety of reactive sites that provides the transformations to synthesize various functionalized intermediates, polymers and macrocycles. Recently, C&#8722;C bond formation is one of useful tool in fluorene molecule modifications due to the low toxicity and high efficiency. This review covers the synthesis of various fluorene&#8208;based small molecules, fluorene&#8208;based polymers, fluorene&#8208;based conjugated materials and fluorene&#8208;based nanogrids via the C&#8722;C bond formation at the 9&#8208;position of fluorene derivatives. Transition&#8208;metal catalysis and metal&#8208;free methods to synthesize different fluorene derivatives are highlighted.

         <title>Carboxylic acids as enabling directing groups in C&#8722;H activation and functionalization: A decade review</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Over the last decade, carboxylic acids have drawn profound interest in synthetic chemistry, due to its exceptional adaptability as traceless directing groups (TDGs) in the construction of complex organic molecules in the realm of C&#8722;H activation. The chameleonic nature of such privileged functionality startles each time in portraying its diversity by either trace elimination of acid group or by inherent annulation which makes an aura of distinction from other conventional DGs. In this review, the recent developments of carboxylic acid as a directing group (DG) are emphasized from the year 2017 with apparent late&#8208;stage applications. In view of synthetic chemistry context and substrate scope, innovative avenues are addressed along with multiple approaches in utilising carboxylic acids as efficient DGs.

         <title>Synthesis of spirolactones from carbonyls via carboborylation of N&#8208;sulfonylhydrazones with alkoxycarbonylalkylboronic acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward synthesis of spirolactones from carbonyls via N&#8208;tosylhydrazones is described. The process consist in the reaction between the N&#8208;tosylhydrazone and ethoxycarbonylethylboronic acid or ethoxycarbonylpropylboronic acid, leading to spiro &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones or &#948;&#8208;valerolactones respectively. The transformation takes place by carboborylation of the N&#8208;tosylhydrazone followed by oxidation of the homologated boronic acid that delivers a hydroxyester, which undergoes further lactonization to yield the spirocyclic lactone. Depending on the structure of the starting N&#8208;tosylhydrazone, thermal or photochemical protocols were applied for the key carboborylation reaction. The usefulness of the process is illustrated by the application on a variety of natural products and biologically relevant carbonyl containing molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Chloro and &#945;,&#945; &#8208;Dichloro acetamidines via the Carbenoids Addition to Inherently Low Electrophilic Carbodiimides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hitherto few explored &#945;&#8208;halomethyl amidine motif has been assembled through the addition of a lithiated (di)&#8208;halomethane (i.e. carbenoid) to easily accessible N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl substituted carbodiimides. Despite the inherent low electrophilicity of these heterocumulenes &#8211; as quantitatively determined in Mayr&#8217;s previous studies &#8211; their sp&#8208;hybridized carbon atom acts as a competent site of attack for these tamed nucleophiles. The overall high&#8208;yielding transformation featuring a genuine chemoselective profile &#8211; as documented by employing variously functionalized materials &#8211; is adaptable to the addition of dihalogenated carbenoids. Reaction products could be advantageously employed in nucleophilic substitution sequences, as well as, in further functionalization of the nitrogen atoms due to the constitutive heteroallyl&#8208;type skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>eAmidation: An Electrochemical Amidation of Aldehydes via the Oxidation of N&#8208;Aryl Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the use of electrochemistry has emerged as a powerful yet sustainable means of enabling key transformations. Amidation is one of the most frequently executed transformations in synthetic chemistry, and using an electrochemical approach, the current study has demonstrated the synthesis of amides from aldehydes and amines. Mechanistic work indicates that the reaction proceeds via the oxidation of an intermediate hydrazone to generate an acyl diazene as the acylating species. The protocol developed has enabled the synthesis of a broad range of amides, including access to pharmaceutically relevant products, directly from aldehydes without recourse for hazardous chemical oxidants and activating agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand controlled regio&#8208;divergent [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of alkynes by merging electrochemistry and nickel catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions between three alkynes, a diyne and an alkyne, or a triyne offer a straightforward and typical protocol toward all kinds of polysubstituted benzens. Herein, the synthesis of polysubstituted aromatics through electrochemical nickel catalyzed cyclotrimerization of alkynes is developed. The regio&#8208;divergent cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes was achieved by judicious choice of ligands. And tributylphosphine, sterically hindered bipyridine or &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands delivered 1,2,4&#8208; and 1,3,5&#8208;substituted aromatics with high regioselectivities respectively. Besides, the semi&#8208;intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between	diynes and alkynes are also amenable under this catalytic system. This approach operates without metal reductant, exhibits wide functional groups tolerance, ease of scalability and furnishes 75 examples with moderate to good yields, including some biorelevant compounds. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculation revealed the catalytic pathways of 1,3,5&#8208; and 1,2,4&#8208;cyclotrimerizations, and the origin of the ligand controlled regioselectivity.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydration reactions of diynes to access tetrasubstituted cyclohexenones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;carboalkoxy&#8208;3&#8208;substituted&#8208;cyclohexenones are powerful building blocks for the synthesis of a variety of bioactive target molecules. Their preparations requires multi&#8208;steps sequence involving the use of stoichiometric quantities of various reagents, while the catalytic approaches are limitited to trisubstituted cyclohexenones. We describe here an efficient catalytic approach based on gold(I)&#8208;catalysis starting from unsymmetrical diynyl mono&#8208;ester or symmetrical diynyl di&#8208;ester substrates. The carbon chain linking the two alkyne functions can bear two or one substituent, or even be unsubstituted. Regardless of the nature of the substrates and independently of its substitution, the cyclohexenone derivatives are cleanly produced.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(II) complex dispersed in imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid: Recyclable catalyst system for regioselective and chemoselective hydrobromination and hydrochlorination of alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a recyclable catalyst system combining Cu(II)O and 4,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline in a 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid for the hydrohalogenation of alkynes. The reaction efficiently yields alkenyl bromides and chlorides with good functional group tolerance and regioselectivity across a range of functionalized alkynes. Remarkably, the reaction exhibits unprecedented chemoselectivity for alkyne over alkenes in polyenynes and enables late&#8208;stage modifications to rapidly synthesize brominated polyenes. The catalyst system could be recycled for up to six runs without significant reduction of the reaction yield.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Click reactions display many of the goals desired for more sustainable chemical
conversions.  Yet, the solvent used is an often overlooked aspect in determining the
environmental impact of reactions. In the current paper we develop the first
mechanochemical method for the efficient and solvent&#8208;free SuFEx reaction of sulfonyl
fluorides with a wide range of phenols.  After outlining the optimization process, which
yields an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use and robust method, we provide indications of the very wide

natural phenols that also display other functionalities, and several gram&#8208;scale
