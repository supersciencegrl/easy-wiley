         <title>Dual HATs&#8208;mediated Catalyst&#8208;free sp3 C&#8208;H Bond Functionalization for Regioselective Radical Hydroalkylation of Ynazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct hydroalkylation of ynazoles, facilitating the efficient synthesis of linear N&#8208;&#946;&#8208;vinylazoles, is accomplished through the functionalization of sp3 C&#8208;H bonds using trace amounts of dioxygen as an initiator. This reagent&#8208;free method eliminates the need for exogenous reagents and proceeds through a radical chain mechanism involving dual hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes. Its application potential is exemplified through the implementation of scale&#8208;up operations.</dc:description>

         <title>NFSI&#8208;TEMPO Catalysed Stereoselective Synthesis of 2&#8208;Deoxyglycosides from Glycals</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;deoxyglycosides are prominent constituents of diverse naturally occurring glycans and are known to participate in crucial biological pathways. We herein demonstrate NFSI&#8208;TEMPO as an efficient organocatalyst for the formation of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glycosides from glycals. For the first time a catalytic behaviour of NFSI&#8208;TEMPO combination has been observed. The reaction conditions have been found suitable for the generation of glycosides from commercial alcohols, amino acid, sterol, phenols and monosaccharide derived alcohols. Broad range of protecting groups on both glycal and glycosyl acceptors as well as alcohols of varied reactivity were found to be compatible for the generation of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glycosides in moderate to good yields. The synthetic potential of the newly established transformation was illustrated by application in trisaccharide synthesis and gram&#8208;scale reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Directing&#8208;Group&#8208;Mediated &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Glycosylation for Synthesis of C&#8208;Alkyl Glycosides</title>

Abstract
C&#8208;alkyl glycosides play a crucial role in various bioactive compounds. However, the synthesis of C&#8208;alkyl glycosides poses significant challenges, particularly through C(sp3)&#8722;H glycosylation. Here, we report a set of reactions for constructing C&#8208;alkyl glycosides through directing&#8208;group&#8208;mediated functionalization of unactivated &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds under mild conditions. These reactions not only achieve high regioselectivity and stereoselectivity in glycosylation, but also exhibit a wide substrate scope. They are compatible with both arene and alkane substrates, as well as natural and unnatural amino acid substrates. Mechanistic studies have shown that the directing&#8208;group 8&#8208;aminoquinoline (AQ) and picolinamide (PA) may affect the chirality of the &#946;&#8208;carbon of L&#8208;valine through a sterically favorable trans&#8208;palladacycle intermediate, resulting in (R) or (S) configuration of glycosylated amino acid, respectively. These reactions are promising to provide a convenient and powerful tool for constructing C&#8208;alkyl glycosides and carbohydrate&#8208;based drugs in the future.

         <title>Gold(III) Catalysis in Ionic Liquids: The Case Study of Coumarin Synthesis</title>

Abstract
Well&#8208;defined (P,C)&#8208;cyclometalated Au(III) complexes proved to be able to catalyze the synthesis of coumarins by intramolecular hydroarylation of a broad range of aryl propiolates under mild and practical conditions (0.1&#8211;2&#8197;mol% catalyst, 25&#8211;40&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8211;24&#8197;hours). The use of an ionic liquid as reaction solvent allowed to drastically decrease the amount of Br&#246;nsted acid used to unlock the catalyst regeneration step. The effect of the nature of the acid additive and of the ionic liquid anion have been assessed. Preliminary results on the extension of this methodology to the cyclization of aryl propargyl ethers are also presented.

Abstract
A Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral C&#8722;H activation/[3+3] cyclization of 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2H&#8208;indazole&#8208;6&#8208;carboxylic acids with iodonium ylides under microwave irradiation for the synthesis of indazole&#8208;fused chromenes has been reported. The critical feature of this method is that the C&#8722;H activation of the C7&#8722;H bond of 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2H&#8208;indazole&#8208;6&#8208;carboxylic acid proceeds regioselectively in the presence of the proximate C5&#8722;H bond without the need of external oxidant. Microwave irradiation reduced the reaction time as compared to conventional heating. The detailed mechanistic study disclosed the mechanistic pathway of the reaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Rh(III)-catalyzed redox-neutral C&#8722;H activation/[3+3] cyclization of 2-benzyl-2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indazole-6-carboxylic acids with iodonium ylides under microwave irradiation for the synthesis of indazole-fused chromenes has been reported. The critical feature of this method is that the C&#8722;H activation of the C7&#8722;H bond of 2-benzyl-2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indazole-6-carboxylic acid proceeds regioselectively in the presence of the proximate C5&#8722;H bond without the need of external oxidant. Microwave irradiation reduced the reaction time as compared to conventional heating. The detailed mechanistic study disclosed the mechanistic pathway of the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
The synthesis of enantiomerically enriched &#947;&#8208;oxobutyric acid and succinic acid derivatives based on asymmetric conjugate addition of allomaltol to chalcones or bis(arylidene)acetones in the presence of readily available and recoverable C2&#8208;symmetric tertiary amine&#8208;squaramide organocatalyst has been developed. Ru(III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative transformation of pyran&#8208;4&#8208;ones bearing the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;enone unit to enantiomerically enriched succinic acid derivatives via a one&#8208;pot oxidative fragmentation of both the &#947;&#8208;pyrone ring and activated C=C bond has been elaborated. The developed methodology was applied for scalable asymmetric synthesis of GABAB receptor agonists precursors, RAR receptor agonists and monoaminooxidase (MAO) inhibitors.

Abstract
A strategy for the preparation of 4&#8208;quinoxalinone&#8208;substituted pyrazole derivatives by electrochemical functionalization of pyrazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ones is reported. Quinoxalinones, possessing significant biological activities, serve as aryl sources and participate in the transformation under electrochemical conditions without the necessity of adding extra oxidants and catalysts. This method features one&#8208;pot synthesis, scale&#8208;up and late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecule derivatives. Notably, activity testing reveals that some compounds exhibit superior inhibitory effects on the proliferation of A549 cells compared to 5&#8208;fluorouracil.

         <title>Magnesium and Calcium Bisguanidinates: Catalytic Activity in the Hydroboration of Unsaturated Molecules</title>

Abstract
The role of ligands in catalytically active metal complexes can be crucial. Herein, we present a study on the synthesis and catalytic behavior of alkaline earth bisguanidinato complexes. The reactivity of trisubstituted guanidines, specifically (iPrHN)2CNR (R=Ph, 2&#8208;Ph2PC6H4, 2&#8208;MeSC6H4), towards magnesium and calcium alkyls or amides was explored. All the compounds were found to be very active in the hydroboration of acetophenone with pinacolborane. Notably, a calcium&#8208;based complex was especially effective in the hydroboration of carbonyl compounds, demonstrating significant chemoselectivity against other reactive functional groups. This complex was also particularly effective in the double hydroboration of nitriles and moderately active in the hydroborative dearomatization of pyridine. Our experimental and DFT studies allow us to propose a mechanism in which the participation of the guanidinato ligands, along with the metal, is key to the activation of both the unsaturated species and borane.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced C&#8722;H Silylation of Azauracils with Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 367, Issue 1, January 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
C&#8722;H silylation of azauracils was developed via the combination of organic photoredox and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysis. Using 1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) as the photocatalyst, quinuclidine as the HAT catalyst, and silanes as the silyl radical source, a variety of silylated azauracils were synthesized in 43&#8211;87% yield. Moreover, pyrazinone, cinnolinone, and chromone were also compatible with this catalytic system. The reaction is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization of drugs and complex molecules, and the transformation can be easily scaled up to gram level. Mechanistic studies suggest that the silylation reaction is likely to proceed through a radical mechanism.

Abstract
A Ruthenium catalyzed C4&#8208; aminomethyl alkenylation of indoles using substituted propargylamine as an alkenylating agent and pivaloyl as a weak chelating group has been demonstrated. A variety of substituted indoles and propargylamines furnished the desired product in good yields. Control experiments indicate that the C&#8722;H cleavage step is reversible and suggest the possibility of a base&#8208;assisted internal electrophilic substitution (BIES) pathway.

         <title>Thianthrenium Salts to Arynes: Base Promoted C&#8722;N Bond Construction</title>

Abstract
Amines are widely found in natural products, drugs and pesticides. We have proposed a base&#8208;promoted method for synthesizing polysubstituted aromatic amines. The reaction does not necessitate the involvement of transition metals, provided that an equivalent base is employed. In this process, aryl thianthrenium salt serves as the precursor to arynes, which are subsequently distorted by the induction effect of different substituents. The attack of amine nucleophiles results in the formation of a series of multi&#8208;substituted aromatic amine products.

Abstract
In this study, Cs2CO3&#8208;mediated one&#8208;pot tandem dimerization/(3+3) cyclocondensation of 1,3&#8208;acetonedicarboxylates followed by substitution of alkyl or aryl halides was developed to construct functionalized 2,4,6&#8208;trialkoxy&#8208; and triaryloxybenzoates. In the effective reaction, the core benzene system was formed in a single&#8208;step process under open&#8208;vessel conditions. A plausible mechanism for this reaction is proposed and discussed herein.

Abstract
The iron (&#1030;&#1030;&#1030;)&#8208;promoted tandem cyclization of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;(allyloxy)aryl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles with diselenides has been developed for the preparation of seleno&#8208;benzo[2,3][1,4]oxazepino[4,5&#8208;a]indole derivatives. The investigation to determine the best reaction conditions indicated the use of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;(allyloxy)aryl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles (0.2&#8197;mmol) with diselenides (1.5&#8197;equiv.) and iron(III) chloride (1.5&#8197;equiv.) in acetonitrile at room temperature under air, and more than 48 examples were obtained. The reaction features access to selenized 7&#8208;membered containing nitrogen&#8208;oxygen heterocyclic skeleton, which also represents a 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization process of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;((2&#8208;methylallyl)oxy)aryl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles and diselenides.

Abstract
An efficient and operationally simple protocol to access N&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)amides/propiolamides and acrylamides via direct conversion of easily accessible nitriles (aryl/alkyl/alkynyl/vinyl) and in&#8197;situ generated CF3CHN2 as trifluoroethylating reagent has been developed. The protocol offers broad functional group tolerance under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, the conversion of trifluoroethylated propiolamide into its triazole analog via Ru&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloadditions using BnN3 clearly indicates its versatility in the synthetic applications.

Abstract
Six&#8208;membered endocyclic benzyl/allyl enecarbamates undergo a Pd&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylation process to generate endocyclic 1&#8208;azaallyl anions and Pd&#8211;benzyl/allyl cations. The ion pair then react with each other followed by reduction to ultimately give unprotected 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl&#8208;3&#8208;benzylpiperidines and 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl&#8208;3&#8208;allylpiperidines in 31&#8211;91% yields as single cis&#8208;diastereomers. These reactions represent a strategy to form unprotected &#946;&#8208;substituted piperidines, which generates elusive endocyclic 1&#8208;azaallyl anion intermediates by introducing the negative charge from the N&#8208;terminal.

         <title>Fe(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Hydroamination of 1,3&#8208;Dienes Improved by Using Triphenylphosphate as an Additive</title>

Abstract
We herein report that the combination of Fe(OTf)3 and triphenylphosphate (TPP, (PhO)3PO) has proven to be an effective catalyst for the intramolecular hydroamination of amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes with an efficiency and scope superior to previously reported methods. This catalytic system demonstrated consistent performance with diverse aminodienes as well as aminoolefins, providing five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles. We propose a Lewis/Br&#248;nsted acid cocatalysis mechanism involving proton transfer through hydrogen bonding with TPP. Catalyst system consisting of inexpensive and nontoxic iron salt and phosphate additive, relatively low loading and recyclability of catalyst, and rapid and high&#8208;yielding reaction are the advantages of this protocol.

This catalytic system demonstrated consistent performance with diverse aminodienes as well as aminoolefins, providing five- to seven-membered &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycles. We propose a Lewis/Br&#248;nsted acid cocatalysis mechanism involving proton transfer through hydrogen bonding with TPP. Catalyst system consisting of inexpensive and nontoxic iron salt and phosphate additive, relatively low loading and recyclability of catalyst, and rapid and high-yielding reaction are the advantages of this protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Cyclization of 2&#8208;(Alkynylaryl)Acetonitriles and Amines: Access to 3&#8208;Hydroxyisoindolinones</title>

Abstract
Herein, we describe an approach to the synthesis of 3&#8208;hydroxyisoindolinone derivatives via copper&#8208;catalyzed tandem cyclization of 2&#8208;(alkynylaryl)acetonitriles and amines. This reaction is compatible with 2&#8208;(alkynylaryl)acetonitriles and primary alkyl amines containing various functional groups, providing the corresponding 3&#8208;hydroxyindolinone derivatives with yields ranging from 44%&#8211;82%. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction involves oxidation of the benzylic carbon, amide formation, hydration of the alkyne and intramolecular cyclization to produce various 3&#8208;hydroxyisoindolinones. The practicality of the strategy was further demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis, late&#8208;stage functionalizations, and the post modification of natural products.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Ortho&#8208;Halogen&#8208;Substituted Aryl(Alkynyl)Phosphinates Via Aryne&#8208;Phosphite&#8208;Haloalkyne Coupling</title>

Abstract
The one&#8208;pot formation of two C&#8722;P bonds and one C&#8722;halogen bond was achieved through a mild three&#8208;component coupling reaction utilizing arynes, phosphites, and haloalkynes. In this reaction, the aryl anion, generated from the nucleophilic addition of phosphite to aryne, directly attacked the halogen of the haloalkyne. The reaction proceeded smoothly with a wide substrate scope and good functional group tolerance. This operationally simple method enables direct access to ortho&#8208;halogen&#8208;substituted aryl(alkynyl)phosphinates. The synthetic utility of ortho&#8208;halogen&#8208;substituted aryl(alkynyl)phosphinates with prospective applications in natural product synthesis, medicinal chemistry, and materials chemistry has also been demonstrated.

Abstract
A visible light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed bifunctionalization of styrenes with malonic esters and CO2 to form two C(sp3)&#8722;C bonds has been developed. The reaction proceeds at room temperature with 0.1&#8197;mol% of the organic photocatalyst (4DPAIPN) and cesium carbonate as a base at a CO2 pressure of 4&#8197;atm. This results in the production of 3&#8208;arylpropane&#8208;1,1,3&#8208;tricarboxylic acid esters in yields ranging from 48% to 99%.

The reaction proceeds at room temperature with 0.1&#8197;mol% of the organic photocatalyst (4DPAIPN) and cesium carbonate as a base at a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure of 4&#8197;atm. This results in the production of 3-arylpropane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid esters in yields ranging from 48% to 99%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>[(5+1)&#8722;1] Cyclization of Nitroepoxides to Pyridinium 1,4&#8208;Zwitterionic Thiolates for the Synthesis of Indolizine Derivatives</title>

Abstract
The synthesis of indolizine derivatives was achieved through the reaction of pyridinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates with a diverse array of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;nitro&#8208;3&#8208;aryloxiranes. Subsequent investigations unveiled a synthetic route to indolizines via a stepwise [(5+1)&#8722;1] pathway, with unstable pyridothiazines serving as transient intermediates. DFT calculations elucidated that this transformation entails sequential annulation, deacylation, desulfurization, and oxidation steps.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted, nitrogen&#8208;centered radical&#8208;initiated trifunctionalization of 5&#8208;hexenonitriles via diamidation and 1,4&#8208;cyano migration, using 1&#8197;mol% fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 as the photoredox catalyst, is reported. In this protocol, the O&#8208;acylhydroxylamine derivative acts as a bifunctional reagent, and the carbonitrile solvent also participates in the reaction. This transformation proceeds at room temperature, yielding a wide range of functionalized &#946;&#8208;amino nitriles, including the derivatives of natural products and pharmaceuticals.

Abstract
We disclose the intramolecular synthesis of 3&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;indazoles from 2&#8208;alkynylazobenzenes, promoted by a dual catalysis using AuCl3 and a ruthenium photocatalyst under visible light irradiation. This reaction proceeds through hydroamination of the alkynyl fragment. The yields are influenced by electronic factors. Control experiments suggest that both radical and polar mechanisms operate in parallel. This transformation involves C&#8722;N bond formation and a 1,2&#8208;hydride shift. Additionally, derivatization was performed to demonstrate the versatility of this methodology.

Abstract
A base&#8208;mediated cascade reaction of CF3&#8208;imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides (TFISYs) and diimides has been developed for the preparation of functionalized amidines. In the transformation, a cascade nucleophilic addition and subsequent [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of sulfoxonium ylide occur to enable an intramolecular migration of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The unexpected result of the developed protocol demonstrates the chameleonic reactivity of TFISYs.

Abstract
An asymmetric 1,4&#8208;reduction of exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, yielding diverse optically active &#945;&#8208;substituted tetralones, has been achieved using a chiral SPINOL&#8208;derived borophosphate catalyst. The enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step of the reaction involves the protonation of a highly active boron enolates intermediate. This catalytic reduction system, comprising chiral SPINOL&#8208;derived borophosphate and pinacolborane, has potential for broader application in other asymmetric reduction reactions.

Abstract
Bicyclo[3.3.0]octanes represent crucial structural motifs found in various bioactive natural compounds. In this study, we present the first metal&#8208;free formal [3 + 2] cycloadditions of alkyne&#8208;tethered cyclopropyl ketones via pyridine&#8208;boryl radical catalysis, affording bicyclo[3.3.0]octanes with high efficiency and broad substrate scope. This reaction features the generation of ketyl radical by pyridine&#8208;boryl radical and a consecutive 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig and 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cascade process.

In this study, we present the first metal-free formal [3 + 2] cycloadditions of alkyne-tethered cyclopropyl ketones via pyridine-boryl radical catalysis, affording bicyclo[3.3.0]octanes with high efficiency and broad substrate scope. This reaction features the generation of ketyl radical by pyridine-boryl radical and a consecutive 5-&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-dig and 5-&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-trig radical cascade process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Generation of Sulfamoyl Radicals via Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Fixation of Sulfur Dioxide for the Synthesis of Sulfonamides</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a new approach for the light&#8208;mediated generation of sulfamoyl radicals using sulfur dioxide as key building block and the direct application of these radicals in the synthesis of sulfonamides. In the presence of different photoredox catalysts, sulfamoyl radicals can be generated directly from SO2 or the SO2 surrogate DABSO (1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane&#8901;bis (sulfur dioxide) adduct) and N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts as nitrogen radical precursors. Trapping of the in&#8197;situ generated sulfamoyl radicals with selected electron&#8208;rich olefins affords different sulfonamides in up to 86% yield in a three&#8208;component procedure. This transformation provides a complementary approach for the in&#8197;situ generation of sulfamoyl radicals as synthetic intermediates for the assembly of the sulfonamide functionality, a privileged motif in active pharmaceutical ingredients.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Vinylation of Phosphines with Sulfones and Alcohols</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a manganese&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component vinylation strategy for the synthesis of vinylphosphines from readily available alcohols, sulfones, and phosphines via acceptorless dehydrogenative strategy. This multi&#8208;component, four&#8208;stage, one&#8208;pot protocol offers a stereoselective approach, overcoming the challenges associated with achieving these products through the hydrophosphination of terminal alkynes. The reaction utilizes sulfones and common alcohols to access both (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;substituted vinylphosphines (using methanol) and &#945;&#8208;substituted vinylphosphines (using primary alcohols) in yields ranging from 52% to 99%, with E:Z stereoselectivity of 95:5 to 99:1. Importantly, the synthesized branched&#8208;substituted vinylphosphines exhibited superior ligand performance in the copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl bromides with pyrazole compared to the commercially available PPh3 and diphenyl(vinyl)phosphane.

Abstract
This work discloses a strategy for the implementation of ON&#8208;ON organometallic catalytic processes using photoresponsive phosphine ligands. The approach leverages on the regiodivergent reactivity of mono&#8208; and bimetallic gold complexes that results from &#960;&#8208; vs &#963;,&#960;&#8208;activations of alkynyl&#8208;substituted urea substrates, for the selective formation of either dihydroquinazolinone or indole&#8208;carboxamide products, via intramolecular hydroamidation.

Abstract
Organocatalytic dearomatization of &#946;&#8208;naphthols has been achieved via a 1,6&#8208;conjugated addition of 2&#8208;naphthols to alkynyl 7&#8208;methylene&#8208;7H&#8208;indoles in&#8197;situ generated from &#945;&#8208;(7&#8208;indolyl)methanols. In the presence of racemic phosphoric acid, a series of tetrasubstituted allenes was obtained in high yields. Particularly, with the aid of chiral phosphoric acid, asymmetric dearomatization of &#946;&#8208;naphthols was investigated, affording axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes with moderate enantioselectivity.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Engineering of Oleate Hydratase for the Synthesis of Small Chiral Alcohols without Decoy Molecule</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Small and chiral secondary alcohols are sought&#8208;after compounds that are frequently used in the synthesis of biologically active compounds. However, their stereochemically correct synthesis remains a challenge for the chemical industry. Synthetic routes are restrained by multiple steps and thus low atom efficiency. Here we employ engineered variants from the oleate hydratase from E. meningoseptica to produce chiral C5&#8208;C8 secondary alcohols within a single step. First, we established a two&#8208;phase system (2&#8208;PS) to trap the volatile substrates/products which facilitated semi&#8208;rational mutagenesis in the active site and tunnel of the enzyme. These efforts led to variants with an up to 20&#8208;fold increase in catalytic activity and &gt;99% ee, notably, without the use of a decoy molecule. Computational analysis indicated structural changes in the tunnel radius, ligand transport and energy profiles, which gave us hints to explain the enhanced performance of the variants. Interestingly, scaling up the reaction volume demonstrated significant increases in product concentrations, leading up to a 100&#8208;fold increase in comparison to the current benchmark. This new 2&#8208;PS and the engineered enzyme variants offer a promising approach for a scalable, asymmetric hydration of small unactivated alkenes, which would drastically ease the access to chiral alcohol&#8208;based pheromones or drugs.

         <title>Organophotocatalytic Site&#8208;Selective Radical Deuteration at Sterically Hindered Benzylic Positions by Consecutive Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>

Abstract
Site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond activation or exchange labeling with hydrogen isotope are of vital importance, in particular for high&#8208;specific&#8208;selectivity deuteration of pharmaceuticals. While catalytic approaches relying on closed&#8208;shell manifolds have been well documented for efficient delivery of deuterium at sterically less hindered benzylic positions, complementary strategies target sterically bulky benzylic positions remain a long&#8208;standing challenge. We herein disclose a mild, versatile approach to achieve efficient and selective radical deuteration by merging organophotoredox catalysis and bromine radical catalysis. This open&#8208;shell strategy provides the unparalleled ability of the convergent unification of readily available quinoxalinones and para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) and D2O through a simultaneous highly cross&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and chem&#8208;selective radical coupling&#8208;H/D exchange approach. Furthermore, the long&#8208;standing challenge of the incorporation of deuterium to sterically bulky benzylic positions has been addressed through this approach.

         <title>Photoredox Hydroacylative Dearomatization of Indoles with Aromatic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein we reported for the first time a photocatalytic dearomative hydroacylation reaction of electron&#8208;deficient indoles with readily available aromatic acids through a phosphoranyl radical&#8208;assisted deoxygenative process. A range of racemic and optically active 2&#8208;acylindoline derivatives were obtained in good yields (up to 94%) with good diastereoselectivity. The synthetic robustness is highlighted by the enantioselective dearomatization of indoles and the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and pharmaceutical molecules. This protocol features broad substrate scope and mild reaction conditions, providing a reliable entry to developing deoxygenative strategies in dearomatization reactions. Preliminary mechanistic studies and DFT calculations suggest that a Giese&#8208;type radical addition pathway should be involved.

         <title>Disclosing the Intra&#8208;Catalyst Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in Tetrahydropyran&#8208;Based Dipeptidic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we describe how minor structural modifications to our bifunctional organocatalysts based on sugar amino acids (SAAs) can alter the network of non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) within the catalyst, leading to significant changes in their catalytic activity. This is attributed to the intra&#8208;catalyst NCIs, which induce conformational changes that are reflected in the transition state of the rate&#8208;determining step of the Michael addition of aldehydes to trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes. Through kinetic experiments, conformational analysis, and DFT calculations, we found that the presence of a methoxy group at the C4 position of the tetrahydropyran ring reduces the catalytic activity by a factor of five compared to the catalyst without the methoxy group. Additionally, we have identified the different intra&#8208;catalyst NCIs, both attractive and repulsive, that drive the conformational changes, ultimately modifying the energy levels of the transition states of the rate&#8208; and enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step of the reaction.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;C Coupling of Alkenyl Boronates and Bromodifluoroacetates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The reaction of alkenyl boronates and bromodifluoroacetates in the presence of copper powder and TMEDA as the catalytic system was developed. The corresponding C&#8722;C coupling products were obtained in 35&#8211;93% yield. The method tolerated a variety of functional groups, namely, phenol, (thio)ether, protected amino&#8208;, hydroxy&#8208;, ketone, and carboxylic acid moieties, as well as various saturated carbo&#8208; and heterocycles, and was compatible with multigram scale&#8208;up (to 76&#8197;g). The diastereoselectivity of the process was typically low so that ca. 1:1 E/Z isomeric mixtures were formed from pure E or Z alkenyl boronates. Further functional group transformations demonstrated the utility of the prepared compounds as valuable building blocks for synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Based on the obtained results and the literature data, a plausible reaction mechanism was proposed involving the formation of radical and organocopper intermediates.

Abstract
A series of 3,5&#8208;diaryl&#8208;4&#8208;selanylisoxazoles were synthesized in 56&#8211;97% yields (most cases&gt;80% yield), which was first accomplished via bromide&#8208;catalyzed selenylation of 2&#8208;alkyn&#8208;1&#8208;one O&#8208;methyloximes using element Se and boronic acids as the selenyl source. Compared to traditional strategies, this method proceeded under simple catalytic system. Broad substrate scope, good functional group compatibility, metal&#8208;free conditions, and easy operation was showed in this protocol. Additionally, this method was easily amendable to gram&#8208;scale reaction and synthetic transformations. Furthermore, preliminary mechanistic experiments demonstrated that a radical pathway was possibly involved in this work.

Abstract
An iodine&#8208;catalyzed C3&#8208;arylation of indoles with cyclohexanones to selectively synthesize 2&#8208;(indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenols has been described. Mechanism studies indicate that the oxygen atom in 2&#8208;(indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenols is originally from DMSO. This cascade involving dehydration condensation, selective oxygenation, dehydrogenation, and aromatization was achieved in one pot under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Organoselenyl Quinolines through the Reduction of Alkynes Mediated by Electrophilic Organoselenium Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A methodology for the synthesis and functionalization of quinolines was developed. This approach involves the cyclization of 2&#8208;amino arylalkynyl ketones to 3&#8208;(organoselanyl)&#8208;4&#8208;iodoquinolines through a sequential reaction pathway. The process includes: (i) in&#8197;situ formation of an electrophilic organoselenyl species, (ii) activation of the alkyne&#8216;s carbon&#8208;carbon bond via a seleniranium ion intermediate, (iii) anti&#8208;nucleophilic attack of iodide on the activated triple bond, and (iv) subsequent condensation. The resulting 3&#8208;(organoselanyl)&#8208;4&#8208;iodoquinolines were demonstrated to be versatile substrates, efficiently undergoing Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling to produce 4&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;quinolines and Ullmann&#8208;type reactions to yield the corresponding sulfides. Furthermore, the 4&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;quinolines were readily converted into selenophene derivatives via halogen&#8208;promoted electrophilic cyclization, highlighting the broad applicability of the developed method.

Abstract
Herein, we report a mild, operationally simple method for synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroketones through selective single defluorination of trifluoroketones and subsequent difluoroalkylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds at room temperature within a single step. By successfully difluoroalkylating unfunctionalized ethers and benzyl radical precursors, we demonstrated the broad applicability of this method. The mechanistic study supports that the success of the reaction is probably attributed to the dual roles of trimethylsilyl chloride under the photocatalyzed conditions: 1) fluoride anion scavenger; and 2) chlorine radical source which promote hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction.

         <title>Research Progress on Organocatalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Atropisomeric Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The burgeoning field of asymmetric catalysis has significantly advanced the construction of axially chiral compounds, recognized for their distinct three&#8208;dimensional structures that are relevant in drug discovery, catalyst design and material science. Particularly, the atropisomeric aldehydes, characterized by a chiral axis and the presence of an aldehyde functionality, are of increasing value and interest in chemistry&#8208;related domains, such as serving as privileged chiral catalysts for activation of amines. In recent years, elegant environmentally&#8208;friendly metal&#8208;free catalytic asymmetric methodologies based on de novo formation of (hetero)aromatic rings, dynamic kinetic resolution and desymmetrization have been established to build this fascinating class of atropisomers. In this review, we would like to highlight recent research progress on enantioselective synthesis of atropisomeric aldehydes by means of organocatalysis and biocatalysis, including their scopes, limitations, mechanisms, synthetic applications and provide some insights into future development.

         <dc:description>Herein, we disclose a readily available phenothiazine derivative as an oxidizing organic photocatalyst, that serves to induce radical cascade sulfonylation/cyclization reaction of enaminones. A variety of 3&#8208;sulfonyl chromones have been obtained with moderate to excellent yields. This catalytic platform proceeds under metal&#8208;free conditions with a wide substrate scope and broad functional group compatibility, which unlocks the new reactivity of phenothiazine derivatives and adds significant synthetic values to &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Catalyst Speciation to Achieve Room Temperature Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Aminations with Aryl and Heteroaryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The amination of aryl halides with palladium catalysts (Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination) is a widely used transformation in synthetic and drug discovery chemistry. In this report, we demonstrate that a monometallic 2&#8208;phosphinoimidazole Pd catalyst exhibits comparable or enhanced reactivity when compared to all ligands screened for room temperature amination of aryl chlorides with secondary amines. The di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine derivative showed extremely high reactivity while the di&#8208;isopropyl variant led to almost complete loss of catalytic activity.  Computational and experimental mechanistic and kinetic studies indicate that a monometallic Pd structure rather than a bimetallic Pd structure is key to fast catalysis. The di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine ligand has fast catalysis because it thermodynamically disfavors the formation of a much less active bimetallic Pd complex. A wide substrate scope is demonstrated for the arylation of secondary amines with aryl chlorides using our new catalyst system.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A 1,3&#8208;iodoesterification of 2&#8208;substituted indoles with trihaloacetic acid, iodination reagent, and hypervalent iodine(III) compound was developed as an acid&#8208;promoted C&lt;sub&gt;sp2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;H/C&lt;sub&gt;sp3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;H dual functionalization reaction to furnish 3&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8208;trihaloacetoxymethyl indoles. The one&#8208;pot 1,3&#8208;iodoesterification/hydrolysis of the trihaloester group provided 3&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8208;pivaloylmethyl indoles via the rearrangement of the pivaloyl group. The reaction proceeded through a trihaloacetic acid&#8208;assisted electrophilic activation of the iodination reagent after the formation of an indolyl(mesityl)iodonium trihaloacetate.</dc:description>

Abstract
Owing to multiple reactive sites, such as an acidic &#945;&#8208;carbon and an isocyano group, isocyanide esters can successfully participate in the synthesis of various five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles through the cycloaddition reactions under metal&#8208;catalyzed systems. Considering the unique and versatile functionality of this synthon, in this review, we have highlighted silver and copper&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions of isocyanide esters over the last decade.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative and Deconstructive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Acrylic Acids with Ketone&#8208;Derived Dihydroquinazolinones</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, an iron&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the aromatization&#8208;driven deconstruction and decarboxylation of ketone&#8208;derived dihydroquinazolinones in reaction with unsaturated carboxylic acids is reported.  A diverse range of fluoroacrylic acids and cinnamic acids reacted effectively with dihydroquinazolinones, yielding essential monofluoroalkenes and alkenes with excellent stereoselectivity. Additionally, spiro&#8208;dihydroquinazolinones served as suitable substrates, facilitating the synthesis of valuable quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones featuring alkene motifs.  This protocol is notable for its operational simplicity and versatility, enabling the chemical diversification of active molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Au(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Hydroarylation of Allenes for the Synthesis of Tetrahydrodiazepines or Tetrahydrodiazonines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allenes tethered to pyrroles undergo Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation leading to tetrahydrodiazepines or tetrahydrodiazonines. The regioselectivity of the reaction is governed by both the substitution pattern of the allene and the nature of the Au(I) ligand. Hence, alkyl&#8208;gem&#8208;disubstituted allenes preferentially lead to tetrahydrodiazepines via 7&#8208;exo&#8208; cyclizations, while aryl&#8208;substituted allenes preferentially lead to tetrahydrodiazonines via 9&#8208;endo cyclization when a phosphite ligand is used. Enantioselective reactions have been developed with the SEGPHOS chiral ligand, leading to chiral heterocycles with high enantioselectivity (up to 96% ee). In addition, DFT calculations have streamlined the regioselectivity (7&#8208;exo vs 9&#8208;endo) of these gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced intramolecular crossed [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of allene&#8208;tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes was reported in this paper. The reactions were conducted under mild conditions using Iridium(III) catalyst FirPic as a photosensitizer for energy transfer, affording bridged bicyclic alkenes in moderate to good yields with excellent regioselectivity and stereoselectivity through the regulation of substituents at the olefin&#8217;s terminal position. Meanwhile, the computational study explained the special region control assisted by sulfonyl radicals in detail.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Mg(SPh)2 has been found to be a highly active catalyst in photocatalytic alkylation reactions of active methylene compounds with nonactivated alkenes. The desired reactions proceeded smoothly to afford the corresponding alkylated products in high yields with low catalyst loadings (0.2&#8208;0.3 mol%).

Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that hydroxylamines derived from nitrosoarenes may serve as crucial intermediates rather than anilines, and free organic radicals may not participate in the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

Abstract
A variety of structurally diverse spirocyclohexane oxindoles featuring a quaternary carbon centre have been successfully constructed through an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation of isatin&#8208;derived enals with &#945;&#8208;cyano&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methylenones. This domino process exhibits a wide substrate tolerance, operates under mild conditions, and yields products with high enantioselectivities.

         <title>2&#8208;Aminoindoles and 2&#8208;Iminoindolines as Viable Precursors of Indole&#8208;fused Nitrogenated Polyheterocycles.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of architecturally complex polyheterocyclic structures embedding the indole ring represents a growing field of interest. Carbolines and their partially dehydro derivatives, pyrazinoindoles, indoloindoles, azepinoindoles and other medium&#8208;sized derivatives are only some examples of indole&#8208;containing polycyclic compounds featured by enhanced pharmacological and photophysical properties. Among various synthetic protocols to prepare these important target compounds those based on the utilization of 2&#8208;aminoindoles and 2&#8208;iminoindolines are gaining increasing interest because of the ease of their preparation. The presence of a couple of reactive sites in these derivatives is instrumental for the assembling of polyheterocyclic structures exploiting single step operations featured by efficient cascade or tandem processes. Several of these methods employ catalyzed reactions which can be developed for the asymmetric synthesis of enantiopure compounds. This review provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date report on the currently available methods for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aminoindoles and 2&#8208;iminoindolines and their application to the preparation of polyheterocyclic derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Cascade Synthesis of 5&#8208;Alkylidene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Hydro&#8208;oxycarbonylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrofunctionalization of alkynes and, more precisely, the intramolecular hydro&#8208;oxycarbonylation (cycloisomerization) of acetylenic acids, has been widely employed as a key step in cascade processes for the construction of valuable and complex molecules. However, in contrast with other aminonucleophiles, no method has been reported for the reaction between primary monoamines and non&#8208;activated alkynoic acids. Hence, a procedure has been devised for the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective preparation of 5&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams via a copper&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction between alkynoic acids and amines. The developed protocol proves to be scalable and demonstrates significant tolerance to a wide range of structurally diverse alkynoic acids and amines bearing various functional groups, as evidenced by 60 high&#8208;yielding examples. An exhaustive experimental and computational analysis of the reaction is also provided to unravel the nature and role of the copper catalyst, the observed regioselectivity and the mechanism of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Hydroelementation of Unsaturated C&#8208;C Bonds Using 3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; Transition Metal Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Divergent hydroelementation reactions offer a cost&#8208;effective synthetic protocol to prepare two or more products starting from same set of reactant molecules by altering one or more reaction parameters. This strategy is quite helpful in functionalizing unsaturated C&#8208;C bonds into several value&#8208;added chemical compounds by using various organic and metal&#8208;based catalysts. In this regard, catalysts derived from 3d metals have come to the fore, providing an alternative to heavier transition metals and rare&#8208;earth elements. In this review, we summarize and elucidate the recent developments of divergent hydroelementation of alkenes and alkynes using the first&#8208;row transition metal complexes by categorizing them into three classes: (1) Catalyst and ligand&#8208;controlled; (2) Reaction component&#8208;controlled and (3) Substrate&#8208;controlled. Given the importance of hydroelementation reactions, we hope this review will be helpful to the organic chemistry community.</dc:description>

Abstract
A copper&#8208;powder&#8208;mediated tandem hydroamination cyclization&#8211;hydrocyanation of alkyne&#8208;tethered ketoximes is described by using TMSCN as a commercially available cyanating reagent. This methodology provides an alternative strategy for the synthesis of a series of structurally important cyano&#8208;substituted cyclic nitrones. The hydrocyanation process exhibits distinct regioselectivity depending on the substituent pattern of the alkyne moiety. Moreover, the synthesized products were shown to be capable of undergoing various derivatization reactions.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Acyl and Thiocyano Pyridylation of Alkenes with Aldehyde and NH4SCN</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
&#946;&#8208;pyridinyl ketones and &#946;&#8208;pyridinyl thiocyanates are commonly used as an essential organic synthesis intermediate and widely present in various drug molecules and bioactive molecules. Herein, a photoredox catalyzed acyl and thiocyano pyridylation of alkenes with aldehydes and NH4SCN via HAT and SET strategy respectively is described. This protocol employs more readily accessible aldehydes and NH4SCN as radical precursors under redox&#8208;neutral conditions. Moreover, high atom economy, simple and accessible starting materials, late&#8208;stage modification and wide substrate scope including primary, secondary alkyl aldehydes and aromatic aldehydes enable the potential application in the organic synthesis.

An approach for the synthesis of quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diamines is reported using a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction of o&#8208;phenylenediamines and isocyanides. Various quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diamines could be obtained in 25%&#8211;95% yields at 100&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8197;h. The key to the success of this protocol involves the formation of two C&#8722;N and one C&#8722;C bonds via the double insertion of isocyanide.

Abstract
Asymmetric alkylation is one of the most important methods for synthesis of chiral unnatural &#945;&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;amino acids. Herein, we reported the asymmetric alkylation catalyzed by Cu/(4S,2R)&#8208;tBu&#8208;Phosferrox catalyst. This catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic performance in the asymmetric alkylation at catalyst loading as low as 1.0&#8197;mol %, giving the desired products with up to 95% yield and &gt;99% ee, which is the best result to date. Furthermore, this method was successfully applied to the scalable practical synthesis of unnatural amino acid 4,5&#8208;OH&#8208;Leu, which could be directly used in the total syntheses of phalloidin, phallacidin, other four phallotoxins and six virotoxins.

         <title>Decyanative Arylation via Radical Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Arenes, especially heteroarenes, are crucial structural motifs in organic chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, and materials science. The introduction of (hetero)aryl groups using readily available feedstocks to modify organic chemicals is a significant topic. Nitriles are ubiquitous and versatile building blocks in organic synthesis. This review summarizes recent advances in decyanative arylation via radical cross&#8208;coupling reactions. In these transformations, (hetero)aromatic nitriles undergo one&#8208;electron reduction to form persistent radical anion intermediates. Simultaneously, transient carbon centered radicals are generated through cleavage of C&#8722;H, C&#8722;C, C&#8722;X (where X=B, N, Si, S, Br) bonds through single electron transfer or hydrogen atom transfer processes. Finally, a radical&#8208;radical coupling reaction followed by CN elimination leads to the formation of aromatized products.

         <title>Manganese Promoted Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Phosphine Chlorides with Disulfides for the Synthesis of Thiophosphanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein we reported a manganese promoted reductive cross&#8208;coupling approach to construct P&#8722;S bond. This is a practical method for the synthesis of mono&#8208;thiophosphanes, bis&#8208;thiophosphanes and tri&#8208;thiophosphanes under mild conditions. The strategy featured a wide range of substrate scope including various disulfides and phosphine chlorides, constructing diverse sulfur&#8208;containing organophosphorus compounds from inodorous and readily available starting materials. The employment of reductive conditions avoided the generation of phosphorothioates (PV) by&#8208;products. Ultimately, gram&#8208;scale synthesis and applications were explored. Extensive experiments indicated that the phosphine radical cascade process was involved in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Enzymatic asymmetric synthesis of all stereoisomers of aliphatic, vicinal diols in conventional and non&#8208;conventional media</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral, vicinal diols are of high interest for academic research and industrial applications. For synthesizing chiral diols, enzymes are important catalysts due to their high selectivity and ability to work under tolerable temperature and no pressure. In this study, two consecutive enzyme&#8208;catalyzed steps were used for the asymmetric synthesis of aliphatic, vicinal diols with high product concentrations and chiral purity. The reaction comprised a ligation step employing lyases and a subsequent reduction step using oxidoreductases. Either in an aqueous buffer or an organic solvent, the potentially biobased aldehydes acetaldehyde, propanal, butanal, and pentanal were used as substrates.	Here, all possible stereoisomers of 2,3&#8208;butanediol,
3,4&#8208;hexanediol, 4,5&#8208;octanediol, and 5,6&#8208;decanediol were produced with isomeric content values between 72% and &gt; 99%, and concentrations and conversions between 4.1 and 60 mM. This work shows how four symmetric, chiral, vicinal diols can be synthesized by combining enzymes in a modular way, including exemplarily scaling.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of mesoporous Cu&#8322;O  nanospheres for green synthesis in the enantioselective boron conjugate addition of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated chiral compounds in aqueous phase</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral organoboron compounds are essential intermediates in various significant reactions. However, there are still few efficient catalysts for their synthesis. This paper reports a novel catalytic material for chiral asymmetric boron conjugate addition reactions: mesoporous Cu&#8322;O nanospheres (M&#8208;Cu&#8322;O). M&#8208;Cu&#8322;O is approximately 0.55 &#956;m, exhibiting dense and uniformly distributed worm&#8208;like pores. It features a specific surface area of 15.7 m&#178;/g and an average pore size of 14.3 nm. Under the conditions of Toluene:H2O = 9:1, with a chiral ligand amount of 3.6 mol% and no additional base, it achieves a high yield (98% yield) and impressive enantioselectivity (98% ee ) for the template substrate chalcone using only 3.0 mol% of the catalyst. Notably, the catalyst can be easily recovered and maintains robust catalytic performance after seven cycles, yielding 92% and an ee value of 90%. This work presents a mild and effective method for synthesizing chiral boron compounds in an aqueous phase, significantly enhancing the application potential of mesoporous copper oxide nanospheres.</dc:description>

Abstract
Herein, we report regiodivergent nucleophilic attack of Grignard reagents to 2&#8208;alkynyl aziridines. Under the catalysis of a Cu(I)&#8208;diphosphine complex, benzylic Grignard reagents add to the carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond of the aziridines to deliver &#945;&#8208;allenylamines in moderate to excellent yields; the direct addition of the Grignard reagents to the aziridines in the absence of catalyst provided homopropargylic amine derivatives. Both reactions could proceed in highly enantiospecific ways. Further synthetic manipulations of these products enable rapid access to diverse useful heterocyclic molecular scaffolds.

         <title>Iron Catalyzed Radical Alkylation of Cyclic Ketimines with Olefins via Metal Hydride Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Here, we present an innovative approach to achieve Minisci&#8208;type alkylation of cyclic N&#8208;ketimines, enabling access to a diverse range of valuable alkylated sulfonyl ketimines via iron hydride hydrogen atom transfer. More than 35 examples are shown with a wide range of substrates. Additionally, this system is easy to operate and can be efficiently scaled up. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the alkyl radical process involved and the air acts as the sole oxidant in this system.

         <title>Mechanochemical Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of In&#8208;Situ Generated Reformatsky Zn&#8208;Enolates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;arylations of carbonyl compounds have shown to be a useful strategy for the late&#8208;stage synthesis of &#945;&#8208;arylesters. However, the use of strong basic conditions and difficult handling necessary for the in&#8208;situ preparation of enolates is a major disadvantage. On the other hand, using Reformatsky zinc&#8208;enolates can overcome these challenges. Moreover, mechanochemical in&#8208;situ activation of zinc is even more beneficial. Herein, we report mechanochemical Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling between in&#8208;situ generated Reformatsky Zn&#8208;enolates and aryl halides. This operationally simple procedure affords &#945;&#8208;arylated esters or amides using an affordable catalytic system. Reactions were carried under air and ambient conditions using granulated zinc without the need for its pre&#8208;activation. Less reactive and commercially more affordable aryl bromides afforded the desired products in good to excellent yields in comparison to aryl iodides. The optimized conditions were applied in scale&#8208;up reaction and in the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;arylated esters, amides, and derivatives of natural products.

Abstract
A copper and DMAP relay&#8208;catalyzed strategy has been achieved for the modular synthesis of 2&#8208;alkoxy quinolines from a three&#8208;component coupling of terminal alkynes, anthranils, and alcohols. In this protocol, a novel quinoline pyridine salt is formed and serves as a key intermediate in the formation of 2&#8208;alkoxy quinolines. The reaction has a broad substrate scope of each reaction partners, affording diversified 2&#8208;alkoxy quinoline products in generally good yields.

         <title>Regioselective Hydrothiolation of Terminal Alkynes using Half&#8208;Sandwich Ni(ii) Catalysts bearing Bidentate NHC&#8208;Carboxylate Ligands</title>

Abstract
A half&#8208;sandwich nickel complex containing an NHC&#8208;carboxylate chelate ligand (i.&#8201;e., [Ni(&#951;5&#8208;Cp)(&#954;2&#8208;C,O&#8208;NHC)]) derived from the (S)&#8208;leucine has been identified for the selective hydrothiolation of terminal acetylenes toward challenging Markovnikov&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;vinyl thioethers, even with aryl alkynes. The activity and selectivity exhibited by the nickel complex are comparable, if not superior, to those of complexes of rhodium reported to be the best catalysts to date for the Markovnikov addition in the thiol&#8208;yne reaction. The experimental data are consistent with the participation of the coordinated carboxylate group in the catalytic reaction as an intermolecular acid&#8208;base co&#8208;catalyst, favoring the formation of nickel&#8208;thiolate intermediates.

Abstract
The visible light&#8208;induced one&#8208;pot tandem photolysis of areneazo&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;nitro)propanes was achieved to give carbazole and indole derivatives. The aryl azidation followed by an intramolecular C&#8722;H amination smoothly proceeded under visible light irradiation without any photocatalyst, demonstrating the synthetic versatility of areneazo&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;nitro)propanes. The in&#8197;situ generation of aryl azide intermediates was executed under mild visible light photolysis conditions, showcasing the synthetic versatility of areneazo&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;nitro)propanes, a safe alternative of diazonium salts.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Nitroalkanes with Aliphatic Grignard/Cerium and Organozinc Reagents for Synthesis of Functionalized Nitrones</title>

Abstract
This study aims to develop a more efficient, functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant approach using stable nitroalkanes and reductive coupling reactions with aliphatic Grignard/cerium and organozinc reagents. The treatment of nitroalkanes with aliphatic Grignard reagents in the presence of a catalytic amount of CuF2 and stoichiometric amount of CeCl3 affords various nitrones in good yields as single isomers. The reaction of tertiary nitroalkanes with organozinc reagents affords various functionalized nitrones without CuF2 or CeCl3. These reductive coupling reactions proceed without the loss of functional groups such as alkene, alkyne, benzyl ether, chlorine, ester, and nitrile moieties. Nitrones can also be used as precursors for [3+2] cyclizations with electron&#8208;withdrawing alkenes and alkynes.

         <title>Three&#8208; and Seven&#8208;membered Annulenones as a Lewis Base Catalyst for Enantioselective meso&#8208;Epoxide Opening</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
This is the report on the Lewis base catalysis of annulenones. Additionally, the synthesis of chiral annulenone catalysts and their application in asymmetric ring&#8208;opening reactions of meso&#8208;epoxides is shown. Annulenones, such as cyclopropenones and tropones, function as Lewis bases owing to their inherent polarity caused by aromaticity, resulting in the activation of silicon tetrachloride, which catalyzes the ring&#8208;opening reaction of meso&#8208;epoxides. Moreover, various chiral annulenone catalysts have been designed and synthesized, and microwave irradiation has been shown to improve the synthetic efficiency of chiral tropones. The chiral annulenones successfully catalyzed the asymmetric ring&#8208;opening reaction of meso&#8208;epoxides, resulting in the formation of 1,2&#8208;chlorohydrins in a high yield and high enantioselectivity (up to 90% ee in 96% yield). These results represent the example of three&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered annulenones as a chiral Lewis base catalyst.

Abstract
In this paper, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition has been revealed to synthesize the bishomocubanone derivatives in moderate to excellent yield under mild conditions. This method demonstrated a broad substrate scope and excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, affording cubane precursors and a series of bishomocubanones. Meanwhile, a hundred&#8208;gram scale experiment of this method has been employed to synthesize cubane precursors with 98% yield.

Abstract
Herein, we report a conceptually new, general, and efficient approach for the synthesis of valuable ortho&#8208;azido&#8208;1,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole and one&#8208;pot synthesis of ortho&#8208;triazoletetrazole derivatives mainly via PIDA mediated N&#8722;N cleavage of the azole ring of 2H&#8208;indazoles using TMSN3. This current methodology represents an array of unsymmetrical ortho&#8208;azidotetrazole and ortho&#8208;triazoletetrazole derivatives with wide functional group tolerance in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. The practical utility of this reaction was showcased through successful scale&#8208;up synthesis and a variety of subsequent derivatizations of ortho&#8208;azidotetrazole products. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the reaction proceeds through a radical pathway.

         <title>Photoinduced Hydrogen Atom Transfer Activation of Benzylic C&#8722;H Bonds Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible light, as an efficient and renewable resource, has gained significant attention in organic synthesis due to its mild, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly nature. Among the various photocatalytic processes, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) has become a crucial mechanism for the activation of C&#8722;H bonds, with a particular focus on the functionalization of benzylic C(sp&#179;)&#8722;H bonds. This review shows recent developments in the area of photoinduced HAT and its use in benzylic C&#8722;H bonds functionalization. We discuss halogen atom radicals, N&#8208;centered radical, O&#8208;centered radical, S&#8208;centered radical and C&#8208;centered radical in HAT processes, and influence on reaction selectivity and substrate versatility. The potential of photoinduced HAT to bypass the need for transition metal catalysts and directing groups positions it as a promising approach for constructing intricate organic molecules with high atom economy and sustainability. This review aims to offer a detailed summary of the current state of photoinduced HAT, providing insights into its potential uses in synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Visible light, as an efficient and renewable resource, has gained significant attention in organic synthesis due to its mild, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly nature. Among the various photocatalytic processes, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) has become a crucial mechanism for the activation of C&#8722;H bonds, with a particular focus on the functionalization of benzylic C(sp&#179;)&#8722;H bonds. This review shows recent developments in the area of photoinduced HAT and its use in benzylic C&#8722;H bonds functionalization. We discuss halogen atom radicals, N-centered radical, O-centered radical, S-centered radical and C-centered radical in HAT processes, and influence on reaction selectivity and substrate versatility. The potential of photoinduced HAT to bypass the need for transition metal catalysts and directing groups positions it as a promising approach for constructing intricate organic molecules with high atom economy and sustainability.

         <title>Multifunctionalization of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Boranes by a Single Metal&#8208;free Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective access to densely functionalized boranes, with identical or distinct functional groups at the boron center, has great potentials in materials science, organic synthesis and drug discovery. However, assembling multifunctional boranes was heavily dependent on hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (HAT) at high temperatures, hazardous radical initiators, metal photocatalysts and HAT reagents, respectively. Simultaneously, competitive side reactions such as polymerizations and regioisomers formation remain highly challenging. Herein, a programmable multifunctionalization of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) boranes is developed for the first time powered by a single, metal&#8208;free photocatalyst, in which boryl radicals from sequential substituted boranes are generated instead of polymerizations. This robust and versatile catalytic system leads to an extremely broad variety of boranes incorporated with diverse alkyl or alkenyl groups in high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorus Fluoride Exchange (PFEx) Click Chemistry: 2&#8208;Substituted&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyclotriphosphazene (SACP) Hubs for Diversity Oriented Clicking</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorus Fluoride Exchange (PFEx) is a new click chemistry technology that hinges on the creation of innovative hubs to unlock its potential and broaden its applications. In this study, we outline some guiding principles for PFEx hub development and validate these principles by developing a new hub, 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyclotriphosphazenes (SACPs). These SACPs serve as versatile PFEx hubs with stable functionality and orthogonal reactivity, exemplifying their utility within the Diversity Oriented Clicking (DOC) framework. We demonstrate that SACPs interact with various 1,3&#8208;dipoles, enabling the synthesis of phosphorus&#8208;rich compounds through sequential cycloaddition and PFEx reactions, thus pioneering new synthetic routes for wide application of click chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>PTC in the Polyenolate&#8208;Mediated [10+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition for the Synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Disubstituted Amino Acid Precursors</title>

Abstract
The manuscript describes a formal [10+2] higher&#8208;order cycloaddition between 2&#8208;arylideneindan&#8208;1&#8208;ones and &#945;&#8208;alkylidene azlactones as higherene precursors and higherenofiles respectively. The reaction is realized under Br&#248;nsted&#8208;base catalysis utilizing the phase transfer catalysis approach. The key intermediate is an isobenzofulvene&#8208;derived polyenolate which acts as a 10&#8208;electron component in the higher&#8208;order cycloaddition. By using this strategy, a series of structurally diverse compounds containing a polycyclic hydrocarbon scaffold was prepared in 79&#8211;99% yields. In addition, the potential of the obtained [10+2]&#8208;cycloadducts has been confirmed by transformations, including the synthesis of a highly&#8208;valuable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted N&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;aminoester.

Abstract
This work provides an in&#8208;depth analysis of the factors governing the different reaction pathways in the acid&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of gem&#8208;vinylsilyl alcohols with aldehydes. The study evaluates the impact of both the ligands attached to silicon and the choice of the Lewis acid on the reaction outcome. Additionally, computational studies offer valuable insights into the mechanism that control these distinct pathways. The process enables the chemo&#8208; and stereocontrolled formation of a variety of structural frameworks, offering significant potential for the generation of a broad range of molecular architectures.

Abstract
Herein, we report a novel and practical strategy to access &#945;&#8208;chloroketones from esters bearing diverse (hetero)aromatic, aliphatic, alkynyl and alkenyl substituents with transient chloromethyllithium under continuous flow conditions. This highly chemoselective method enables a fast (on a time scale of &lt;5 s), efficient and straightforward access to a broad substrate scope (up to 99% yield) with a remarkable throughput of &#8764;10.6 g/h.

         <title>Photoinduced Cu&#8208;Catalyzed C2&#8208;H Functionalization of Azoles using Aryl Thianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Development of a mild approach for the highly efficient synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl azoles, which are typically synthesized using high temperature, ligands and preactivated substrates, is highly desirable. Here, we report a mild and efficient photo&#8208;induced Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling to obtain C2&#8208;functionalized azoles using aryl thianthrenium salt (Ar&#8208;TTs). The reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope and an excellent functional group compatibility and serves as an ideal strategy for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals. Additionally, this method enables the efficient synthesis of azole&#8208;based polycyclic compounds.

Abstract
Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) enzymes have been extensively exploited to produce differently substituted arylalanine analogues, but their use in the stereoselective synthesis of aliphatic fatty amino acids has never been addressed. In this work, a two&#8208;step hydroamination&#8208;hydrodesulfurisation process has been investigated for the production of aliphatic L&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids from thienylacrylic acids, easily accessible by condensation from the corresponding arylaldehydes. Wild&#8208;type PALs from Planctomyces brasiliensis and Streptomyces rimosus were selected as the most promising candidates and improved by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, thus unlocking the hydroamination of a broad panel of 10 different thienylacrylic acids bearing aliphatic and aromatic substituents. The subsequent hydrodesulfurisation step, accomplished by means of inexpensive Raney nickel in mild conditions and aqueous medium, afforded the corresponding aliphatic &#945;&#8208;amino acids in 10&#8211;63% overall isolated yield and perfect enantiopurity. This chemo&#8208;enzymatic process represents the first example of aliphatic amino acid production using PALs, circumventing a major limitation of those biocatalysts.

         <title>Recent Advances in Photoredox/Chromium dual&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonyl Addition Reactions: A Review</title>

Abstract
The chromium&#8208;catalysed Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama&#8208;Kishi (NHK) reaction is a very dependable technique for alcohol synthesis and is extensively used in the complete synthesis of natural compounds. The majority of these reactions occur via a reductive&#8208;radical&#8208;polar crossover (RRPCO) mechanism, which is crucial for the transformation of reactive radical intermediates. The production of radicals using photoinduced catalytic reactions is now among the most effective approaches. The photoinduced chromium&#8208;catalysed addition reaction to carbonyl compounds is an effective technique for alcohol synthesis that integrates the benefits of photocatalysis with chromium catalysis. Photocatalysis significantly enhances the diversity of radical production, hence broadening the substrate scope in the chromium&#8208;catalysed NHK reaction. This paper primarily examines the photoredox chromium dual&#8208;catalysed carbonyl addition process for alcohol synthesis, including numerous methods for radical generation.

         <title>Photoinduced Metal&#8208;Free Hydrocarboxylation of Allylamines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, we disclose a new photochemical process to prepare &#947;&#8208;amino acids from allylamines and formic acid salts. The investigated redox&#8208;neutral hydrocarboxylation process produces high yields across a wide range of functionalized allylamine substrates with excellent regioselectivity. The developed operationally simple protocol can be readily scaled with low photocatalyst loading (from 1% up to 0.02&#8197;mol%) without the need for any precautions to exclude air or moisture. The mechanistic working model utilizes a thiol&#8208;catalyzed radical chain process, delivering the hydrogen atom and CO2 from formic acid salt across the alkene substrate through the carboxylate radical (CO2&#8901;&#8722;), a crucial reactive intermediate.

         <title>Photocatalytic C&#8722;I Bond Borylation and Phosphorylation of Diaryliodonium Salts with Excellent Atom&#8208;Economy</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Highly atom&#8208;economic conversion of diaryliodonium salts represents an underdeveloped but highly desirable domain. Most reactions involving these species only utilize single aryl group of the diaryliodonium salts and produce an equivalent of aryl iodide as waste. Herein, by further transforming the side&#8208;product aryl iodide, we report an overall new two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot strategy that allows photocatalytic C&#8722;I bond borylation of diaryliodonium salts and ensures effective conversion of both aryl groups of the diaryliodonium into the relevant arylboronic esters. Mechanistic investigations suggest that electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor complex is formed between the photocatalyst phenothiazine and diaryliodonium salt substrate. Upon visible light irradiation, this complex produces aryl radical and aryl iodide. With addition of a base in the second step, the reducing ability of the photocatalyst is enhanced via proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process, thereby aryl iodide produced in the first step is reduced to yield aryl radical again. Both aryl radicals generated in the two steps react with B2(OR)4 to produce the corresponding monoarylation product in a quantitative yield. The strategy is also applicable for C&#8722;I bond phosphorylation of diaryliodonium salts, ensuring that both aryl moieties can be phosphorylated with high efficiency.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Enantioselective Intermolecular Allylation of Quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones</title>

Abstract
An enantioselective C&#8208;, O&#8208; and N&#8208; intermolecular allylic reaction of quinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones has been developed. The reaction between 3&#8208;hydroxy quinolone and Boc&#8208;protected MBH adducts with Pd&#8208;catalysis provided a series of 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diones in 20&#8211;95% yield accompanied by 69&#8211;96% enantioselectivity. In addition, the O&#8208;allylic alkylation could occur by varying the organo&#8208;catalyst and Boc&#8208;protected MBH adducts from benzaldehyde. Furthermore, the N&#8208;allylation of 3&#8208;O&#8208;protected quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones with allylic acetates was also realized (40&#8211;92% yield, 78&#8211;97% ee).

         <title>Regioselective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Protoboration of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A regioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed protoboration of alkynes has been developed, utilizing diboron as the borylation source for the efficient synthesis of alkenylborates. The reaction proceeds via cobalt&#8208;boryl intermediates, diverging from conventional Co&#8722;H chemistry. By fine&#8208;tuning the phosphine ligand side chains, we achieved excellent reactivity and regioselectivity across a wide range of internal and terminal alkynes. This Co&#8208;catalyzed method offers significant advantages in terms of both efficiency and environmental impact, making it an attractive approach for the synthesis of complex organic molecules.

Abstract
An unprecedented cascade reaction of simple inactive alkenes, azo compounds and H2O to produce valuable poly&#8208;substituted oxazolidinones is reported herein. The transformation possesses exclusive regioselectivity and features mild reaction conditions and a broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies indicated this transformation underwent a N&#8208;alkylation&#8208;hydroxylation&#8208;transesterification cascade process. This research not only pushes the boundaries of the essential difunctionalization of alkenes but also exploits a new chemistry for azo compounds.

         <title>From gem&#8208;Dichlorocyclobutenones to Cyclobutenols: Unveiling a Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Reduction&#8208;Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation Cascade</title>

Abstract
Cyclobutenones constitute an appealing class of substrates in catalytic asymmetric transformations leading to diversely substituted enantioenriched four&#8208;membered carbocycles, which are eliciting a growing interest in medicinal chemistry. Whilst several synthetically useful enantioselective conjugate addition reactions have been reported, the catalytic enantioselective reduction of the carbonyl group of simple cyclobutenones remains an elusive transformation. Herein, we disclose the discovery of a novel allylic reduction&#8208;asymmetric transfer hydrogenation cascade, catalyzed by a Noyori&#8208;Ikariya ruthenium complex, from readily available gem&#8208;dichlorocyclobutenones, leading to 2&#8208;chlorocyclobutenols with high optical purities, which can be engaged in postfunctionalization reactions enabling access to substituted four&#8208;membered rings.

Abstract
A synthetic method to prepare &#948;&#8211;&#954;&#8208;chloroketones, &#8208;esters and &#8208;amides that relies on the copper(I)&#8208;mediated chlorination at the unactivated tertiary &#948;&#8211;&#954;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of ketones, carboxylic esters, and amides by dichloramine&#8208;T is presented. By exploiting the ability of the N&#8208;chloramide to act as both the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and chlorination reagent, the reactions were shown to be site&#8208;selective with halogenation only occurring at the unactivated tertiary carbon center situated four to ten C&#8722;C bond distances away from the carbonyl functional group in the substrate. The site&#8208;selectivity of the chlorination protocol was further exemplified by the installing of the C&#8722;Cl bond at the distal position of one example containing two tertiary carbon centers and the late&#8208;stage functionalization of two drug molecules.

Abstract
Visible light&#8208;induced site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkylation and alkenylation of 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes with maleimides at room temperature via dual catalysis in an aqueous medium has been disclosed. This operationally simple and mild approach enables the selective formation of alkylation and alkenylation products up to 92% yield under silver&#8208;free conditions with excellent substrate scope. For the mechanistic examination, KIE, H/D labeling experiments, light on&#8208;off experiments, and quantum yield measurements were carried out. Moreover, the present approach for the alkylation and alkenylation of 2&#8208;aryl heteroarenes is suitable for scalable synthesis.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Direct Synthesis of Alkyl&#8208;Substituted Phosphonodithioates from White Phosphorus (P4)</title>

Abstract
The direct synthesis of organic phosphorus compounds from white phosphorus (P4) is a longstanding challenge in organic synthesis. Here, we present a novel visible light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component functionalization reaction that integrates P4, disulfide compounds, and N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) esters to produce alkyl&#8208;substituted phosphonodithioates in a one&#8208;pot process. Using 2,4,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) as a photocatalyst, blue LEDs (456&#8197;nm) as the light source, and N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) as the reducing agent in an acetone&#8208;toluene solvent system, this method achieves moderate to good yields of structurally diverse phosphonodithioates. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, ensures complete conversion of P4, avoids chlorination, and uses inexpensive, readily available starting materials, offering potential for large&#8208;scale applications.

Abstract
Dibenzoxasilepine is an important skeleton in both synthetic organic and medicinal chemistry. Here, we have succeeded in obtaining it in higher yield than the conventional method, elucidating for the first time the rearrangement tendency of the two aromatic rings during the ring expansion reaction on the cyclic pentacoordinate silicon intermediate.

         <title>Phosphonamidates of Camphorsultam: Versatile Building Blocks for the Synthesis of P&#8208;Chiral Phosphorous(V) Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Camphorsultam was utilized for the optical resolution of P&#8208;chiral phosphorous compounds. After chromatographic separation of diastereomeric RP&#8208; and SP&#8208;phosphonamidate intermediates, subsequent substitution reactions with phenol derivatives yielded P&#8208;chiral phosphonic acid aryl esters with excellent enantioselectivities. In these processes, chiral sulfonamide of camphorsultam demonstrated superior abilities as an optical&#8208;resolving agent and a good leaving group. This method was applied to the synthesis of P&#8208;chiral phosphinic esters, phosphonamidates, and thiophosphonate diesters.

         <title>Electrochemically Driven Site&#8208;Selective C(sp2)&#8722;H Bond Hydroxylation of N&#8208;Substituted Anilines</title>

Abstract
Organic synthesis has long been fascinated by phenolic compounds, especially their exploration of selectively hydroxylating arenes utilizing H2O as a hydroxyl source. However, phenols&#8242; low redox potential and strong reactivity frequently result in unwanted overoxidation byproducts. Here, we present an electrochemical strategy to overcome this difficulty by using electricity as an oxidant and facilitating the para&#8208;selective hydroxylation of N&#8208;protected anilines. This process exhibits excellent regio&#8208;selectivity, compatibility with diverse functional groups, and adaptability by handling an extensive range of substrates. Noteworthily, the technique provides a sustainable substitute for paracetamol synthesis and terminal acetylene&#8208;holding hydroxylated products, proving the suitability of this strategy for drug synthesis. Significantly, mechanistic investigations suggest the possible radical pathway and water as a hydroxyl source for this strategy.

Abstract
A variety of fluorinated 2H&#8208;chromenes and dihydroquinolines was synthesized by virtue of gem&#8208;difluoromethylene allenes as versatile coupling partners to participate in the transition metal&#8208;catalysed cascade C&#8722;H activation/[5+1] annulation of 2&#8208;alkenylphenols/anilines. This protocol features specific chemo&#8208;/regioselectivity, redox&#8208;neutral manner and good compatibility, providing a straightforward synthetic route to intriguing motifs with the equipment of attractive fluoroalkenyl moiety. The distinctive gem&#8208;difluorine effect induced an unexpected protonolysis of &#963; carbon&#8208;metal bond, thus accounting for the observed selectivity via sequential C&#8722;H activation/allene insertion/protonolysis/cyclization/&#946;&#8208;F elimination process.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrative C2&#8208;Arylation of Oxazoles, Benzoxazoles, and Benzimidazoles with Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A step&#8208;economic method for C2&#8208;arylated azoles via Pd&#8208;catalyzed denitrative arylation of nitroarenes and azoles is reported. This protocol employs synthetically upstream nitroarenes as arylating reagents and proceeds through the selective cleavage of the C&#8722;NO2 and C&#8722;H bonds. Various nitroarenes and nitroheteroarenes were coupled with oxazoles, benzoxazoles, and methylbenzimidazoles, achieving yields of up to 95%. The method's utility is exemplified by its application in the synthesis of Flunoxaprofen. This strategy reduces synthetic steps and minimizes pollution, offering substantial cost&#8208;effectiveness and environmental benefits. Furthermore, the relatively inert C&#8722;NO2 bond in nitroarenes enables late&#8208;stage functionalization or stepwise coupling reactions, providing a complementary method for C2&#8208;arylation of azoles.

         <title>Photoinduced Methylthio Radical Generation from Methylthiophosphonium Salt</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The production of methylthio radical typically relies on gaseous methanethiol or dimethyl disulfide. Herein, we present a new and straightforward method for the photogeneration of methylthio radical from methylthiophosphonium salt, enabling the synthesis of methylthiophenanthridines via charge transfer complex strategy. In this approach, the methylthiophosphonium salt acts as the electron acceptor, while 2&#8208;isocyanobiaryls serve as the electron donors. This strategy is distinguished by its simplicity in both conditions and operation, and can be extended for the generation of various alkyl(aryl)thio radicals.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Dearomative [5+1] Spiroannulation and Formal [5+2] Cyclization of Indoles with Enynones: Divergent Synthesis of Spiro&#8208;Indolenines and Dihydrocyclohepta[b]Indolones</title>

Abstract
We developed a temperature&#8208;controlled intermolecular dearomative [5+1] spiroannulation and [5+2] cyclization of indoles with enynones, smoothly delivering a variety of spiroindolenines and dihydrocyclohepta[b]indolones under 40&#8201;&#176;C and 80&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. A three&#8208;step cascade reaction was also realized by using OTBS or NHBoc containing enynones in the reaction with the indole under the identical condition. And a novel valuable highly&#8208;oriented three&#8208;dimensional indole&#8208;based tetracyclic scaffold was produced in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities. Additionally, various spiroindolines and spirooxindoles were facilely produced through simple operations.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed a temperature-controlled intermolecular dearomative [5+1] spiroannulation and [5+2] cyclization of indoles with enynones, smoothly delivering a variety of spiroindolenines and dihydrocyclohepta[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]indolones under 40&#8201;&#176;C and 80&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. A three-step cascade reaction was also realized by using OTBS or NHBoc containing enynones in the reaction with the indole under the identical condition. And a novel valuable highly-oriented three-dimensional indole-based tetracyclic scaffold was produced in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities. Additionally, various spiroindolines and spirooxindoles were facilely produced through simple operations. This highly efficient domino-reaction represents an emblematic method for the preparation of indole-based polycycles through the intermolecular pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Conjugation of amino acids to bioactive molecules has emerged as a promising strategy for optimizing pharmacological profiles of lead candidates in drug discovery. This study describes a photocatalytic Minisci&#8208;type transfer reaction of N&#8208;acyl amino acids into various N&#8208;heterocycles. Notably, this protocol enables direct conjugation of amino acids into heterocyclic C&#8722;H bonds, eliminating the need for prefunctionalized substrates. A diverse array of N&#8208;heterocycles, amino acids, oligopeptides, and drugs were used to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach. In addition, the importance of this approach is demonstrated through its application in the DNA&#8208;encoded library chemistry. Various synthetic transformations and preliminary mechanistic investigations were also explored.

         <title>Regioselective Palladaelectro&#8208;Catalyzed Chlorination of Arenes in an Undivided Cell</title>

Abstract
Chloroarenes constitute fundamental building blocks in organic synthesis and are widely applied in the synthesis of bioactive compounds, fine chemicals, materials, natural products and pharmaceuticals. Electrochemical chlorination has been recognized as a promising synthetic method for accessing chloroarenes, but it has proved challenging to achieve in practice as shown by the limited number of existing protocols. Herein, we report on a highly general electrocatalytic strategy for the regioselective chlorination of various substituted heteroaryl scaffolds in an undivided cell setup, using ethyl chloroformate as the chlorine source. This strategy offers several practical advantages over existing methodologies, including an operationally simple experimental setup, exceptional functional group tolerance, and the possibility to form either the mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;chlorinated products in high selectivity depending on the choice of catalyst loading, electric current and ethyl chloroformate equivalents. The practicality and selectivity of the protocol were demonstrated by the successful chlorination of an array of densely&#8208;substituted arene frameworks as well as by the synthesis of chlorinated bioactive molecules.

         <dc:description>








Abstract
Isochromenes, oxygen&#8208;containing bicyclic compounds, have gained significant attention in organic synthesis due to their versatile reactivity and prominence in biologically active natural products. This review highlights recent developments in the synthesis of isochromenes, with a focus on efficient and selective methodologies. Traditional metal&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular ring&#8208;closure reactions have been the cornerstone for isochromene formation, but recent efforts have expanded to include new strategies that enhance functionalization and scalability. By examining key advancements in the field, this article provides a critical assessment of the current state of the art involving isochromene synthesis and its ongoing challenges.

         <title>Selective Enzymatic C&#8722;H&#8208;Oxyfunctionalization for the Efficient Synthesis of Grevillic Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
In this study, a selective C&#8722;H&#8208;oxyfunctionalization using an unspecific peroxygenase (UPO) enabled an efficient biosynthetic route for the synthesis of grevillic acid (GA), a natural antioxidant. The route commenced with the release of o&#8208;coumaric acid (oCA) from trans&#8208;2&#8208;coumaric acid glucoside (trans&#8208;CAG) using commercially available &#946;&#8208;glucosidase from almonds. In addition, a cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans photoisomerization of cis&#8208;CAG was implemented to increase the synthetic access of oCA. The key step, the para&#8208;hydroxylation relative to the existing hydroxyl group of oCA, was accomplished by an UPO with full conversion and 93% isolated yield. Despite its name, the UPO turned out to exhibit excellent regioselectivity in this C&#8722;H functionalization, requiring only H2O2 as a cosubstrate.

         <title>Bidentate NHC&#8208;Containing Ligands for Copper Catalysed Synthesis of Functionalised Diaryl Ethers</title>

Abstract
Diaryl and heteroaryl ethers are important and common motifs in drug discovery and agrochemicals. Here we present a catalytic system for the copper catalysed arylation of phenols with aryl halides. Bidentate N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands provide a well&#8208;defined catalytic system that enable low loading of copper in effective coupling reactions (0.5&#8197;mol% Cu or lower). The reaction scope of aryl iodides and aryl bromides is developed, that is tolerant of functional groups and a library of biaryl ethers with lead&#8208;like properties is prepared. The presence of excess ligand (in a 1:3 ratio) is shown to be optimal to prevent catalyst degradation, presumably by avoiding decomplexation of the ligand. This is also supported by the catalytic results obtained with pre&#8208;formed copper complexes. The kinetics of the reaction are examined and shown to be first order in copper, supportive of a well&#8208;defined catalyst species, first order in phenol and aryl iodide, and zero order in base under the developed conditions. Computational studies performed using Minnesota MN15&#8208;L parametrisation method support an oxidative addition&#8208;reductive elimination sequence with both steps having similar enegies and the reductive elimination occurring through an intimate ion pair intermediate.

Abstract
Merging the stereoisomeric mixture of substrate into a single product through stereospecific transformation is a challenging but higher&#8208;order synthetic strategy, which perfectly meets the demand of cost control in the precise chemical production. In this work, the stereoconvergent synthesis of Z&#8208;allylic boronates was realized with protoborylation of E/Z&#8208;mixed 1,3&#8208;dienes catalyzed by a novel copper&#8208;guanidine complex. The reaction could proceed smoothly under very mild conditions with good functional group tolerance, and convert diverse aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes into the desired Z&#8208;1,4&#8208;addition products with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivities in minutes. Detailed mechanistic studies also helped to disclose the origin of stereoconvergency. Both E&#8208; and Z&#8208;diene were found directly undergoing a rapid borylation without E/Z isomerization of C=C bond, followed by a convergent formation of the same thermodynamically stable allylcopper intermediate before the slow protonation step occurred.

&lt;p&gt;Merging the stereoisomeric mixture of substrate into a single product through stereospecific transformation is a challenging but higher-order synthetic strategy, which perfectly meets the demand of cost control in the precise chemical production. In this work, the stereoconvergent synthesis of &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-allylic boronates was realized with protoborylation of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-mixed 1,3-dienes catalyzed by a novel copper-guanidine complex. The reaction could proceed smoothly under very mild conditions with good functional group tolerance, and convert diverse aryl-substituted 1,3-dienes into the desired &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-1,4-addition products with excellent chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivities in minutes. Detailed mechanistic studies also helped to disclose the origin of stereoconvergency. Both &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-diene were found directly undergoing a rapid borylation without &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; isomerization of C=C bond, followed by a convergent formation of the same thermodynamically stable allylcopper intermediate before the slow protonation step occurred.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A metal&#8208;free base&#8208;promoted [4+3] cycloaddition reaction of N&#8208;thioacyl imines in&#8197;situ generated from &#945;&#8208;amido sulfones with &#945;&#8208;chlorohydroxamates is described. The reaction allows the straightforward synthesis of 1,3,5&#8208;thiadiazepin&#8208;6(7H)&#8208;one derivatives in 44~90% yields. Moreover, a gram&#8208;scale reaction and a product transformation were conducted, which further increased the diversity of products.

         <title>Reconstructive Synthesis of Fluorinated Dihydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a] indolones by a Cyclohexadione Cut&#8208;to&#8208;Fuse Strategy</title>

Abstract
We describe a fluorinative ring&#8208;cleavage reaction that breaks C&#8722;C bonds in cyclic &#946;&#8208;diketones bearing an aryl moiety by using N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) in the presence of inorganic carbonates (Cs2CO3 or K2CO3) in methanol at room temperature within one hour. The generated fluorinated keto acid esters bearing ortho&#8208;nitro aryl groups were transformed into fluorinated dihydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indolones (DHPIs) via reductive cyclization using B2(OH)4 followed by amidation in the presence of K2CO3. This &#8220;cut&#8208;to&#8208;fuse&#8221; strategy enables the reconstructive synthesis of valuable fused heterocycles from relatively simple cyclohexadiones.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deuterium&#8208;labeled compounds play a pivotal role in physical organic chemistry, life sciences, and materials science. This has resulted in a surge of interest in deuterium&#8208;labeled active pharmaceutical ingredients in recent years. In this study, we present a continuous flow Raney nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange process that boasts compatibility with a wide spectrum of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles and pharmaceutical compounds. The broad applicability of the developed method was demonstrated through successful labeling of various purine bases, imidazoles, pyridines, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including complex structures like abacavir and remdesivir. Control experiments revealed Raney nickel's crucial role in the exchange process, showcasing the superiority of the continuous flow approach over batch reactions. Furthermore, a scaled&#8208;up experiment demonstrated the robustness of the catalyst.</dc:description>
