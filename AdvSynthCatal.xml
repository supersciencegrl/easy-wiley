         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Allylation of Vinyl Carbinols &#8211; Total Syntheses of Carotenoids by Julia&#8208;Kocienski Olefination</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium catalyzed &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;allylation of vinyl carbinols from ionones (or conjugated carbonyls) with 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzothiazole (BT&#8208;SH) provides versatile C&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; dienyl benzothiazolyl (BT) sulfides. This Pd(dppe)Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;catalyzed &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;allylation is highly selective for free allylic alcohols in the presence of allylic acetates, resulting in 3&#8208; or 4&#8208;acetoxy C&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; dienyl BT&#8208;sulfides suitable for xanthophyll synthesis. The corresponding C&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; dienyl BT&#8208;sulfones undergo Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination reactions with C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; 2,7&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;octatrienedial under mild conditions to produce carotenoids natural products. Efficient synthesis is achieved for a range of carotenoids including xanthophylls such as iso&#8208;zeaxanthin, zeaxanthin, and lutein as well as carotenes like &#946;&#8208;carotene, &#949;&#8208;carotene, and 9'&#8208;&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenyl&#8208;carotene.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Nucleophilic Lewis Base&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloadditions for Synthesis of Spirooxindoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spirooxindoles are privileged scaffolds in diverse bioactive natural products and pharmaceuticals, significant achievements for the construction of these molecules have thus been made in the past years. Among them, organocatalysis, in particular, nucleophilic Lewis base catalysis, has recently emerged as an efficient and reliable method for the preparation of diverse and valuable functionalized spirooxindoles. According to different kinds of nucleophilic catalysts, we summarize and classify three catalytic strategies; these are tertiary amine&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions, NHC&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions, and tertiary phosphine&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions, respectively. Through these methods, potential bioactive spirooxindole skeletons owning various functional groups can be produced to enrich the small organic molecule library. In this review, we describe a comprehensive and updated advances of nucleophilic Lewis base catalytic cycloaddition reactions for the construction of spirooxindoles. Meanwhile, the related mechanism and the application of these annulation strategies in natural product total synthesis will be highlighted in detail.</dc:description>

         <title>Blue Light&#8208;Promoted Synthesis of Thiochromenopyrroledione Derivatives via Titanium Dioxide&#8208;Catalyzed Dual Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bond Formation with Thioanisole and Maleimide Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Under anaerobic conditions, thioanisole derivatives bearing a thiomethyl group participated in dual carbon&#8208;carbon bond&#8208;forming reactions with maleimide derivatives in the presence of titanium dioxide. Blue light irradiation facilitated these reactions, producing thiochromenopyrroledione derivatives and nearly equimolar quantities of succinimide derivatives. Specifically, a thiochromenopyrroledione derivative formed from thioanisole and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;benzylmaleimide was achieved with a 43% yield after 12 hours of blue light exposure (&gt;420 nm), approaching its theoretical maximum yield of 50%. Without titanium dioxide, the reaction remained dormant. Our investigations with five varieties of 4&#8208;substituted thioanisoles and four &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;substituted maleimides as precursors resulted in the synthesis of 20 distinct thiochromenopyrroledione derivatives with moderate to high yields. From observed substituent effects, we postulate that this reaction proceeds through a charge transfer from thioanisole to the conduction band of titanium dioxide during blue light irradiation, initiating the one&#8208;electron oxidation of thioanisole and subsequent generation of &#945;&#8208;thioalkyl radicals via deprotonation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Pentatomic Spirolactams via Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed [4+1] Spirocyclization of Aromatic Amides with Cyclic Diazo Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
In this paper, a non&#8208;Cp* cobalt&#8208;catalyzed [4+1] spirocyclization of aromatic amides with cyclic diazo compounds for the synthesis of pentatomic spirolactams is presented. The reaction features with high regio/chemoselectivity by using cheap and commercially available base metal catalyzed C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H bond functionalization. Moreover, the practicability of this developed protocol is further demonstrated by the removal of the directing group and gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

         <title>Yttrium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydroamination and Sequential Intermolecular Hydroamination/Endocyclization of Vinylsilanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The intermolecular anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamination of vinylsilanes was achieved utilizing five silyl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;terphenoxide yttrium complexes. The highest activity was observed for the most sterically encumbered triphenylsilyl&#8208;substituted complex. Excellent activity and complete anti&#8208;Markonikov selectivity were obtained for a variety of benzylic and aliphatic primary and secondary amines. Interestingly, the reaction with 2&#8208;picolylamine produced the hydroaminoalkylation product rather than the hydroamination product. Reaction of dimethyldivinylsilane resulted in a range of 1,4&#8208;azasilinanes via sequential hydroamination/endocyclization in good yields.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective 1,4&#8208;Phosphinoylcyanation of 1,3&#8208;Enynes with Diarylphosphine Oxides and TMSCN</title>

Abstract
We established a strategy for the copper&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component 1,4&#8208;phosphinoylcyanation of 1,3&#8208;enynes with diarylphosphine oxides and trimethylsilyl cyanide. The reaction produced various tetrasubstituted phosphinoyl&#8208; and cyano&#8208;containing allenes with high functional group compatibilities in good yields under mild reaction conditions. A preliminary reaction mechanism involving the formation of phosphinoyl radicals and their regioselective addition to 1,3&#8208;enynes was also proposed.

Abstract
Herein we describe Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of &#945;&#8208;pinene derivative &#8211; pinacarvone O&#8208;methyl oxime (1) with aryl halides (2). Surprisingly, the formation of the C&#8722;C coupling product was accompanied by an unexpected opening of the pinene bicyclic structure. The (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;aryl&#8208;4,4,5&#8208;trimethylcyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;one O&#8208;methyl oxime (3) was formed as the resulting product. The reaction conditions of the developed synthetic procedure were carefully optimized and the reaction mechanism was supposed on the basis of data obtained by structural and computational methods.

         <title>Maleimide&#8208;Controlled Formation of Indanonylpyrrolinediones and Spiroindanonylpyrrolinediones via Rh(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation of Sulfoxonium Ylides</title>

Abstract
A substrate&#8208;controlled [4+1] annulation of sulfoxonium ylides with maleimides via Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation is developed. The reaction of sulfoxonium ylides with 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;arylmaleimides in the presence of AgNTf2 diastereoselectively provides diversely functionalized indanonylpyrroline&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione derivatives. Furthermore, in the presence of AgBF4, the subsequent reaction with maleimides leads to biologically intriguing various spiroindanonylpyrroline&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones. This methodology offers a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalysed Kinetic Resolution of Secondary and Tertiary 3&#8208;Amido Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A synthetic method to prepare enantioenriched secondary and tertiary 3&#8208;amido allylic alcohols efficiently that relies on their stereoablative enantioselective kinetic resolution (KR) catalysed by a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid is described. Achieved at room temperature, the stereoablative asymmetric KR protocol was shown to exhibit excellent functional group tolerance and provided product yields up to 50%, and ee and s values up to 99% and &gt;200. The synthetic utility of the divergent catalytic protocol was exemplified by the 1&#8197;mmol scale preparation of one tertiary example and its reduction or bromination to give the corresponding 1,3&#8208;amino alcohol and 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,3&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives. The suggested asymmetric KR pathways provide rare instances of accomplishing enantioselective discrimination through the dehydration or imine&#8208;enamine tautomerisation/retro&#8208;aza&#8208;aldol reaction of the respective 2&#176; and 3&#176; alcohol substrates.

         <title>Recent Advances in the 1,2&#8208;Diarylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Alkenes are a fascinating functional class that can be converted into various structures. A desirable and durable synthetic method for forming two C&#8722;C bonds across an olefin is the dicarbofunctionalization of olefins, catalyzed by transition metals. This method enables a rapid expansion of molecular complexity in a single step. Among the myriad of efficient strategies for alkene difunctionalization, the 1,2&#8208;diarylation mode stands out primarily due to its remarkable ability to incorporate two hindered aryl groups across the C=C bond in a versatile and straightforward manner. This review covers the recent advances in the 1,2&#8208;diarylation of alkenes from 2018 to 2023, focusing on different transition metals employed as catalysts.

The inside cover picture illustrates a starship satellite for the asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between 2,4&#8208;dienals and various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters in the organocatalytic universe. Leveraging the power of organocatalysis, the catalytic process facilitates the creation of a diverse range of densely functionalized cyclohexenes bearing multiple stereogenic centers with high levels of stereoselectivity (up to &gt;20:1 dr and &gt;99% ee). Details can be found in the Research Article by Sarah Yunmi Lee and co&#8208;workers. (B. Kim, S. Lee, S. Y. Lee, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2023, 365, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202300756)

Abstract
Synthesis of benzoxazoles via amide formation from amino phenols and &#945;&#8208;diazoesters using dicobalt octacarbonyl as a solid CO source is reported. Our methodology provides a strategy for synthesizing substituted benzoxazoles with methylene linker between the benzoxazole and aromatic ring systems. Substrates with different substituents were employed to produce corresponding benzoxazoles. The synthesized compounds were characterized by using standard spectroscopic and analytical techniques including single crystal XRD studies.

         <title>Enantioselective Assembly of &#945;, &#946;&#8208;Diamine Acid Derivatives via Three&#8208;Component Reaction of &#945;&#8208;H Diazoacetates with Sulfonamides and Imines</title>

Abstract
An asymmetric three&#8208;component reaction of &#945;&#8208;H diazoacetate with sulfonamide and imine has been developed under the co&#8208;catalyzation of Rh2(OAc)4 and a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA), which proceed through Mannich&#8208;type interception of transient ammonium ylide. The reaction offers a convenient access to &#945;, &#946;&#8208;diamine acid derivatives with two adjacent chiral centers in 59%&#8208;74% yields with 91%&#8208;99% ee and 92:8 to&gt;95:5 dr. Moreover, the generated products could be easily converted to free chiral diamines and other useful chiral motifs.

Abstract
Various symmetrical and unsymmetrical indolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazoles were synthesized in a one&#8208; or two&#8208;step reaction using &#945;&#8208;haloketones and indoles. The developed methodology demonstrated controllable chemoselectivity and gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Furthermore, this transformation was compatible with other &#945;&#8208;functionalized ketones, such as &#945;&#8208;hydroxy and &#945;&#8208;acetyloxy ketones, allowing for the formation of their corresponding indolocarbazoles. Additionally, our photochemical research has revealed that all the indolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazoles exhibited dual fluorescence, with the relative intensity varying depending on the solvent.

Abstract
We developed a cascade reaction of diynone and o&#8208;hydroxy aromatic aldimine under mild conditions. This protocol is proposed to proceed through sequential [3+2]/[4+4] cycloaddition and proton transfer processes, thus providing an efficient way for the synthesis of a variety of dihydropyrrole fused eight&#8208;membered ring scaffolds.

         <title>Synthesis of Monofluorocyclohexene via Photocatalytic Defluorinative [4+2] Annulation of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes with Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, a photocatalytic system for defluorinative [4+2] annulation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes with unactivated alkenes is realized. This protocol was compatible with a broad scope of unactivated alkenes, affording the diverse monofluorocyclohexene products in 30&#8211;95% yields. Furthermore, the value of this method was demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis, late&#8208;stage functionalization and synthesis of various valuable and complex monofluorocyclohexene derivatives.

         <title>Purple&#8208;Light Promoted Thiol&#8208;ene Reaction of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Here we present a catalyst&#8208;free protocol for the purple light&#8208;mediated anti&#8208;Markovnikov functionalization of alkenes with thiols. Crucial to the generation of the thiyl radical was the formation of a key photo&#8208;active complex. More than 30 thioether products were obtained, demonstrating tolerance towards different functional groups and scalability up to 5&#8197;mmol of alkene. Two different reaction conditions have been developed, varying both the solvent and the amount of thiol. Depending on the alkene structure, water can be used as an alternative to dichloromethane as a solvent, thus increasing the sustainability of the whole process.

         <title>Synthesis of Two Isomers of pyrido/benzo[b][1,4]selenazines: A Selective Catalyst&#8208;Dependent Formation of C&#8722;N and C&#8208;Se Bonds</title>

Abstract
This work describes the selective synthesis of a series of pyrido/benzo&#8208;fused 1,4&#8208;selenazines, through the reaction of bis(3&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl) or bis(2&#8208;aminophenyl) diselenides with different &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. When molecular I2 was used as catalyst, a series of (Z)&#8208;1&#8208;(1H&#8208;pyrido[2,3&#8208;b][1,4]selenazin&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;ylidene)propan&#8208;2&#8208;ones were obtained. On the other hand, in the absence of catalyst, 1&#8208;(2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrido[2,3&#8208;b][1,4]selenazin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;ones could be prepared selectively. The structure of the prepared compounds was elucidated by NMR and HRMS analysis and confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The versatility of the protocol was demonstrated not only by the access to a variety of 1,4&#8208;selenazine derivatives, but also by the structural diversity in the 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl precursors, incorporating multifunctionalities in the synthesized heterocycles.

     alt="Synthesis of Two Isomers of pyrido/benzo[b][1,4]selenazines: A Selective Catalyst-Dependent Formation of C&#8722;N and C-Se Bonds"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work describes the selective synthesis of a series of pyrido/benzo-fused 1,4-selenazines, through the reaction of bis(3-amino-2-pyridyl) or bis(2-aminophenyl) diselenides with different &lt;i&gt;&#946;-&lt;/i&gt;dicarbonyl compounds. When molecular I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was used as catalyst, a series of (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-1-(1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyrido[2,3-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;][1,4]selenazin-2(3&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-ylidene)propan-2-ones were obtained. On the other hand, in the absence of catalyst, 1-(2-methyl-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyrido[2,3-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;][1,4]selenazin-3-yl)ethan-1-ones could be prepared selectively. The structure of the prepared compounds was elucidated by NMR and HRMS analysis and confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The versatility of the protocol was demonstrated not only by the access to a variety of 1,4-selenazine derivatives, but also by the structural diversity in the 1,3-dicarbonyl precursors, incorporating multifunctionalities in the synthesized heterocycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Coupling Reaction of Cyclopropanols with Electrophilic Alkenes Enabled by Decatungstate as Photoredox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce a methodology for the photocatalytic generation of &#946;&#8208;ketoalkyl radicals from tertiary cyclopropanols, utilizing tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as a photoredox catalyst. The application is demonstrated by the synthesis of distantly functionalized ketones via the redox&#8208;neutral addition of the cyclopropanol&#8208;derived &#946;&#8208;ketoalkyl radicals to the double bond of electrophilic olefins. The transformation occurs under ambient temperature conditions and is suitable for coupling a wide range of cyclopropanol and alkene substrates. This was demonstrated by the preparation of 33 ketone products with 35&#8211;92% yield. The method's preparative robustness has been validated through upscaled preparations conducted under continuous flow conditions.
Mechanistic investigations support the role of TBADT as a photoredox catalyst, which facilitates the single electron oxidation of cyclopropanols, followed by the electron transfer from the reduced form of decatungstate to the electrophilic double bond of alkene. Moreover, we found that electron&#8208;rich aromatic cyclopropanols and electron&#8208;deficient olefins form photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes. This property allows the reaction to proceed under UV light irradiation via the photoinduced charge transfer in the absence of the photocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light induced approach has enabled the synthesis of 3&#8208;alkyl indole from ynones via Csp3&#8208;H bond functionalization. This protocol proceeded under base&#8208;free conditions and at room temperature, providing a series of 3&#8208;alkyl indole motifs in 39% to 86% yields (44 examples).

Abstract
We disclosed the dual role of neutral [Hmim]Br towards the direct conversion of arylsulfonic anhydride into arylthiol surrogate for the controlled and regioselective synthesis of 3&#8208;sulfenylindoles from indole derivatives at rt. In addition, 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;3&#8208;sulfenylindoles were synthesized in the presence of catalytic water at 50&#8201;&#176;C in a cascade manner i.&#8201;e. sulfenylation and bromination through de&#8208;oxygenative reduction with [Hmim]Br in the absence of any additional brominating agent. The present method was also utilized for the sulfenylation of other heterocycles including azaindole, coumarin, naphthol, and pyrrole in good to excellent yields. Moreover, mechanistic investigations revealed this reaction was driven by imidazolium cation of neutral ionic liquid i.&#8201;e. [Hmim]Br, which converts arylsulfonic anhydride into sulfenyl group for sulfenylation/bromination of sp2 C&#8722;H bond wherein an acidic ionic liquid [Hmim]pTSA is released as a by&#8208;product.

Abstract
A base&#8208;promoted net&#8208;[3+2] cycloaddition of nitriles and 1&#8208;arylpropynes for the synthesis of pyrroles is described. The developed method provides convenient access to various 2,5&#8208;disubstituted or 2,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted pyrroles in 40% to 96% yields (32 examples). Among methods for the synthesis of pyrroles, the protocol presented here stands out for its convenience and atom&#8208;economy.

Abstract
A Cu/Pd co&#8208;catalyzed Catellani&#8208;type ortho arylation reaction of iodoarenes with aryl diazonium salts has been developed. Aryl radicals that derived from aryl diazonium salts were regioselectively installed at ortho position of iodoarenes via palladium catalyzed C&#8722;H activation. Mechanistic studies showed that, in contrast to classical Pd0&#8722;PdII&#8722;PdIV&#8722;PdII&#8722;Pd0 catalytic cycle, this radical cascades performed via a Pd0&#8722;PdII&#8722;PdIII&#8722;PdI&#8722;Pd0&#8197;cycle.

         <title>Accessing Indenoazulenes via a Gold&#8208;Catalysed Cyclisation of Cycloheptatrienyl&#8208;Substituted 1,5&#8208;Diynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report that cycloheptatrienyl&#8208;substituted 1,5&#8208;diynes with aromatic backbones undergo a gold&#8208;catalysed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclisation to give 11H&#8208;indeno&#8208;[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes at room temperature. This methodology complements the established range of aromatic structures obtained from gold&#8208;catalysed conversions of differently substituted 1,5&#8208;diynes accessed via highly reactive cationic intermediates. We have demonstrated the scope of the reaction and have assessed the possibility of further functionalisation of the indenoazulene scaffold. Additionally, we have studied the optical and electrochemical properties as well as the frontier molecular orbitals of this structural motif by both spectroscopic and theoretical means.</dc:description>

         <title>Domino Reactions with Dicyanoalkenes and Fluorinated Conjugated Sulfinyl Imines. A Convenient Strategy for the Generation of Structural Diversity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dicyanoalkenes are versatile reagents in organic synthesis and they have been extensively used in a wide variety of organic transformations. However, their reactivity towards fluorinated imines remained almost unnoticed. The divergent reactivity of fluorinated conjugated sulfinyl imines with dicyanoalkenes is described herein. On the one hand, when tert&#8208;butyl sulfinyl imines were employed, a cycloaromatization cascade process took place preferentially, rendering valuable trifluoromethyl arenes. On the other hand, the reaction with p&#8208;tolyl sulfinyl imines mainly led to a complex tetracyclic skeleton, involving an azetidinimine rearrangement of a reaction intermediate. Finally, when 1&#8208;indanone&#8208;derived dicyanoalkenes were employed, the aromatization process was interrupted, rendering a new family of diene derivatives. Theoretical calculations were performed in order to shed light on the mechanistic outcome of this transformation.</dc:description>

On the one hand, when tert-butyl sulfinyl imines were employed, a cycloaromatization cascade process took place preferentially, rendering valuable trifluoromethyl arenes. On the other hand, the reaction with p-tolyl sulfinyl imines mainly led to a complex tetracyclic skeleton, involving an azetidinimine rearrangement of a reaction intermediate.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkenyl iodide, as an essential precursor and structural unit in organic synthesis, has been widely used in the synthesis of natural products, pharmaceutical pesticides and functional materials. The high reactivity of Csp2&#8208;I bond allowing could lead to form C&#8208;M bond via oxidative addition, and then undergoes C&#8208;M bond transformations to construct new chemical bonds. A variety of valuable scaffolds, in particular the cyclic motifs, could be achieved via designing and synthesis the corresponding alkenyl iodide, which makes this strategy to be a hot topic in synthetic chemistry. In this paper, the recent progress of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of alkenyl iodides is summarized, and the possible mechanisms for most transformations are described in detail.</dc:description>

Abstract
Complex spirocyclic isoindolines and pyrrolidines are formed in a tandem process involving Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed dienylation of cyclic C&#8208;aryl nitrones with 2,3&#8208;butadien&#8208;1&#8208;ol carbonates, followed by intramolecular 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition. The nitrone moiety serves both as a directing group for the C(aryl)&#8722;H activation and the dipole in the cycloaddition step. High regioselectivity of the fused vs. bridged product can be obtained by adjusting the reaction temperature. Reactions with substituted allenic substrates provide heterocycles with additional stereocenters usually with complete diastereoselectivity. The reaction products were readily transformed further into other complex nitrogen&#8208;containing spirocyclic systems.

         <title>Pentafluorophenyl&#8208;Substituted Proline&#8208;Derived Chiral Urea for &#8220;On Water&#8221; Asymmetric Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysis</title>

Abstract
This work demonstrated the efficacy of a proline&#8208;derived chiral urea for &#8220;on water&#8221; asymmetric hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis by incorporating a hydrophobic and electron&#8208;withdrawing pentafluoro&#8208;phenyl substituent into the urea moiety. When employed as a catalyst, pentafluorophenyl&#8208;substituted proline&#8208;derived chiral urea exhibited significant enhancement of both the reaction rate and stereoselectivity when conducted &#8220;on water&#8221; compared to that of conventional organic solvents due to the hydrophobic hydration effect. Moreover, this catalyst did not display notable self&#8208;aggregation during the &#8220;on water&#8221; hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis and was confirmed to exist as a monomeric species with catalytic activity. Due to its remarkable acceleration in &#8220;on water&#8221; conditions, the catalyst load was significantly reduced. Consequently, complete conversion was achieved at room temperature within 2&#8197;hours while maintaining good enantioselectivities (up to 96% ee) even at 0.2&#8197;mol% catalyst loading in the Michael addition of dithiomalonate to nitrostyrene.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Carboxylic Acids with Disulfides to Access Thioesters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross coupling reaction of carboxylic acids with disulfides is described. The readily available and inexpensive carboxylic acid is activated in&#8197;situ by the formation of a mixed anhydride. The transformation occurs at room temperature with wide functional group tolerance to efficiently generate structurally diverse thioesters. Moreover, the reaction tolerated a broad substrate scope, including sterically hindered of disulfides. Ultimately, this powerful method could be applied to the late&#8208;stage functionalization for the construction of diverse thioesters, affording a convenient and practical tactic to construct carbon&#8208;sulfur bonds.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Borylation&#8208;Cross Coupling Reaction of Unactivated Alkenes to Borylated Indolines</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
Cu&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular borylation&#8208;cross coupling reaction of alkenes was developed. Racemic and chiral borylated indolines were achieved by borylation&#8208;cross coupling of alkenes with B2pin2 via simultaneous construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;B bonds by Cu/phosphine ligand system. With CuOAc and DPPE ligand, a series of 3&#8208;substituted borylated indoline derivatives were concisely synthesized in good to excellent yields in short time under mild conditions. Asymmetric synthesis was investigated by ligand screening, and the chiral 3&#8208;substituted borylated indoline was obtained in 80% yield and 80:20 er with (R, R)&#8208;Me&#8208;Duphos. Application of 3&#8208;substituted borylated indolines has been demonstrated by a gram scale synthesis and further functionalization.

         <title>Oxidative Aminopyridylation of Maleimides and 1, 4&#8208;Quinones with N&#8208;Aminopyridinium Ylides at Room Temperature in the Absence of External Reagents</title>

Abstract
Herein we have reported an expedient di&#8208;functionalization of such versatile scaffolds. By harnessing an under explored reactivity of N&#8208;aminopyridinium ylides, we have developed an aminopyridylation of N&#8208;substituted maleimides and 1, 4&#8208;quinones at room temperature in 2&#8208;methyl THF without any external reagents. The [3+2] cycloaddition of N&#8208;aminopyridinium ylides generate the corresponding cycloadduct with various maleimides and 1, 4&#8208;quinone substrates, which rapidly undergoes oxidation at the alkene moiety under open air, inducing a considerable driving force, thermodynamically, to facilitate aromatisation of the pyridine and a subsequent homolytic cleavage of the N&#8722;N bond to generate the desired 2, 3&#8208;aminopyridylated products in good to excellent yield. Experimental and computational studies clarify the reaction mechanism.

Abstract
(Hetero)Aryl fluorosulfates (ArOSO2F/ArOFs) emerged as a versatile synthon in &#8220;click chemistry,&#8221; attracting the interest of chemists owing to their extensive applications in fields such as biology, medicine, materials, and polymers. Readily prepared from widely available phenolic compounds in nature, fluorosulfates serve as a economical, efficient, and environmentally friendly alternative to trifluoromethane sulfonates. In recent years, fluorosulfates have attracted research attention as emerging electrophilic reagents in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions. The development of a broad range of coupling reactions will considerably expand their applications in interdisciplinary fields. This review summarized the synthesis methods for fluorosulfates and their instances as coupling partners in various transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions.

Abstract
Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of 8&#8208;benzylquinolines with arylboronic acids was developed. In the presence of 5&#8197;mol% BINOL&#8208;derived chiral cyclopentadienyl rhodium complex, asymmetric benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond arylation reaction proceeded smoothly to afford a series of enantioenriched triarylmethanes in moderate to good yields with good to excellent enantioselective control (24&#8211;89% yields, 63&#8211;93% ee).

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H arylation of 8-benzylquinolines with arylboronic acids was developed. In the presence of 5&#8197;mol% BINOL-derived chiral cyclopentadienyl rhodium complex, asymmetric benzylic C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond arylation reaction proceeded smoothly to afford a series of enantioenriched triarylmethanes in moderate to good yields with good to excellent enantioselective control (24&#8211;89% yields, 63&#8211;93% ee). The method displays a broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance under mild conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A convenient protocol for the synthesis of thiazole&#8208;2&#8208;thiones from nitrobenzene, chalcones and carbon disulfide is described. The construction of one C&#8722;S bond and two C&#8722;N bonds via [3+2] cycloaddition reaction is achieved using NaOH as the base in one pot. Various functional groups attached to substrates were well tolerated to afford the corresponding products in moderate to good yields.

Abstract
Here we report a light&#8208;induced FeCl3&#8208;catalyzed approach for benzyl C&#8722;H chlorination with remarkable regioselectivity, which enables alkylbenzenes to be converted into versatile benzyl chlorides under mild conditions using trifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride (TfCl) as the chlorine source. DFT calculations show that the dynamics preference of benzylic &#945;&#8722;C&#8722;H chlorination is more pronounced by employing TfCl.

         <dc:description>A divergent synthesis of ortho&#8208;anisidines was achieved by controlling Cu&#8208;catalyzed [1,3]&#8208;methoxy rearrangement.  The reactions of N&#8208;alkoxyanilines having an electron&#8208;donating group (EDG), such as an alkyl or anisyl group, at the ortho position and a pivaloyl group on the nitrogen atom in the presence of catalytic amounts of IPrMeCuCl and AgNTf2 afforded the corresponding 6&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;anisidines with good product selectivity through a [1,3]&#8208;rearrangement of the methoxy group to the

In contrast, the reactions of N&#8208;methoxyanilines having a benzyloxycarbonyl group on the nitrogen atom using IPrCuBr and AgBF4 as catalysts afforded 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;anisidines via a domino process involving a [1,3]&#8208;rearrangement of the methoxy group to the EDG&#8208;substituted ortho position followed by a [1,2]&#8208;rearrangement of the EDG of the resulting ortho&#8208;quinol imine intermediate.

         <title>Catalytic Difluoromethylation of Alkenes with Difluoroacetic Anhydride: Reactivity of Fluorinated Diacyl Peroxides and Radicals</title>

Abstract
Given the importance of difluoromethylated molecules for drug and agrochemical development, much attention has been drawn to the establishment of related synthetic protocols, as exemplified by the CF2H radical&#8208;mediated catalytic difluoromethylation of alkenes. However, most of these difluoromethylations proceed under photocatalytic conditions, whereas those requiring thermal conditions are few. Herein, we developed a general and practical method of Cu&#8208;catalyzed alkene difluoromethylation with difluoroacetic anhydride (DFAA) as a CF2H source, showing that the thus realized amino&#8208;, allylic&#8208;, and oxy&#8208;difluoromethylations involve bis(difluoroacetyl) peroxide (BDFAP) in&#8197;situ generated from DFAA and H2O2 and further demonstrating the occurrence of carbo&#8208;difluoromethylation under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The obtained results pave the way to the simple and efficient synthesis of a broad range of difluoromethylated species and thus facilitate their practical applications, including those in medicinal and agricultural chemistry. Moreover, we probed the mechanisms of the observed transformations, rationalized the extraordinary fast decomposition of BDFAP compared to that of diacyl peroxides containing CF3 or CF2Cl groups, and performed DFT calculations to shed light on the low stability and decomposition mode of BDFAP. Finally, we examined the influence of fluorinated radical philicity on the reaction outcome.

Abstract
Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular cyclization of 2&#8208;amidoazulene derivatives, prepared by the reaction of 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;aminoazulene derivatives with perfluoroalkyl acid anhydrides, resulted in the formation of 2&#8208;perfluoroalkylazuleno[2,1&#8208;d]pyrimidin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones. Heating of these products in phosphoryl chloride led to 4&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;perfluoroalkylazuleno[2,1&#8208;d]pyrimidines. We also evaluated the reactivity of these pyrimidin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones and pyrimidine derivatives toward the electrophilic and nucleophilic substitution reactions, revealing that a variety of functional groups can be incorporated into these derivatives. The NMR studies, NICS calculations, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analyses revealed structural features including the bond&#8208;length alternation of the azuleno[2,1&#8208;d]pyrimidin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones and pyrimidine derivatives.

Abstract
We herein disclose a simple and general method for the synthesis of chromendiones through Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization/annulation reactions of nitrones with cyclic 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones by using nitrone group as a traceless directing group. This method exhibits high efficiency and broad functional group compatibility. The derivatization of these chromendiones has been also demonstrated to further strengthen the synthetic utility of the transformation.

Abstract
The development of a rational protocol to realize the complete regioselectivity and the capability to switch regioselectivity is an appealing yet challenging task. Herein, a regiodivergent C&#8722;H arylation of 2&#8208;pyridylthiophenes has been demonstrated via the choice of RuII and PdII catalysts. The reactions proceeded smoothly in a good regioselective manner to afford the corresponding C3&#8208; and C5&#8208;arylated thiophenes. Late&#8208;stage diversification of biologically relevant scaffold derived from estrone and successful transformation of the products further highlighted the potential utility and importance of this synthetic strategy.

Abstract
A new family of triaminocyclopentadienyl iron(II) tricarbonyl complexes has been synthesized, fully characterized and applied in hydrogenation transfer. These complexes are the first Earth&#8208;abundant metal complexes able to catalyze reductive alkylation of primary and secondary aliphatic amines with 2&#8208;diarylphosphinobenzaldehyde derivatives at room temperature. These non&#8208;pincer type cyclopentadienyl iron(II) complexes demonstrate not only better efficiency than known cyclopentadienone iron carbonyl complexes but also high functionality tolerance. The resulting aminophosphines provide a straightforward and rapid access to potential P&#8722;N ligands.

Abstract
Sulfoximines, the isoelectronic with sulfones, represent a class of alternative and intriguing motifs in both discovery program and agrochemistry. N&#8208;Alkylation on imines could significantly improve their bioactivities, but the lack of general method has hindered their further uptake by medicinal chemistry and drug development. Herein, we present a mild photocatalytic anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamination of alkenes to construct N&#8208;alkylated sulfoximines with broad substrate tolerance on primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl substituents as well as a diverse range of sulfoximines. The mechanistic studies support the photocatalytic pathway, and demonstrate that the alkene radical cation rather than the iminium radical serves as the key intermediate in the transformation.

Abstract
A multifaceted study on the effect of various factors on the efficiency of photocyclization of naphthofuran O&#8208;acyl oximes was performed. It showed that without any additives or in the presence of electron acceptors, the reaction occurs by a radical pathway and with low chemoselectivity, while DABCO promotes intramolecular cyclization to give naphthofuroquinolines (NFQs) in 34&#8211;87% yields. The iminyl radical formed under UV irradiation in the presence of DABCO due to single electron transfer (SET) and N&#8722;O bond cleavage undergoes selective intramolecular homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS) with formation of a new C&#8722;N bond. This route to quinoline&#8208;annulated scaffolds is based on the use of DABCO both as an electron transfer agent and a proton acceptor.

Abstract
Herein, metal triflates&#8211;catalyzed one&#8208;pot domino cyclocondensation of 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;sulfonylacetones and 3&#8208;arylacroleins via (3+3) or (3+2+1) annulation has been proposed to construct diversified 2&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;4&#8208;arylphenols and 2,6&#8208;bis&#8208;sulfonyl 5&#8208;aryl&#8208;4&#8208;arylidene&#8208;2&#8208;cyclohexenones. In this effective reaction, C&#8722;C and C=C bonds are formed via a cascade process and 3&#8208;arylacrolein acts as a C3 and C1 synthon during the formation of a six&#8208;membered ring system under mild conditions. A plausible mechanism has been proposed and discussed.

Abstract
A Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed dearomative skeletal rearrangement of azofurans with indoles is reported, enabling a regioselective 1,6&#8208;addition, ring&#8208;opening and 1,4&#8208;addition cascade to produce 26 examples of indolylated pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;ones with a cyclic tetrasubstituted stereocenter in 58&#8211;94% yields. This protocol demonstrates remarkable compatibility regarding azofurans and indoles with different substitution patterns, featuring complete regioselectivity.

The front cover picture illustrates the difluoromethylation of alkenes with bis(difluoroacetyl) peroxide (BDFAP), which is easily preparable from difluoroacetic anhydride and hydrogen peroxide. The use of a copper catalyst enables amino&#8208;, allylic, and oxy&#8208;difluoromethylation under thermal conditions. Moreover, metal&#8208;free carbo&#8208;difluoromethylation of an alkene bearing a pendant aromatic group takes place through a radical chain mechanism. Computational investigations shed light on the unique reactivity of BDFAP and the difluoromethyl radical. Details can be found in Research Article by Shintaro Kawamura, Mikiko Sodeoka and co&#8208;workers (T. Tagami, Y. Mitani, S. Kawamura, M. Sodeoka, Adv. Synth.

Abstract
Harnessing visible light to trigger (aza and thia) Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction injects new vitality into [2+2] photocyclization reaction and enable impressive reactivity modes. The popular (aza and thia) Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction is one of the most efficient ways to synthesize strained four&#8208;membered heterocycles. Recently, visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered (aza and thia) Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reactions have received considerable attentions as this strategy has overcome some long&#8208;standing challenges, and remarkable achievements have been made within this field. Strained four&#8208;membered heterocyclics with favorable properties provide a perfect combination of stable skeletons for pharmaceutical chemistry and reaction intermediates for further transformation. In this review, we highlight the most recent advances in visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered (aza and thia) Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction with an emphasis on reaction mechanism and applications. Organization of the review follows a subdivision according to reaction type and substrate classes.

Abstract
Trifluoromethylated alkenes and alkynes are versatile building blocks for organofluorine synthesis. In addition, (trifluoromethyl)alkene motifs are found in biofunctional molecules. Hence, their synthesis is an important research objective. Although trifluoromethylated alkenes and alkynes have been prepared using transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated coupling reactions, more environmentally benign processes that obviate the use of precious metal catalysts and/or harsh reaction conditions should be developed. This review outlines recent advances in the synthesis of fluoroalkylated alkenes and alkynes via fluoroalkyl radical substitution reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of Furfural Sulfides and 4&#8208;Alkylthiopyridines via Heterocyclization of &#945;&#8208;Acyl Ketene Dithioacetals</title>

Abstract
Herein, we devised a synthetic approach for skeletally diversified furfuryl sulfides and 4&#8208;alkylthiopyridines involving the heterocyclization of flexible &#945;&#8208;acyl ketene dithioacetals, enabled by cooperative Pd/Cu catalysis. The overall transformation was initiated by acyl&#8208;directed desulfurative Sonogashira coupling, which was proposed as the key step in surmounting the competitive carbothiolation pathway. This step was followed by 1,6&#8208;addition of either a S&#8208; or N&#8208;nucleophile and intramolecular cyclization. Notably, the two different annulation reactions featured readily accessible starting materials, selective cleavage and reassembly of multiple chemical bonds, broad functional group tolerance, pharmacologically significant heterocyclic products with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivities, and high atom economy.

Abstract
N&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;alkoxyalkyl)benzotriazoles are of great importance for biochemical and antitumor activity. A feasible protocol has been developed for the synthesis of N&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;alkoxyalkyl)benzotriazoles using azoles, aldehydes and alcohols as substrates under electrochemical conditions. The reaction is carried out under acid catalyst&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions, so that a variety of synthetically useful nitrogen heterocyclic derivatives can be obtained. More meaningfully, a gram&#8208;scale synthetic approach was employed to demonstrate the scale&#8208;up applicability of this transformation.

Abstract
Herein, a copper&#8208;catalyzed photoinduced [3+3] cycloaddition reaction of &#945;&#8208;acidic isocyanides with 2,5&#8208;diaryltetrazoles is described. The reaction proceeded smoothly with high regioselectivity, affording a range of important 1,2,4&#8208;triazines under mild conditions. The obtained 1,2,4&#8208;triazines were converted into triazine alcohol, Weinreb amide and triazinone easily, which further illustrate the utility of this [3+3] cycloaddition process.

Abstract
A quinine&#8208;derived thiourea&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective double annulation strategy using alkylidene Meldrum&#8242;s acid as an acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor with salicylaldehyde&#8208;derived azomethine ylide is reported. The methodology is realized via a (3+2) cycloaddition/transesterification/decarboxylation sequence, giving chromeno[4,3&#8208;b]pyrrolidines within 15&#8211;420&#8197;minutes at room temperature in 51&#8211;97% yields with 92&#8211;99% ee under 1&#8211;10&#8197;mol% catalyst loading. A plausible activation model is proposed for the excellent stereoinduction by H&#8208;bond interaction between the catalyst and the Meldrum&#8242;s acid motif according to control experiments.

Abstract
A Selectfluor mediated regioselective &#960;&#8208;extended [3+1+1] annulation using imidazopyridines, acetophenones and DMF as carbon source has been realized. The current route compared to traditional &#960;&#8208;extended annulation reaction utilizes commercially available acetophenones as a cyclic partner and offers three C&#8722;C bond formations. This reaction displayed good functional group tolerance wherein DMF served as a carbon synthon. Five&#8208;membered bridged chroman&#8208;4&#8208;one derivative of imidazopyridine has been achieved with 2&#8208;hydroxy acetophenone, wherein DMF acted as a dual carbon synthon and offered four C&#8722;C and one C&#8722;O bond formation in one&#8208;pot.

Abstract
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed trifunctionalization of 5&#8208;heteroaryl&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;hexenes via remote heteroaryl migration and a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed trifunctionalization of 5&#8208;hexenenitriles via cyano migration are reported. This protocol provides access to a broad scope of CFnR&#8208;containing ketones with high molecular complexity and functional group diversity. The reaction features mild conditions and high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities. The success of gram&#8208;scale reactions and the versatility of products in derivative synthesis illustrated the potential value of this transformation in synthetic chemistry.

Abstract
Cross&#8208;electrophilic coupling of various benzyl sulfonium salts with Callyl&#8722;O electrophiles is described using a simple Co&#8722;Mn catalytic system. This catalytic system is able to activate both the stable Csp3&#8722;S bond of sulfonium salts and the Csp3&#8722;O bond of allylic acetate or ether under mild reaction conditions to form various functionalized alkyl olefinic compounds. Allyl methyl ethers were employed for the first time in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophilic coupling to build Csp3&#8722;Csp3 bonds. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested the involvement of benzyl radicals generated from C&#8722;S bond cleavage through a single electron transfer.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;catalyzed formal [3+2] annulation&#8208;aromatization reaction for the synthesis of various substituted imidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines from amidines with stabilized isoquinolinium N&#8208;ylides in the presence of bases is developed. The procedure reported here involves a direct C&#8722;H activation and the formation of C&#8722;C/C&#8722;N bonds in one&#8208;pot. The reaction mechanism is probed by radical&#8208;trapping experiment, fluorescence quenching, and light on/off experiments. The late&#8208;stage modification experiments provide the potential applications in the field of organic and medicinal chemistry for chemists.

         <title>Molecular Oxygen&#8208;Induced Transamidation of Unactivated Amides in Diethyl Carbonate in the Presence of a Palladium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we disclose a palladium&#8208;catalyzed procedure for the transamidation of structurally diverse amides with amines based on the use of molecular oxygen as palladium&#8208;activating agent. The reaction, which is scalable and amenable for the preparation of enantioenriched compounds, is carried out in a bio&#8208;degradable solvent often used as a fuel additive, diethyl carbonate. As a result of 10&#8208;4 mol% of catalyst required, final products are isolated containing palladium impurities in a concentration of 0.1 ppm. Two kinetically different mechanistic pathways are proposed for this reaction on account of a number of experiments such as kinetic curves, TEM images, catalyst poisoning experiments, UPLC&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS identification of intermediates and EPR spectra of reaction crude.</dc:description>

         <title>Contemporary Approaches for Amide Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amide bond construction has garnered significant interest in recent decades due to amides being one of the most prevalent functional groups among bioactive molecules. Out of the thirty&#8208;seven new drugs approved by the FDA in 2022, eleven are small molecules containing at least one amide bond. Additionally, there are nineteen large molecules approved as new drugs, some of which have peptide structures, and therefore, also bear amide bonds.
In recent years, multiple teams have embraced the challenge of developing more efficient methods for amide bond formation. This dedication has led to numerous publications appearing monthly in prestigious journals, showcasing significant advancements in this field. The primary goal of this review is to present the most viable strategies for constructing the amide bond.
It is crucial to differentiate between amide bond formation and amide synthesis; hence, the focus is on describing specific methods for forming new C(O)&#8208;N bonds. In particular, this review concentrates on the methods developed within the last six years. There is a particular emphasis on new approaches that consider the thought process when selecting the starting materials and functional groups. This approach ensures coverage of all the most common chemical transformations that yield new amide bonds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The hapalindole&#8208;type metabolites have garnered significant interest due to their diverse biological activities and unique chemical structures. Recently, the biosynthesis of this family of indole alkaloids has been uncovered and shown to involve a rare biocatalytic Cope rearrangement. Previously, we demonstrated cis&#8208;indole isonitrile C&#8208;3 normal geranylation using FamD2. Thus, we sought to explore further the reaction potential with this substrate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) using prenyltransferases and cyclases from the hapalindole biosynthetic pathways. Here, we report a new compound derived from an unexpected biosynthetic Cope rearrangement, which expands further the scope of metabolites generated from cyanobacterial Stig cyclases.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Regulation of Short&#8208;Chain Dehydrogenases via Key Sites in its Loop and Adjacent Regions for the Enantiodivergent Reduction of Difficult&#8208;To&#8208;Reduce Ketones</title>

Abstract
Short&#8208;chain dehydrogenases (SDRs) are powerful catalysts for the asymmetric reduction of prochiral ketones in pharmaceutical products. Herein, through gene mining and evolutionary analysis, we obtained two major types of SDRs (SDR&#8208;1 and SDR&#8208;2) for the enantioselective complementary reduction of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;piperidone, which gives the corresponding product (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc&#8208;piperidol, an intermediate of the interleukin inhibitor and lymphoma treatment drug (imbruvica), respectively. By integrating multiple sequence alignment, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and computational modeling, we proposed a &#8220;loop regulation&#8221; mechanism for the enantioselective control of SDRs, through which residues in the loop region could potentially fine&#8208;tune their enantioselectivity. Further, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis assays showed that two key residues (L201 and F205 for SDR&#8208;1, F92 and H93 for SDR&#8208;2) in the loop and its adjacent region played critical roles in fine&#8208;tuning the enantioselectivity of SDRs. Understanding this mechanism of SDR stereo preference in catalyzing asymmetric reduction, we further switched the enantioselectivity of the homologous enzymes. The obtained enzymes catalyzed the enantiodivergent synthesis of chiral heterocyclic alcohols with different ring sizes and substituents (25&#8211;99% conversion and 25&#8211;99% ee (R/S)), including piperidols, 4&#8208;hydroxy azepanes, 3&#8208;hydroxy azepanes and pyrrolidinols. These findings could potentially guide future attempts at protein engineering of stereoselective SDRs.

Herein, through gene mining and evolutionary analysis, we obtained two major types of SDRs (SDR-1 and SDR-2) for the enantioselective complementary reduction of N-Boc-piperidone, which gives the corresponding product (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)- or (&lt;i&gt;S)-&lt;/i&gt;N-Boc-piperidol, an intermediate of the interleukin inhibitor and lymphoma treatment drug (imbruvica), respectively. By integrating multiple sequence alignment, site-directed mutagenesis and computational modeling, we proposed a &#8220;loop regulation&#8221; mechanism for the enantioselective control of SDRs, through which residues in the loop region could potentially fine-tune their enantioselectivity. Further, site-directed mutagenesis assays showed that two key residues (L201 and F205 for SDR-1, F92 and H93 for SDR-2) in the loop and its adjacent region played critical roles in fine-tuning the enantioselectivity of SDRs. Understanding this mechanism of SDR stereo preference in catalyzing asymmetric reduction, we further switched the enantioselectivity of the homologous enzymes. The obtained enzymes catalyzed the enantiodivergent synthesis of chiral heterocyclic alcohols with different ring sizes and substituents (25&#8211;99% conversion and 25&#8211;99% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;)), including piperidols, 4-hydroxy azepanes, 3-hydroxy azepanes and pyrrolidinols. These findings could potentially guide future attempts at protein engineering of stereoselective SDRs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Diverse Allylsilanes Employing Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyzed Reductive Functionalization</title>

Abstract
We present a rapid (0.25&#8211;1&#8197;h), method to produce functionalised allylsilanes from readily available vinylsilanes. Employing a Br&#248;nsted acid catalysed dehydration as the key step, allylsilanes are produced in good yields (22&#8211;98%) and, in most cases, as a single geometric isomer. Furthermore, a possible allylation&#8208;Cope pathway was discovered for certain substrates and attempts to optimise this are described.

Abstract
A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation/[4+1] annulation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;indoles and CF3&#8208;substituted imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides (TFISYs) has been achieved, producing a wide variety of trifluoroacetimidoyl&#8208;substituted 11H&#8208;isoindolo[2,1&#8208;a]indoles in 51&#8211;86% yields. The cascade reaction involves C&#8722;H imidoylmethylation, tautomerization and AgOAc&#8208;mediated C&#8722;N bond formation sequence. The reaction could be scaled up to 2&#8197;mmol scale.

         <title>Convergent Paired Electrolysis for the Synthesis of Pyrazolyl&#8208;Substituted Tetrahydroisoquinolines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A convergent paired electrolysis method for the synthesis of 1&#8208;pyrazolyl&#8208;substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines has been developed. The reaction proceeded without any transition metal catalyst and chemical oxidant. The desired products could be isolated in high yields (80&#8211;99%) in 60&#8211;80&#8197;minutes. The Faradaic efficiency was 108% and gram&#8208;scale synthesis (84%) could be carried out. Mechanistic studies revealed that the C&#8722;N bond formation process might mainly involve a nucleophilic addition reaction.

         <title>Desilylation&#8208;Promoted Phosphine Catalysis: Intramolecular Annulation/Nucleophilic Addition Sequence of Trimethylsilylethynyl Benzoxazinanones with N&#8208;Tosyl Imines</title>

Abstract
Under phosphine catalysis facilitated through desilylation, intramolecular annulation/nucleophilic addition of trimethylsilylethynyl benzoxazinanones with electron&#8208;deficient imines or alkenes was achieved to afford a series of indole derivatives in moderate to high yields. The trimethylsilylethynyl benzoxazinanones without electron&#8208;withdrawing group on the alkyne moiety functioned as phosphine acceptors. Notably, the distinctive desilylation activation played a key role in catalytic process. Particularly, those indole derivatives could be readily transformed into various biologically significant &#947;&#8208;carboline compounds. The use of chiral phosphine achieved asymmetric reaction, leading to a 95% ee of product.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to the Challenging Direct C&#8208;Alkylation and C&#8208;Allylation of Unactivated Nitroalkanes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The limited nucleophilic character and the bidentate nature of unactivated nitroalkane anions (nitronates) makes the corresponding alkylation and allylation procedures rather troublesome. This aspect is in sharp contrast with other commonly employed processes involving nitronate anions such as conjugate additions or nitroaldol reactions. This review summarizes the most rewarding approaches that along the years have been devised to overcome this limitation. Efficient methods are nowadays mainly based on metal&#8208;catalyzed processes involving purely ionic or mixed ionic&#8208;radical intermediates including photoenzymatic reactions.

         <title>Recent Advances in Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions with Triflates or Nonaflates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura (SM) cross&#8208;coupling of organo halides with organoboron compounds is a widely used tool in organic synthesis for the construction of C&#8208;C bonds. Alternative methods using pseudohalides, such as triflates or nonaflates, are also suitable for this transformation. These substrates offer the advantages of simple access from readily available phenols (or enolizable ketones) and possible use for chemodivergent sequential SM couplings using electronically differentiated leaving groups. This review aims to give an overview about the current strategies of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings with triflates or nonaflates as leaving groups. In particular, it aims to give a better understanding about the development of new efficient catalyst systems over the last decade overcoming the limitations of the standard catalyst Pd(PPh3)4. The hydrolysis of triflates as a common side reaction and its prevention will be discussed, as well as the possible transformation of triflates into halides as a strategic alternative. A matrix table is provided to guide the practitioners to find suitable reaction conditions for the various combinations of aryl/enol triflate substrates and arylboronic acids with differing electronic character.</dc:description>

         <title>Primary and Secondary Amines by Flavin&#8208;Photocatalyzed Consecutive Desulfonylation and Dealkylation of Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkane&#8208;, arene&#8208;, and perfluoroalkanesulfonyl groups are widely used in organic synthesis to protect amino functionalities or to facilitate their installation. Protection of amino functions by a sulfonyl group to form sulfonamides is advantageous as they are easy to purify and tolerate various reaction conditions. On the other hand, sulfonyl group removal is difficult. Herein, we present a facile and versatile metal&#8208;free photocatalytic reductive method for desulfonylation of sulfonamides and aryl sulfonates to the parent amines mediated by flavin derivatives, namely deazaisoalloxazines and deazaalloxazines, and visible light. Photocatalysis with 5&#8208;deazalloxazines is shown to even mediate the cleavage of pefluoroalkanesulfonamides (triflylamides and nonaflylamides), which is significantly more difficult than that of other sulfonamides and has previously not been achieved by photochemical means. The method is shown to perform unprecedented consecutive desulfonylation and dealkylation of N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenylperfluoroalkanesulfonamides affording primary anilines. This occurs via consecutive reductive and oxidative catalytic cycles mediated by the flavin catalyst. The perfluoroalkylsulfonyl group fulfils a dual role serving as a protecting group and, after removal by the reductive cycle, as the species driving the oxidative dealkylation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Cycloaddition of Azobenzenes and Nonstabilized Azomethine Ylides to Access 1,2,4&#8208;Triazolidines</title>

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated cycloaddition of azobenzenes and nonstabilized azomethine ylides has been developed to access 1,2,4&#8208;triazolidines. With readily available organic dye rose bengal as a photocatalyst and alkyl tertiary amines as precursors for azomethine ylides, the reaction proceeded smoothly under visible light irradiation at room temperature, affording various 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolidines with yields of up to 96%. Preliminarily mechanistic studies suggest that the nonstabilized azomethine ylides are formed in&#8197;situ through photoredox catalysis.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction of 2&#8208;azidosulfonamides and isocyanides enables the synthesis of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;substituted 1,2,4&#8208;benzothiadiazine 1,1&#8208;dioxides at room temperature. By applying commercially available Pd(dba)2 in catalyst loadings as low as 1.0&#8197;mol%, a variety of 21 differently substituted 2H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;benzothiadiazine 1,1&#8208;dioxides can be prepared within 2&#8197;h. Moreover, the developed protocol gives access to the related 4H heterocycles.

         <title>Hydroxamate Assays for High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Transketolase Libraries Against Arylated Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
We recently reported that the transketolase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (TKgst) upon acyl transfer to nitrosoarenes generates N&#8208;aryl hydroxamic acids (HA). The latter are metal chelating compounds that in the presence of Fe(III) ions form deep&#8208;red complexes. Here, we applied this principle to the development of a colorimetric assay in both solid&#8208; and liquid&#8208;phase formats for the high&#8208;throughput screening of TKgst and its variants. Screening a set of positive hits from a L382X/D470X library validated the specificity and sensitivity of the assays. The solid surface assay allows a clear distinction between positive and negative colonies by the naked eye in qualitative mode, and further also to measure activity in semi&#8208;quantitative fashion in the liquid&#8208;phase format. The assay will be important for engineering the TKgst enzyme towards improved conversion of aromatic aldehydes by their close structural analogy to nitrosoarenes.

         <title>Harnessing Visible Light for the Synthesis of N&#8208;Aryl Oxazolidines: Organocatalyzed Tandem Decarboxylation&#8210;Cyclization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we have developed an organophotocatalyzed, visible&#8208;light mediated tandem decarboxylation&#8210;cyclization method. The Eosin&#8208;Y as organophotocatalyst drives photoredox tandem protocol to construct C&#8211;N, C&#8211;O, and C&#8211;C bonds in a single operation. The reaction mechanism proceeds through decarboxylation followed by amino alcohol intermediate formation from N&#8208;arylglycine and formaldehyde followed by cyclization with another formaldehyde delivers N&#8208;arylloxazolidine derivatives.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An oxidant&#8208;free photocatalytic [2+2+m] cyclization of 2&#8208;cyanoaryl acrylamides with 2&#8208;bromocarbonyls is reported, enabling the assembly of biologically important N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;fused quinolinones including benzo[1,6]naphthyridinones and pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;c]&#8208;quinolines. This photocatalytic protocol proceeds through a radical relay pathway including alkene difunctionalization along with an intramolecular cyano insertion and subsequent site&#8208;specific functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bond enabled by cyano&#8208;derived iminyl radical&#8208;mediated 1,n&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer. Notably, this transformation selectively formed two distinct C&#8722;C bonds, one C&#8722;N bond, and one quaternary carbon center in a one&#8208;pot procedure.</dc:description>

         <title>General Synthesis of Alkyl Amines via Borrowing Hydrogen and Reductive Amination</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amines are a very important class of compounds and the selective synthesis of differently substituted primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl amines is challenging. Here we present the synthesis of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl amines from ammonia and alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and hydrogen by combining borrowing hydrogen or hydrogen autotransfer and reductive amination with hydrogen. The key is a nanostructured, bimetallic Co/Sc catalyst able to mediate both reactions or concepts efficiently. We observe a broad product scope, a very good functional group tolerance, upscaling is easily accomplished and our catalyst is reusable.</dc:description>

Abstract
A selective reaction of bridged ozonides with Fe(II) salts proceeds through the sequence of O&#8722;O, C&#8722;C scissions and halogenation to form &#945;&#8208;halogen substituted &#948;&#8208;ketoesters and &#948;&#8208;diketones in 15&#8211;72% yields. The overall sequence shows how a temporary installation of a peroxide functionality can be used to replace the acyl group within an acetoacetic ester unit with a halogen.

         <title>Assembly of Phospha&#8208;Xanthenes from Functionalized Organophosphines and Arynes through a Formal (4+2) Annulation&#8208;Inspired Cascade</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report an approach to phospha&#8208;xanthenes from ortho&#8208;chalcone based organophosphines and arynes. These reactions proceeded through a sequential process consisting of a formal [4+2] cycloaddition, arylation, P&#8722;OH formation and P&#8722;C bond cleavage. A gram&#8208;scale preparation and a chemical conversion were performed to demonstrate the synthetic utility of this method. Also, a possible mechanism was proposed based on the control experiments.

         <title>A One&#8208;Pot, Whole&#8208;Cell Biocatalysis Approach for Vanillin Production using Lignin Oil</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Vanillin is a popular and versatile flavor compound, almost entirely produced from petroleum&#8208;derived phenol by a multi&#8208;step chemical synthesis. The process is hazardous to the environment and unsustainable for its fossil oil usage. Therefore, developing environmentally friendly, efficient, and sustainable routes to biobased vanillin is essential. Here, we report on vanillin production from 4&#8208;n&#8208;propylguaiacol (4PG), one of the main components in lignin oil obtained through reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) of soft wood, by employing recombinant Escherichia coli cells. Conversion is based on the expression of two engineered oxidative enzymes: a 4&#8208;n&#8208;propylguaiacol oxidase and an isoeugenol dioxygenase. A high yield of vanillin, 66% from 4PG in RCF lignin oil was achieved through rounds of optimisation of the whole&#8208;cell conversion process. This high&#8208;performance strategy was readily scaled up to produce vanillin at an unprecedented 18% and 3% yield based on lignin oil and spruce wood respectively. The whole&#8208;cell bioconversion process shows good tolerance even at high loadings of starting material, showcasing the robustness and applicability of the employed biocatalysts. This work paves the way for further development towards the efficient production of high&#8208;titer biobased vanillin using depolymerised lignin as the feedstock.

Abstract
A variety of Pd&#8208;catalyzed reactions are carried out with palladium carboxylates in the presence of carboxylic acids and/or alkali metal carboxylates. This review is Part A of three reviews highlighting the dependence of the efficiency of the formation of the different C&#8722;C bonds on the nature of the carboxylate unit. Part A concerns inter&#8208; and intramolecular reactions leading to the formation of a C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2), C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) or C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond. The variety of procedures and additives is presented as well as the reaction mechanisms with, as far as possible, personal comments.

Abstract
A radical&#8208;induced dichloromethylation and concomitant 1,2&#8208;aryl migration of allylic alcohols with CHCl3 is developed for the construction of &#947;,&#947;&#8208;dichloroketones in moderate to good yields. We found that, for the para&#8208;substituted unsymmetrical substrates, the more electron&#8208;deficient aryl group migrates preferentially over the more electron&#8208;rich aryl group. Moreover, chlorocyclopropanes could be obtained from allyl alcohols in one&#8208;pot manner through radical&#8208;addition/1,2&#8208;aryl migration/nucleophilic substitution.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Thiolation of Amino Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Herein, we report a protocol for the selective &#948;&#8208;thiolation of aliphatic &#945;&#8208;amino acids catalyzed by a Pd(II)/Ag(I) system. This reaction employs disulfides as thiolating agents and N&#8208;COPy as directing group, providing valuable non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid derivatives in moderate to good diastereoselectivities and yields. Remarkably, the method is also suitable for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of a dipeptide. Experimental and DFT studies have provided significant insights into the mechanism and underlying factors controlling the selectivity of the process and determining the key role of the silver salt.

         <title>Selective Formation of 2,3,5&#8208;Trisubstituted Furans from 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyls and Hydroxyketones</title>

Abstract
Chemoselective cyclizations of 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds with hydroxyketones for the selective formation of two 2,3,5&#8208;trisubstituted furans have been reported. While TsOH&#8208;mediated cyclization in DCM afforded 2&#8208;acylfurans, the additional copper catalyst in acetone turned over the selectivity for the generation of 3&#8208;acylfurans. The featured advantages of both reactions include simple conditions, high yielding, broad substrate scope, gram scalability, and H2O as the sole byproduct.

         <title>Conjugate Aminocyclization Catalyzed by a Bismuthinidene</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We disclose how an N,C,N&#8208;bismuthinidene is able to promote an intramolecular conjugate amination that affords cyclic carbamates in 91&#8211;97% yields. The reaction proceeds at room temperature in short reaction times, requiring a remarkably low loading of a bismuth(I) complex (0.1&#8197;mol%) without the need of an additional Br&#248;nsted base. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction takes place through a polar pathway involving the conjugate addition of the nucleophilic bismuthinidene, followed by an intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael reaction.

Subsequent Lewis acid&#8208;facilitated o&#8208;NQM formation and annulation with olefins afforded multi&#8208;fused heterocycles. Notably, the consecutive hexacyclic skeleton of rubioncolin B was constructed via solvent&#8208;dependent regioselective annulation of naphthofuran derivatives.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Enantioselective Alkynylation of Trifluoropyruvates with Terminal 1,3&#8208;Diynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A direct catalytic enantioselective alkynylation reaction of trifluoropyruvates with terminal 1,3&#8208;diynes was achieved by using C2&#8208;symmetric NCN pincer rhodium (III) complexes with bis(imidazolinyl)phenyl ligands. This protocol is effective for enantioselective synthesis of optically active trifluoromethylated tertiary alcohols with the diyne moiety. A variety of electronically and structurally diverse terminal 1,3&#8208;diynes are well tolerated. Furthermore, the catalytic reaction is applicable to preparation of both enantiomers of the chiral CF3&#8208;containing conjugated diynols with high enantioselectivity.

         <title>Palladium Catalysis: Dependence of the Efficiency of C&#8722;C Bond Formation on Carboxylate Ligand and Alkali Metal Carboxylate or Carboxylic Acid Additive. Part C: The Domino Diarylation and Annelation Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
The efficiency of the formation of C&#8722;C bonds under palladium catalysis often depends on the nature of the carboxylate ligand and carboxylic acids or alkali metal carboxylates additives. This review which is Part C of a trilogy devoted to the topic, highlights the influence of the carboxylate units on domino diarylation and annelation reactions. The plausible reaction mechanisms are presented with, as far as possible, personal comments.

         <title>Synthesis of Trifluoromethylthiolated Quinolinones via Trifluoromethanesulfanamide&#8208;Induced Electrophilic Intramolecular Cyclization of N&#8208;Arylpropynamides</title>

Abstract
The reaction of N&#8208;arylpropynamides with the commercially available trifluoromethanesulfanamide in the presence of BiCl3 was found to afford quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones in a selective manner via electrophilic trifluoromethylthiolation enabled by the in&#8208;situ generated CF3S&#8722;Cl and the followed intramolecular cyclization. Differing from the existing analogous cyclization route that solely produces spiro[4,5]trienones, this alternative approach exclusively affords the biologically interesting quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones as the major products.

Abstract
A method is developed for preparing 18O&#8208;labeled esters through a Ni&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction of amides, alkyl halides, and 18O&#8208;labeled water. This method demonstrated excellent selectivity and compatibility with various amides and alkyl halides, allowing the synthesis of diverse isotopically labelled esters. Ni&#8208;catalyzed reaction of alkyl bromides, carboxylates that generated from amides, and water in the presence of a base formed the desired esters.

Abstract
A photoredox&#8208;promoted approach for the synthesis of [1,4]diazepino[1,7&#8208;a]indol&#8208;6(7H)&#8208;ones starting from N&#8208;indolyl phenylacrylamides and aroyl chlorides as radical source is reported. This method, that involves a cascade radical addition on C&#8722;C double bond followed by intramolecular cyclization at indole C2&#8208;position, affords two diastereomeric indole&#8208;fused 1,4&#8208;diazepinones characterized by a N&#8722;C(aryl) axial chirality in yields ranging from 51 to 99%.

         <title>Direct Generation of N&#8208;Alkoxycarbonyl Nitrones from Oximes: Intramolecular Cycloaddition of Oximes Having Alkene Moieties</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
&#948;,&#1013;&#8208;Unsaturated oximes, on heating with O&#8208;alkyl S&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)carbonothioates (PySCO2R) in refluxing toluene, undergo intramolecular cycloaddition to give N&#8208;alkoxycarbonylated multi&#8208;cyclic compounds. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction involves direct generation of N&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl nitrones followed by cycloaddition, instead of intramolecular oxime&#8208;olefin cycloaddition (IOOC) followed by alkoxycarbonylation. DFT calculation indicates that N&#8208;alkoxycarbonylation of oxime with PySCO2R is a concerted reaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#948;,&#1013;-Unsaturated oximes, on heating with &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-(pyridin-2-yl)carbonothioates (PySCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) in refluxing toluene, undergo intramolecular cycloaddition to give &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkoxycarbonylated multi-cyclic compounds. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction involves direct generation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkoxycarbonyl nitrones followed by cycloaddition, instead of intramolecular oxime-olefin cycloaddition (IOOC) followed by alkoxycarbonylation. DFT calculation indicates that &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkoxycarbonylation of oxime with PySCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R is a concerted reaction. The reaction of oxime with a chiral alkoxycarbonylation reagent exhibits a reasonably high diastereo-face selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Divergent Carbene Insertion into the N&#8722;H bonds of Tryptamines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Easy access to divergent products with chemoselectivity is of great importance in organic synthesis. Herein, we have developed a chemoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed carbene insertion protocol onto N&#8722;H bonds of tryptamine derivatives. Divergent insertion products are obtained by varying the nucleophilicity of the aliphatic NH of tryptamine with electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. The reaction provided N&#8722;H insertion products with broad substrate scope in good yields.

         <title>Electrochemical Reductive Carboxylation of para&#8208;Quinone Methides with CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Herein, electrochemical reductive carboxylation of para&#8208;quinone methides with CO2 was developed. A variety of value&#8208;added carboxylic acids can be accessed in moderate to excellent yields. Preliminary studies showed that para&#8208;quinone methides were reduced to benzyl carbanion during the reaction. This protocol features high atom economy, operational simplicity, and environmental friendliness, enabling the synthesis of various carboxylic compounds.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Multicomponent Reaction of Aromatic Aldehydes, Amines and Sodium Difluoromethanesulfinate: Synthesis of CF2H&#8208;Substituted Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A visible&#8208;light induced multicomponent reaction of aromatic aldehydes, amines and sodium difluoromethanesulfinate for the synthesis of fluorinated secondary amines has been investigated. The protocol affords a convenient pathway for the introduction of difluoromethyl group into imines, which generated in&#8197;situ by the reaction of aldehydes and amines. A diverse range of fluorinated secondary amines were synthesized in 43%&#8211;79% yields under room temperature. In addition, a plausible mechanism was proposed based on several control experiments.

Abstract
A four&#8208;step metal&#8208;free procedure is described for the transformation of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;methylcyclopent&#8208;2&#8208;enone derivatives into highly functionalized E&#8208;alkylidenecyclobutanes featuring oxygenated tetrasubstituted centers. The key intermediate is a (cyclobutenyl)propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol diester, easily accessed via a tandem photochemical reaction, which undergoes an original Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution reaction with alcohols to give the title products with ester&#8208;protected primary alcohol side chains.

Abstract
The efficiency of the formation of C&#8722;C bonds under palladium catalysis often depends on the nature of the carboxylate ligand and carboxylic acids or alkali metal carboxylates additives. This review which is Part B of a trilogy devoted to the topic, highlights the influence of the carboxylate unit on the hydro(hetero)arylation, hydroalkenylation and hydroalkylation reactions. The plausible reaction mechanisms are presented with, as far as possible, personal comments.

         <title>KI&#8208;Facilitated Trifunctionalization of Maleimides in Water: Access to Disulfonylated Diazosuccinimide Derivatives and their Synthetic Applications</title>

         <dc:description>









Abstract
A trifunctionalization cascade reaction of substituted maleimides was developed to generate a series of disulfonylated diazosuccinimides in satisfactory yields by employing readily available sulfonyl hydrazides as both diazo source and sulfonylation reagent. The notable features of this developed method include avoiding the use of transition metal catalysts, environmentally benign H2O as the solvent, mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance, and the late&#8208;stage modification of drugs. The derivatization reactions were effectively applied to synthesize aminosulfonylation&#8208;substituted maleimides. The involved radical pathway was also demonstrated by mechanistic studies.

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot synthesis method for functionalized bis&#8208;sulfonyl dibenzofurans was developed under an air atmosphere using potassium carbonate&#8208;mediated benzannulation of diversified &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl o&#8208;hydroxyacetophenones with 1,4&#8208;dichloro&#8208;2&#8208;butyne. A plausible mechanism was proposed and discussed. This method provides intermolecular double &#945;&#8208;propargylation, sulfonyl migration, and intramolecular ring&#8208;closure via the formation of one carbon&#8208;oxygen single (C&#8722;O) bond, one carbon&#8208;sulfur single (C&#8722;S) bond, and two carbon&#8208;carbon (C=C) double bonds.

         <title>Selective Catalysts for the Homogeneous Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and highly selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of terminal alkynes to alkenes using neutral dimeric rhodium(I) complexes of the type [Rh(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(PP)]2 is presented. Dehydroisophytol (DIP) was chosen as the alkyne for this study because of its high importance in the industrial production of synthetic vitamin E. Excellent selectivity of over 91% towards the alkene was achieved with known and new rhodium catalysts. No deactivation was observed for the [Rh(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(PP)]2 complexes and the molar Rh:DIP ratio could be increased to 1:20 000, and importantly, no reduction in selectivity was observed. The results presented open the door to the industrial application of homogeneous rhodium complexes in the semihydrogenation of terminal alkynes.</dc:description>
