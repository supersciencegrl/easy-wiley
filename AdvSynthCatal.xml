      <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Biaryls using Biaryl 2,5&#8208;Diphenylphospholanes as Ligands for Palladium&#8208;Catalysed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Here we describe the development of biaryl 2,5&#8208;diphenylphospholanes as a new class of C2&#8208;symmetric, monodentate ligands for asymmetric Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura (ASM) reactions. Screening of a series of exemplary phospholanes led to the identification of two ligands that were used to prepare a range of atropisomeric biaryl and heterobiaryl products with good to excellent levels of enantioselectivity (up to 97:3 e.r.) under mild conditions. DFT studies suggest that the formation of a constraining ligand pocket and coordination of one of the biaryl methoxy groups in the optimised ligands to the metal centre is crucial for restricting conformational freedom in the bond&#8208;forming step.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient synthesis of bulky 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;pyridine&#8208;oxazoline ligands</title>
      <dc:description>Bulky &lt;i&gt;N,N&lt;/i&gt;&#8217;&#8208;bidentate ligands can furnish catalysts with enhanced catalytic activity compared to commercially available ligands. Straightforward methods to effectively synthesize a broad range of these ligands, however, are uncommon. In this work, a simple and efficient method is developed for the synthesis of bulky &lt;i&gt;N,N&lt;/i&gt;&#8217;&#8208;bidentate ligands, including 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridines and enantioenriched pyridine&#8208;oxazolines. The Pd(II)/NIXANTPHOS catalyst system enabled synthesis of a series of bulky 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;based ligands and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;pyridine oxazoline&#8208;based enantioenriched ligands with good to excellent yields.  The ligands have been benchmarked in the aminofluorination of styrene.</dc:description>

In this work, a simple and efficient method is developed for the synthesis of bulky &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;N,N&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&#8217;&#8208;bidentate ligands, including 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridines and enantioenriched pyridine&#8208;oxazolines. The Pd(II)/NIXANTPHOS catalyst system enabled synthesis of a series of bulky 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;based ligands and (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;S&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;)&#8208;pyridine oxazoline&#8208;based enantioenriched ligands with good to excellent yields.  The ligands have been benchmarked in the aminofluorination of styrene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Ni/Co Catalyzed Reductive Hydrocyanation of Alkynes with Formamide as the Cyano Source, Dehydrant, Reductant and Solvent</title>
      <dc:description>A Ni/Co co&#8208;catalyzed reductive hydrocyanation of various alkynes is developed for the production of saturated nitriles. Hydrocyanic acid is generated in situ from safe and readily available formamide. Formamide played multiple roles as a cyano source, dehydrant, and reductant for the NiII pre&#8208;catalyst and vinyl nitriles, along with acting as the co&#8208;solvent in this reaction. Detailed mechanistic investigation supported a pathway via hydrocyanation of C&#8801;C bond and the subsequent reduction of C=C bond. Wide substrate scope, the employment of a cheap and stable nickel salt as pre&#8208;catalyst, a safe cyano source, and convenient experimental operation render this hydrocyanation practical for the laboratory synthesis of saturated nitriles.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A halogen bond donor based on a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine framework has been synthesized, and used to catalyze Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions of furans.  Electrophiles used successfully in these reactions included various enones, an aldehyde and a carboxylic acid anhydride.  The yields of the reactions were generally good using a moderate catalyst loading (0.025 or 0.1 equiv.) at a relatively low temperature (room temp. or 50 &#176;C) in acetonitrile.  The catalyst used was designed with a biaryl scaffold so that if it indeed proved to be an efficient halogen bond donor organocatalyst, an enantioenriched version of it could potentially serve as a stereoselective catalyst.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;PdCl2/CuCl2/Bi(OTf)3&#8208;promoted intramolecular domino annulation of sulfonyl o&#8208;allylarylchromanones provides tetracyclic sulfonyl dibenzooxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes and bicyclic arylnaphthalenes with good to excellent yields in MeOH at room (25 oC) and refluxing (65 oC) temperature, respectively. The starting sulfonyl o&#8208;allylarylchromanones can be easily obtained from the intermolecular cyclocondensation of &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl o&#8208;hydroxyacetophenones and o&#8208;allylbenzaldehydes. The uses of various catalysts and solvent systems are investigated herein for convenient transformation. A plausible mechanism is proposed and discussed. This protocol provides one&#8208;pot ring closure via carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8208;C) bond formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Gold Catalysis Meets Materials Science &#8211; A New Approach to pi&#8208;Extended Indolocarbazoles</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we describe a modular, convergent synthesis of substituted benzo[a]benzo[6,7]&#8208;indolo[2,3&#8208;h]carbazoles (BBICZs) using a bidirectional gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction as a key step. A building block strategy enabled the easy variation of substituents at different positions of the core structure and a general analysis of substitution effects on the materials properties of the target compounds. All BBICZs were fully characterized and their optical and electronic properties were studied experimentally as well as by computational methods. Organic thin&#8208;film transistors based on eight selected derivatives were fabricated by vacuum deposition and charge&#8208;carrier mobilities up to 1 cm2/Vs were measured.</dc:description>

      <title>Stepwise Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling of Triborylalkenes Derived from Alkynyl&#8211;B(dan)s: Regioselective and Flexible Synthesis of Tetrasubstituted Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>Alkenes with 3 boryl groups of distinct different reactivity were synthesized for the first time, and were thus demonstrated to cross&#8208;couple with aryl halides step&#8208;by&#8208;step to provide regioselectively&#8208;well&#8208;controlled tetrasubstituted alkenes. The triborylalkene, which is readily derived from the platinum&#8208;catalyzed diboration of alkynyl&#8211;B(dan)s with B2(pin)2, is our original template. Due to the high/exclusive regioselectivity and reaction efficiency of each step from the alkynyl&#8211;B(dan), tetrasubstituted alkenes with a desired carbon framework at a desired position can be prepared in high yields. For example, the alkene with four different aryl groups of p&#8208;MeOC6H4, p&#8208;CF3C6H4, p&#8208;MeC6H4, and p&#8208;NCC6H4 can be obtained in 71% overall yield via six steps (see 9a in Scheme 5), starting with the dehydrogenative borylation of p&#8208;MeC6H4C&#8801;CH with HB(dan), which is also our original reaction. Moreover, a variety of tetrasubstituted alkenes, which include regio&#8208; and stereoisomers of 9a, AIE&#8208;active TPTPE and derivatives thereof, and also (Z)&#8208;tamoxifen well&#8208;known as a drug for breast cancer, were found to be target structures accessible by this strategy.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Developments in Photo&#8208;Catalyzed/Promoted Synthesis of Indoles and Their Functionalization: Reactions and Mechanisms</title>
      <dc:description>The use of clean and renewable light sources is increasingly common in organic synthesis due to its safety, practicality and economy. Recently, photoredox catalysis has shown great application values in organic transformations because of its advantages of environmentally friendly and abundant resources. Indoles and their derivatives (indolines, oxindoles and isatins) are the core skeletons of some important organic compounds and widely&#8208;present in various natural products and pharmaceuticals with different biological activities. Therefore, the research on the synthesis and modification of indoles is particularly important for chemists and pharmacologists. This review summarizes the effects of photocatalysis on indoles synthesis and modification in recent decades. These transformations are	accomplished by using metal photocatalysts (i.e., Ir, Ru, Ni, Cu, Fe, Au, Rh, TiO2, etc.) or non&#8208;metallic photocatalysts (i.e., Rose Bengal, Eosin Y, quinones, naphthols, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, carbazoles, pyrylium salts, etc.), or without the need of photocatalysts. The detailed mechanisms of these photo&#8208;catalyzed/promoted organic reactions are also highlighted deeply. And we hope this review will be helpful to researchers interested in this promising field of photocatalyzed transformations.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Starting from cyclic diaryliodoniums and terminal alkenes, a diverse set of novel fluorenes is conveniently constructed. The reactions catalyzed by palladium undergo one conventional Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reaction and one reductive Heck reaction. The scope of alkenes is general, leading to 29 fluorenes which would expand the structural diversity of fluorene reservoir.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The selective functionalisation of arylamine derivatives with hexafluoroisopropanol through copper(II)&#8208;catalysed aerobic oxidative coupling was developed to generate various fluoroalkylated arylamines under mild conditions. This method has a wide substrate scope with excellent functional group tolerance and provides the fluorinated products in good to excellent yields.

      <title>Methyl Radical Initiated Kharasch and Related Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>An improved procedure to run halogen atom and related chalcogen group transfer radical additions is reported. The procedure relies on the thermal decomposition of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylhyponitrite (DTBHN), a safer alternative to the explosive diacetyl peroxide, to produce highly reactive methyl radicals that can initiate the chain process. This mode of initiation generates byproducts that are either gaseous (N2) or volatile (acetone and methyl halide) thereby facilitating greatly product purification by either flash column chromatography or distillation. In addition, remarkably simple and mild reaction conditions (refluxing EtOAc during 30 minutes under normal atmosphere) and a low excess of the radical precursor reagent (2.0 equivalents) make this protocol particularly attractive for preparative synthetic applications. This initiation procedure has been demonstrated with a broad scope since it works efficiently to add a range of electrophilic radicals generated from iodides, bromides, selenides and xanthates over a range of unactivated terminal alkenes. A diverse set of radical trap substrates exemplifies a broad functional group tolerance. Finally, di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxyoxalate (DTBPO) is also demonstrated as alternative source of tert&#8208;butoxyl radicals to initiate these reactions under identical conditions which gives gaseous byproducts (CO2).</dc:description>

      <title>Benzylpalladium Intermediates: Unique and Versatile Reactive Intermediates for Aromatic Functionalization</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract: Aromatic functionalizations are of current interest and importance in organic chemistry, recent transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reactions can transform inert C&#8211;H bond into C&#8211;X (X = C, O, N, etc.) bonds, greatly enriching aromatic chemistry and related fields. Some well known palladium&#8211;containing intermediates such as palladacycles and allylpalladium intermediates play an important role in organic conversions. Similar with allyl group, benzyl group also possesses the capability of stabilizing palladium through &#951;3&#8208;binding. In the process of the formation of benzyl palladium intermediate, there is a transition state of dearomatization. Therefore, it is a challenging and meaningful research topic to seize these aromatic destruction intermediates, realize selective functionalization reaction on 	aromatic ring via them, and inhibit the formation of traditional benzylated products. Herein, we summarized the recent efforts on expanding the synthetic utility, as well as exploring the mechanism in aromatic functionalization via reactive benzyl palladium intermediates. We envision that the transformation via benzyl palladium intermediates will help promote the development in the &#64257;eld of palladium&#8211;catalyzed aromatic regioselective functionalization.</dc:description>

On this review, the recent advances on asymmetric fluorination reactions promoted by chiral hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;based organocatalysts are discussed.

      <title>Propargylic Alcohols as Coupling Partners in Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Arene C&#8208;H Activation</title>
      <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed site selective arene C&#8208;H bond activation concomitant functionalization with various coupling partners gain magnificent attraction in synthetic organic chemistry as complementary to traditional transformations. Mechanistically, these C&#8208;H functionalization approaches involve directing group assisted concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation (CMD), migratory insertion, and reductive elimination sequences. In this realm, diverse categories of coupling partners were employed as C&#8208;H functionalization buddies. Particularly alkynes gain enormous  attention as annulating agents. These units coordinates with metalcycle through &#7467;&#8208;interaction produce annulation outcomes in a straightforward manner.
Very recently, propargylic alcohols were appointed as valuable archetypes in arene C&#8208;H activation armoury, as they have shown regio&#8208; and chemoselective migratory insertion into primary metalcycle species via hydroxy chelation. The influential regioselectivity was drawn by dual coordination of metal complexes with the pendent directing group and a propargylic hydroxyl group. In this review, we focused on annulations and functionalization of arenes and propargylic alcohols, which afford intricate cycles as well as complex acyclic motifs in a trouble&#8208;free manner. We categorized these transformations based on number of atoms  of propargylic alcohols involved in annulation along with some addition reactions. We anticipate to pave a way towards enhanced endeavours for discovering novel reaction avenues.</dc:description>

      <title>Stereospecific Synthesis of Glycoside Mimics Through Migita&#8211;Kosugi&#8211;Stille Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of Chemically and Configurationally Stable 1&#8208;C&#8208;Tributylstannyl Iminosugars</title>
      <dc:description>A process for the de novo synthesis of imino&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides is described. The methodology is based on the reaction of 1&#8208;C&#8208;stannylated iminosugars with various electrophiles under the conditions of Migita&#8211;Kosugi&#8211;Stille cross&#8208;couplings, which gives 1&#8208;C&#8208;substituted iminosugar derivatives in a stereoretentive process. The required iminoglycosyl stannanes are obtained by way of the highly stereoselective addition of tributylstannyllithium to (SR)&#8208; or (SS)&#8208;N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl glycosylamines, followed by an activation cyclization sequence.	Most interestingly, the methodology is tunable: the configuration of the tin adduct is controlled exclusively by the tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl auxiliary, thus giving access after ring formation to &#8216;&#945;&#8217;&#8208;configured or &#8216;&#946;&#8217;&#8208;configured iminoglycosyl stannanes. With the subsequent stereoretentive C&#8210;C bond&#8208;forming process, the methodology allows the synthesis of pseudo anomers of imino&#8208;C&#8208;glycosyl compounds in a controlled fashion.</dc:description>
