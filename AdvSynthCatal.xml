         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of Polysubstituted Carbazoles from Indoles and Simple Dicarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polysubstituted carbazoles were efficiently synthesized through direct benzannulation reaction between 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds and indoles with catalytic amount of inexpensive zirconium(IV) chloride. This transformation proved to be regioselective and furnishes 1,4&#8208;disubstituted and 1,2,4&#8208;trisubstituted carbazoles with yields ranging from 26% to 91% and broad substrate scope. Moreover, this protocol benefits from using readily accessible starting materials without the need of their pre&#8208;functionalization. The synthetic utility of the products was exemplified by functionalization of an iodocarbazole by means of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions and by the synthesis of a 3&#8208;deaza&#8208;derivative of the natural product canthin&#8208;6&#8208;one.</dc:description>

</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;regioselective dicarbofunctionalization of silylated 1,3&#8208;dienes with functionalized solid organozinc pivalates and alkyl bromides is disclosed, thus affording the alkylarylated and dialkylated silanes in a regioselective manifold. Herein, regioselectivity is steered by steric hindrance of the bulky silyl groups, which could prohibit the formation of the flexible &#960;&#8208;allylcobalt intermediate. Furthermore, derivatizations of the resulting products and modifications of bioactive molecules demonstrate the synthetical utility of our method.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric construction of substituted purine esters with tunable N&#8208;9/N&#8208;7 regioselectivity via enzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution protocol for the one&#8208;pot asymmetric synthesis of substituted purine derivatives with high product yield (up to 96%) and enantio purity (up to 99%). The controllable N&#8208;9/N&#8208;7 substitution, which posed formidable challenges in organic synthesis, could be accomplished by choosing different types of enzymes as the catalyst. This method was proved easily scalable and was successfully used to prepare a series of prodrugs of medicinally active acids. In addition, the biocatalysts exhibited good recyclability, indicating the potential of this strategy for practical applications in the pharmaceutical industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Acceleration of the Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction between 9&#8208;Functionalized Anthracenes and C60/C70 in the Cavity of a Water Soluble Subphthalocyanine Cage</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report on the acceleration of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between a series of 9&#8208;functionalized anthracenes and C60/C70  encapsulated in a water&#8208;soluble  metallo&#8208;organic Pd(II)&#8208;subphthalocyanine cage (SubPc&#8208;cage), which performs as a catalytic molecular reactor that provides a beneficial hydrophobic environment. Negatively and positively charged anthracenes do not react either with C60 or C70, due to a favored solvation in water medium and/or to detrimental interactions with positively&#8208;charged Pd(II) corners of SubPc&#8208;cage. Experiments with C60 and C70 rendered parallel results, although C70 proved more reactive, leading to anthracene cycloadducts by reaction in the &#945; bonds. All the results have been rationalized by theoretical calculations at the GFN2&#8208;xTB level.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Ring&#8208;Opening of Oxetanes Catalysed by Lewis Superacid Al(C6F5)3</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study details an aluminum&#8208;catalyzed regioselective isomerization of 2,2&#8208;disubstituted oxetanes to yield homoallylic alcohols. The reaction takes place in toluene at 40 &#186;C, employing 1 mol % of Al(C6F5)3 as catalyst. This catalytic system shows a wide substrate scope (12 examples). The optimized conditions are especially useful for electron&#8208;rich aryl oxetanes, completely suppressing the formation of allyl isomers and reducing the amount of the dimer by&#8208;product.
The synthetic applicability of the reported methodology is demonstrated by the enantioselective formal synthesis of curcuquinone and the &#963;1 receptor agonist RC&#8208;33.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Vinyl Triflates and 1,4&#8208;Dicyanobenzene to Access Alkenyl Nitrile</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a vinyl cyanation reaction of vinyl triflates and readily available 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene through a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling process. The reaction is operated under mild conditions with remarkable functional&#8208;group compatibility. Cyclic vinyl triflates with various ring sizes and substituents at different positions all reacted smoothly. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by the derivatization of pharmaceutical and natural compounds, a scale&#8208;up synthesis, and various functional group transformations. Preliminary mechanistic studies demonstrate that vinyl triflates are more reactive than 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene towards the oxidative addition to nickel catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Manufacturing of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients: Current Trends and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pharmaceutical industry has traditionally employed batch processing as a means of synthesizing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) on a commercial scale. Batch manufacturing enables API synthesis in large quantities in order to meet regulations. Yet, this strategy remains cumbersome, is labor&#8208;intensive, and creates complex logistical networks. In recent decades, batch API processing has gradually eroded American economic competitiveness and has led to the off&#8208;shoring of API manufacturing from the United States. Today it is estimated that +80% of APIs are manufactured overseas. Meanwhile, disruptions from the Coronavirus Disease (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) have exacerbated weaknesses in the global supply chain, culminating with widespread shortages of critical life&#8208;saving drugs. These shortages have emphasized the importance of reshoring drug manufacturing to the U.S. and fostered a regulatory landscape that seeks advanced methods of API manufacturing in order to bolster America&#8217;s supply chain resiliency. Recently, increased attention has been directed towards continuous drug manufacturing to enable nonstop API production within modular stand&#8208;alone flow systems. Continuous manufacturing (CM) facilitates modular automation, offers new avenues towards process intensification, and even enables in&#8208;line analytical monitoring from raw materials to packaged products. This strategy offers better conversion, increased safety, reduced waste, and overall cost savings versus traditional batch&#8208;style processing. The rise of advanced API manufacturing, coupled with the current regulatory landscape, offers a rare window of opportunity to convert traditional batch pharmaceutical processes into continuous, streamlined production systems to on&#8208;shore API manufacturing and eliminate drug shortages. This review will outline the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the CM of APIs and will highlight the translation of chemistry and unit operations from batch processes to modular CM systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Reductive Elimination from Bismuth(V) Compounds for Aryl Transfer to Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate that regioselective aryl transfer to the nucleophile occurs rapidly under mild conditions via reductive elimination and show that regioselectivity is primarily governed by steric factors imparted by ortho substituents on the recipient ring. Computational modeling and x&#8208;ray crystallography confirm that the recipient aryl ring is positioned in the equatorial coordination site and oriented orthogonally to the axial X&#8208;Bi&#8208;Ph bond (X = nucleophile) in a trigonal bipyramidal structure. The orientation of the ortho&#8208;substituted aryl ring allows the appropriate orbital to overlap between its ipso carbon and nucleophile, which enhances the rate of aryl transfer to the nucleophile and dictates the regioselective reductive elimination from Bi(V) compounds. This level of stereoelectronic control results in significantly enhanced reaction rate and selectivity and creates an opportunity to rationally design ligand systems for highly selective aryl transfer reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Stereoselective Decarboxylative Addition of &#945;&#8208;Amido Malonic Acid Half Oxyesters to Isatins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereoselective reaction of &#945;&#8208;amido&#8208;substituted malonic acid half oxyesters (amido&#8208;MAHOs) with isatins was developed. A cinchona alkaloid thiourea catalyst gave products bearing a tetrasubstituted stereogenic centre in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (75&#8208;99% yield, 83:17&#8208;97:3 dr, 92:8&#8208;99:1 er). The obtained products can be converted into some chiral compounds without loss of enantiopurity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to clarify the origin of stereoselectivities, and revealed that the first centre is set in the decarboxylation, the second in the protonation.</dc:description>

         <title>The Intermolecular Pauson&#8208;Khand Reaction: Applications, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The rapid assembly of complex organic molecules from simple and structurally diverse building blocks is a prevalent challenge in organic synthesis. The Pauson&#8208;Khand reaction (PKR) is a method of choice for the construction of five membered rings that has historically been popularized as a late&#8208;stage intramolecular cyclization method. The intermolecular version of the PKR, on the other hand, constitutes a powerful approach for the rapid assembly of densely functionalized cyclopentanic cores at early stages of a synthetic sequence. Despite its potential, the intermolecular PKR is much less prevalent in the organic synthesis literature due to several historical limitations, most importantly a reduced scope with respect to the alkene component of the reaction. The last decade has witnessed important developments in the area including a) experimental and theoretical studies that provide a good mechanistic understanding of the reaction and its selectivity, b) methodological developments that have broadened the scope of potential alkene partners, and c) the development of catalytic enantioselective versions that provide useful levels of enantioselectivity. In parallel, remarkable synthetic applications of the intermolecular PKR have emerged, including (enantioselective) total syntheses of complex natural products (polycyclic terpenes, alkaloids, prostanes) as well as examples of industrial relevance. A fundamental limitation of the PKR that needs to be addressed in the future is the current lack of a ligand&#8208;accelerated version of the reaction, which would be a promising advance towards developing more efficient and general catalytic (enantioselective) reactions.

         <title>FeCl3&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H Heteroarylation Enabled by Photoinduced Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer</title>

Abstract
Herein, we report a strategy for pyrimidination of inert alkanes via synergistic visible light&#8208;driven redox reaction and FeCl3 catalysis. This transformation involves C&#8722;H activation by a chlorine radical generated during the iron&#8208;promoted ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer process, triggering subsequent C&#8722;H pyrimidination. The substrates and catalysts are inexpensive and readily available, while the reaction conditions and procedures are simple without the need for external oxidants. This work provides a practical approach for synthesizing pyrimidine derivatives with high structural diversity.

Abstract
The regioselective functionalization of heptacyclo[6.6.0.02,6.03,13.04,11.05,9.010,14]tetradecane (HCTD) under photocatalytic conditions is described. The protocols developed share an initial photo&#8208;triggered hydrogen atom abstraction that regioselectively generates the necessary HCTD&#8208;radical preferentially at position 1&#8208;, they employ no excess of the precious cage carbocycle, and enable the straightforward access to a broad variety of 1&#8208;(alkyl, aryl, or sulfinyl) HCTDs in moderate but still synthetically useful yields. The scope and limitations of each transformation are also discussed.

Abstract
A regio&#8208; and diastereoselective conjugate addition reaction of Grignard reagents to fluoroalkyl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl ketimines was disclosed. A range of different fluoroalkyls and Grignard reagents were well tolerated, giving up to 99% diastereomeric and regioisomeric ratios. This reaction provided a straightforward method for the synthesis of a variety of enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;fluorinated enamines and derivatives which are difficult to achieve with other methods.

Abstract
A strategy was developed for synthesizing furan&#8208;fused dibenzotropones via intramolecular Wittig reactions of alkylidene dibenzo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;tropolones and acylating reactants in catalytic or stoichiometric conditions. With these protocols, a series of furo[2,3&#8208;f]dibenzotropones were obtained in 49&#8211;99% yields within 1&#8211;10&#8197;hours. Mechanistic studies of the base&#8208;free phenomena revealed that the organophosphane acts both as a mediator and a regenerable Br&#248;nsted base under heating.

         <title>Synthesis of Selenooxazoles through Electrochemical Oxidative Selenocyclization of N&#8208;Propargylamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An electrocatalytic approach for the bromide&#8208;mediated selenocyclization of N&#8208;propargylamides with diselenides is described, providing a synthetic route for the synthesis of various seleno&#8208;oxazoles in 41&#8211;73% yields. The success of gram&#8208;scale experiments demonstrate the potential value of this protocol in synthetic chemistry. Mechanistic investigations suggest that this selenocyclization protocol proceed through two possible pathways, including selenium cation and radical processes.

Abstract
Elaborated molecular architectures, especially carbocyclic, heterocyclic, endocyclic, and polycyclic molecular structures, serve as an important class of organic complexes because they are frequently occurring core structural units in a variety of biologically and pharmacologically relevant natural products, drug molecules, agrochemicals, and functional materials. A main challenge of current synthetic approaches is the development of strategically efficient and selective formation of these compounds from easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle starting materials. The cascade cyclizations of 1,7&#8208;enynes have afforded an indispensable method for accessing molecular complexity and diversity, thus highlighting their potential significance in both academic and industrial communities. In the last decades, tremendous efforts have been devoted to discovering convenient routes to access sophisticated annulation derivatives, and a wide range of powerful and straightforward synthetic strategies have been reported. In this review, the latest achievements in the cascade cyclization reactions of 1,7&#8208;enynes are summarized, which could be separated into three categories: (1) Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reactions of 1,7&#8208;enynes; (2) Metal&#8208;free catalyzed reactions of 1,7&#8208;enynes; (3) Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions of 1,7&#8208;enynes.

Abstract
Photoinduced chemical transformations have become a promising aspect of organic synthesis. This review focuses on the recent advancements in harnessing photoinduced processes for the formation of carbon&#8208;chalcogen (C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, C&#8722;Se, and C&#8722;Te) bonds under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. These pathways typically involve either a radical mechanism or the creation of electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes. The review explores the intricacies of the underlying mechanisms, discusses limitations, and evaluates the applicability of various methodologies in this field. Notably, photocatalyst and transition metal&#8208;free photochemical reactions offer effective alternatives to enhance sustainability in this research area.

         <title>A Direct Synthesis of Substituted Exocyclic 1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones by Base&#8208;Mediated Multicomponent [3+2] Cycloaddition</title>

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component, base&#8208;mediated [3+2] cycloaddition reaction to synthesize 1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones from readily available amino acid esters, aldehydes, and terminal alkynes was reported. Isolation of the intermediate and the detailed mechanistic study revealed the course of the reaction. This multi&#8208;component reaction proceeds via imine formation followed by the nucleophilic addition of alkyne to form a propargylamine precursor. Base&#8208;mediated conversion of propargylamine precursor into 1&#8208;azadiene followed by in&#8197;situ ketene formation leading to [3+2] cycloaddition that ultimately produces unusual 1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones.

Abstract
Herein, the selective ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;C&#8722;H bond borylation of NH&#8208;aryl sulfoximines is reported. Regioselectivity is achieved by the choice of commercially available ligands giving fast excess to valuable borylated aryl sulfoximine building blogs. The utility of the borylated products is demonstrated for the formation of C&#8722;O, C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;D, and C&#8722;I bonds.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Sulfoxonium Ylides Using Hypervalent Iodine Compounds</title>

Abstract
A Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of &#945;&#8208;arylated sulfoxonium ylides has been achieved from mesitylene&#8208;derived diaryliodonium salts and &#945;&#8208;carbonyl sulfoxonium ylides. The reaction is believed to proceed via an electrophilic Cu(III)&#8208;aryl intermediate that can be trapped upon nucleophilic attack of the sulfoxonium ylide precursor. The reaction was tolerant to both &#945;&#8208;keto and &#945;&#8208;ester&#8208;derived sulfoxonium ylides, to drug&#8208;derived ylide motifs and to electronically&#8208;diverse arenes, and enabled the direct synthesis of 32 &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;sulfoxonium ylides in 42&#8211;85% yield.

         <title>Flavin&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidative C&#8722;C Bond Formation by Metal/Light&#8208;Free Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Biomimetic flavin catalysts enable green and selective aerobic oxidative transformations. However, most previous studies tended to focus on reproducing the enzymatic function of flavin monooxygenase, thereby limiting the applications of flavin catalysts to oxygen&#8208;atom transfer reactions. We herein report a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) between the sp3 C&#8722;H bond of tetrahydroisoquinolines and the sp3 and sp2 C&#8722;H bonds of carbon nucleophiles, such as &#945;&#8208;methylene carbonyl compounds, nitromethane, and indoles, for C&#8722;C bond formation promoted by flavin catalysts. Flavin catalysis enables the oxidative C&#8722;H activation of tetrahydroisoquinolines and the efficient activation of molecular oxygen (1&#8197;atm) under mild and metal/light&#8208;free conditions, thus facilitating a green aerobic CDC that generates benign water as the sole by&#8208;product.

         <title>Synthesis of Indoles via Sigmatropic Rearrangements and Olefin Isomerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Indoles are important heterocycles in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, and their atom&#8208;economical synthesis is needed. Herein, we describe the synthesis of indoles using sigmatropic rearrangements. The N&#8208;allylaniline was oxidized by environmentally benign hydrogen peroxide, and spontaneous [2,3]&#8208;Meisenheimer rearrangement gave N&#8208;allyloxyaniline. Subsequent treatment with a ruthenium catalyst afforded N&#8208;vinyloxyaniline, which underwent [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement to give indoles, expelling water as the only byproduct. The whole sequence is free of quantitative salt byproducts, thereby avoiding aqueous work up and cutting off the inorganic waste.

Abstract
A domino SNAr&#8208;ihDA/rDA reaction was developed from rarely exploited 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazines with bifunctional alkyne tethered nucleophiles to construct various fused non&#8208;aromatic/heteroaromatic bicycles in yields ranging from 56 to 99%, notably within the family of valuable spirooxindole derivatives. In this study, the challenging enantioselective phase&#8208;transfer catalyzed arylation of a sulfonyl&#8208;triazine was also demonstrated with up to 66%&#8197;ee. In both racemic and asymmetric processes, the nature of the leaving group at C3 was key to successfully achieve these sequences.

Abstract
&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated ketones are highly versatile intermediates in organic synthesis, widely being used as substrates in e.&#8201;g. 1,4&#8208;addition&#8208; and Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. Their synthesis, however, often proceeds via multi&#8208;step pathways. Here we present an alternative methodology for the one&#8208;pot formation of 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ones by the Pd&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;coupling of readily available bromides and lithium 1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes, proceeding in 2.5&#8197;h at 40&#8201;&#176;C. In situ hydrolysis of the intermediate 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes affords the desired 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ones, providing a direct cross&#8208;coupling method to access isomerically pure (E)&#8208;enones.

         <title>Stereospecific Indium(III)&#8208;catalysed tandem cycloisomerization of functionalized 1,6&#8208;enynes: scope and mechanistic insights</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tandem cycloisomerization reactions of functionalized 1,6&#8208;enynes under indium(III) catalysis are described. This atom&#8208;economic transformation proceeds smoothly with 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig regioselectivity using commercial In(III) halides and 1,6&#8208;enynes furnished with alcohol, carboxylic acid or amine functional groups to give bicyclic structures in good yields and diastereoselectivities. The reaction with enynals involves a three&#8211;step mechanism to give an oxatricycle and a conjugated 1,3&#8208;diene. In the absence of the internal nucleophile the enyne cycloisomerization evolves through a skeletal rearrangement or a cyclopropanation reaction after the regioselective 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization. The 1,6&#8208;enyne cycloisomerization is stereospecific and the stereoselectivity appears to be independent of the internal nucleophile. Experimental data support a common reaction mechanism involving an initial alkyne electrophilic &#960;&#8208;coordination of In(III) followed by Markovnikov electrophilic alkene addition and ring&#8208;closure by nucleophilic attack. DFT studies hold up a stepwise mechanism involving the formation of a chiral non&#8208;classical carbocation intermediate that determines the diastereoselectivity of this tandem cycloisomerization reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, the use of triphenylmethylium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate as an efficient catalyst for the intermolecular dehydrative coupling of p&#8208;hydroxymandelic acid hydrate with substituted aromatic amines and (thio)phenols was developed, which allows for the preparation of aryl acetic acid derivatives in a convenient manner. Notably, this method offers several advantages, including being metal&#8208;free, prefunctionalization free, high atom efficiency, highc regioselective, and utilizing easily accessible starting materials. Additionally, it exhibits a broad substrate scope, enabling the synthesis of a range of aryl acetic acid derivatives. Furthermore, this method can also be applied to the etherification of arylthiol derivatives, facilitating the preparation of various thiolated products. The readily available starting materials and broad substrate scope enhance the applicability and potential utility of this method in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Length Scale Communication Effects in Catalysis: Thinking Big and Acting Small</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of hierarchically structured materials as catalysts has been finding increasing application in the past years. For these catalytic systems, not only the nano&#8208;scale matters: a high degree of order across multiple length scales, along with its control and analytical assessment, is of paramount importance to obtain innovative properties that can find application in catalysis. Most reviews dealing with hierarchically structured materials are concerned with the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; transfer of structural information along the different length scales, with special emphasis on the transmission of chirality. Due to their mesoscale size together with their complex behaviour, these systems are susceptible to feel the effects of macroscopic forces, that can exert a &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; control of their catalytic properties, so that an external stimulus, acting at the level of the supramolecular architecture of the catalyst, can ultimately determine the outcome of the catalyzed reaction at the molecular level.
	We review in this paper some recent reports that deal with the experimental implementation of this concept, either by using a mechanical force in a full range direct transmission to the reaction coordinate, or by means of a stepwise relay transmission from the macroscopic level (purely supramolecular chirality) to the nanoscopic one. We focus in this review on these multi&#8208;length scale communication control effects, identifying the different mechanisms that are affecting the catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A highly enantioselective biocatalytic dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of 2(quinoline&#8208;8&#8208;yl) 3&#8208;methylbenzaldehydes and 1&#8208;naphthaldehydes is described. The reaction proceeds by atroposelective carbonyl reduction catalyzed by commercial ketoreductases (KREDs), generally reaching high conversions and excellent enantiomeric excesses. Both atropoisomers of the final alcohols can be obtained by a proper selection of the biocatalyst. The DKR strategy relies in the racemization of the stereogenic axis that takes place thanks to a transient Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction (LABI) between the nitrogen in the quinoline and the carbonyl group.</dc:description>

Abstract
We report here a practical protocol for the asymmetric synthesis of amino acids (AAs) with a CF3&#8208;containing 3,2&#8217;&#8208;pyrrolidinyl spirooxindole skeleton with three defined carbon stereocenters via a sequential Michael/Mannich [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction. The coupling of a robust and stereochemically stable chiral dehydroalanine Ni(II) complex with various N&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethylisatin ketimines in the presence of triethylamine afforded a library of single diastereomeric complexes with a 3,2&#8217;&#8208;pyrrolidinyl spirooxindole moiety in 36&#8211;71% yields. In particular, the change of base to LiOH allowed to obtain predominantly the Michael addition product in 76% yield. Finally, the decomposition of the obtained Ni(II) complexes with 3&#8197;N HCl provided the target complex AA with a 3,2&#8217;&#8208;pyrrolidinyl spirooxindole core and (2S,4R)&#8208;2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;5,5,5&#8208;trifluoropentanoic acid &#8211; an (S)&#8208;norvaline derivative, together with easy recovery of the chiral auxiliary ligand for the synthesis of the starting dehydroalanine complex.

&lt;p&gt;We report here a practical protocol for the asymmetric synthesis of amino acids (AAs) with a CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-containing 3,2&#8217;-pyrrolidinyl spirooxindole skeleton with three defined carbon stereocenters via a sequential Michael/Mannich [3+2]-cycloaddition reaction. The coupling of a robust and stereochemically stable chiral dehydroalanine Ni(II) complex with various &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-2,2,2-trifluoroethylisatin ketimines in the presence of triethylamine afforded a library of single diastereomeric complexes with a 3,2&#8217;-pyrrolidinyl spirooxindole moiety in 36&#8211;71% yields. In particular, the change of base to LiOH allowed to obtain predominantly the Michael addition product in 76% yield. Finally, the decomposition of the obtained Ni(II) complexes with 3&#8197;N HCl provided the target complex AA with a 3,2&#8217;-pyrrolidinyl spirooxindole core and (2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,4&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-2,4-diamino-5,5,5-trifluoropentanoic acid &#8211; an (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-norvaline derivative, together with easy recovery of the chiral auxiliary ligand for the synthesis of the starting dehydroalanine complex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible Light instead of Transition Metal: Electron Donor Acceptor Complex Enabled Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Halides with Active Methylene Compounds</title>

Abstract
An arylation of anions of active methylene compounds with aryl halides provides an access to synthetically versatile &#945;&#8208;arylated 1,3&#8208;diketones, &#946;&#8208;keto esters, &#946;&#8208;keto nitriles, &#946;&#8208;cyano esters, etc. Previously, these C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions have been accomplished only using transition metal&#8208;based catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate that these arylations can be successfully realized under catalyst&#8208;free conditions employing the electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex photoactivation strategy. The protocol was further optimized for a semi&#8208;one pot synthesis of indole derivatives via an intramolecular C&#8722;C coupling.

Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed heterocyclization/carbonylation/arylation cascade reaction between &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated N&#8722;Ts hydrazones and commercially available arylboronic acids as coupling partners is described, producing 2&#8208;pyrazoline&#8208;ketone derivatives in 11&#8211;78% yield. A detailed statistical analysis of reactivity patterns of boronic acids provided key information about the limitations of the method, highlighting the challenges of degradation pathways. Our methodology offers a tool for synthesizing diverse 2&#8208;pyrazoline&#8208;ketone derivatives, expanding the toolbox of accessible N&#8722;N&#8208;heterocycles.

         <title>Cyclisation of Alkynyl Alcohols and Carboxylic Acids Mediated by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Copper(I) Complexes</title>

Abstract
The cyclisation of alkynyl alcohols and carboxylic acids in the presence of a [Cu(NHC)2]X complex is reported. The reactions were carried out in technical grade toluene in the presence of air with a catalyst that is readily accessible. N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes are recognised for stabilising metal centres in a range of oxidation states, and this work further supports that NHCs can also be used as activation sites in air and moisture stable yet active catalysts.

Abstract
A method for the synthesis of (E)&#8208;vinyl sulfones and alkynyl sulfones through the cleavage of thiosulfonate promoted by the formation of EDA complexes under visible light irradiation at room temperature without the need for other metal catalysts is described. The mechanism study shows that sodium iodide and thiosulfonate form EDA complexes under visible light irradiation, resulting in a single&#8208;electron transfer cleavage to generate sulfonyl radicals, which then react with olefins or alkynes to produce (E)&#8208;vinyl sulfones or alkynyl sulfones, respectively. This method is applicable to 44 olefin and alkyne substrates, with yields ranging from 38% to 90%, providing a radical synthesis approach for the preparation of sulfonylated compounds.

Abstract
An EDA complex comprising N&#8208;allyl bromodifluoroacetamides and tertiary alkyl amine was exploited to facilitate annulative difunctionalization reaction under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This external photocatalyst&#8208;free methodology garners olefin&#8208;olefin coupling featuring a radical Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement and produced long&#8208;chain functionalized gem&#8208;difluoropyrrolidones from N&#8208;substituted methacryloyl sulfonamides, while simple N&#8208;aryl methacrylamides furnished pyrrolidinone&#8208;oxindole hybrid lactams in high yields. Mechanistic investigations substantiate a combined reaction mechanism, involving charge&#8208;transfer EDA complex&#8208;based radical cascade, alongside an &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical&#8208;triggered XAT process, exhibiting a quantum yield value of 1.48.

Abstract
An iron&#8208;catalyzed direct C3&#8722;H radical trifluoromethylthiolation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones has been developed. This protocol uses earth&#8208;abundant FeSO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7H2O as the catalyst, and AgSCF3 as the trifluoromethylthiolating reagent to provide various SCF3&#8208;containing quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives in 26&#8211;88% yields. Preliminary mechanistic investigations indicate that the reaction proceeds through a radical pathway.

Abstract
The catalytic deoxygenative reduction of hydrazides to the corresponding alkyl hydrazine with PhSiH3 via B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation is reported. This metal&#8208;free protocol is compatible with various acylhydrazides and diacylhydrazides, giving rise to a variety of structurally diverse alkyl hydrazine products in 63&#8211;95% yields. The proper selection of borane catalyst and hydrosilane reductant is essential for catalysis. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the reaction involves a hydrazone intermediate.

         <title>Chiral 1&#8208;phosphabarrelene&#8208;pyridines as suitable ligands for the Rh/Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of chiral phosphabarrelene&#8208;pyridine ligands. Their synthesis benefit from our improvement of the reaction conditions to overcome the low yields associated to the [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of phosphinine intermediates with hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;butyne, which is key to install the phosphabarrelene P&#8208;stereocenter. Their potential in asymmetric catalysis was assessed in the Rh&#8208; and Ir&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of cyclic &#946;&#8208;enamides and &#946;&#8208;dehydroamino acid derivatives. We found that the catalytic system containing a tert&#8208;butyl substituent at the ortho position of the phosphabarrelene moiety is able to successfully hydrogenate a range of cyclic &#946;&#8208;enamides (ee&#8217;s between 92% to 94%) and &#946;&#8208;dehydroamino acid derivatives (ee&#8217;s between 93% to 95%). Moreover, the reactions can be carried out in the environmentally friendly 1,2&#8208;propylene carbonate as solvent with no loss of enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies with the Rh/P,N catalytic systems agree with the Landis&#8208;Halpern mechanism and explain the influence of the substituent of the phosphabarrelene on enantioselectivity. Finally, we also verified that the hydrogenation can be carried out at large scale maintaining the high enantioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Photoredox Catalysis with Vanadium Complexes in Low Oxidation State: Diastereoselective Pinacol Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Dual photoredox catalysis is modifying the approach to sustainable metal catalysis based on metals in low oxidation state, as the use of stoichiometric metal as reductants are avoided. In this study, we showcase the potential use of vanadium in a dual photoredox process, allowing us to effectively control the formation of V(II) and its corresponding chemical reactions. A diastereoselective pinacol coupling with aromatic aldehydes is described. The process shows broad scope, and interestingly, unprotected salicylic aldehydes are compatible with the reaction protocol. Additionally, among all the ligands investigated we found that inexpensive bipyridines control the diastereoselection of the reaction favoring the d,l chiral compound (dr&gt;20:1 for most of the aldehydes investigated). To promote the reaction and avoid an unproductive and not stereoselective radical coupling of the generated ketyl radical, the use of [DMQA]+, a stable organic dye, was found crucial. Furthermore, this dye possesses the remarkable capability of efficiently capturing light in the red segment of the visible spectrum, effectively raising efficiency of the protocol. The utilization of red light carries notable advantages in terms of penetration and safety, making it particularly significant. Moreover, careful photophysical investigations were able to give indications about the mechanism of the reaction.

         <dc:description>In this paper, we present a one&#8208;pot protocol that enables a straightforward and selective transformation of alkyl benzothiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl and phenyltetrazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl sulfones and acyl chlorides into ketones, E&#8208;olefins, Z&#8208;olefins, and even pyrroles. The final product of the reaction depends on the proper choice of the reaction workup. Notably, the protocol designed for olefin formation allows for an easy switch between E&#8208; and Z&#8208;olefin formation by simple adjustments in the reaction workup. These developed protocols facilitate the formation of all compounds under mild reaction conditions, as evidenced by the smooth synthesis of (nitro)&#8208;fatty acids, and the concept can be extended to other product formations, as demonstrated by the synthesis of pyrroles.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing novel borazine substitution patterns through late&#8208;stage iodination</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have defined a procedure for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of aryl borazines to facilitate the synthesis of a diverse array of borazine derivatives with varying substitution patterns, paving the way for further exploration of the field.
More in detail, we have studied and disclosed a simple iodination procedure that could be applied to several differently substituted substrates (1a&#8208;i) with good to excellent yields (47&#8208;96%).
The representative iodinated compounds 2b and 2e, were utilized to test their use in further representative functionalization steps such as cyanation, Heck, and Sonogashira reactions. All products 3a&#8208;e were obtained in satisfactory good to very good yields considering the multiple (three or six times) concomitant reactions.

         <title>In Situ Generated, Tetracoordinated Copper(II)&#8208;Quinoline Complexes as Photocatalysts for the Chlorosulfonylation of Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Volume 365, Issue 24, Page 4701-4707, December 19, 2023. </description>

Abstract
A series of copper complexes was synthesized and studied as photocatalysts for the chlorosulfonylation of olefins. Featuring a tetradentate ligand consisting of one amino quinoline and two methyl pyridine moieties, the resulting Cu(II)&#8208;complex is effective under visible light irradiation to add sulfonyl chlorides to alkenes and alkynes, including unactivated aliphatic olefins. A weak base additive such as Na2CO3 prevents catalyst poisoning, resulting in an improvement of reaction yields and catalyst lifetime. A broad scope of sulfonyl chlorides and alkenes/alkynes as coupling partners are amenable for the title process, including examples previously reported unsuccessful with established copper&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Quaternary Ammonium Salts: Catalysts for Hydrosilylation of Alkynes with Hydrosilanes</title>

Abstract
Mixing i&#8208;PrI and DABCO in solvent EtCN gave two quaternary ammonium salts (QASs) quantitatively, one of which is monocationic (QAS&#8208;1) and the other is dicationic (QAS&#8208;2). These QASs were found to catalyze hydrosilylation of alkynes with hydrosilanes (HAH) without the aid of metal and metalloid catalysts. This organocatalysis can be applied to a variety of alkynes: terminal/internal aryl and alkyl alkynes with/without a functional group. With dihydrosilanes (H2Si), the HAH occurred with high E&#8208;selectivity through syn addition, which was exclusively observed when using terminal alkyl alkynes, irrespective of a hydrosilane used. A scalable HAH is also feasible. The H&#8722;Si unit remaining in alkenylsilanes derived from H2Si is available for dehydrogenative alkynylation and N&#8208;heteroarylation under zinc&#8211;pyridine catalysis. This synthetic application delivers unique silicon compounds that have, for instance, alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, and alkynyl groups in a single molecule. Mechanistic studies suggested that alkynes activated by QASs irreversibly react with hydrosilanes that become more nucleophilic by the coordination of EtCN. A radical pathway is unlikely. The QAS catalysts can be recovered and reused at least 5&#8197;times.

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Carboxylic Acids through Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrocarboxylation of Allenes with Diisobutylaluminum Hydride and Carbon Dioxide</title>

Abstract
A regioselective method for synthesizing &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;quaternary carboxylic acids through the copper&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarboxylation of allenes with CO2 is described. Allenes undergo hydroalumination with diisobutylaluminum hydride, followed by carboxylation of the resulting allylaluminum intermediate. The presence of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand is essential for enhancing the reactivity of the reaction. The good functional group compatibility of the reaction allows the synthesis of a wide range of functionalized &#945;&#8208;quaternary carboxylic acids with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities for synthetic and medicinal applications.

Abstract
Alkane&#8208;, arene&#8208;, and perfluoroalkanesulfonyl groups are widely used in organic synthesis to protect amino functionalities or to facilitate their installation. Protection of amino functions by a sulfonyl group to form sulfonamides is advantageous as they are easy to purify and tolerate various reaction conditions. On the other hand, sulfonyl group removal is difficult. Herein, we present a versatile metal&#8208;free photocatalytic reductive method for desulfonylation of sulfonamides and aryl sulfonates to the parent amines mediated by flavin derivatives, namely deazaisoalloxazines and deazaalloxazines, and visible light. Photocatalysis with 5&#8208;deazalloxazines is shown to even mediate the cleavage of perfluoroalkanesulfonamides (triflylamides and nonaflylamides), which is significantly more difficult than that of other sulfonamides and has previously not been achieved by photochemical means. The method is shown to perform consecutive desulfonylation and dealkylation of N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenylperfluoroalkanesulfonamides affording primary anilines. This occurs via consecutive reductive and oxidative catalytic cycles mediated by the flavin catalyst. The perfluoroalkylsulfonyl group fulfils a dual role serving as a protecting group and, after removal by the reductive cycle, as the species driving the oxidative dealkylation reaction.

Abstract
A concise method for the synthesis furan and benzene fused 2&#8208;tetralones via photo&#8208;induced rearrangement of 2&#8242;&#8208;(furan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;ols was developed. Under argon atmosphere and room temperature, 6,7&#8208;dihydrophenanthro[9,10&#8208;b]furan&#8208;5(4H)&#8208;ones were obtained by irradiating 2&#8242;&#8208;(furan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;ols with a 254&#8197;nm UV lamp (64&#8197;W) in dichloromethane (DCM) for 1&#8197;hour. The reaction mechanism includes 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization, thermal suprafacial [1,5]&#8208;H shift, double thermal suprafacial [1,3]&#8208;H shift and keto&#8208;enol isomerization.

Abstract
2&#8208;Iminothiazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;one, 5&#8208;ethylidenethiazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;one, and thiazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thione are all medicinally relevant structures. In this work, a NaSO2CF3&#8208;promoted [2+2+1] cascade annulation reaction of CF3&#8208;imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides and isothiocyanates was reported to synthesize a variety of decorated thiazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thiones in 35&#8211;91% yields with exclusive stereoselectivity. The gram&#8208;scale reaction and further chemoselective S&#8208;alkylations demonstrated the synthetic utilities of this transformation.

Abstract
Herein, an electrochemical oxidative approach for the synthesis of N&#8208;sulfenyl and N&#8208;phosphinyl sulfoximines has been established from readily available NH&#8208;sulfoximines with thiophenols and diarylphosphine oxides. Utilizing the synergistic effect of halide salt and electrochemical oxidation, the desired products are obtained at room temperature in the absence of any acidic/basic/metallic additives.

Abstract
Synthesis of benzoxazoles via amide formation from amino phenols and &#945;&#8208;diazoesters using dicobalt octacarbonyl as a solid CO source is reported. Our methodology provides a strategy for synthesizing substituted benzoxazoles with methylene linker between the benzoxazole and aromatic ring systems. Substrates with different substituents were employed to produce corresponding benzoxazoles. The synthesized compounds were characterized by using standard spectroscopic and analytical techniques including single crystal XRD studies.

Abstract
We demonstrate a photocatalyst and transition metal catalyst free photo&#8208;activation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones in visible light in the presence of an acid catalyst. The photoactivated quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one species transfers its energy to oxygen which promotes C&#8722;N cross dehydrogenative coupling with nucleophilic partners such as carbazoles, azoles and amides giving the products in 42&#8211;75% yields. Preliminary studies reveal quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one&#8208;carbazole adducts to display fluorescent properties including Intramolecular Charge Transfer (ICT) and Aggregate Induced Emission (AIE).

Preliminary studies reveal quinoxalin-2(1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-one-carbazole adducts to display fluorescent properties including Intramolecular Charge Transfer (ICT) and Aggregate Induced Emission (AIE).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Various symmetrical and unsymmetrical indolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazoles were synthesized in a one&#8208; or two&#8208;step reaction using &#945;&#8208;haloketones and indoles. The developed methodology demonstrated controllable chemoselectivity and gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Furthermore, this transformation was compatible with other &#945;&#8208;functionalized ketones, such as &#945;&#8208;hydroxy and &#945;&#8208;acetyloxy ketones, allowing for the formation of their corresponding indolocarbazoles. Additionally, our photochemical research has revealed that all the indolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazoles exhibited dual fluorescence, with the relative intensity varying depending on the solvent.

Abstract
Condensations of the title educts R4CH=CH(C=O)CH2CO2Et and R6CH=CHNO2 in the presence of NEt3 and the catalyst &#923;&#8208;[Co((S,S)&#8208;dpen)3]3+2Cl&#8722;B(C6F5)4&#8722; (both 10&#8197;mol%, 0&#8201;&#176;C; dpen=1,2&#8208;diphenylethylenediamine) afford R6CHCH(NO2)CH(R4)CH2C(OH)CCO2Et, with three contiguous carbon stereocenters, as &gt;99:1 to 85:15 mixtures of diastereomers (ten examples). The major diastereomers are isolated in 81&#8211;63% yields and 97&#8211;76% ee. When R4 and R6 are both aryl groups, additions of 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylquanidine/CH3CN epimerize the CHNO2 moieties, affording 78:22 to 67:33 mixtures of the new/old diastereomers (2&#8197;h, RT). Alternatively, epimerization to &gt;99:1 mixtures occurs spontaneously over 4 weeks in hexanes/isopropanol. These transformations entail two consecutive Michael additions, and two crystal structures confirm the relative and absolute product configurations. These assignments are supported by NMR data in solution and literature studies of similar compounds. Overall, catalyst &#923;&#8208;[Co((S,S)&#8208;dpen)3]3+2Cl&#8722;B(C6F5)4&#8722; affords superior yields and enantio&#8208; or diastereoselectivities compared to those previously reported for the title reaction.

         <title>Molecular Oxygen&#8208;Induced Transamidation of Unactivated Amides in Diethyl Carbonate in the Presence of a Palladium Catalyst</title>

Abstract
Herein we disclose a palladium&#8208;catalyzed procedure for the transamidation of structurally diverse amides with amines based on the use of molecular oxygen as palladium&#8208;activating agent. The reaction, which is scalable and amenable for the preparation of enantioenriched compounds, is carried out in a bio&#8208;degradable solvent often used as a fuel additive, diethyl carbonate. As a result of the 10&#8722;4&#8197;mol% of catalyst required, final products are isolated containing palladium impurities in a concentration of 0.1&#8197;ppm. Two kinetically different mechanistic pathways are proposed for this reaction on account of a number of experiments such as kinetic curves, TEM images, catalyst poisoning experiments, UPLC&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS identification of intermediates and EPR spectra of reaction crude.

Abstract
Here we present a catalyst&#8208;free protocol for the purple light&#8208;mediated anti&#8208;Markovnikov functionalization of alkenes with thiols. Crucial to the generation of the thiyl radical was the formation of a key photo&#8208;active complex. More than 30 thioether products were obtained, demonstrating tolerance towards different functional groups and scalability up to 5&#8197;mmol of alkene. Two different reaction conditions have been developed, varying both the solvent and the amount of thiol. Depending on the alkene structure, water can be used as an alternative to dichloromethane as a solvent, thus increasing the sustainability of the whole process.

Abstract
A substrate&#8208;controlled [4+1] annulation of sulfoxonium ylides with maleimides via Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation is developed. The reaction of sulfoxonium ylides with 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;arylmaleimides in the presence of AgNTf2 diastereoselectively provides diversely functionalized indanonylpyrroline&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione derivatives. Furthermore, in the presence of AgBF4, the subsequent reaction with maleimides leads to biologically intriguing various spiroindanonylpyrroline&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones. This methodology offers a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and diastereoselectivity.

&lt;p&gt;A substrate-controlled [4+1] annulation of sulfoxonium ylides with maleimides &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; Rh(III)-catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation is developed. The reaction of sulfoxonium ylides with 2-methyl-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-arylmaleimides in the presence of AgNTf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; diastereoselectively provides diversely functionalized indanonylpyrroline-2,5-dione derivatives. Furthermore, in the presence of AgBF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the subsequent reaction with maleimides leads to biologically intriguing various spiroindanonylpyrroline-2,5-diones. This methodology offers a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and diastereoselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Herein, a photocatalytic system for defluorinative [4+2] annulation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes with unactivated alkenes is realized. This protocol was compatible with a broad scope of unactivated alkenes, affording the diverse monofluorocyclohexene products in 30&#8211;95% yields. Furthermore, the value of this method was demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis, late&#8208;stage functionalization and synthesis of various valuable and complex monofluorocyclohexene derivatives.

Abstract
An asymmetric three&#8208;component reaction of &#945;&#8208;H diazoacetate with sulfonamide and imine has been developed under the co&#8208;catalyzation of Rh2(OAc)4 and a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA), which proceed through Mannich&#8208;type interception of transient ammonium ylide. The reaction offers a convenient access to &#945;, &#946;&#8208;diamine acid derivatives with two adjacent chiral centers in 59%&#8208;74% yields with 91%&#8208;99% ee and 92:8 to&gt;95:5 dr. Moreover, the generated products could be easily converted to free chiral diamines and other useful chiral motifs.

Abstract
The one&#8208;pot construction of diversified sulfonyl flavones was developed by K2CO3&#8208;mediated formal (5+1) stepwise annulation of &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl o&#8208;hydroxyacetophenones with substituted nitriles under the open&#8208;flask atmosphere conditions. A plausible mechanism is proposed and discussed. This method provides intermolecular and intramolecular ring&#8208;closure via the formations of one carbon&#8208;oxygen single (C&#8722;O) bond, one carbon&#8208;carbon (C=C) double bond, and the cleavage of one carbon&#8208;nitrile triple (C&#8801;N) bond.

Abstract
A divergent synthesis of ortho&#8208;anisidines was achieved by controlling Cu&#8208;catalyzed [1,3]&#8208;methoxy rearrangement. The reactions of N&#8208;alkoxyanilines having an electron&#8208;donating group (EDG), such as an alkyl or anisyl group, at the ortho position and a pivaloyl group on the nitrogen atom in the presence of catalytic amounts of IPrMeCuCl and AgNTf2 afforded the corresponding 6&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;anisidines with good product selectivity through a [1,3]&#8208;rearrangement of the methoxy group to the unsubstituted ortho position. In contrast, the reactions of N&#8208; methoxyanilines having a benzyloxycarbonyl group on the nitrogen atom using IPrCuBr and AgBF4 as catalysts afforded 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;anisidines via a domino process involving a [1,3]&#8208;rearrangement of the methoxy group to the EDG&#8208;substituted ortho position followed by a [1,2]&#8208;rearrangement of the EDG of the resulting ortho&#8208;quinol imine intermediate.

         <title>General Synthesis of Alkyl Amines via Borrowing Hydrogen and Reductive Amination</title>

Abstract
Amines are a very important class of compounds and the selective synthesis of differently substituted primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl amines is challenging. Here we present the synthesis of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl amines from ammonia and alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and hydrogen by combining borrowing hydrogen or hydrogen autotransfer and reductive amination with hydrogen. The key is a nanostructured, bimetallic Co/Sc catalyst able to mediate both reactions or concepts efficiently. We observe a broad product scope, a very good functional group tolerance, upscaling is easily accomplished and our catalyst is reusable.

         <title>Cover Picture: Quaternary Ammonium Salts: Catalysts for Hydrosilylation of Alkynes with Hydrosilanes (Adv. Synth. Catal. 24/2023)</title>

The inside cover picture, designed by Tsuchimoto, illustrates the world of the title reaction. The hydrosilylation of alkynes (HA) has been traditionally catalyzed by rare and costly metals like Pt, Rh, and Pd. In contrast, we developed for the first time the HA catalyzed by quaternary ammonium salts, which can be readily prepared in&#8197;situ of the reaction from i&#8208;PrI and DABCO. The catalysts can be recycled. Details can be found in the Research Article presented by Tsuchimoto and co&#8208;workers (H. Andoh, K. Nakamura, Y. Nakazawa, T. Ikeda&#8208;Fukazawa, S. Okabayashi, T. Tsuchimoto, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2023, 365, 4583&#8211;4594; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202300423)

Abstract
Alkenyl iodide, as an essential precursor and structural unit in organic synthesis, has been widely used in the synthesis of natural products, pharmaceutical pesticides and functional materials. The high reactivity of the Csp2&#8722;I bond enables the formation of a C&#8722;M bond through oxidative addition, followed by subsequent transformations of the C&#8722;M bond to create new chemical bonds. A variety of valuable scaffolds, in particular the cyclic motifs, could be achieved via designing and synthesis the corresponding alkenyl iodide, which makes this strategy to be a hot topic in synthetic chemistry. In this paper, the recent progresses of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclizationof alkenyl iodides are summarized, and the possible mechanisms for most transformations are described in detail.

Abstract
Spirooxindoles are privileged scaffolds in diverse bioactive natural products and pharmaceuticals, significant achievements for the construction of these molecules have thus been made in the past years. Among them, organocatalysis, in particular, nucleophilic Lewis base catalysis, has recently emerged as an efficient and reliable method for the preparation of diverse and valuable functionalized spirooxindoles. According to different kinds of nucleophilic catalysts, we summarize and classify three catalytic strategies; these are tertiary amine&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions, NHC&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions, and tertiary phosphine&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions, respectively. Through these methods, potential bioactive spirooxindole skeletons owning various functional groups can be produced to enrich the small organic molecule library. In this review, we describe a comprehensive and updated advances of nucleophilic Lewis base catalytic cycloaddition reactions for the construction of spirooxindoles. Meanwhile, the related mechanism and the application of these annulation strategies in natural product total synthesis will be highlighted in detail.

Abstract
Oxa(aza)benzonorbornadienes are utilized as important synthetic intermediates and useful building blocks in organic synthesis due to their structural features and reactivity. In addition to ring&#8208;opening reactions, the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;retentive addition reactions of oxa(aza)bicyclic alkenes have increasingly drawn the attention of various researchers. Numerous efficient protocols in this field have been investigated that enable facile and efficient transformations of oxa(aza)benzonorbornadienes to related valuable adducts, which are summarized and discussed in detail in this review.

Abstract
Benzofuran&#8208; and benzopyran&#8208;fused polycyclic acetals are found in a variety of biologically active natural products. The synthetic methods toward this class of polycyclic heterocycles have fascinated one of the most intensive pursuits in total synthesis. Nevertheless, stereoselective methods towards the rapid construction of such skeletons still remain challenging for organic chemists. Significant progress has been made in this research area in recent years, however, literature on enantioselective approaches to construct these molecules has not fully reviewed. Driven by their intriguing and complex scaffolds with potential usefulness, we compose the recent advances in this review covering all the important works in this field. We hope this review will promote future research in this area.

Abstract
Amide bond construction has garnered significant interest in recent decades due to amides being one of the most prevalent functional groups among bioactive molecules. Out of the thirty&#8208;seven new drugs approved by the FDA in 2022, eleven are small molecules containing at least one amide bond. Additionally, there are nineteen large molecules approved as new drugs, some of which have peptide structures, and therefore, also bear amide bonds. In recent years, multiple teams have embraced the challenge of developing more efficient methods for amide bond formation. This dedication has led to numerous publications appearing monthly in prestigious journals, showcasing significant advancements in this field. The primary goal of this review is to present the most viable strategies for constructing the amide bond. It is crucial to differentiate between amide bond formation and amide synthesis; hence, the focus is on describing specific methods for forming new C(O)&#8722;N bonds. In particular, this review concentrates on the methods developed within the last six years. There is a particular emphasis on new approaches that consider the thought process when selecting the starting materials and functional groups. This approach ensures coverage of all the most common chemical transformations that yield new amide bonds.

Abstract
Alkenes are a fascinating functional class that can be converted into various structures. A desirable and durable synthetic method for forming two C&#8722;C bonds across an olefin is the dicarbofunctionalization of olefins, catalyzed by transition metals. This method enables a rapid expansion of molecular complexity in a single step. Among the myriad of efficient strategies for alkene difunctionalization, the 1,2&#8208;diarylation mode stands out primarily due to its remarkable ability to incorporate two hindered aryl groups across the C=C bond in a versatile and straightforward manner. This review covers the recent advances in the 1,2&#8208;diarylation of alkenes from 2018 to 2023, focusing on different transition metals employed as catalysts.

Abstract
The preservation of scarce rare earth metals, such as palladium, rhodium, iridium, and others, poses a significant challenge for humanity due to their limited availability. These rare earth metals might be replaced by earth&#8208;abundant 3d&#8208;transition metals such as cobalt, manganese, iron, nickel, copper, etc. Isoquinolines have acquired an important position in synthetic organic chemistry as well as medicinal chemistry. They manifest in a diverse range of natural and synthetic molecules, serving as pivotal synthons for the synthesis of numerous bioactive compounds with notable medicinal significance. Numerous reports on the synthesis of isoquinoline derivatives via transition metal catalysis have been published worldwide. In this review, we summarize recent approaches for synthesizing various isoquinoline derivatives using 3d&#8208;transition&#8208;metal catalysts since 2020. The review has been divided into different 3d&#8208;transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysis. We expect that this review will bring a better overview of the present status of the significant progress made in the 3d&#8208;transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based synthesis of isoquinolines and persuade more advancements and research in this area in the near future.

Abstract
Dioxazolones and phosphines have been used to access N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes in copper(I) catalysis under simple thermal conditions. The synthetic utility of this protocol is demonstrated by a broad range of substrates with an excellent atom&#8208;economy. The optimization process showed that copper demonstrated as catalytic amount toward the targeted transformation. Functionalization studies of N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes were also conducted. Our reaction protocol is compatible with an example of a bioactive motif&#8208;containing N&#8208;acyl iminophosphorane analogue.

Abstract
An efficient and highly selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of terminal alkynes to alkenes using neutral dimeric rhodium(I) complexes of the type [Rh(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(PP)]2 is presented. Dehydroisophytol (DIP) was chosen as the alkyne for this study because of its high importance in the industrial production of synthetic vitamin E. Excellent selectivity of over 91% towards the alkene was achieved with known and new rhodium catalysts. No deactivation was observed for the [Rh(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(PP)]2 complexes and the molar Rh:DIP ratio could be increased to 1:20 000, and importantly, no reduction in selectivity was observed. The results presented open the door to the industrial application of homogeneous rhodium complexes in the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of terminal alkynes.

         <title>1,6&#8208;Addition Reactions of Difluoroenol Silyl Ethers with Benzoquinones and Quinonediimines To Access Difluorooxymethyl and Difluoroaminomethyl Compounds</title>

Abstract
The etherification and amination of difluoroenol silyl ethers with benzoquinones and quinonediimines were achieved by using hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as the solvent. This 1,6&#8208;addition reaction could construct difluorooxymethyl and difluoroaminomethyl compounds under metal&#8208;free conditions. It is preliminarily speculated that the reaction took place through a single electron transfer (SET) process.

Abstract
Treatment of 1&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;(2,2&#8208;dihalovinyl)arenes with a catalytic amount of Rh2(esp)2 afforded various 2,3&#8208;dihaloindoles in 51&#8211;74% yields. This reaction progressed via the intramolecular cyclization of rhodium nitrene generated in&#8197;situ and the rearrangement of one halogen group. For the 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;iodovinyl group, the iodo group selectively rearranged to yield 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;iodoindoles as single isomers. Moreover, 1&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;[(2,2&#8208;dihalomovinyl)(Boc)amino]arenes were reacted with a catalytic amount of Rh2(oct)4, which produced 2&#8208;haloquinoxaline in 55&#8211;92% yields.

Abstract
Herein, we have developed an organophotocatalyzed, visible&#8208;light mediated tandem decarboxylation&#8208;cyclization method. The Eosin&#8208;Y as organophotocatalyst drives photoredox tandem protocol to construct C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, and C&#8722;C bonds in a single operation. The reaction mechanism proceeds through decarboxylation followed by amino alcohol intermediate formation from N&#8208;arylglycine and formaldehyde followed by cyclization with another formaldehyde delivers N&#8208;arylloxazolidine derivatives.

Abstract
An oxidant&#8208;free photocatalytic [2+2+m] cyclization of 2&#8208;cyanoaryl acrylamides with 2&#8208;bromocarbonyls is reported, enabling the assembly of biologically important N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;fused quinolinones including benzo[1,6]naphthyridinones and pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;c]&#8208;quinolines. This photocatalytic protocol proceeds through a radical relay pathway including alkene difunctionalization along with an intramolecular cyano insertion and subsequent site&#8208;specific functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bond enabled by cyano&#8208;derived iminyl radical&#8208;mediated 1,n&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer. Notably, this transformation selectively formed two distinct C&#8722;C bonds, one C&#8722;N bond, and one quaternary carbon center in a one&#8208;pot procedure.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light induced approach has enabled the synthesis of 3&#8208;alkyl indole from ynones via Csp3&#8722;H bond functionalization. This protocol proceeded under base&#8208;free conditions andat room temperature, providing a series of 3&#8208;alkyl indole motifs in 39% to 90% yields (44 examples). Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that a radical process should be involved in this transformation.

Abstract
This manuscript presents a regioselective chlorination of arenes, yielding almost exclusively the monochlorinated product. It tolerates free hydroxy groups, 1&#176;, 2&#176; and 3&#176; amines, and carboxylic acids, among other polar and nonpolar functional groups, as well as mono&#8208; and polysubstituted aromatic rings. Additionally, the utilization of chlorosulfonium salts as the chlorinating agent is demonstrated. The method emerges as an alternative to other processes where organic byproducts must be separated from the reaction mixture. In addition, the main byproducts are gaseous materials such as CO and CO2. This publication introduces the application of sulfoxides, oxalyl chloride, and aqueous hydrogen peroxide as the chlorination mixture.

Abstract
The hapalindole&#8208;type metabolites have garnered significant interest due to their diverse biological activities and unique chemical structures. Recently, the biosynthesis of this family of indole alkaloids has been uncovered and shown to involve a rare biocatalytic Cope rearrangement. Previously, we demonstrated cis&#8208;indole isonitrile C&#8208;3 normal geranylation using FamD2. Thus, we sought to explore further the reaction potential with this substrate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) using prenyltransferases and cyclases from the hapalindole biosynthetic pathways. Here, we report a new compound derived from an unexpected biosynthetic Cope rearrangement, which expands further the scope of metabolites generated from cyanobacterial Stig cyclases.

Abstract
A three&#8208;step synthesis of anti&#8208;amoebic, ring&#8208;fused mackinazolinones has been developed. A Mannich&#8208;type reaction between quinazolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones and N&#8208;Cbz propanal in the presence of AgOTf afforded quinazolinones (19&#8211;94% isolated yield) bearing a newly formed heterocycle with an alkylamine appendage that, upon N&#8208;Cbz deprotection and basification, triggered a domino rearrangement to afford 45 separable, ring&#8208;fused products. Several compounds inhibited growth of Naegleria fowleri parasites that can cause a lethal human brain infection. Thus, the methodology provides immediate access to a promising anti&#8208;amoebic scaffold.

         <title>Blue Light&#8208;Promoted Synthesis of Thiochromenopyrroledione Derivatives via Titanium Dioxide&#8208;Catalyzed Dual Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bond Formation with Thioanisole and Maleimide Derivatives</title>

Abstract
Under anaerobic conditions, thioanisole derivatives bearing a thiomethyl group participated in dual carbon&#8208;carbon bond&#8208;forming reactions with maleimide derivatives in the presence of titanium dioxide. Blue light irradiation facilitated these reactions, producing thiochromenopyrroledione derivatives and nearly equimolar quantities of succinimide derivatives. Specifically, a thiochromenopyrroledione derivative formed from thioanisole and N&#8208;benzylmaleimide was achieved with a 43% yield after 12&#8197;hours of blue light exposure (&gt;420&#8197;nm), approaching its theoretical maximum yield of 50%. Without titanium dioxide, the reaction remained dormant. Our investigations with five varieties of 4&#8208;substituted thioanisoles and four N&#8208;substituted maleimides as precursors resulted in the synthesis of 20 distinct thiochromenopyrroledione derivatives with moderate to high yields. From observed substituent effects, we postulate that this reaction proceeds through a charge transfer from thioanisole to the conduction band of titanium dioxide during blue light irradiation, initiating the one&#8208;electron oxidation of thioanisole and subsequent generation of &#945;&#8208;thioalkyl radicals via deprotonation.

Abstract
An electrochemical Reformatsky&#8208;type reaction of bromodifluoroamides with aldehydes/ketones via electron reductive umpolung is reported, leading to the generation of a series of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro amides in moderate to good yields. This protocol tolerated a variety of commercially available alkyl ketone, alkyl and aromatic aldehydes, featuring broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance under transition metal&#8208;free conditions without metal reduction reagents. Control experiment indicated that the reaction proceeded via an electron reductive umpolung pathway.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free, Air&#8208;Mediated C(sp2)&#8722;H Alkylation of Cyclic Aldimines with Alkylboronic Acids</title>

Abstract
The air mediated radical alkylation of cyclic aldimines via autoxidation of alkylboronic acids has been realized under mild reaction conditions. By simply heating cyclic aldimines with alkylboronic acid using air as sole oxidant, this protocol provides a catalyst&#8208;free access to a variety of alkylated cyclic aldimines with 21&#8211;91% yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that a radical pathway might be involved in the reaction.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The air mediated radical alkylation of cyclic aldimines via autoxidation of alkylboronic acids has been realized under mild reaction conditions. By simply heating cyclic aldimines with alkylboronic acid using air as sole oxidant, this protocol provides a catalyst-free access to a variety of alkylated cyclic aldimines with 21&#8211;91% yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that a radical pathway might be involved in the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A photocatalytic reaction of N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;methacryloylbenzamides with monoalkyl oxalates is described. Monoalkyl oxalates undergo single&#8208;electron oxidation/CO2 extrusion to generate alkoxycarbonyl radicals, followed by the addition and subsequent cyclization to give alkoxycarbonyl substituted isoquinolinediones. A wide variety of monoalkyl oxalates were amenable in this protocol, affording various alkoxycarbonyl substituted isoquinolinediones.

         <title>Recent Advances in Ni&#8208;Catalyzed 1,1&#8208;Difunctionalization of Unactivated Olefins</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Unactivated olefins rank amongst the most important feedstocks in organic synthesis. Their availability makes them particularly useful synthons for subsequent functionalization, particularly in a catalytic manner. Driven by the popularity ascribed by nickel catalysis as a new tool to rapidly forge molecular architectures via one&#8208;or two&#8208;electron manifolds, the recent years have witnessed significant advances in Ni&#8208;catalyzed olefin difunctionalization. While 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization or remote functionalization via &#8220;chain&#8208;walk&#8221; have become mature disciplines for repurposing the potential of olefins as building blocks, it was only recently that extensions of this chemistry to 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization have been possible. This review summarizes the recent advances in Ni&#8208;catalyzed olefin 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization, holding considerable promise as a new powerful strategy for our ever&#8208;growing synthetic repertoire.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;Allenynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
We report the Ni&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;allenynes. Substrates containing terminal alkynes afford cyclopentene derivatives, whereas internal alkynes lead to the formation of two consecutive C&#8722;C bonds to give fused 5&#8211;5 bicyclic compounds. The reaction shows a wide scope. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies suggest a Ni(0)&#8722;Ni(II) catalytic cycle. The reaction starts with an oxidative cyclometallation followed by a &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination. The trans arrangement of alkenyl and hydride ligands is key to allow formation of the second carbocycle.

         <title>An Organocatalytic Route to endo&#8208;Vinylene Carbonates from Carbon Dioxide&#8208;Based exo&#8208;Vinylene Carbonates</title>

Abstract
An organocatalytic route has been developed for the isomerization of exo&#8208;vinylene carbonates (exo&#8208;VCs) to endo&#8208;vinylene carbonates (endo&#8208;VCs). The exo&#8208;VC starting material can easily be obtained from propargylic alcohols via cyclization with carbon dioxide. In this study, these exo&#8208;VCs are shown to isomerize to the thermodynamically more stable endo&#8208;VCs in the presence of an N&#8208;heterocyclic base and phenol. Density functional theory (DFT) studies were conducted to elucidate the mechanism, tackling difficulties of the description of charge separation steps. This isomerization process delivers an ample diversity of endo&#8208;VCs in good to excellent yields and chemoselectivities under mild reaction conditions.

Abstract
Herein, we present a method for electrochemical&#8208;induced 1,3&#8208;oxohydroxylation of arylcyclopropanes with H2O as the green oxygen source. This transformation offers a regioselective route to highly functionalized &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketones under oxidant&#8208; and metal&#8208;free conditions. Notably, this electrochemical approach features simple operation, good regioselectivity, high functional group tolerance, and easy derivatization of the products. Mechanistic studies have provided solid evidences that 1,3&#8208;diol acts as the crucial intermediate in this reaction, leading to the observed regioselectivity.

The front cover picture illustrates the reaction between 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl and double bonds to afford 1,5&#8208;diketones, known as the De Mayo reaction. This reaction discovered in the mid&#8208;20th century represents a powerful tool for synthesis, since it allows the preparation of complex structures in one simple step using the energy of light. This review article presents a detailed overview on the evolution and impact of this reaction from its use in natural&#8208;product preparation to more recent photocatalytic approaches. Details can be found in the Review by Salaverri, Alem&#225;n and Marzo (N. Salaverri, J. Alem&#225;n, L. Marzo, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2024, 366, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202300647)

Abstract
An assorted set of sulfonyl arenes such as &#946;&#8208;naphthylamines, &#946;&#8208;naphthols, phenols and naphthalenes could be accessed in a divergent manner by base&#8208;mediated annulation of sulfonyl enynals. The strategy is extended to the synthesis of heterocycles such as carbazole, quinoline and benzothiophene. Benzannulation is demonstrated on derivatives of natural steroids like estrone and cholesterol.

         <title>Anhydrous Carbene Insertion Reactions: A Synthetic Platform for DNA&#8208;Encoded Library</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An operationally simple anhydrous carbene insertion reaction to construct DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DEL) is reported. The developed reaction employs visible light photolysis of diazo compounds and Reversible Adsorption to Solid Support (RASS) strategy. From readily available amines, alcohols, phenols, and carboxylic acids, a variety of high&#8208;value molecules, including useful unnatural amino acids, ethers, and esters, promising clinical drug derivatives, and bioactive molecules have been constructed.

         <title>Electrochemical Selenylation&#8208;Induced Annulation of Alkenyl Ureas to Access Cyclic Isoureas</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A direct electrosynthesis of cyclic isoureas from N&#8208;allyl ureas and diselenides has been described. This protocol proceeds without any additional catalyst and oxidant, at room temperature under air, providing the desired products in 71&#8211;91% yield. In addition, the synthesis of cyclic isoureas containing five to seven&#8208;membered rings has also been achieved by the employment of this strategy. On the basis of the mechanism experiments and previous research works, a probable mechanism is proposed.

         <title>Integrating Chemocatalysis and Enzyme Engineering for Coproduction of Bioplastic Precursors Butanediol and Succinic Acid from Xylose</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Polybutylene succinate (PBS) is one of the most important biobased plastics, based on the amount produced. Owing to its high melting point and resemblance to petroleum&#8208;based plastics (i.&#8201;e. PP), PBS becomes one of the emerging bioplastics with an array of applications. PBS is manufactured by polymerization of 1,4&#8208;butanediol and succinic acid. Thus, it is of great importance to ensure the use of renewable resources to produce the PBS precursors. As the second most abundant carbohydrate monomer on Earth, D&#8208;xylose will be a suitable candidate for this purpose. In this work, we combined protein engineering with chemical oxidation by gold catalyst to enable transformation of D&#8208;xylose to 1,4&#8208;butanediol and succinic acid simultaneously. In silico docking studies and semi rational design were employed to create variants of the key enzyme, branched chain &#945;&#8208;keto acid decarboxylase (KdcA) with higher affinity for the intermediates in the production of 1,4&#8208;butanediol and succinic acid. Direct enzymatic biotransformation would result in a production of both monomers with 3:1 ratio, thus not readily suitable for a direct polymerization to PBS. By developing a one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;step chemo&#8208;enzymatic approach with a gold catalyst to perform the first oxidation step, we could achieve a final product ratio of 1:1. Application of an engineered KdcA variant allowed us to achieve &gt;98% yield after four hours transformation. In contrast, after 24&#8197;h transformation, &gt;10% intermediate was still observed when the original variant was used. We anticipate this new approach could serve as an alternative route for biotechnological productions of PBS and its precursors.

Abstract
Here we present a [3+2] cycloaddition of rationally designed trisubstituted cyclic &#945;&#8208;chloroamides, primarily those incorporating pharmacological pyrazolone cores, as potent synthons for synthesizing valuable spirocyclic &#947;&#8208;lactam architectures. This protocol exhibits 52&#8211;96% yields, impressive substrate compatibility, and scale&#8208;up capacity. Importantly, this study also represents one of the rare examples that harness enaminone C&#8722;N bond cleavage to engineer relevant spirocyclic &#947;&#8208;lactam skeletons of biological interest. Moreover, we propose a plausible mechanistic explanation to elucidate the outstanding chemical outcomes observed, thereby enriching the synthetic toolbox for pyrazolone chemistry and &#945;&#8208;haloamide&#8208;mediated reactions.

Herein a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H silylation of o&#8208;alkynylanilines with hexamethyldisilane for the synthesis of disilylated 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles is reported. In this reaction, o&#8208;alkynylanilines undergo an aminopalladation, C&#8722;H activation, and dealkylation sequence to form five&#8208;membered C,C&#8208;palladacycles, which then couple with hexamethyldisilane to construct one C&#8722;N bond and two C&#8722;Si bonds. This method provides an alternative strategy for C&#8722;H silylation.

Abstract
An asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of 2&#8208;oxazolones in the presence of a chiral diamine ruthenium catalyst with potassium formate as a hydrogen source and potassium carbonate as an additive in 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol is described. A series of chiral 2&#8208;oxazolidinones were obtained with 29%&#8211;95% yields and 86%&#8211;&gt;99% ee's. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale synthesis of chiral 2&#8208;oxazolidinone and its downstream derivatizations demonstrate the practicality of this method.

Abstract
We studied a reaction of chromone&#8208;containing acrylonitriles and cyanoacrylates with acid hydrazides. This reaction turned out to be a method for the synthesis of salicyloyl&#8208;substituted 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines. The synthesis developed is a tandem ring&#8208;opening/double ring&#8208;closing process. This synthetic approach is characterized by low toxic solvents (ethanol, butanol) and mediator (Et3N), 37&#8211;84% yields, non&#8208;chromatographic isolation of products, and substrate tolerance (59 examples).

Abstract
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes with anilines/indoles and acetonitrile has been developed. This protocol provides an access to functionalized cyano&#8208;containing molecules. In this transformation, employing di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide as a radical initiator, a variety of commercialized nucleophiles and electronically diverse arenes were well tolerated. In addition, we also studied the kinetic isotope effect.

         <title>TBHP&#8208;Mediated Intermolecular Radical Coupling and Intramolecular Cyclization Cascade: Access to Furo[2,3&#8208;b]quinoxalines and Their Photophysical Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
A cascade one&#8208;pot strategy to construct 31 examples of furo&#8208;fused quinoxalines in up to 88% yields has been devised from readily accessible &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides and quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;ones in open flask at room temperature under TBHP mediated conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed that the overall reactivity relies on the seamless integration of intermolecular radical coupling and intramolecular cyclization via desulfhydration of C=S bond cleavage. Generation of H2S as the only by&#8208;product makes this process highly attractive. Furthermore, the photophysical behavior of the furo&#8208;fused quinoxalines has also been studied.

Abstract
The established strategy unveils a metal and mediator&#8208;free electrochemical [3+2] cycloaddition approach among &#945;&#8208;amino carbonyls and tosylmethyl isocyanide (TosMIC) fabricating substituted imidazole scaffolds. Implementation of electro&#8208;redox conditions on this cycloaddition approach eliminates the essential requirement of transition metal catalysts and chemical oxidants. A wide variety of different functionalities are well tolerated under this reaction condition, contributing to the substrate scope and applicability. Several control experiments and cyclic voltammetry studies suggest an electro&#8208;oxidation triggered successive C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formations followed by rapid aromatization for constructing the five&#8208;membered core structure.

Abstract
A dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation, involving the generation of four stereogenic centers with a well&#8208;defined configuration, occurs in the cyclocondensation of diastereomeric mixtures of 2&#8208;oxocyclohexanepropionic acid racemates 6 with (1S,2R)&#8208;cis&#8208;aminoindanol: two major tetracyclic lactams, 7&#8201;a and 7&#8201;b, that differ in the configuration of the four stereocenters on the decahydroquinoline moiety were obtained. From the above lactams, the removal of the chiral auxiliary, the introduction of a 2&#8208;piperidone ring, and the closure of the diazine ring complete the first enantioselective total synthesis of the Myrioneuron alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;schoberine B and its enantiomer (+)&#8208;schoberine B.

         <title>Construction of Polyheterocyclic Skeletons through C&#8722;H Bond Activation&#8208;Initiated Cascade Reactions by Using Cyclopropanol as Alkylating Agent as well as Masked Nucleophile and Electrophile</title>

         <dc:description>









Abstract
Presented herein is a synthesis of indane fused bicyclic pyrazolidinones based on the reactions of aryl azomethine imines with cyclopropanols. Mechanistically, the formation of product involves Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed direct aryl C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of aryl azomethine imine with cyclopropanol through in&#8197;situ ring&#8208;opening, followed by cascade intramolecular C&#8208; and N&#8208;nucleophilic addition. In this tandem process, cyclopropanol acts as not only an alkylating agent but also masked nucleophile and electrophile to participate in the construction of both the indane and the bicyclic pyrazolidinone scaffolds. To our knowledge, such a cascade reaction pattern has not been disclosed. In general, this synthetic protocol has advantages such as easily obtainable substrates, valuable products, concise synthetic procedure, unique reaction pathway, and good compatibility with diverse functional groups.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Diazabicycloalkanes via Organocatalytic aza&#8208;Michael/Aldol Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We introduce a strategy for the one&#8208;step synthesis of chiral diazabicycloalkanes that delivers the annulated ring system in a single reaction step. The method entails a direct aza&#8208;Michael/aldol reaction of enals in conjunction with modified oxopropanamides and establishes the chiral center via iminium&#8208;enamine tandem catalysis. For this purpose, we developed simple diphenylethylendiamine frameworks as dual activation organocatalyst, effectively engaging both the substrate and reagent, thus leading to yields of 31&#8211;86% and enantioselectivities in the range of 80&#8211;98%. The final product features not only the diazabicycloalkane moiety but includes also additional functionalities, such as aldehyde motives that can be modified in&#8197;situ without loss of enantioselectivity, and an sp2&#8208;bearing methyl group. Our approach accommodates a wide array of enals with high functional group tolerance. Additionally, we demonstrated the adjustability of enantioselectivity and yield by modulating the acid cocatalyst&#8216;s quantity, thus offering multiple optimization possibilities.

         <title>Synthesis of Benzo[a]fluorene, Benzo[c]fluorene, and Benzo[j]fluoranthene via a Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Prins&#8208;Type Cycloaromatization: Application to the Total Synthesis of Viridistratin A.</title>

         <dc:description>
The front cover illustrates the streamlined synthesis of representative non&#8208;alternant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons through Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed Prins&#8208;type cycloaromatization (on the earth). Notable features of the catalytic reaction encompass air tolerance, high productivity, remarkably short reaction times, and scalability. The plausible mechanism suggests that Prins&#8208;type benzannulation competes with oxonium&#8208;ene cyclization. The robustness and high productivity of the key reaction allowed the application towards total synthesis of natural benzo[j]fluoranthene, viridistratin A (on the moon). Details can be found in the Communication by Hwayoung Yun and co&#8208;workers (M. Jeong, M. Yoon, L. H. Nguyen, S. Kim, J. Han, C. S. Tran, J. Kim, J. Jo, Y.&#8208;S. Jung, J.&#8208;W. Yoo, H.

         <title>Recent Advances in Synthetic Methods for 2H&#8208;Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The compound, 2H&#8208;pyrrole, is a key scaffold contained in natural products, bioactive compounds, pharmaceuticals, and organic functional materials. However, the development of efficient synthetic strategies for 2H&#8208;pyrroles is challenging. This is because 2H&#8208;pyrroles, owing to their nonaromatic nature, are easily converted into the thermodynamically more stable 1H&#8208;pyrroles. Recently, efficient and straightforward synthetic strategies for 2H&#8208;pyrroles have been developed, including the dearomatization of 1H&#8208;pyrrole, oxidation of pyrrolines or pyrrolidines, ring construction via catalytic cycloaddition, and rearrangement of 3H&#8208;pyrroles. In this review, we summarize the progress in the research on 2H&#8208;pyrrole synthesis since 2000 and briefly discuss the synthesis reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Accessing Indenoazulenes via a Gold&#8208;Catalysed Cyclisation of Cycloheptatrienyl&#8208;Substituted 1,5&#8208;Diynes</title>

Abstract
Herein we report that cycloheptatrienyl&#8208;substituted 1,5&#8208;diynes with aromatic backbones undergo a gold&#8208;catalysed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclisation to give 11H&#8208;indeno&#8208;[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes at room temperature. This methodology complements the established range of aromatic structures obtained from gold&#8208;catalysed conversions of differently substituted 1,5&#8208;diynes accessed via highly reactive cationic intermediates. We have demonstrated the scope of the reaction and have assessed the possibility of further functionalisation of the indenoazulene scaffold. Additionally, we have studied the optical and electrochemical properties as well as the frontier molecular orbitals of this structural motif by both spectroscopic and theoretical means.

&lt;p&gt;Herein we report that cycloheptatrienyl-substituted 1,5-diynes with aromatic backbones undergo a gold-catalysed 5-&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;dig&lt;/i&gt; cyclisation to give 11&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indeno-[2,1-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]azulenes at room temperature. This methodology complements the established range of aromatic structures obtained from gold-catalysed conversions of differently substituted 1,5-diynes accessed &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; highly reactive cationic intermediates. We have demonstrated the scope of the reaction and have assessed the possibility of further functionalisation of the indenoazulene scaffold. Additionally, we have studied the optical and electrochemical properties as well as the frontier molecular orbitals of this structural motif by both spectroscopic and theoretical means.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights on the Enantioselective (4+3) Cycloaddition Between Oxyallylcations and Furans Catalyzed by BINOL&#8208;Based Phosphoramides</title>

Abstract
The mechanism of the enantioselective (4+3) cycloaddition between furan derivatives and oxyallylcations, which are generated from the corresponding oxiranes through in&#8197;situ oxidation of allenamides, has been studied using DFT methods. The research has revealed that, under acid&#8208;catalysis by a chiral non&#8208;racemic phosphoramide, the epoxide ring&#8208;opening proceeds without any energy barrier, while the rate&#8208;limiting step is the electrophilic attack of the intermediate enaminium ion on the furan ring. The reaction exhibits low energy barriers when dealing with furan derivatives unsubstituted at C2 and C5. Calculations predict the formation of an achiral regioisomer for 2&#8208;substituted furans, a prediction that has been experimentally confirmed. Additionally, the calculations accurately predict the reaction with substituted allenamides.

         <title>Aza&#8208;Prins Cyclization on Ketones to Access Piperidines with Tetrasubstituted Carbon Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The aza&#8208;Prins cyclization in presence of a variety of aliphatic, aromatic, and heterocyclic ketones is disclosed. The developed method allows an access to diverse C&#8208;2 functionalized piperidines, bearing a tetrasubstituted or spiranic carbon stereocenter, in a range of 30 to 87% yields. When diastereomers were formed, the trans isomer was identified as the major product.

         <title>Mechanistic Insight into Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Alkylation of Indoles with Diazoesters Employing Bipyridine&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dioxides as Chiral Controllers</title>

Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkylation of indoles with &#945;&#8208;diazoesters is well&#8208;known, however, the underlying mechanisms of this reaction, particularly the origin of stereoselectivity, remain uncertain. For the Pd catalysis, we address this cutting&#8208;edge challenge from two complementary viewpoints &#8211; i) the molecular level regarding a single catalytically active Pd center; and ii) nano&#8208;level Pd species investigating the factors favoring the appearance of the preferred catalytic centers. The formation of the active catalytic species was monitored by structural methods (NMR and ESI&#8208;MS), and metal particles were characterized with electron microscopy (SEM, EDX). On the molecular level, chiral bipyridine&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dioxides proved to be competent chiral controllers. The kinetic and DFT computational data revealed a crucial role of water in the rate and selectivity determining steps and showed that the enantioselectivity of the process is controlled by the protodepalladation step. On the nano&#8208;scale, the important effect of catalyst precursor on the overall reaction performance was shown.

Abstract
Asymmetric three&#8208;component, 1,2&#8208;aminoxy&#8208;trifluoromethylation of styrenes with N&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;benz/naphthoxazine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones (i.&#8201;e., N&#8208;OH&#8208;(B/Np)OxzOn) catalysed by chiral vanadyl complexes derived from N&#8208;salicylidene&#8208;L&#8208;t&#8208;leucinate were explored. Among 14 different solvents and 13 different catalysts screened, the best reaction scenarios were in 2&#8208;propanol with 3&#8208;(2,5&#8208;dimethyl)phenyl&#8208;5&#8208;bromo (DMP), or 3&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;5&#8208;bromo substituted catalysts that led to the corresponding complementary (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;products with potential biological activities in 45&#8211;91% yields and up to 85 and 75% ee, respectively. Further optimisation with the DMP catalyst led to the best combination of 3&#8208;halo/3,5&#8208;dihalo&#8208;styrenes with 6&#8208;/7&#8208;Br&#8722;N&#8722;OH&#8208;(B/Np)OxzOn as the trapping agents. The corresponding eight different products were isolated in 52&#8211;75% yields with ees in a range of 88&#8211;93% (R). Based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations with conformational searches, the origin of enantiocontrol and the working mechanism were proposed by resorting to a bidentate&#8208;chelation between the amide or carbamate C=O group and N&#8722;OH group in the trapping agent to the vanadyl center followed by asymmetric benzylic radical trapping in an SH2 fashion. Subsequent Fragment Molecular Orbital (FMO)/Pair Interaction Energy Decomposition Analysis (PIEDA) calculations with the DMP catalyst were carried out to rationalize the extent of asymmetric induction. One representative product derived from p&#8208;methyl&#8208;styrene and NpOxzOn was hydrolyzed in basic MeOH with decarboxylation to unmask its carbamate moiety. The resulting chiral (R)&#8208;N&#8208;benzoxy&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;naphthamide was subjected to aerobic, oxidative homo&#8208;coupling catalysed by the DMP catalyst in CCl4. The corresponding 2,2&#8208;binaphthol product was isolated in 90% (brsm) yield with nearly complete diastereo&#8208;control at the created (M)&#8208;axial chirality, allowing for sequential, bi&#8208;functional asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Pyrido&#8208;[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline Derivatives via Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Cascade Reaction of Enamides</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cascade reaction of tertiary enamides has been developed, which provides a method for the preparation of diverse pyrido[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives with good function group tolerance. Preliminary investigation of the reaction mechanism indicate that this process comprises a nucleophilic addition of the enamide to an alkynyl group, followed by the capture of the acyliminium ion by an electron&#8208;rich aromatic component. Additionally, scale&#8208;up experiments and further transformations of pyrido&#8208;[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines underscore the utility of this methodology.

         <title>Substrate&#8208; and Catalyst&#8208;Controlled C&#8722;H Bond Activation/Annulation for Construction of Pyrido[2,3,4&#8208;de]quinazolinones and Indolo[1,2&#8208;c]quinazolinones</title>

Abstract
A substrate and catalyst&#8208;controlled synthetic strategy was employed to construct two distinct types of fused polycyclic heterocycles, namely pyrido[2,3,4&#8208;de]quinazolinones and indolo[1,2&#8208;c]quinazolinones. The most notable advantage of this method is its ability to rapidly generate two different polycyclic scaffolds via a simple C&#8722;H activation and subsequent cyclization cascade pathway. Specifically, sulfoxonium ylides played a crucial role in both transformations, serving as a two&#8208;carbon synthon and a one&#8208;carbon synthon, to independently construct the two fused polycyclic scaffolds through [4+2] and [4+1] annulation pathways, respectively.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Laetevirenol A via Regioselective Gold&#8208;Catalyzed and Acid&#8208;Promoted Cyclizations</title>

Abstract
The total synthesis of Laetevirenol A, a natural product with antioxidant activity, has been achieved. A gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of an o&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;o&#8217;&#8208;alkynylbiphenyl has been used as the key step for the construction of the phenanthrene moiety present in Laetevirenol A. Several studies in model substrates have been carried out to unveil the effect of substituents in different locations in the outcome of this cyclization, which allowed the design of an appropriate precursor for the fundamental gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization. The suitably functionalized phenanthrene intermediate obtained in this key step could be further transformed into Laetevirenol A via a Friedel&#8208;Crafts cyclization, which also turned out to be dependent on the nature of the substituents. Finally, Laetevirenol A was obtained in 10 steps from commercially available substrates, with a 20% global yield.

         <title>Chemical Approach for Investigation of the Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship of Salmycin and Identification of a Glycan&#8208;based Analogue for Drug Resistant Staphylococcus aureus</title>

Abstract
New synthetic routes were devised for total synthesis of Fe3+&#8208;bound (ferri&#8722;) salmycin B (Sal B) (1), glycan&#8208;based Sal analogues 2&#8211;5 and their Fe3+&#8208;unbound (desferri&#8722;) counterparts 1&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; for the structure to activity relationship (SAR) study. The results of SAR study reveal the effective structure of 1 and its desferri&#8208;counterpart 1&#8242; that are responsible for the observed inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Among the analogues 2&#8211;5 and 2&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242;, glucose&#8208;based analogue 2 and its desferri&#8208;counterpart 2&#8242; exhibited inhibitory potency comparable to 1 and 1&#8242;. Chemical modification of 2&#8242; for further antibacterial study enabled us to discover desferri&#8208;Sal analogue 7&#8242; that endowed with a simpler pharmacophore structure but significantly higher antibacterial potency against methicillin&#8208;sensitive and resistant S. aureus than the natural product 1&#8242; and even the clinical vancomycin. Together with a better hydrolytic stability and shorter synthetic route, the analogue 7&#8242; represents an attractive antibiotic lead for further exploration.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Utilization of Non&#8208;Stabilized Diazoalkanes from (3+2) Cycloaddition of Linear N,N&#8208;Disilyl Enamines and Azides</title>

Abstract
A (3+2) cycloaddition reaction of linear N,N&#8208;disilyl enamines and organic azides is investigated. The N,N&#8208;disilyl enamines, derived from the selective double hydrosilylation of conjugated nitriles, are employed in&#8208;situ for this investigation. The resulting triazoline intermediate from the (3+2) cycloaddition reaction promptly undergoes retro&#8208;(3+2) cycloaddition to yield versatile non&#8208;stabilized diazoalkane, along with formamidine. The presence of a transient and unstable alkyl diazomethane is confirmed by utilizing carboxylates as trapping reagents. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of these alkyl diazomethanes by utilizing them in reactions with various reagents, including hydroborane, diboron, silaborane, alkenes, and alkynes.

         <title>Synthesis of Phenethylamine&#8208;Azulene Conjugates Enabled by Regioselective Ring Opening of Aziridines</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The BF3&#8901;OEt2&#8208;catalyzed reaction of azulene with N&#8208;protected aziridines represents a general, efficient (up to 91% yield) and regioselective approach to phenethylamine&#8208;azulene conjugates. Stereochemical studies and DFT calculations lend support to a concerted SN2&#8208;type mechanism governing the ring&#8208;opening of the aziridine.

&lt;p&gt;The BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed reaction of azulene with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-protected aziridines represents a general, efficient (up to 91% yield) and regioselective approach to phenethylamine-azulene conjugates. Stereochemical studies and DFT calculations lend support to a concerted S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2-type mechanism governing the ring-opening of the aziridine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidation of Indoles to Access Tryptanthrins at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An electrooxidative reconstruction of the indole core under ambient conditions is reported, resulting in the construction of tryptanthrins. This electrochemical strategy simplifies molecular skeleton&#8208;hopping by employing commercially available NH&#8208;indole feedstock as the starting materials. Furthermore, the synthetic value of this skeletal reconstruction was demonstrated by divergent further transformations. A preliminary mechanistic investigation involving control experiments and cyclovoltammetric studies showed the indispensability of electricity, as well as the importance of oxygen and TEMPO, thereby revealing a possible reaction pathway.

         <title>Pd(0)&#8208;Catalyzed&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Vitamin D Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
1&#945;,25&#8208;Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3), the hormonally active form of vitamin D3, regulates mineral homeostasis, cell growth, cell differentiation&#8208;proliferation, apoptosis, and immune responses. 1,25D3 activates more than 229 genes associated with several diseases, including arthritis, diabetes and cancer, suggesting its implications in a broader range of biological functions than originally thought. Despite the wide range of biological activities, the clinical applications of 1,25D3 have been limited due to its collateral hypercalcemic effects. This problem has boosted intense synthetic activity in the vitamin D area in the last decades aimed at the development of highly active and non&#8208;calcemic analogs for treatment of hyperproliferative diseases. This review covers the most useful synthetic approaches to 1,25D3 analogs containing the natural vitamin D triene system with emphasis on the Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed transformations involved in the formation of the vitamin D triene system and A&#8208;ring synthons.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Coupling Reaction of Cyclopropanols with Electrophilic Alkenes Enabled by Decatungstate as Photoredox Catalyst</title>

Abstract
We introduce a methodology for the photocatalytic generation of &#946;&#8208;ketoalkyl radicals from tertiary cyclopropanols, utilizing tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as a photoredox catalyst. The application is demonstrated by the synthesis of distantly functionalized ketones via the redox&#8208;neutral addition of the cyclopropanol&#8208;derived &#946;&#8208;ketoalkyl radicals to the double bond of electrophilic olefins. The transformation occurs under ambient temperature conditions and is suitable for coupling a wide range of cyclopropanol and alkene substrates. This was demonstrated by the preparation of 33 ketone products with 35&#8211;92% yield. The method's preparative robustness has been validated through upscaled preparations conducted under continuous flow conditions. Mechanistic investigations support the role of TBADT as a photoredox catalyst, which facilitates the single electron oxidation of cyclopropanols, followed by the electron transfer from the reduced form of decatungstate to the electrophilic double bond of alkene. Moreover, we found that electron&#8208;rich aromatic cyclopropanols and electron&#8208;deficient olefins form photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes. This property allows the reaction to proceed under UV light irradiation via the photoinduced charge transfer in the absence of the photocatalyst.

         <title>Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloaddition of C60 with Enynes. Unveiling the Mechanistic Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study we present a method for functionalizing C60 through a Rh&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction with 1,6&#8208;enynes, resulting in the formation of a fused bicyclic structure. Additionally, fullerene derivatives are further functionalized through regioselective photooxygenation reactions. Our DFT calculations reveal two distinct reaction pathways: one involving rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of the enyne followed by Diels&#8208;Alder with C60, and the other featuring a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of enyne and C60 followed by isomerization. Surprisingly, both pathways exhibit nearly identical energy barriers. However, experimental tests indicate that the predominant pathway varies depending on the substitution motifs of the substrates.</dc:description>
