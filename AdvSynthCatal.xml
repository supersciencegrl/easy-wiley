         <dc:description>A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes with anilines/indoles and acetonitrile has been developed allowing the rapid building of valuable complex highly functionalized cyano&#8208;containing molecules. In this transformation, employing di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide as a radical initiator, a variety of commercialized nucleophiles and electronically diverse arenes were well tolerated. In addition, we also studied the kinetic isotope effect.</dc:description>

         <title>[3 + 2] Cycloaddition of Rationally Designed Trisubstituted Cyclic &#945;&#8208;Chloroamide: an Alternative Strategy for Accessing Spirocyclic &#947;&#8208;Lactam Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we present a [3 + 2] cycloaddition of rationally designed trisubstituted cyclic &#945;&#8208;chloroamides, primarily those incorporating pharmacological pyrazolone cores, as potent synthons for synthesizing valuable spirocyclic &#947;&#8208;lactam architectures. This protocol exhibits 52 &#8211; 96% yields, impressive substrate compatibility, and scale&#8208;up capacity. Importantly, this study also represents one of the rare examples that harness enaminone C&#8211;N bond cleavage to engineer relevant spirocyclic &#947;&#8208;lactam skeletons of biological interest. Moreover, we propose a plausible mechanistic explanation to elucidate the outstanding chemical outcomes observed, thereby enriching the synthetic toolbox for pyrazolone chemistry and &#945;&#8208;haloamide&#8208;mediated reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Silylation of o&#8208;Alkynylanilines Initiated by an Aminopalladation to Access Disilylated 2&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles</title>

         <dc:description>Herein a new Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H silylation of o&#8208;alkynylanilines with hexamethyldisilane for the synthesis of disilylated 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles has been reported. In this reaction, o&#8208;alkynylanilines undergo an aminopalladation, C&#8722;H activation and dealkylation sequence to form five&#8208;membered C,C&#8208;palladacycles, which then couple with hexamethyldisilane to construct one C&#8722;N bond and two C&#8722;Si bonds. The method provides an alternative strategy for C&#8722;H silylation.</dc:description>

         <title>TBHP&#8208;Mediated Intermolecular Radical Coupling and Intramolecular Cyclization Cascade: Access to Furo[2,3&#8208;b]quinoxalines and their Photophysical Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cascade one&#8208;pot strategy to construct furo&#8208;fused quinoxalines up to 88% yields has been devised from readily accessible &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides and quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;ones in open flask at room temperature under TBHP mediated conditions. The method is metal&#8208;/catalyst&#8208;free, and devoid of toxic reagents with 31 examples. Mechanistic studies revealed that the overall reactivity relies on the seamless integration of intermolecular radical coupling and intramolecular cyclization via desulfhydration of C=S bond cleavage. Generation of H2S as the only by&#8208;product makes this process highly attractive. Furthermore, the photophysical behaviour of the furo&#8208;fused quinoxalines has also been studied.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Coupling Reaction of Cyclopropanols with Electrophilic Alkenes Enabled by Decatungstate as Photoredox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
We introduce a methodology for the photocatalytic generation of &#946;&#8208;ketoalkyl radicals from tertiary cyclopropanols, utilizing tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as a photoredox catalyst. The application is demonstrated by the synthesis of distantly functionalized ketones via the redox&#8208;neutral addition of the cyclopropanol&#8208;derived &#946;&#8208;ketoalkyl radicals to the double bond of electrophilic olefins. The transformation occurs under ambient temperature conditions and is suitable for coupling a wide range of cyclopropanol and alkene substrates. This was demonstrated by the preparation of 33 ketone products with 35&#8211;92% yield. The method's preparative robustness has been validated through upscaled preparations conducted under continuous flow conditions. Mechanistic investigations support the role of TBADT as a photoredox catalyst, which facilitates the single electron oxidation of cyclopropanols, followed by the electron transfer from the reduced form of decatungstate to the electrophilic double bond of alkene. Moreover, we found that electron&#8208;rich aromatic cyclopropanols and electron&#8208;deficient olefins form photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes. This property allows the reaction to proceed under UV light irradiation via the photoinduced charge transfer in the absence of the photocatalyst.

         <title>Electrochemical Annulation of ortho&#8208;Alkynylbiphenyls to Fused Sulfenyl Phenanthrenes and Spiro Cyclohexenone Indenes</title>

Abstract
Here, we present an electrochemically induced synthesis of 9&#8208;sulfenylarylphenanthrenes and 3&#8217;&#8208;sulfenylarylspiro&#8208;cyclohexa[4.5]trienones starting from o&#8208;alkynylbiphenyls and diaryl disulfides. This method was accomplished through constant current electrolysis of 10&#8197;mA in an undivided cell setup by utilizing CH3CN as a solvent and LiClO4 as an electrolyte at room temperature. Notably, the present strategy enabled the formation of sulfenylphenanthrenes and sulfenyl spiro cyclohexa[4.5]trienones in 70%&#8211;95% yield. Scale&#8208;up synthesis, mechanistic studies, and cyclic voltammetry have also been carried out.

Abstract
Spirooxindoles are privileged scaffolds in diverse bioactive natural products and pharmaceuticals, significant achievements for the construction of these molecules have thus been made in the past years. Among them, organocatalysis, in particular, nucleophilic Lewis base catalysis, has recently emerged as an efficient and reliable method for the preparation of diverse and valuable functionalized spirooxindoles. According to different kinds of nucleophilic catalysts, we summarize and classify three catalytic strategies; these are tertiary amine&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions, NHC&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions, and tertiary phosphine&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions, respectively. Through these methods, potential bioactive spirooxindole skeletons owning various functional groups can be produced to enrich the small organic molecule library. In this review, we describe a comprehensive and updated advances of nucleophilic Lewis base catalytic cycloaddition reactions for the construction of spirooxindoles. Meanwhile, the related mechanism and the application of these annulation strategies in natural product total synthesis will be highlighted in detail.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed S&#8208;Allylation of Vinyl Carbinols &#8211; Total Syntheses of Carotenoids by Julia&#8208;Kocienski Olefination</title>

Abstract
Palladium catalyzed S&#8208;allylation of vinyl carbinols from ionones (or conjugated carbonyls) with 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzothiazole (BT&#8208;SH) provides versatile C15 dienyl benzothiazolyl (BT) sulfides. This Pd(dppe)Cl2&#8208;catalyzed S&#8208;allylation is highly selective for free allylic alcohols in the presence of allylic acetates, resulting in 3&#8208; or 4&#8208;acetoxy C15 dienyl BT&#8208;sulfides suitable for xanthophyll synthesis. The corresponding C15 dienyl BT&#8208;sulfones undergo Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination reactions with C10 2,7&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;octatrienedial under mild conditions to produce carotenoids natural products. Efficient synthesis is achieved for a range of carotenoids including xanthophylls such as iso&#8208;zeaxanthin, zeaxanthin, and lutein as well as carotenes like &#946;&#8208;carotene, &#1013;&#8208;carotene, and 9&#8242;&#8208;Z&#8208;phenyl&#8208;carotene.

         <title>1,6&#8208;Addition Reactions of Difluoroenol Silyl Ethers with Benzoquinones and Quinonediimines To Access Difluorooxymethyl and Difluoroaminomethyl Compounds</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
The etherification and amination of difluoroenol silyl ethers with benzoquinones and quinonediimines were achieved by using hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as the solvent. This 1,6&#8208;addition reaction could construct difluorooxymethyl and difluoroaminomethyl compounds under metal&#8208;free conditions. It is preliminarily speculated that the reaction took place through a single electron transfer (SET) process.

         <title>Blue Light&#8208;Promoted Synthesis of Thiochromenopyrroledione Derivatives via Titanium Dioxide&#8208;Catalyzed Dual Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bond Formation with Thioanisole and Maleimide Derivatives</title>

Abstract
Under anaerobic conditions, thioanisole derivatives bearing a thiomethyl group participated in dual carbon&#8208;carbon bond&#8208;forming reactions with maleimide derivatives in the presence of titanium dioxide. Blue light irradiation facilitated these reactions, producing thiochromenopyrroledione derivatives and nearly equimolar quantities of succinimide derivatives. Specifically, a thiochromenopyrroledione derivative formed from thioanisole and N&#8208;benzylmaleimide was achieved with a 43% yield after 12&#8197;hours of blue light exposure (&gt;420&#8197;nm), approaching its theoretical maximum yield of 50%. Without titanium dioxide, the reaction remained dormant. Our investigations with five varieties of 4&#8208;substituted thioanisoles and four N&#8208;substituted maleimides as precursors resulted in the synthesis of 20 distinct thiochromenopyrroledione derivatives with moderate to high yields. From observed substituent effects, we postulate that this reaction proceeds through a charge transfer from thioanisole to the conduction band of titanium dioxide during blue light irradiation, initiating the one&#8208;electron oxidation of thioanisole and subsequent generation of &#945;&#8208;thioalkyl radicals via deprotonation.

Abstract
In this study, we developed a process for the [2+1+3] cyclization of 2&#8208;methylbenzothiazole salts, aldehydes and amidine hydrochlorides, which allows rapid synthesis of 1,3&#8208;diazaphenothiazines with moderate to good yields. The use of ethanol as solvent, oxygen as the terminal oxidant, mild reaction conditions, good functionality tolerance show the promising application in organic synthesis.

Abstract
A strategy for sulfonylation of boronic acids with sulfonyl chlorides has been established via Suzuki&#8208;type radical cross&#8208;coupling. This approach allows for the synthesis of more than 50 sulfone examples enabled by photoredox catalysis under visible light radiation. Moreover, the title reaction is applied in late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules, and further transformation of the resulting sulfones into 2&#8208;functionalized sulfones, borates, triphenylphosphine oxide and N&#8208;arylcarbazole can be also achieved.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free, Air&#8208;Mediated C(sp2)&#8722;H Alkylation of Cyclic Aldimines with Alkylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The air mediated radical alkylation of cyclic aldimines via autoxidation of alkylboronic acids has been realized under mild reaction conditions. By simply heating cyclic aldimines with alkylboronic acid using air as sole oxidant, this protocol provides a catalyst&#8208;free access to a variety of alkylated cyclic aldimines with 21&#8211;91% yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that a radical pathway might be involved in the reaction.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Syntheses of Flavonoids and Cannabinoids</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Flavonoids and cannabinoids comprise two large families of natural products that contain a chromane moiety in their structure. Their therapeutic potential has been extensively investigated as potential treatments to several diseases, ranging from cancer to infectious and neurodegenerative diseases. Despite their relative structural simplicity, in recent years creative synthetic methodologies were designed to overcome limitations from the previous synthetic strategies applied to these compounds. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of all the enantioselective organocatalytic strategies that have been applied to the synthesis of flavonoids and cannabinoids to date.

Abstract
C10a&#8208;Acetoxylated perhydroazepino[1,2&#8208;a]&#8208;indoles, accessible via visible light&#8208;mediated sensitized photooxygenation of cyclo&#8208;hepta[b]indoles, are precursors to structurally elaborate carbon&#8208;centered radicals. Their photoredox&#8208;catalyzed SET reduction by phenothiazine or phenoxazine photocatalysts, followed by fragmentation and C&#8722;O bond cleavage, liberates tricyclic &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals that readily engage in radical addition reactions with silyl enol ethers and silyl ketene acetals. The C&#8722;C functionalized azepinoindole[1,2&#8208;a]indoles are useful building blocks for the synthesis of polycyclic indole derivatives as shown by the controlled borohydride reduction of a C10a&#8208;methylenecarboxylate derivative, which leads stereoselectively to tetracyclic azepino[1,2&#8208;a]furo[3,2&#8208;b]indoles. The photocatalytic method developed herein is also suitable for the radical functionalization of simple &#945;&#8208;acetoxy acetophenones.

         <title>Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloaddition of C60 with Enynes. Unveiling the Mechanistic Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study we present a method for functionalizing C60 through a Rh&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction with 1,6&#8208;enynes, resulting in the formation of a fused bicyclic structure. Additionally, fullerene derivatives are further functionalized through regioselective photooxygenation reactions. Our DFT calculations reveal two distinct reaction pathways: one involving rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of the enyne followed by Diels&#8208;Alder with C60, and the other featuring a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of enyne and C60 followed by isomerization. Surprisingly, both pathways exhibit nearly identical energy barriers. However, experimental tests indicate that the predominant pathway varies depending on the substitution motifs of the substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>The Intermolecular Pauson&#8208;Khand Reaction: Applications, Challenges and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid assembly of complex organic molecules from simple and structurally diverse building blocks is a prevalent challenge in organic synthesis. The Pauson&#8208;Khand reaction (PKR) is a method of choice for the construction of five membered rings that has historically been popularized as a late&#8208;stage intramolecular cyclization method. The intermo&#8208;lecular version of the PKR, on the other hand, constitutes a powerful approach for the rapid assembly of densely func&#8208;tionalized cyclopentanic cores at early stages of a synthetic sequence. Despite its potential, the intermolecular PKR is much less prevalent in the organic synthesis literature due to several historical limitations, most importantly a reduced scope with respect to the alkene component of the reaction.
The last decade has witnessed important developments in the area including a) experimental and theoretical studies that provide a good mechanistic understanding of the reac&#8208;tion and its selectivity, b) methodological developments that have broadened the scope of potential alkene part&#8208;ners, and c) the development of catalytic enantioselective versions that provide useful levels of enantioselectivity. In parallel, remarkable synthetic applications of the intermo&#8208;lecular PKR have emerged, including (enantioselective) total syntheses of complex natural products (polycyclic terpenes, alkaloids, prostanes) as well as examples of in&#8208;dustrial relevance.
A fundamental limitation of the PKR that needs to be ad&#8208;dressed in the future is the current lack of a ligand&#8208;accelerated version of the reaction, which would be a promising advance towards developing more efficient and general catalytic (enantioselective) reactions.

         <title>Construction of Polyheterocyclic Skeletons through C&#8722;H Bond Activation&#8208;Initiated Cascade Reactions by Using Cyclopropanol as Alkylating Agent as well as Masked Nucleophile and Electrophile</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Presented herein is a synthesis of indane fused bicyclic pyrazolidinones based on the reactions of aryl azomethine imines with cyclopropanols. Mechanistically, the formation of product involves Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed direct aryl C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of aryl azomethine imine with cyclopropanol through in situ ring&#8208;opening, followed by cascade intramolecular C&#8722; and N&#8722;nucleophilic addition. In this tandem process, cyclopropanol acts as not only an alkylating agent but also masked nucleophile and electrophile to participate in the construction of both the indane and the bicyclic pyrazolidinone scaffolds. To our knowledge, such a cascade reaction pattern has not been disclosed. In general, this synthetic protocol has advantages such as easily obtainable substrates, valuable products, concise synthetic procedure, unique reaction pathway, and good compatibility with diverse functional groups.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation, involving the generation of four stereogenic centers with a well&#8208;defined configuration, occurs in the cyclocondensation of diastereomeric mixtures of 2&#8208;oxocyclohexanepropionic acid racemates 6 with (1S,2R)&#8208;cis&#8208;aminoindanol: two major tetracyclic lactams, 7a and 7b, that differ in the configuration of the four stereocenters on the decahydroquinoline moiety were obtained. From the above lactams, the removal of the chiral auxiliary, the introduction of a 2&#8208;piperidone ring, and the closure of the diazine ring complete the first enantioselective total synthesis of the Myrioneuron alkaloid (&#8211;)&#8208;schoberine B and its enantiomer (+)&#8208;schoberine B.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Catalysts for the Homogeneous Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
An efficient and highly selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of terminal alkynes to alkenes using neutral dimeric rhodium(I) complexes of the type [Rh(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(PP)]2 is presented. Dehydroisophytol (DIP) was chosen as the alkyne for this study because of its high importance in the industrial production of synthetic vitamin E. Excellent selectivity of over 91% towards the alkene was achieved with known and new rhodium catalysts. No deactivation was observed for the [Rh(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(PP)]2 complexes and the molar Rh:DIP ratio could be increased to 1:20 000, and importantly, no reduction in selectivity was observed. The results presented open the door to the industrial application of homogeneous rhodium complexes in the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of terminal alkynes.

Among 14 different solvents and 13 different catalysts screened, the best reaction scenarios were in 2&#8208;propanol with 3&#8208;(2,5&#8208;dimethyl)phenyl&#8208;5&#8208;bromo (DMP), or 3&#8208;&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;butyl&#8208;5&#8208;bromo substituted catalysts that led to the corresponding complementary (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208; and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;products with potential biological activities in 45&#8208;91% yields and up to 85 and 75% ee, respectively. Further optimization with the DMP catalyst led to the best combination of 3&#8208;halo/3,5&#8208;dihalo&#8208;styrenes with 6&#8208;/7&#8208;Br&#8208;N&#8208;OH&#8208;(B/Np)OxzOn as the trapping agents. The corresponding eight different products were isolated in 52&#8208;75% yields with ees in a range of 88&#8208;93% (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;). Based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations with conformational searches, the origin of enantiocontrol and the working mechanism were proposed by resorting to a bidentate&#8208;chelation between the amide or carbamate C=O group and N&#8208;OH group in the trapping agent to the vanadyl center followed by asymmetric benzylic radical trapping in an S&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 fashion.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights on the Enantioselective (4+3) cycloaddition between Oxyallylcations and Furans Catalyzed by BINOL&#8208;based Phosphoramides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism of the enantioselective (4+3) cycloaddition between furan derivatives and oxyallylcations, which are generated from the corresponding oxiranes through in situ oxidation of allenamides, has been studied using DFT methods. The research has revealed that, under acid&#8208;catalysis by a chiral non&#8208;racemic phosphoramide, the epoxide ring&#8208;opening proceeds without any energy barrier, while the rate&#8208;limiting step is the electrophilic attack of the intermediate enaminium ion on the furan ring. The reaction exhibits low energy barriers when dealing with furan derivatives unsubstituted at C2 and C5. Calculations predict the formation of an achiral regioisomer for 2&#8208;substituted furans, a prediction that has been experimentally confirmed. Additionally, the calculations accurately predict the reaction with substituted allenamides</dc:description>

         <title>Domino Reactions with Dicyanoalkenes and Fluorinated Conjugated Sulfinyl Imines. A Convenient Strategy for the Generation of Structural Diversity</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Dicyanoalkenes are versatile reagents in organic synthesis and they have been extensively used in a wide variety of organic transformations. However, their reactivity towards fluorinated imines remained almost unnoticed. The divergent reactivity of fluorinated conjugated sulfinyl imines with dicyanoalkenes is described herein. On the one hand, when tert&#8208;butyl sulfinyl imines were employed, a cycloaromatization cascade process took place preferentially, rendering valuable trifluoromethyl arenes. On the other hand, the reaction with p&#8208;tolyl sulfinyl imines mainly led to a complex tetracyclic skeleton, involving an azetidinimine rearrangement of a reaction intermediate. Finally, when 1&#8208;indanone&#8208;derived dicyanoalkenes were employed, the aromatization process was interrupted, rendering a new family of diene derivatives. Theoretical calculations were performed in order to shed light on the mechanistic outcome of this transformation.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Diazabicycloalkanes via Organocatalytic aza&#8208;Michael/Aldol Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce a strategy for the one&#8208;step synthesis of chiral diazabicycloalkanes that delivers the annulated ring system in a single reaction step. The method entails a direct aza&#8208;Michael/aldol reaction of enals in conjunction with modified oxopropanamides and establishes the chiral center via iminium&#8208;enamine tandem catalysis. For this purpose, we developed simple diphenylethylendiamine frameworks as dual activation organocatalyst, effectively engaging both the substrate and reagent, thus leading to yields of 31&#8208;86% and enantioselectivities in the range of 80&#8208;98%. The final product features not only the diazabicycloalkane moiety but includes also additional functionalities, such as aldehyde motives that can be modified in situ without loss of enantioselectivity, and an sp2&#8208;bearing methyl group. Our approach accommodates a wide array of enals with high functional group tolerance. Additionally, we demonstrated the adjustability of enantioselectivity and yield by modulating the acid cocatalyst's quantity, thus offering multiple optimization possibilities.</dc:description>

Abstract
An array of enantioenriched vinyl boronates bearing an allylic carbonate moiety have been prepared through selective hydroboration of propargyl carbonates. Treatment of these vinyl boronates with TBAF in THF affords enantioenriched 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allenes through a novel 1,2&#8208;anti elimination in good yields and high enantiospecificities.

         <title>Visible Light Mediated Cyclization of Ynones for the Synthesis of 3&#8208;Alkyl N&#8208;Fused Indoles via Csp3&#8722;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A visible&#8208;light induced approach has enabled the synthesis of 3&#8208;alkyl indole from ynones via Csp3&#8722;H bond functionalization. This protocol proceeded under base&#8208;free conditions andat room temperature, providing a series of 3&#8208;alkyl indole motifs in 39% to 90% yields (44 examples). Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that a radical process should be involved in this transformation.

The front cover picture illustrates gold&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling of N&#8208;hydroxy phthalimide esters and disilanes or diborons to give organosilicon and organoboron compounds. In these reactions, gold nanoparticles functioned as single&#8208;electron transfer catalysts, which enabled the generation of alkyl radical and silyl radical, thereby enabling radical cross&#8208;coupling. The unique nature of supported gold catalyst enables the practical transformation of carboxylic acid derivatives into value&#8208;added organosilicon and organoboron compounds. Details can be found in the Research Article by Miura, Ameyama, and Shishido (H. Miura, K. Ameyama, T. Shishido, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2024, 366, XXXX&#8211;XXXX; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202300462)

Implementation of electro&#8208;redox conditions on this cycloaddition approach eliminates the essential requirement of transition metal catalysts and chemical oxidants. A wide variety of different functionalities are well tolerated under this reaction condition, contributing to the substrate scope and applicability. Several control experiments and cyclic voltammetry studies suggest an electro&#8208;oxidation triggered successive C&#8210;C and C&#8210;N bond formations followed by rapid aromatization for constructing the five&#8208;membered core structure.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The compound, 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;pyrrole, is a key scaffold contained in natural products, bioactive compounds, pharmaceuticals, and organic functional materials. However, the development of efficient synthetic strategies for 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;pyrroles is challenging. This is because 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;pyrroles, owing to their nonaromatic nature, are easily converted into the thermodynamically more stable 1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;pyrroles. Recently, efficient and straightforward synthetic strategies for 2&#8208;pyrroles have been developed, including the dearomatization of 1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;pyrrole, oxidation of pyrrolines or pyrrolidines, ring construction via catalytic cycloaddition, and rearrangement of 3&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;pyrroles. In this review, we summarize the progress in the research on 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;pyrrole synthesis since 2000 and briefly discuss the synthesis reaction mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preservation of scarce rare earth metals, such as palladium, rhodium, iridium, and others, poses a significant challenge for humanity due to their limited availability. These rare earth metals might be replaced by earth&#8208;abundant 3d&#8208;transition metals such as cobalt, manganese, iron, nickel, copper, etc. Isoquinolines have acquired an important position in synthetic organic chemistry as well as medicinal chemistry. They manifest in a diverse range of natural and synthetic molecules, serving as pivotal synthons for the synthesis of numerous bioactive compounds with notable medicinal significance. Numerous reports on the synthesis of isoquinoline derivatives via transition metal catalysis have been published worldwide. In this review, we summarize recent approaches for synthesizing various isoquinoline derivatives using 3d&#8208;transition metal catalysts since 2020. The review has been divided into different 3d&#8208;transition metal&#8208;based catalysis. We expect that this review will bring a better overview of the present status of the significant progress made in the 3d&#8208;transition metal&#8208;based synthesis of isoquinolines and persuade more advancements and research in this area in the near future.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Pyrido&#8208;[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline Derivatives via Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Cascade Reaction of Enamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cascade reaction of tertiary enamides has been developed, which provides a method for the preparation of diverse pyrido[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives with good function group tolerance. Preliminary investigation of the reaction mechanism indicate that this process comprises a nucleophilic addition of the enamide to an alkynyl group, followed by the capture of the acyliminium ion by an electron&#8208;rich aromatic component. Additionally, scale&#8208;up experiments and further transformations of pyrido&#8208;[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines underscore the utility of this methodology.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3), the hormonally active form of vitamin D3, regulates mineral homeostasis, cell growth, cell differentiation&#8208;proliferation, apoptosis, and immune responses. 1,25D3 activates more than 229 genes associated with several diseases, including arthritis, diabetes and cancer, suggesting its implications in a broader range of biological functions than originally thought. Despite the wide range of biological activities, the clinical applications of 1,25D3 have been limited due to its collateral hypercalcemic effects. This problem has boosted intense synthetic activity in the vitamin D area in the last decades aimed at the development of highly active and non&#8208;calcemic analogs for treatment of hyperproliferative diseases. This review covers the most useful synthetic approaches to 1,25D3 analogs containing the natural vitamin D triene system with emphasis on the Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed transformations involved in the formation of the vitamin D triene system and A&#8208;ring synthons.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Laetevirenol A via Regioselective Gold&#8208;Catalyzed and Acid&#8208;Promoted Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The total synthesis of Laetevirenol A, a natural product with remarkable antioxidant activity, has been achieved. A gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of an o&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;o&#8217;&#8208;alkynylbiphenyl has been used as the key step for the construction of the phenanthrene moiety present in Laetevirenol A. Several studies in model substrates have been carried out to unveil the effect of substituents in different
locations in the outcome of this cyclization. The lessons learned in these experiments have allowed the design of an appropriate precursor for the fundamental gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization. The suitably functionalized phenanthrene intermediate obtained in this key step could be further transformed into Laetevirenol A via a Friedel&#8208;Crafts cyclization, which also turned out to be highly dependent on the nature of the substituents. Finally, Laetevirenol A was obtained in 10 steps from commercially available substrates, with a 20%
global yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of Alkenyl Iodide</title>

Abstract
Alkenyl iodide, as an essential precursor and structural unit in organic synthesis, has been widely used in the synthesis of natural products, pharmaceutical pesticides and functional materials. The high reactivity of the Csp2&#8722;I bond enables the formation of a C&#8722;M bond through oxidative addition, followed by subsequent transformations of the C&#8722;M bond to create new chemical bonds. A variety of valuable scaffolds, in particular the cyclic motifs, could be achieved via designing and synthesis the corresponding alkenyl iodide, which makes this strategy to be a hot topic in synthetic chemistry. In this paper, the recent progresses of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclizationof alkenyl iodides are summarized, and the possible mechanisms for most transformations are described in detail.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Anisidines by Controlling Cu&#8208;Catalyzed [1,3]&#8208;Methoxy Rearrangement</title>

Abstract
A divergent synthesis of ortho&#8208;anisidines was achieved by controlling Cu&#8208;catalyzed [1,3]&#8208;methoxy rearrangement. The reactions of N&#8208;alkoxyanilines having an electron&#8208;donating group (EDG), such as an alkyl or anisyl group, at the ortho position and a pivaloyl group on the nitrogen atom in the presence of catalytic amounts of IPrMeCuCl and AgNTf2 afforded the corresponding 6&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;anisidines with good product selectivity through a [1,3]&#8208;rearrangement of the methoxy group to the unsubstituted ortho position. In contrast, the reactions of N&#8208; methoxyanilines having a benzyloxycarbonyl group on the nitrogen atom using IPrCuBr and AgBF4 as catalysts afforded 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;anisidines via a domino process involving a [1,3]&#8208;rearrangement of the methoxy group to the EDG&#8208;substituted ortho position followed by a [1,2]&#8208;rearrangement of the EDG of the resulting ortho&#8208;quinol imine intermediate.

Abstract
We demonstrate a photocatalyst and transition metal catalyst free photo&#8208;activation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones in visible light in the presence of an acid catalyst. The photoactivated quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one species transfers its energy to oxygen which promotes C&#8722;N cross dehydrogenative coupling with nucleophilic partners such as carbazoles, azoles and amides giving the products in 42&#8211;75% yields. Preliminary studies reveal quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one&#8208;carbazole adducts to display fluorescent properties including Intramolecular Charge Transfer (ICT) and Aggregate Induced Emission (AIE).

Abstract
A photocatalytic reaction of N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;methacryloylbenzamides with monoalkyl oxalates is described. Monoalkyl oxalates undergo single&#8208;electron oxidation/CO2 extrusion to generate alkoxycarbonyl radicals, followed by the addition and subsequent cyclization to give alkoxycarbonyl substituted isoquinolinediones. A wide variety of monoalkyl oxalates were amenable in this protocol, affording various alkoxycarbonyl substituted isoquinolinediones.

The inside cover picture illustrates a green and robust cascade Wolff rearrangement and double N&#8208;acylation for the synthesis of 3&#8208;substituted&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;a] pyrimidine&#8208;2,4(3H)&#8208;diones and 6&#8208;substituted&#8208;pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a] pyrimidine&#8208;5,7(4H,6H)&#8208;diones. The protocol features catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions and avoided traditional purification procedures such as organic solvent extraction and column chromatography. The synthesis of biologically active molecules and gram&#8208;scale experiment demonstrated the potential applications of this reaction.

         <dc:description>A substrate and catalyst&#8208;controlled synthetic strategy has been successfully employed to construct two distinct types of fused polycyclic heterocycles, namely pyrido[2,3,4&#8208;de]quinazolinones and indolo[1,2&#8208;c]quinazolinones. The most notable advantage of this method is its ability to rapidly generate two different polycyclic scaffolds via a simple C&#8722;H activation and subsequent cyclization cascade pathways. Specifically, sulfoxonium ylides played a crucial role in both transformations, serving as a two&#8208;carbon synthon and a one&#8208;carbon synthon, to independently construct the two fused polycyclic scaffolds through the [4+2] and [4+1] annulation pathways, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Utilization of Non&#8208;Stabilized Diazoalkane from (3 + 2) Cycloaddition of Linear N,N&#8208;Disilyl Enamine and Azide</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A (3+2) cycloaddition reaction of linear N,N&#8208;disilyl enamines and organic azides is investigated. The N,N&#8208;disilyl enamines, derived from the selective double hydrosilylation of conjugated nitriles, are employed in&#8208;situ for this investigation. The resulting triazoline intermediate from the (3+2) cycloaddition reaction promptly undergoes retro&#8208;(3+2) cycloaddition to yield versatile non&#8208;stabilized diazoalkane, along with formamidine. The presence of a transient and unstable alkyl diazomethane is confirmed by utilizing carboxylates as trapping reagents. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of these alkyl diazomethanes by utilizing them in reactions with various reagents, including hydroborane, diboron, silaborane, alkenes, and alkynes.</dc:description>

Abstract
A photochemical synthetic method to access sulfones from aryl halides and sodium alkylsulfinates in the presence of CuCl is reported. Regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity for the sulfonylation is observed for polyhalogenated arenes. Mechanistic studies indicate that a copper sulfinate reagent is formed in&#8197;situ from CuCl and sodium sulfinate based on NMR experiments. Potential reaction intermediates, including excited state aryl halides are studied using density functional theory calculations and reveal energetically accessible non&#8208;planar triplet geometries.

Abstract
An acetic acid&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+1+1] cycloaddition of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes with methylene compounds was developed. This protocol provides an access to hexahydropyrimidines (HHPs) (25 examples) in 35&#8211;99% yields under mild conditions in 2&#8197;hours. The potential application of this method was demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Preliminary mechanistic investigation was conducted to elucidate the possible mechanism. This work represents the yet unknown example of [2+2+1+1] cycloaddition reaction between 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes and active methylene compounds.

Abstract
The formal aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of dihydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carboline with heterodiene mediated by caesium carbonate has been described. This pathway provided a mild approach to functionalized polycyclic frameworks in 41%&#8211;91% yields.

Abstract
Gold&#8208;catalyzed [5+1]&#8208;annulations between allenylacetals with diazo esters to form 1,3&#8208;disubstituted naphthoate derivatives are described. Notably, this reaction chemoselectivity is switched to 2,3&#8208;naphthoate products when using the HOTf catalyst. Mechanistic studies of these reactions support an acetal activation, in which oxoniums are formed initially, followed by attack of the allene, generating allyl cations to trap &#945;&#8208;diazo esters. In gold catalysis, such diazo addition intermediates undergo Roskamp rearrangement, whereas in HOTf catalysis the same intermediates undergo a Conia&#8208;ene reaction instead.

Abstract
A photoredox&#8208;promoted approach for the synthesis of [1,4]diazepino[1,7&#8208;a]indol&#8208;6(7H)&#8208;ones starting from N&#8208;indolyl phenylacrylamides and aroyl chlorides as radical source is reported. This method, that involves a cascade radical addition on C&#8722;C double bond followed by intramolecular cyclization at indole C2&#8208;position, affords two diastereomeric indole&#8208;fused 1,4&#8208;diazepinones characterized by a N&#8722;C(aryl) axial chirality in yields ranging from 51 to 99%.

Abstract
A method is developed for preparing 18O&#8208;labeled esters through a Ni&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction of amides, alkyl halides, and 18O&#8208;labeled water. This method demonstrated excellent selectivity and compatibility with various amides and alkyl halides, allowing the synthesis of diverse isotopically labelled esters. Ni&#8208;catalyzed reaction of alkyl bromides, carboxylates that generated from amides, and water in the presence of a base formed the desired esters.

Abstract
Despite advances in the development of catalytic asymmetric Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, introducing &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters as dienophiles remains challenging owing to their low reactivity. Herein, we report that a chiral aminocatalyst in conjunction with a chiral isothiourea catalyst or a Br&#248;nsted acid can promote enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective Diels&#8208;Alder reactions between 2,4&#8208;dienals and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters. This method proceeds through the formation of chiral trienamine intermediates for the exo&#8208;cycloaddition with activated dienophiles, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acylammonium species or protonated N&#8208;heteroaryl&#8208;substituted alkenes. Through synergistic activation of both dienes and ester dienophiles, densely functionalized cyclohexenes bearing multiple stereocenters can be afforded with up to &gt;25:1 dr and &gt;99% ee. Moreover, we show that variation of the configurations of the chiral catalysts and the olefin geometry allows the stereodivergent preparation of four stereoisomers of the enantiopure exo&#8208;products.

         <title>Direct Generation of N&#8208;Alkoxycarbonyl Nitrones from Oximes: Intramolecular Cycloaddition of Oximes Having Alkene Moieties</title>

Abstract
&#948;,&#1013;&#8208;Unsaturated oximes, on heating with O&#8208;alkyl S&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)carbonothioates (PySCO2R) in refluxing toluene, undergo intramolecular cycloaddition to give N&#8208;alkoxycarbonylated multi&#8208;cyclic compounds. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction involves direct generation of N&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl nitrones followed by cycloaddition, instead of intramolecular oxime&#8208;olefin cycloaddition (IOOC) followed by alkoxycarbonylation. DFT calculation indicates that N&#8208;alkoxycarbonylation of oxime with PySCO2R is a concerted reaction. The reaction of oxime with a chiral alkoxycarbonylation reagent exhibits a reasonably high diastereo&#8208;face selectivity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#948;,&#1013;-Unsaturated oximes, on heating with &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-(pyridin-2-yl)carbonothioates (PySCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) in refluxing toluene, undergo intramolecular cycloaddition to give &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkoxycarbonylated multi-cyclic compounds. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction involves direct generation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkoxycarbonyl nitrones followed by cycloaddition, instead of intramolecular oxime-olefin cycloaddition (IOOC) followed by alkoxycarbonylation. DFT calculation indicates that &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkoxycarbonylation of oxime with PySCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R is a concerted reaction. The reaction of oxime with a chiral alkoxycarbonylation reagent exhibits a reasonably high diastereo-face selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A four&#8208;step metal&#8208;free procedure is described for the transformation of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;methylcyclopent&#8208;2&#8208;enone derivatives into highly functionalized E&#8208;alkylidenecyclobutanes featuring oxygenated tetrasubstituted centers. The key intermediate is a (cyclobutenyl)propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol diester, easily accessed via a tandem photochemical reaction, which undergoes an original Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution reaction with alcohols to give the title products with ester&#8208;protected primary alcohol side chains.

Abstract
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [5+1] cycloaddition via C&#8722;H activation/O&#8208;annulation strategy for synthesizing biologically interesting isochromenes is presented. This protocol selectively provides divergently functionalized isochromenes containing spirosuccinimide and maleimide scaffolds according to the maleimides and itaconimides used as the substrates. This methodology exhibits an extensive substrate scope, remarkable functional group tolerance, and high regioselectivity.

Abstract
Herein, we report a protocol for the selective &#948;&#8208;thiolation of aliphatic &#945;&#8208;amino acids catalyzed by a Pd(II)/Ag(I) system. This reaction employs disulfides as thiolating agents and N&#8208;COPy as directing group, providing valuable non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid derivatives in moderate to good diastereoselectivities and yields. Remarkably, the method is also suitable for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of a dipeptide. Experimental and DFT studies have provided significant insights into the mechanism and underlying factors controlling the selectivity of the process and determining the key role of the silver salt.

Abstract
Reactivity of nitriles in a CoCl2&#8722;6H2O/dppe/Zn&#8208;catalyzed diyne&#8208;nitrile cycloaddition was explored through the competitive reactions of a diyne with two different nitriles, and it was found that cyanamides are good substrates, and the reaction yielded 2&#8208;aminopyridines. Notably, N&#8208;unsubstituted cyanamide (H2N&#8722;CN) could be used for the reaction with 1,6&#8208;diynes to afford the corresponding N&#8208;unsubstituted 2&#8208;aminopyridines, which cannot be prepared via other catalytic reactions and are versatile intermediates for further transformations such as the synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted pyridines and 6,7&#8208;annulated imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines.

         <title>KI&#8208;Facilitated Trifunctionalization of Maleimides in Water: Access to Disulfonylated Diazosuccinimide Derivatives and their Synthetic Applications</title>

Abstract
A trifunctionalization cascade reaction of substituted maleimides was developed to generate a series of disulfonylated diazosuccinimides in satisfactory yields by employing readily available sulfonyl hydrazides as both diazo source and sulfonylation reagent. The notable features of this developed method include avoiding the use of transition metal catalysts, environmentally benign H2O as the solvent, mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance, and the late&#8208;stage modification of drugs. The derivatization reactions were effectively applied to synthesize aminosulfonylation&#8208;substituted maleimides. The involved radical pathway was also demonstrated by mechanistic studies.

Abstract
Chemoselective cyclizations of 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds with hydroxyketones for the selective formation of two 2,3,5&#8208;trisubstituted furans have been reported. While TsOH&#8208;mediated cyclization in DCM afforded 2&#8208;acylfurans, the additional copper catalyst in acetone turned over the selectivity for the generation of 3&#8208;acylfurans. The featured advantages of both reactions include simple conditions, high yielding, broad substrate scope, gram scalability, and H2O as the sole byproduct.

Abstract
Vanillin is a popular and versatile flavor compound, almost entirely produced from petroleum&#8208;derived phenol by a multi&#8208;step chemical synthesis. The process is hazardous to the environment and unsustainable for its fossil oil usage. Therefore, developing environmentally friendly, efficient, and sustainable routes to biobased vanillin is essential. Here, we report on vanillin production from 4&#8208;n&#8208;propylguaiacol (4PG), one of the main components in lignin oil obtained through reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) of soft wood, by employing recombinant Escherichia coli cells. Conversion is based on the expression of two engineered oxidative enzymes: a 4&#8208;n&#8208;propylguaiacol oxidase and an isoeugenol dioxygenase. A high yield of vanillin, 66% from 4PG in RCF lignin oil was achieved through rounds of optimisation of the whole&#8208;cell conversion process. This high&#8208;performance strategy was readily scaled up to produce vanillin at an unprecedented 18% and 3% yield based on lignin oil and spruce wood respectively. The whole&#8208;cell bioconversion process shows good tolerance even at high loadings of starting material, showcasing the robustness and applicability of the employed biocatalysts. This work paves the way for further development towards the efficient production of high&#8208;titer biobased vanillin using depolymerised lignin as the feedstock.

Abstract
A one&#8208;pot synthesis method for functionalized bis&#8208;sulfonyl dibenzofurans was developed under an air atmosphere using potassium carbonate&#8208;mediated benzannulation of diversified &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl o&#8208;hydroxyacetophenones with 1,4&#8208;dichloro&#8208;2&#8208;butyne. A plausible mechanism was proposed and discussed. This method provides intermolecular double &#945;&#8208;propargylation, sulfonyl migration, and intramolecular ring&#8208;closure via the formation of one carbon&#8208;oxygen single (C&#8722;O) bond, one carbon&#8208;sulfur single (C&#8722;S) bond, and two carbon&#8208;carbon (C=C) double bonds.

Abstract
Easy access to divergent products with chemoselectivity is of great importance in organic synthesis. Herein, we have developed a chemoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed carbene insertion protocol onto N&#8722;H bonds of tryptamine derivatives. Divergent insertion products are obtained by varying the nucleophilicity of the aliphatic NH of tryptamine with electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. The reaction provided N&#8722;H insertion products with broad substrate scope in good yields.

         <title>Hydroxamate Assays for High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Transketolase Libraries Against Arylated Substrates</title>

Abstract
We recently reported that the transketolase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (TKgst) upon acyl transfer to nitrosoarenes generates N&#8208;aryl hydroxamic acids (HA). The latter are metal chelating compounds that in the presence of Fe(III) ions form deep&#8208;red complexes. Here, we applied this principle to the development of a colorimetric assay in both solid&#8208; and liquid&#8208;phase formats for the high&#8208;throughput screening of TKgst and its variants. Screening a set of positive hits from a L382X/D470X library validated the specificity and sensitivity of the assays. The solid surface assay allows a clear distinction between positive and negative colonies by the naked eye in qualitative mode, and further also to measure activity in semi&#8208;quantitative fashion in the liquid&#8208;phase format. The assay will be important for engineering the TKgst enzyme towards improved conversion of aromatic aldehydes by their close structural analogy to nitrosoarenes.

Here, we applied this principle to the development of a colorimetric assay in both solid- and liquid-phase formats for the high-throughput screening of TK&lt;sub&gt;gst&lt;/sub&gt; and its variants. Screening a set of positive hits from a L382X/D470X library validated the specificity and sensitivity of the assays. The solid surface assay allows a clear distinction between positive and negative colonies by the naked eye in qualitative mode, and further also to measure activity in semi-quantitative fashion in the liquid-phase format. The assay will be important for engineering the TK&lt;sub&gt;gst&lt;/sub&gt; enzyme towards improved conversion of aromatic aldehydes by their close structural analogy to nitrosoarenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Enantioselective Alkynylation of Trifluoropyruvates with Terminal 1,3&#8208;Diynes</title>

Abstract
A direct catalytic enantioselective alkynylation reaction of trifluoropyruvates with terminal 1,3&#8208;diynes was achieved by using C2&#8208;symmetric NCN pincer rhodium (III) complexes with bis(imidazolinyl)phenyl ligands. This protocol is effective for enantioselective synthesis of optically active trifluoromethylated tertiary alcohols with the diyne moiety. A variety of electronically and structurally diverse terminal 1,3&#8208;diynes are well tolerated. Furthermore, the catalytic reaction is applicable to preparation of both enantiomers of the chiral CF3&#8208;containing conjugated diynols with high enantioselectivity.

Abstract
A variety of Pd&#8208;catalyzed reactions are carried out with palladium carboxylates in the presence of carboxylic acids and/or alkali metal carboxylates. This review is Part A of three reviews highlighting the dependence of the efficiency of the formation of the different C&#8722;C bonds on the nature of the carboxylate unit. Part A concerns inter&#8208; and intramolecular reactions leading to the formation of a C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2), C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) or C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond. The variety of procedures and additives is presented as well as the reaction mechanisms with, as far as possible, personal comments.

Abstract
The efficiency of the formation of C&#8722;C bonds under palladium catalysis often depends on the nature of the carboxylate ligand and carboxylic acids or alkali metal carboxylates additives. This review which is Part B of a trilogy devoted to the topic, highlights the influence of the carboxylate unit on the hydro(hetero)arylation, hydroalkenylation and hydroalkylation reactions. The plausible reaction mechanisms are presented with, as far as possible, personal comments.

Abstract
The efficiency of the formation of C&#8722;C bonds under palladium catalysis often depends on the nature of the carboxylate ligand and carboxylic acids or alkali metal carboxylates additives. This review which is Part C of a trilogy devoted to the topic, highlights the influence of the carboxylate units on domino diarylation and annelation reactions. The plausible reaction mechanisms are presented with, as far as possible, personal comments.

         <title>Synthesis of Trifluoromethylthiolated Quinolinones via Trifluoromethanesulfanamide&#8208;Induced Electrophilic Intramolecular Cyclization of N&#8208;Arylpropynamides</title>

Abstract
The reaction of N&#8208;arylpropynamides with the commercially available trifluoromethanesulfanamide in the presence of BiCl3 was found to afford quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones in a selective manner via electrophilic trifluoromethylthiolation enabled by the in&#8208;situ generated CF3S&#8722;Cl and the followed intramolecular cyclization. Differing from the existing analogous cyclization route that solely produces spiro[4,5]trienones, this alternative approach exclusively affords the biologically interesting quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones as the major products.

Abstract
An iodine&#8208;mediated radical cyclization of o&#8208;vinylaryl isocyanides with disulfides or diselenides was developed. The atom&#8208;economic reaction provides a method for regioselective construction of the 2&#8208;chalcogenated quinolines in 42&#8211;93% yields by incorporation of both chalcogen atoms of disulfides or diselenides into quinolines.

Abstract
Herein, electrochemical reductive carboxylation of para&#8208;quinone methides with CO2 was developed. A variety of value&#8208;added carboxylic acids can be accessed in moderate to excellent yields. Preliminary studies showed that para&#8208;quinone methides were reduced to benzyl carbanion during the reaction. This protocol features high atom economy, operational simplicity, and environmental friendliness, enabling the synthesis of various carboxylic compounds.

Abstract
A radical&#8208;induced dichloromethylation and concomitant 1,2&#8208;aryl migration of allylic alcohols with CHCl3 is developed for the construction of &#947;,&#947;&#8208;dichloroketones in moderate to good yields. We found that, for the para&#8208;substituted unsymmetrical substrates, the more electron&#8208;deficient aryl group migrates preferentially over the more electron&#8208;rich aryl group. Moreover, chlorocyclopropanes could be obtained from allyl alcohols in one&#8208;pot manner through radical&#8208;addition/1,2&#8208;aryl migration/nucleophilic substitution.

Abstract
A photo&#8208;induced metal&#8208;free radical hydroboration of various styrenes with NHC&#8208;borane has been developed, which can provide mono&#8208; and di&#8208;alkylated boranes in a selective manner. Besides, this strategy can also be applied to prepare di&#8208;functionalized boranes with two different alkyl groups. Mild reaction conditions and good functional groups compatibility were observed. Preliminary mechanism for this reaction was proposed.

         <title>Synthesis of Diverse Allylsilanes Employing Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyzed Reductive Functionalization</title>

Abstract
We present a rapid (0.25&#8211;1&#8197;h), method to produce functionalised allylsilanes from readily available vinylsilanes. Employing a Br&#248;nsted acid catalysed dehydration as the key step, allylsilanes are produced in good yields (22&#8211;98%) and, in most cases, as a single geometric isomer. Furthermore, a possible allylation&#8208;Cope pathway was discovered for certain substrates and attempts to optimise this are described.

Abstract
Herein, we report an approach to phospha&#8208;xanthenes from ortho&#8208;chalcone based organophosphines and arynes. These reactions proceeded through a sequential process consisting of a formal [4+2] cycloaddition, arylation, P&#8722;OH formation and P&#8722;C bond cleavage. A gram&#8208;scale preparation and a chemical conversion were performed to demonstrate the synthetic utility of this method. Also, a possible mechanism was proposed based on the control experiments.

Abstract
A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation/[4+1] annulation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;indoles and CF3&#8208;substituted imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides (TFISYs) has been achieved, producing a wide variety of trifluoroacetimidoyl&#8208;substituted 11H&#8208;isoindolo[2,1&#8208;a]indoles in 51&#8211;86% yields. The cascade reaction involves C&#8722;H imidoylmethylation, tautomerization and AgOAc&#8208;mediated C&#8722;N bond formation sequence. The reaction could be scaled up to 2&#8197;mmol scale.

         <title>Contemporary Approaches for Amide Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Amide bond construction has garnered significant interest in recent decades due to amides being one of the most prevalent functional groups among bioactive molecules. Out of the thirty&#8208;seven new drugs approved by the FDA in 2022, eleven are small molecules containing at least one amide bond. Additionally, there are nineteen large molecules approved as new drugs, some of which have peptide structures, and therefore, also bear amide bonds. In recent years, multiple teams have embraced the challenge of developing more efficient methods for amide bond formation. This dedication has led to numerous publications appearing monthly in prestigious journals, showcasing significant advancements in this field. The primary goal of this review is to present the most viable strategies for constructing the amide bond. It is crucial to differentiate between amide bond formation and amide synthesis; hence, the focus is on describing specific methods for forming new C(O)&#8722;N bonds. In particular, this review concentrates on the methods developed within the last six years. There is a particular emphasis on new approaches that consider the thought process when selecting the starting materials and functional groups. This approach ensures coverage of all the most common chemical transformations that yield new amide bonds.

2&#8208;Iminothiazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;one, 5&#8208;ethylidenethiazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;one, and thiazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thione are all medicinally relevant structures. In this work, a NaSO2CF3&#8208;promoted [2+2+1] cascade annulation reaction of CF3&#8208;imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides and isothiocyanates was reported to synthesize a variety of decorated thiazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thiones in 35&#8211;91% yields with exclusive stereoselectivity. The gram&#8208;scale reaction and further chemoselective S&#8208;alkylations demonstrated the synthetic utilities of this transformation.

         <title>General Synthesis of Alkyl Amines via Borrowing Hydrogen and Reductive Amination</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Amines are a very important class of compounds and the selective synthesis of differently substituted primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl amines is challenging. Here we present the synthesis of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl amines from ammonia and alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and hydrogen by combining borrowing hydrogen or hydrogen autotransfer and reductive amination with hydrogen. The key is a nanostructured, bimetallic Co/Sc catalyst able to mediate both reactions or concepts efficiently. We observe a broad product scope, a very good functional group tolerance, upscaling is easily accomplished and our catalyst is reusable.

         <title>Cooperative Biocatalysis Enables Assembly of a Prenylated Indole Alkaloid</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The hapalindole&#8208;type metabolites have garnered significant interest due to their diverse biological activities and unique chemical structures. Recently, the biosynthesis of this family of indole alkaloids has been uncovered and shown to involve a rare biocatalytic Cope rearrangement. Previously, we demonstrated cis&#8208;indole isonitrile C&#8208;3 normal geranylation using FamD2. Thus, we sought to explore further the reaction potential with this substrate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) using prenyltransferases and cyclases from the hapalindole biosynthetic pathways. Here, we report a new compound derived from an unexpected biosynthetic Cope rearrangement, which expands further the scope of metabolites generated from cyanobacterial Stig cyclases.

Abstract
A concise method for the synthesis furan and benzene fused 2&#8208;tetralones via photo&#8208;induced rearrangement of 2&#8242;&#8208;(furan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;ols was developed. Under argon atmosphere and room temperature, 6,7&#8208;dihydrophenanthro[9,10&#8208;b]furan&#8208;5(4H)&#8208;ones were obtained by irradiating 2&#8242;&#8208;(furan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;ols with a 254&#8197;nm UV lamp (64&#8197;W) in dichloromethane (DCM) for 1&#8197;hour. The reaction mechanism includes 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization, thermal suprafacial [1,5]&#8208;H shift, double thermal suprafacial [1,3]&#8208;H shift and keto&#8208;enol isomerization.

Abstract
The one&#8208;pot construction of diversified sulfonyl flavones was developed by K2CO3&#8208;mediated formal (5+1) stepwise annulation of &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl o&#8208;hydroxyacetophenones with substituted nitriles under the open&#8208;flask atmosphere conditions. A plausible mechanism is proposed and discussed. This method provides intermolecular and intramolecular ring&#8208;closure via the formations of one carbon&#8208;oxygen single (C&#8722;O) bond, one carbon&#8208;carbon (C=C) double bond, and the cleavage of one carbon&#8208;nitrile triple (C&#8801;N) bond.

         <title>Primary and Secondary Amines by Flavin&#8208;Photocatalyzed Consecutive Desulfonylation and Dealkylation of Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Alkane&#8208;, arene&#8208;, and perfluoroalkanesulfonyl groups are widely used in organic synthesis to protect amino functionalities or to facilitate their installation. Protection of amino functions by a sulfonyl group to form sulfonamides is advantageous as they are easy to purify and tolerate various reaction conditions. On the other hand, sulfonyl group removal is difficult. Herein, we present a versatile metal&#8208;free photocatalytic reductive method for desulfonylation of sulfonamides and aryl sulfonates to the parent amines mediated by flavin derivatives, namely deazaisoalloxazines and deazaalloxazines, and visible light. Photocatalysis with 5&#8208;deazalloxazines is shown to even mediate the cleavage of perfluoroalkanesulfonamides (triflylamides and nonaflylamides), which is significantly more difficult than that of other sulfonamides and has previously not been achieved by photochemical means. The method is shown to perform consecutive desulfonylation and dealkylation of N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenylperfluoroalkanesulfonamides affording primary anilines. This occurs via consecutive reductive and oxidative catalytic cycles mediated by the flavin catalyst. The perfluoroalkylsulfonyl group fulfils a dual role serving as a protecting group and, after removal by the reductive cycle, as the species driving the oxidative dealkylation reaction.

         <title>Molecular Oxygen&#8208;Induced Transamidation of Unactivated Amides in Diethyl Carbonate in the Presence of a Palladium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Herein we disclose a palladium&#8208;catalyzed procedure for the transamidation of structurally diverse amides with amines based on the use of molecular oxygen as palladium&#8208;activating agent.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein we disclose a palladium-catalyzed procedure for the transamidation of structurally diverse amides with amines based on the use of molecular oxygen as palladium-activating agent. The reaction, which is scalable and amenable for the preparation of enantioenriched compounds, is carried out in a bio-degradable solvent often used as a fuel additive, diethyl carbonate. As a result of the 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;mol% of catalyst required, final products are isolated containing palladium impurities in a concentration of 0.1&#8197;ppm. Two kinetically different mechanistic pathways are proposed for this reaction on account of a number of experiments such as kinetic curves, TEM images, catalyst poisoning experiments, UPLC-ESI-MS identification of intermediates and EPR spectra of reaction crude.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
An oxidant&#8208;free photocatalytic [2+2+m] cyclization of 2&#8208;cyanoaryl acrylamides with 2&#8208;bromocarbonyls is reported, enabling the assembly of biologically important N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;fused quinolinones including benzo[1,6]naphthyridinones and pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;c]&#8208;quinolines. This photocatalytic protocol proceeds through a radical relay pathway including alkene difunctionalization along with an intramolecular cyano insertion and subsequent site&#8208;specific functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bond enabled by cyano&#8208;derived iminyl radical&#8208;mediated 1,n&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer. Notably, this transformation selectively formed two distinct C&#8722;C bonds, one C&#8722;N bond, and one quaternary carbon center in a one&#8208;pot procedure.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Cycloadditions of Alkenylidenecyclopropanes with Alkenes and Dienes</title>

Abstract
Low&#8208;valent cobalt complexes equipped with phosphorous type of ligands can promote the intramolecular (3+2) cycloaddition of alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) with alkenes and with allenes. Dienes can also be used as partners, but they afford seven&#8208;membered cycloadducts. The reactions are fully diastereoselective and, in some cases, we also observed moderate enantioselectivities, especially when using chiral phosphite ligands.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidation of Indoles to Access Tryptanthrins at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrooxidative reconstruction of indole core under ambient conditions is reported, by constructing tryptanthrin architecture successfully. This electrochemical strategy simplifies molecular skeleton&#8208;hopping by employing commercially available NH&#8208;indole feedstock as the starting materials. Furthermore, the synthetic value of this skeletal reconstruction was demonstrated by the readily accessible and divergent further transformations, which provided a diverse array of biologically active molecules. A preliminary mechanism investigation involving control experiments and cyclovoltammetric studies have evidenced the indispensability of electricity, as well as the importance of oxygen and TEMPO, thereby revealing a possible reaction pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Organocatalyzed Monochlorination of Arenes with Electrophilic Chlorosulfoniums</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This manuscript presents a regioselective chlorination of arenes, yielding almost exclusively the monochlorinated product. It tolerates free hydroxy groups, 1&#186;, 2&#186; and 3&#186; amines, and carboxylic acids, among other polar and nonpolar functional groups, as well as mono&#8208; and polysubstituted aromatic rings. Additionally, the utilization of chlorosulfonium salts as the chlorinating agent is demonstrated. The method emerges as an alternative to other processes where organic byproducts must be separated from the reaction mixture. In addition, the main byproducts are gaseous materials such as CO and CO2. This publication introduces the application of sulfoxides, oxalyl chloride, and aqueous hydrogen peroxide as the chlorination mixture.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A three&#8208;step synthesis of anti&#8208;amoebic, ring&#8208;fused mackinazolinones has been developed. A Mannich&#8208;type reaction between quinazolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones and N&#8208;Cbz propanal in the presence of AgOTf afforded quinazolinones (19&#8208;94% isolated yield) bearing a newly formed heterocycle with an alkylamine appendage that, upon N&#8208;Cbz deprotection and basification, triggered a domino rearrangement to afford 45 separable, ring&#8208;fused products. Several compounds inhibited growth of Naegleria fowleri parasites that can cause a lethal human brain infection. Thus, the methodology provides immediate access to a promising anti&#8208;amoebic scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Approach for Investigation of the Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship of Salmycin and Identification of a Glycan&#8208;based Analogue for Drug Resistant Staphylococcus aureus</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New synthetic routes were devised for total synthesis of Fe3+&#8208;bound (ferri&#8208;) salmycin B (Sal B) (1), glycan&#8208;based Sal analogues 2&#8208;5 and their Fe3+&#8208;unbound (desferri&#8208;) counterparts 1&#8242;&#8210;5&#8242; for the structure to activity relationship (SAR) study. The results of SAR study reveal the effective structure of 1 and its desferri&#8208;counterpart 1&#8242; that responsible for the observed inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Among the analogues 2&#8208;5 and 2&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242;, glucose&#8208;based analogue 2 and its desferri&#8208;counterpart 2&#8242; exhibited inhibitory potency comparable to 1 and 1&#8242;. Chemical modification of 2&#8242; for further antibacterial study enabled us to discover desferri&#8208;Sal analogue 7&#8242; that endowed with a simpler pharmacophore structure but significantly higher antibacterial potency against methicillin&#8208;sensitive and resistant S. aureus than the natural product 1&#8242; and even the clinical vancomycin. Together with a better hydrolytic stability and shorter synthetic route, the analogue 7&#8242; represents an attractive antibiotic lead for further exploration.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic insight into Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkylation of indoles with diazoesters employing bipyridine&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dioxides as chiral controllers</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkylation of indoles with &#945;&#8208;diazoesters is well&#8208;known, however, the underlying mechanisms of this reaction, particularly the origin of stereoselectivity, remain uncertain. For the Pd catalysis, we address this cutting&#8208;edge challenge from two complementary viewpoints &#8211; i) the molecular level regarding a single catalytically active Pd center; and ii) nano&#8208;level Pd species investigating the factors favoring the appearance of the preferred catalytic centers. The formation of the active catalytic species was monitored by structural methods (NMR and ESI&#8208;MS), and metal particles were characterized with electron microscopy (SEM, EDX). On the molecular level,chiral bipyridine&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dioxides proved to be competent chiral controllers. The kinetic and DFT computational data revealed a crucial role of water in the rate and selectivity determining steps and showed that the enantioselectivity of the process is controlled by the protodepalladation step. On the nano&#8208;scale, the important effect of catalyst precursor on the overall reaction performance was shown.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies and Methods for the Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Benzofuran/Benzopyran Fused Acetals: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzofuran&#8208; and benzopyran&#8208;fused polycyclic
acetals are found in a variety of biologically active natural
products. The synthetic methods toward these class of
polycyclic heterocycles have fascinated one of the most
intensive pursuits in total synthesis. Nevertheless,
stereoselective methods towards the rapid construction of
such skeletons still remain challenging for organic chemists.
Significant progress has been made in this research area in
recent years, however, literature on enantioselective
approaches to construct these molecules has not fully
reviewed.
Driven by their intriguing and complex scaffolds with
potential usefulness, we compose the recent advances in this
review covering all the important works in this field. We
hope this review will promote future research in this area.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Carboxylic Acids through Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrocarboxylation of Allenes with Diisobutylaluminum Hydride and Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A regioselective method for synthesizing &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;quaternary carboxylic acids through the copper&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarboxylation of allenes with CO2 is described. Allenes undergo hydroalumination with diisobutylaluminum hydride, followed by carboxylation of the resulting allylaluminum intermediate. The presence of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand is essential for enhancing the reactivity of the reaction. The good functional group compatibility of the reaction allows the synthesis of a wide range of functionalized &#945;&#8208;quaternary carboxylic acids with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities for synthetic and medicinal applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A regioselective method for synthesizing &#946;,&#947;-unsaturated &#945;-quaternary carboxylic acids through the copper-catalyzed hydrocarboxylation of allenes with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is described. Allenes undergo hydroalumination with diisobutylaluminum hydride, followed by carboxylation of the resulting allylaluminum intermediate. The presence of an &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene ligand is essential for enhancing the reactivity of the reaction. The good functional group compatibility of the reaction allows the synthesis of a wide range of functionalized &#945;-quaternary carboxylic acids with high regio- and stereoselectivities for synthetic and medicinal applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
An electrochemical Reformatsky&#8208;type reaction of bromodifluoroamides with aldehydes/ketones via electron reductive umpolung is reported, leading to the generation of a series of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro amides in moderate to good yields. This protocol tolerated a variety of commercially available alkyl ketone, alkyl and aromatic aldehydes, featuring broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance under transition metal&#8208;free conditions without metal reduction reagents. Control experiment indicated that the reaction proceeded via an electron reductive umpolung pathway.

         <title>Quaternary Ammonium Salts: Catalysts for Hydrosilylation of Alkynes with Hydrosilanes.</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inside cover picture, designed by Tsuchimoto, illustrates the world of the title reaction. The hydrosilylation of alkynes (HA) has been traditionally catalyzed by rare and costly metals like Pt, Rh, and Pd. In contrast, we developed for the first time the HA catalyzed by quaternary ammonium salts, which can be readily prepared in&#8197;situ of the reaction from i&#8208;PrI and DABCO. The catalysts can be recycled. Details can be found in the Research Article presented by Tsuchimoto and co&#8208;workers (H. Andoh, K. Nakamura, Y. Nakazawa, T. Ikeda&#8208;Fukazawa, S. Okabayashi, T. Tsuchimoto, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2023, 365, xxxx&#8211;xxxx; DOI: 10.1002/adsc.202300423)

Abstract
A Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] oxidative annulation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketoxime acetates with cyclopropanols has been developed for the synthesis of 2,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted pyridines in 28&#8211;76% yields. This method employs cyclopropanols as C2 synthons and features various functional group compatibility and gram&#8208;scale synthesis. In addition, a plausible reaction pathway was proposed based on the mechanism studies.

Abstract
Herein, we have developed an organophotocatalyzed, visible&#8208;light mediated tandem decarboxylation&#8208;cyclization method. The Eosin&#8208;Y as organophotocatalyst drives photoredox tandem protocol to construct C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, and C&#8722;C bonds in a single operation. The reaction mechanism proceeds through decarboxylation followed by amino alcohol intermediate formation from N&#8208;arylglycine and formaldehyde followed by cyclization with another formaldehyde delivers N&#8208;arylloxazolidine derivatives.

Abstract
In this paper, a non&#8208;Cp* cobalt&#8208;catalyzed [4+1] spirocyclization of aromatic amides with cyclic diazo compounds for the synthesis of pentatomic spirolactams is presented. The reaction features with high regio/chemoselectivity by using cheap and commercially available base metal catalyzed C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H bond functionalization. Moreover, the practicability of this developed protocol is further demonstrated by the removal of the directing group and gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

Abstract
The intermolecular anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamination of vinylsilanes was achieved utilizing five silyl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;terphenoxide yttrium complexes. The highest activity was observed for the most sterically encumbered triphenylsilyl&#8208;substituted complex. Excellent activity and complete anti&#8208;Markonikov selectivity were obtained for a variety of benzylic and aliphatic primary and secondary amines. Interestingly, the reaction with 2&#8208;picolylamine produced the hydroaminoalkylation product rather than the hydroamination product. Reaction of dimethyldivinylsilane resulted in a range of 1,4&#8208;azasilinanes via sequential hydroamination/endocyclization in good yields.

Abstract
We established a strategy for the copper&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component 1,4&#8208;phosphinoylcyanation of 1,3&#8208;enynes with diarylphosphine oxides and trimethylsilyl cyanide. The reaction produced various tetrasubstituted phosphinoyl&#8208; and cyano&#8208;containing allenes with high functional group compatibilities in good yields under mild reaction conditions. A preliminary reaction mechanism involving the formation of phosphinoyl radicals and their regioselective addition to 1,3&#8208;enynes was also proposed.

Abstract
Herein we describe Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of &#945;&#8208;pinene derivative &#8211; pinacarvone O&#8208;methyl oxime (1) with aryl halides (2). Surprisingly, the formation of the C&#8722;C coupling product was accompanied by an unexpected opening of the pinene bicyclic structure. The (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;aryl&#8208;4,4,5&#8208;trimethylcyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;one O&#8208;methyl oxime (3) was formed as the resulting product. The reaction conditions of the developed synthetic procedure were carefully optimized and the reaction mechanism was supposed on the basis of data obtained by structural and computational methods.

Abstract
A substrate&#8208;controlled [4+1] annulation of sulfoxonium ylides with maleimides via Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation is developed. The reaction of sulfoxonium ylides with 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;arylmaleimides in the presence of AgNTf2 diastereoselectively provides diversely functionalized indanonylpyrroline&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione derivatives. Furthermore, in the presence of AgBF4, the subsequent reaction with maleimides leads to biologically intriguing various spiroindanonylpyrroline&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones. This methodology offers a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Recent Advances in the 1,2&#8208;Diarylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Alkenes are a fascinating functional class that can be converted into various structures. A desirable and durable synthetic method for forming two C&#8722;C bonds across an olefin is the dicarbofunctionalization of olefins, catalyzed by transition metals. This method enables a rapid expansion of molecular complexity in a single step. Among the myriad of efficient strategies for alkene difunctionalization, the 1,2&#8208;diarylation mode stands out primarily due to its remarkable ability to incorporate two hindered aryl groups across the C=C bond in a versatile and straightforward manner. This review covers the recent advances in the 1,2&#8208;diarylation of alkenes from 2018 to 2023, focusing on different transition metals employed as catalysts.

Abstract
Synthesis of benzoxazoles via amide formation from amino phenols and &#945;&#8208;diazoesters using dicobalt octacarbonyl as a solid CO source is reported. Our methodology provides a strategy for synthesizing substituted benzoxazoles with methylene linker between the benzoxazole and aromatic ring systems. Substrates with different substituents were employed to produce corresponding benzoxazoles. The synthesized compounds were characterized by using standard spectroscopic and analytical techniques including single crystal XRD studies.

Abstract
An asymmetric three&#8208;component reaction of &#945;&#8208;H diazoacetate with sulfonamide and imine has been developed under the co&#8208;catalyzation of Rh2(OAc)4 and a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA), which proceed through Mannich&#8208;type interception of transient ammonium ylide. The reaction offers a convenient access to &#945;, &#946;&#8208;diamine acid derivatives with two adjacent chiral centers in 59%&#8208;74% yields with 91%&#8208;99% ee and 92:8 to&gt;95:5 dr. Moreover, the generated products could be easily converted to free chiral diamines and other useful chiral motifs.

&lt;p&gt;An asymmetric three-component reaction of &#945;-H diazoacetate with sulfonamide and imine has been developed under the co-catalyzation of Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA), which proceed through Mannich-type interception of transient ammonium ylide. The reaction offers a convenient access to &#945;, &#946;-diamine acid derivatives with two adjacent chiral centers in 59%-74% yields with 91%-99% ee and 92:8 to&amp;gt;95:5 dr. Moreover, the generated products could be easily converted to free chiral diamines and other useful chiral motifs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Various symmetrical and unsymmetrical indolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazoles were synthesized in a one&#8208; or two&#8208;step reaction using &#945;&#8208;haloketones and indoles. The developed methodology demonstrated controllable chemoselectivity and gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Furthermore, this transformation was compatible with other &#945;&#8208;functionalized ketones, such as &#945;&#8208;hydroxy and &#945;&#8208;acetyloxy ketones, allowing for the formation of their corresponding indolocarbazoles. Additionally, our photochemical research has revealed that all the indolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazoles exhibited dual fluorescence, with the relative intensity varying depending on the solvent.

Abstract
We developed a cascade reaction of diynone and o&#8208;hydroxy aromatic aldimine under mild conditions. This protocol is proposed to proceed through sequential [3+2]/[4+4] cycloaddition and proton transfer processes, thus providing an efficient way for the synthesis of a variety of dihydropyrrole fused eight&#8208;membered ring scaffolds.

Abstract
Herein, a photocatalytic system for defluorinative [4+2] annulation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes with unactivated alkenes is realized. This protocol was compatible with a broad scope of unactivated alkenes, affording the diverse monofluorocyclohexene products in 30&#8211;95% yields. Furthermore, the value of this method was demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis, late&#8208;stage functionalization and synthesis of various valuable and complex monofluorocyclohexene derivatives.

Abstract
This work describes the selective synthesis of a series of pyrido/benzo&#8208;fused 1,4&#8208;selenazines, through the reaction of bis(3&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl) or bis(2&#8208;aminophenyl) diselenides with different &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. When molecular I2 was used as catalyst, a series of (Z)&#8208;1&#8208;(1H&#8208;pyrido[2,3&#8208;b][1,4]selenazin&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;ylidene)propan&#8208;2&#8208;ones were obtained. On the other hand, in the absence of catalyst, 1&#8208;(2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrido[2,3&#8208;b][1,4]selenazin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;ones could be prepared selectively. The structure of the prepared compounds was elucidated by NMR and HRMS analysis and confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The versatility of the protocol was demonstrated not only by the access to a variety of 1,4&#8208;selenazine derivatives, but also by the structural diversity in the 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl precursors, incorporating multifunctionalities in the synthesized heterocycles.

         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Here we present a catalyst&#8208;free protocol for the purple light&#8208;mediated anti&#8208;Markovnikov functionalization of alkenes with thiols. Crucial to the generation of the thiyl radical was the formation of a key photo&#8208;active complex. More than 30 thioether products were obtained, demonstrating tolerance towards different functional groups and scalability up to 5&#8197;mmol of alkene. Two different reaction conditions have been developed, varying both the solvent and the amount of thiol. Depending on the alkene structure, water can be used as an alternative to dichloromethane as a solvent, thus increasing the sustainability of the whole process.

         <title>Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalysed Kinetic Resolution of Secondary and Tertiary 3&#8208;Amido Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A synthetic method to prepare enantioenriched secondary and tertiary 3&#8208;amido allylic alcohols efficiently that relies on their stereoablative enantioselective kinetic resolution (KR) catalysed by a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid is described. Achieved at room temperature, the stereoablative asymmetric KR protocol was shown to exhibit excellent functional group tolerance and provided product yields up to 50%, and ee and s values up to 99% and &gt;200. The synthetic utility of the divergent catalytic protocol was exemplified by the 1&#8197;mmol scale preparation of one tertiary example and its reduction or bromination to give the corresponding 1,3&#8208;amino alcohol and 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,3&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives. The suggested asymmetric KR pathways provide rare instances of accomplishing enantioselective discrimination through the dehydration or imine&#8208;enamine tautomerisation/retro&#8208;aza&#8208;aldol reaction of the respective 2&#176; and 3&#176; alcohol substrates.

Abstract
We disclosed the dual role of neutral [Hmim]Br towards the direct conversion of arylsulfonic anhydride into arylthiol surrogate for the controlled and regioselective synthesis of 3&#8208;sulfenylindoles from indole derivatives at rt. In addition, 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;3&#8208;sulfenylindoles were synthesized in the presence of catalytic water at 50&#8201;&#176;C in a cascade manner i.&#8201;e. sulfenylation and bromination through de&#8208;oxygenative reduction with [Hmim]Br in the absence of any additional brominating agent. The present method was also utilized for the sulfenylation of other heterocycles including azaindole, coumarin, naphthol, and pyrrole in good to excellent yields. Moreover, mechanistic investigations revealed this reaction was driven by imidazolium cation of neutral ionic liquid i.&#8201;e. [Hmim]Br, which converts arylsulfonic anhydride into sulfenyl group for sulfenylation/bromination of sp2 C&#8722;H bond wherein an acidic ionic liquid [Hmim]pTSA is released as a by&#8208;product.

Abstract
A base&#8208;promoted net&#8208;[3+2] cycloaddition of nitriles and 1&#8208;arylpropynes for the synthesis of pyrroles is described. The developed method provides convenient access to various 2,5&#8208;disubstituted or 2,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted pyrroles in 40% to 96% yields (32 examples). Among methods for the synthesis of pyrroles, the protocol presented here stands out for its convenience and atom&#8208;economy.

         <title>Pd/Cu Co&#8208;Catalyzed ortho&#8208;Arylation of Aryl Iodides via Radical Intermediates with Aryl Diazonium Salts</title>

Abstract
A Cu/Pd co&#8208;catalyzed Catellani&#8208;type ortho arylation reaction of iodoarenes with aryl diazonium salts has been developed. Aryl radicals that derived from aryl diazonium salts were regioselectively installed at ortho position of iodoarenes via palladium catalyzed C&#8722;H activation. Mechanistic studies showed that, in contrast to classical Pd0&#8722;PdII&#8722;PdIV&#8722;PdII&#8722;Pd0 catalytic cycle, this radical cascades performed via a Pd0&#8722;PdII&#8722;PdIII&#8722;PdI&#8722;Pd0&#8197;cycle.

         <title>Accessing Indenoazulenes via a Gold&#8208;Catalysed Cyclisation of Cycloheptatrienyl&#8208;Substituted 1,5&#8208;Diynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Synthesis &amp;amp;Catalysis, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report that cycloheptatrienyl&#8208;substituted 1,5&#8208;diynes with aromatic backbones undergo a gold&#8208;catalysed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclisation to give 11H&#8208;indeno&#8208;[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes at room temperature. This methodology complements the established range of aromatic structures obtained from gold&#8208;catalysed conversions of differently substituted 1,5&#8208;diynes accessed via highly reactive cationic intermediates. We have demonstrated the scope of the reaction and have assessed the possibility of further functionalisation of the indenoazulene scaffold. Additionally, we have studied the optical and electrochemical properties as well as the frontier molecular orbitals of this structural motif by both spectroscopic and theoretical means.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Nitrogen Spirocycles in a Tandem Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation/Dipolar Cycloaddition Reaction</title>

Abstract
Complex spirocyclic isoindolines and pyrrolidines are formed in a tandem process involving Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed dienylation of cyclic C&#8208;aryl nitrones with 2,3&#8208;butadien&#8208;1&#8208;ol carbonates, followed by intramolecular 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition. The nitrone moiety serves both as a directing group for the C(aryl)&#8722;H activation and the dipole in the cycloaddition step. High regioselectivity of the fused vs. bridged product can be obtained by adjusting the reaction temperature. Reactions with substituted allenic substrates provide heterocycles with additional stereocenters usually with complete diastereoselectivity. The reaction products were readily transformed further into other complex nitrogen&#8208;containing spirocyclic systems.

         <title>Pentafluorophenyl&#8208;Substituted Proline&#8208;Derived Chiral Urea for &#8220;On Water&#8221; Asymmetric Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysis</title>

Abstract
This work demonstrated the efficacy of a proline&#8208;derived chiral urea for &#8220;on water&#8221; asymmetric hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis by incorporating a hydrophobic and electron&#8208;withdrawing pentafluoro&#8208;phenyl substituent into the urea moiety. When employed as a catalyst, pentafluorophenyl&#8208;substituted proline&#8208;derived chiral urea exhibited significant enhancement of both the reaction rate and stereoselectivity when conducted &#8220;on water&#8221; compared to that of conventional organic solvents due to the hydrophobic hydration effect. Moreover, this catalyst did not display notable self&#8208;aggregation during the &#8220;on water&#8221; hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis and was confirmed to exist as a monomeric species with catalytic activity. Due to its remarkable acceleration in &#8220;on water&#8221; conditions, the catalyst load was significantly reduced. Consequently, complete conversion was achieved at room temperature within 2&#8197;hours while maintaining good enantioselectivities (up to 96% ee) even at 0.2&#8197;mol% catalyst loading in the Michael addition of dithiomalonate to nitrostyrene.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Carboxylic Acids with Disulfides to Access Thioesters</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross coupling reaction of carboxylic acids with disulfides is described. The readily available and inexpensive carboxylic acid is activated in&#8197;situ by the formation of a mixed anhydride. The transformation occurs at room temperature with wide functional group tolerance to efficiently generate structurally diverse thioesters. Moreover, the reaction tolerated a broad substrate scope, including sterically hindered of disulfides. Ultimately, this powerful method could be applied to the late&#8208;stage functionalization for the construction of diverse thioesters, affording a convenient and practical tactic to construct carbon&#8208;sulfur bonds.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Borylation&#8208;Cross Coupling Reaction of Unactivated Alkenes to Borylated Indolines</title>

Abstract
Cu&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular borylation&#8208;cross coupling reaction of alkenes was developed. Racemic and chiral borylated indolines were achieved by borylation&#8208;cross coupling of alkenes with B2pin2 via simultaneous construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;B bonds by Cu/phosphine ligand system. With CuOAc and DPPE ligand, a series of 3&#8208;substituted borylated indoline derivatives were concisely synthesized in good to excellent yields in short time under mild conditions. Asymmetric synthesis was investigated by ligand screening, and the chiral 3&#8208;substituted borylated indoline was obtained in 80% yield and 80:20 er with (R, R)&#8208;Me&#8208;Duphos. Application of 3&#8208;substituted borylated indolines has been demonstrated by a gram scale synthesis and further functionalization.

         <title>Oxidative Aminopyridylation of Maleimides and 1, 4&#8208;Quinones with N&#8208;Aminopyridinium Ylides at Room Temperature in the Absence of External Reagents</title>

Abstract
Herein we have reported an expedient di&#8208;functionalization of such versatile scaffolds. By harnessing an under explored reactivity of N&#8208;aminopyridinium ylides, we have developed an aminopyridylation of N&#8208;substituted maleimides and 1, 4&#8208;quinones at room temperature in 2&#8208;methyl THF without any external reagents. The [3+2] cycloaddition of N&#8208;aminopyridinium ylides generate the corresponding cycloadduct with various maleimides and 1, 4&#8208;quinone substrates, which rapidly undergoes oxidation at the alkene moiety under open air, inducing a considerable driving force, thermodynamically, to facilitate aromatisation of the pyridine and a subsequent homolytic cleavage of the N&#8722;N bond to generate the desired 2, 3&#8208;aminopyridylated products in good to excellent yield. Experimental and computational studies clarify the reaction mechanism.
