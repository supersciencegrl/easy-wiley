         <title>Gram&#8208;scale Access to (3,11)&#8208;Cyclotaxanes &#8211; Synthesis of 1&#8208;Hydroxytaxuspine C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we present the semi&#8208;synthesis of complex taxane diterpenoid 1&#8208;hydroxytaxuspine C. Starting from cheap and abundant 10&#8208;deacetylbaccatin III, a scalable and robust route was developed, enabling an unprecedented gram&#8208;scale access to the intricate (3,11)&#8208;cyclotaxane scaffold. In addition, this represents the first synthetic access to C1&#8208;hydroxylated cyclotaxanes. The natural product is synthesized in 17 steps, with the reactions being performed on decagram&#8208;scale up to an advanced intermediate, establishing the scalability of this approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of fluorine&#8208;free weakly coordinating electrolyte solvents with enhanced oxidative stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High concentrations of conducting salt in electrolyte formulations enhance the agglomeration of ionic species, which has been demonstrated to yield anion&#8208;derived electrode&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphases and improved reversibility in several battery configurations. However, industrial application of these electrolytes may be limited due to high costs of electrolyte conducting salts. Here, weakly solvating electrolyte solvents with tailored coordination strength have been established as an approach to achieve ionic agglomeration at moderate conducting salt concentrations and without per&#8208;fluorinated diluents. However, the inevitable presence of uncoordinated solvent molecules in this electrolyte concept renders them susceptible to oxidative decomposition. Although previous efforts demonstrated fluorination as an effective design strategy to tailor the oxidative stability of weakly solvating electrolytes, the per&#8208;fluorinated solvents are toxic and harmful to the environment. Herein, the incorporation of silicon is evaluated as an eco&#8208;friendly approach to dispel electron density of the oxygen lone pair. Though steric demand of substituents is already sufficient to tailor the coordination strength, negative hyperconjugation effectively expands the oxidative stability limit of weakly solvating electrolytes. Combining ion agglomeration and intrinsic oxidative stability, the herein introduced weakly solvating electrolyte enables a notable improvement of reversibility under eco&#8208;friendly conditions, presenting a valid alternative to fluorinated electrolyte solvents.</dc:description>

         <title>A&#160;Universal Metal Ion&#8208;targeting Coordination Strategy for Precise Synthesis of Heteronuclear Dual&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteronuclear dual&#8208;atoms catalysts (DACs) represent an emerging frontier in heterogeneous catalysis due to maximum atom utilization and synergistic catalysis, yet their precise synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we propose a universal &#8216;metal ion targeting coordination&#8217; (MITC) strategy to construct a series of heteronuclear DACs. This approach utilizes the bipyridyl (bpy) ligands to coordinate a primary metal (M1), forming an artificial monooxygenase (bpy)M1(&#956;2&#8208;OH) structure, where electron&#8208;enriched oxygen atoms serve as anchoring sites for a secondary metal (M2). The oxygen bridged M1&#8208;O&#8208;M2 configurations in the resulting (bpy)M1(&#956;2&#8208;OH)M2 precursors enable precise synthesis of heteronuclear DACs during the subsequent pyrolysis. Benefiting&#160;from geometric and electronic structure merits, heteronuclear DACs can efficiently catalyze oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) through a more desirable dissociative mechanism, thus circumventing the inherent OH*&#8208;OOH* linear scaling relations.&#160;Notably, the FeCo DAC exhibits exceptional ORR performance, with an onset and half&#8208;wave potential of 1.03 V and 0.93 V, respectively. The excellent ORR activity of FeCo DAC is further validated in anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), delivering a peak power density over 1.3&#8201;W&#8201;cm&#8208;2 and a current density of 79.2 mA cm&#8208;2 at 0.9 ViR&#8208;free under H2&#8208;O2 conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Dictating Zn2+ Transport Kinetics via Versatile Ionic Covalent Organic Framework for Robust Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a promising platform in regulating ion transport and stabilizing electrode/electrolyte interfaces owing to their tailorable porosity and versatile moiety. Compared to widely employed neutral COFs, ionic COFs (iCOFs) harness strong electrostatic interactions to selectively interact with target ions, thereby helping accelerate ion&#8208;pair dissociation. Furthermore, the charged backbones of iCOFs induce interlayer electrostatic repulsion, driving spontaneous exfoliation and hence promoting ion transport kinetics. Capitalizing upon these advantages, we in situ engineer a low&#8208;crystallinity iCOF interfacial membrane over Zn anode. The guanidium moieties within the framework immobilize water molecules through H&#8208;bond interactions, effectively suppressing parasitic side reactions. Concurrently, Coulombic interactions between the positively charged backbone and SO42&#8722; facilitate Zn2+ dissociation, enabling stable ion transport and uniform Zn deposition. Benefiting from the improved electrochemical stability of modified Zn anode, the as&#8208;assembled Zn metal pouch cell delivers a reversible capacity of ~0.35 Ah g&#8722;1 with a 98.72% capacity retention over prolonged cycling. This work establishes a paradigm for leveraging iCOFs to regulate Zn2+ transport kinetics toward next&#8208;generation energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Crystalline and Oriented Thin Films of Fully Conjugated 3D&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fully conjugated three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a newly emerged class of materials that expands reticular chemistry to extended electron delocalization for optoelectronic applications. To overcome the limitations of sp3&#8208;connected 3D frameworks, the pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral motif cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh) has gained attention for forming fully conjugated 3D COFs. We report on a novel COTh building block, featuring functional formyl groups directly attached to the core's conjugated thiophenes. The modulation synthesis approach with mono&#8208;functionalized inhibitors enables the formation of COTh&#8208;1P COF, which exhibited remarkable crystallinity and permanent porosity. By following this approach and by optimizing the synthesis conditions to the solvothermal growth of thin films, we fabricated the first preferentially oriented conjugated 3D COF films on various substrates without pre&#8208;functionalization. With these thin films, optical pump terahertz probe studies allowed us, for the first time with 3D&#8208;fully conjugated COFs, to provide insights into the excited state and charge&#8208;carrier dynamics of these unique organic frameworks. Low effective masses are discovered for valence and conduction bands by density functional theory simulations. The ability to create crystalline and oriented films of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D COTh&#8208;based COFs on non&#8208;modified substrates is expected to open the way for integration of such frameworks into diverse optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Twisting Chiral Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Macrocycles into a Microhelix with Boosted Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and assembly of chiral macrocycles remain an underexplored frontier in supramolecular science. In this study, we synthesized a pair of enantiomeric macrocyclic molecules (CP1) through the condensation of chiral cyclohexanediamine with tetraphenylethylene (TPE) dialdehyde. These molecules exhibited remarkable circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties at the supramolecular level. Through supramolecular assembly in mixed solvent systems, we achieved a rare micron&#8208;scale helical structure, exhibiting a high dissymmetry factor (glum) of 0.32&#8212;one of the highest values reported to date for macrocyclic assemblies. Furthermore, by designing a chiral macrocycle with phenyl spacers (CP2), we revealed that the confinement of macrocycles and restricted internal molecular rotation are critical for achieving high glum values and helical structure formation. This work not only advances the design of chiral macrocycles but also provides new insights into the relationship between molecular structure and supramolecular assembly, paving the way for the development of advanced chiral materials with potential applications in optics, sensing, and nanotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Mesoionic Imine&#8208;Carbodiimde (MII&#8208;CDI) Adducts: 1,3 H&#8208;Shift, N(I) Compounds and Guanidinate&#8208;Type Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we report our recent findings on the synthesis and reactivity of a novel 1,2,3&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;imine type mesoionic imine&#8208;carbodiimide (MII&#8208;CDI) adduct. Unlike reported NHC&#8208;CDI adducts, formed by the reactions of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) with CDI, these zwitterionic compounds undergo a spontaneous 1,3 H&#8208;shift, resulting in guanidine&#8208;type compounds. The mechanism of this 1,3&#8208;H shift has been investigated through quantum chemical calculations. The MII&#8208;CDI adduct serves as a valuable synthon for the synthesis of mesoionic carbene&#8208;acyclic diamino carbene (MIC&#8208;ADC)&#8208;based nitreone (N(I)) compounds. We have conducted a detailed investigation into the electronic properties, chemical reactivity, and electrochemical behaviour of these nitreone (N(I)) compounds. Additionally, the potential of these MII&#8208;CDI adducts as guanidinate ligands is explored. Our investigations here display the distinct reactivities of MII in contrast to their N&#8208;heterocyclic imine (NHI) congeners.</dc:description>

         <title>Microscale Tattooing of Hydrogels and Cells: Benzoxaborole&#8208;Driven Microcontact Printing (&#181;CP) on Glycosylated Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microcontact printing (&#181;CP) is a widely used technique for microscale surface patterning. In this study, we present a polymer&#8208;supported &#181;CP method for the patterning of (bioactive) glycosylated surfaces under hydrated conditions. Patterning is achieved by direct contact with a grooved polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp, whose surface was grafted with a dopamine&#8208;containing polymer. The polymer brushes offer an anchor for the boronic acid derivative 6&#8208;aminobenzo[c][1,2]oxaborol&#8208;1(3H)&#8208;ol (ABOB), used as an ink for surface functionalization, to introduce patterns to three different surfaces as substrates: (1) monosaccharide&#8208;modified hydrogel surfaces possessing aldose (glucose, fucose, galactose) or ketose (fructose, sorbose) functions; (2) glycolsylated surfaces of polymeric microspheres; and (3) the membranes of mammalian cells, such as human primary gastric cells and others. During &#181;CP, ABOB patterns transferred to the target surface through the formation of carbohydrate&#8208;ABOB complexes at fully hydrated, neutral pH conditions. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed the successful transfer of ABOB patterns to glycosylated surfaces, with clear "tattoo&#8208;like" signatures observed on hydrogels, glycosylated particle surfaces and cellular interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;driven in&#8208;situ Formation of Bimetallic Catalysts via Sn2+/Sn4+ Interconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bimetallic catalysts have garnered substantial interest across diverse fields due to their distinctive geometric and electronic structures. Nevertheless, achieving uniformly distributed bimetallic catalysts remains challenging due to the solubility or charge properties of ions in specific bimetallic systems. Herein, we present an innovative in&#8208;situ redox&#8208;driven synthesis strategy utilizing Sn2+/Sn4+ interconversion to address these challenges. By immobilizing Sn2+ ions on Al&#8208;deficient alumina and capturing secondary metal ions through redox reactions, we successfully synthesized eight distinct Sn&#8208;M bimetallic catalysts. The representative Sn&#8208;Pt catalysts derived from [PtCl4]2&#8208; or [Pt(NH3)4]2+ ions, lead to the reduction of Pt2+ to Pt0 with analogous local structures, resulting in comparable catalytic performance in carbon monoxide oxidation and propane dehydrogenation. This redox&#8208;driven synthesis strategy can be extended to other bimetallic systems, with promising preliminary results observed in Cr&#8208;M systems. This innovative strategy effectively mitigates the hydrolysis of tin ions, neutralizes the influence of ion charges, and addresses the solubility challenges of secondary metal ions, providing a robust solution for the design of bimetallic catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Ammonia Synthesis via Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction Using Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Dual&#8208;Atomic Cu Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The potential application prospects of green electricity&#8208;driven electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (NO&#8323;RR) technology for the production of valuable ammonia have garnered widespread attention. However, designing electrocatalysts with remarkable activity and stability for the NO&#8323;RR to realize gram&#8208;level ammonia production remains a significant hurdle in terms of practical application. In nature, the synergistic effect of the dual&#8208;sites copper of nitrite reductase promotes the substrate adsorption and protonation, achieving efficient conversion of nitrite. Herein, enzyme&#8208;inspired Cu dual&#8208;atomic sites are constructed on polymeric carbon nitride (PCN&#8208;Cu&#8208;DAC). Systematic investigations indicate the dual&#8208;atomic Cu sites in the catalyst exhibits stronger proton transfer and synergistic nitrate adsorption interaction, thereby reducing the energy barrier for *NO protonation. Studies have shown that the PCN&#8208;Cu&#8208;DAC catalyst presents a remarkable ammonia (NH&#8323;) yield (467 mg h&#8208;1 mg&#8208;1 cat. and 102 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2) and achieves an 11 g d&#8208;1 NH3&#160;yield at 6 A of current for 360 h. This work demonstrates the concept of mimicking natural nitrite reductase toward the continuous reduction of nitrate wastewater and promotes the production of NH3.</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Adapted Active Site Self&#8208;Evolving Reconfiguration Boosting Catalytic Effect on Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The facile synthesis of highly substrate&#8208;adapted catalysts with dynamic active site adaptability remains a persistent challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, breaking through conventional catalyst preparation route of design&#8211;synthesis&#8211;evaluation iteration, we demonstrate an active site self&#8208;evolving reconfiguration strategy for spontaneous construction an adaptive multimolecular activation catalyst, such as for acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation. Specifically, a metastable Cu single atom (Cu1) precursor as structural seed reconstructs to an exceptional acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation catalyst under moderate operational conditions, which undergoes a copper active site reconfiguration employing reactants themselves as inducing medium. This self&#8208;evolving reconfiguration creates cooperative Cu1 and Cu nanocluster (Cun) ensemble sites with a dynamic active configuration, which is unavailable by conventional thermal reduction methodology, for adaptive multi&#8208;substrate H2 and acetylene activation. Hence, the resulting catalyst achieves full acetylene conversion with 96% ethylene selectivity and robust durability (&gt;30 h) at a record&#8208;low temperature of 120 &#176;C, superior to reported copper&#8208;based analogues. Such spontaneous active site self&#8208;evolving reconfiguration offers a new possibility for intelligent catalyst engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>A Strong and Tough Thermosetting Epoxy Resin for Recyclable High&#8208;Performance Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Epoxy&#8208;based carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced composites (EP&#8208;CFRCs) are appealing for engineering applications due to their exceptional specific strength and modulus. Nevertheless, the intrinsic brittleness and limited recyclability of highly cross&#8208;linked epoxy matrices pose significant challenges to their sustainable development. Herein, we present an approach combining dynamic ester bonds with semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer networks (SIPNs) to overcome these challenges. This strategy leverages the crosslinked epoxy network to resist deformation, while hydrogen bonds and entangled SIPNs to facilitate energy dissipation, enhancing both strength and toughness. The resultant epoxy matrix exhibits superior tensile strength of 123 MPa and record&#8208;breaking impact strength of 52.3 kJ m&#8208;2, effectively overcoming the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between strength and toughness in thermosets. This balanced performance renders it a promising matrix for high&#8208;performance EP&#8208;CFRCs, which display a tensile strength of 718&#8239;MPa and a bending deflection of 0.59&#8239;mm. Moreover, the embedded tertiary amines accelerate transesterification reactions, enabling closed&#8208;loop recycling of EP&#8208;CFRCs in water. The recycled carbon fibers and the degraded matrix can be reused in new composites and adhesives. This work presents a simple yet effective strategy for designing epoxy resin&#8208;based composites that overcome the limitations of traditional matrices and support the development of recyclable advanced materials for diverse industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying the Role of Pt Active Species in CO&#8208;Sensitive Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum (Pt) has been widely employed in photocatalytic H2 production. However, the influence of CO on proton reduction to H2 over Pt active species remains unknown. Herein, using Pt/Nb2O5 as a model catalyst, the role of Pt active species in CO&#8208;sensitive photocatalytic H2 evolution is evaluated. Our results reveal that Pt4+ species exhibits superior activity in H2 production when the CO&#8208;to&#8208;Pt molar ratio is low (nCO/nPt &#8804; 1.3), but their photocatalytic performance is suppressed at a high nCO/nPt ratio (&gt; 1000). By contrast, increasing the loading amount of Pt suppresses Pt4+ species formation and the low valence state Pt species shows inferior activity for H2 production, which is almost unaffected by the nCO/nPt ratio. The CO&#8208;TPD results, in situ FTIR spectra, and DFT calculations indicate that the role of adsorbed CO molecules is to impede the interaction between H2O and Pt4+ species and prevent the generation of *H species for H2 production. Significantly improving the H2 production rate by purging with argon suggests the importance of inhibiting the adsorption of CO on Pt4+ species. This study sheds light on the generation and transformation of active H species in CO&#8208;participated photocatalytic systems, which is missing in previous works.</dc:description>

         <title>Complex Donuts: Small Variations in DNA Sequence Dictate Pathway Complexity in DNA Nanotoroids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of higher&#8208;order structures in natural biopolymers like polypeptides and nucleic acids is governed by sequence specificity and monomer chemistry. Nucleic acids can assemble into programmable nanostructures through base&#8208;pairing interactions, but their chemical diversity is limited to four nucleobases. DNA amphiphiles address this by introducing orthogonal interactions through non&#8208;nucleosidic modifications. These amphiphiles self&#8208;assemble into diverse morphologies, such as spheres, fibers, or nanosheets, with closely packed, parallel DNA strands on their exterior. This unusual arrangement creates emergent properties absent in simple DNA strands. Here, we show that the precise sequence of single&#8208;stranded DNA, independent of base&#8208;pairing, can program the self&#8208;assembled morphology of DNA amphiphiles. Remarkably, small sequence variations induce the formation of non&#8208;equilibrium DNA nanotoroids, rather than conventional morphologies. The nanotoroids form as on&#8208;pathway structures via a competitive mechanism, only when a toroid&#8208;selective DNA sequence is used. They can be stabilized non&#8208;covalently by a small molecule cross&#8208;linker or co&#8208;assembly with a secondary DNA amphiphile. Molecular dynamics demonstrated the dependence of toroid formation on the structure of the end&#8208;p stacking unit. This work introduces a new class of DNA&#8208;based nanotoroid materials with assembly properties controlled by unique sequences, akin to proteins, for applications in cell delivery, nano&#8208;filtration, nanoreactors, and materials templation.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Assembly of B(III)&#8208;Coordinated Fluorophores with Quantitatively Predictable Photoinduced Electron Transfer for Chemosensing and Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinduced electron transfer (PeT), a foundational mechanism for constructing stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent probes, faces persistent challenges including the lack of generalizable quantitative models, limited systematic case studies, signal interference, and synthetic complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a boron&#8208;centric PeT molecular engineering strategy that harnesses the unique tetrahedral coordination geometry of B(III) centers. This approach leverages the programmable nature of boron coordination chemistry to precisely tailor &#8211;dye electronic energy levels and photophysical properties. Using dipyrromethane as a core scaffold and modulating boronic acid coordination with diverse nucleophiles (such as alcohols, phenols, and carboxylic acids), we developed a modular, multicomponent one&#8208;pot synthesis platform for efficient assembly of B&#8208;PeT dyes. Extending this strategy to pyrrolyldipyrrin and dipyrrolyldipyrrin scaffolds achieved the synthesis of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) B&#8208;PeT dyes. A library of 75 B(III)&#8208;derivatives was synthesized and characterized to enable systematic elucidation and predictive modeling of structure&#8208;PeT activity relationships, providing mechanistic insights to guide mitigation of PeT signal interference. The engineered B&#8208;PeT probes exhibit superior performance in photoactivated imaging and lysosomal pH sensing, highlighting their translational potential. Our work establishes boron coordination chemistry as a modular toolkit for rational PeT probe design, offering scalable molecular platforms for next&#8208;generation sensors with enhanced functionality and synthetic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting CO2 Fixation into Dimethyl Carbonate via Multiple Active Sites Constituted by VO&#8208;Ce&#8208;O Vacancy Clusters on Single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell CeO2&#160;Nano&#8208;sheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The thermodynamic stability and intrinsic kinetic inertia of CO2 present a critical challenge for its effective activation in the synthesis of high&#8208;value dimethyl carbonate (DMC). In this work, we report the fabrication of novel O&#8208;Ce&#8208;O vacancy clusters (VO&#8208;Ce&#8208;O) incorporated into CeO2&#160;nano&#8208;sheets with a near single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell thickness to construct atomically adjacent multiple active sites on their surfaces. These active sites significantly enhance the activation of both CO2 and CH3OH. Impressively, the as&#8208;prepared CeO2&#160;with&#160;VO&#8208;Ce&#8208;O&#160;catalyst exhibits an excellent DMC yield of 31.2 mmol/g, surpassing previously reported Ce&#8208;based catalysts under equivalent reaction conditions. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that oxygen vacancy increases the reducibility of lattice oxygen, facilitating CO2 activation, while cerium vacancies weaken the *CH3O adsorption, promoting the coupling reaction between *CH3O and *CO2 to form the intermediate (*CH3OC(O)2). Notably, the formation of vacancy clusters reduces the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;controlled step (*CH3OC(O)2 dissociation to *CH3OCO), thereby boosting the DMC yield.&#160;Our new findings provide valuable insights into surface engineering and active site modulation of cerium&#8208;based catalysts, offering a viable pathway for green resource utilization of CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Structure Modulation of Nb2O5 by Ru Single Atoms Enabling Efficient Hydrogen Storage of Magnesium Hydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is a promising solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage material due to its high capacity and low cost, but its high dehydrogenation temperature and poor kinetic limits its applications. Although catalytic modification of MgH2 has been extensively studied, existing efforts focus on optimizing hydrogen transfer, with limited exploration of electron transfer and transport. This study investigated the enhancement of electron transfer and transport rates during MgH2 de/hydrogenation by introducing a single&#8208;atom catalyst composed of Ru single atoms on a Nb2O5 substrate. The Ru0.028@Nb2O5 single&#8208;atom catalyst reduced the peak dehydrogenation temperature of MgH2 from 429 to 214 &#176;C, and the activation energies for de/hydrogenation were reduced by 53.7% and 83.9%, respectively. Furthermore, the 15wt%&#8208;Ru0.028@Nb2O5&#8208;MgH2 composite maintained 97.4% capacity after 100 cycles. Based on excellent performance and theoretical calculations, it was demonstrated that the electronic structure modulation of Nb2O5 by Ru single atoms enhanced the electron transfer and transport capacities, and the synergistic effects of single&#8208;atom Ru (dominant role), multivalent Nb, and oxygen vacancies resulted in remarkable catalytic activity. This study offers a new strategy for improving electron transfer and transport by modulating the electronic structure of catalysts, thereby increasing&#8232;catalytic activity during the solid&#8208;state pyrolysis reaction of hydrogen storage materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Biosensing of Drug&#8208;Induced Cell&#8208;Heterogeneous Injuries with an Ultrahigh Turn&#8208;On Ratio</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence probes of reactive oxygen species in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral region, i.e., 800 nm and beyond, are desired for in vivo biosensing, diagnosis and pharmacology. However, the NIR dyes are typically prone to oxidative destruction, and the probes based on these dyes exhibit a poor fluorescence turn&#8208;on ratio and a low detection sensitivity. EC5 is a bright and stable NIR fluorochromic scaffold and yet has not been exploited for probe design. Despite the structural analogy of EC5 to xanthene dyes, the classic spiro&#8208;cyclization at the central methine carbon was surprisingly not applicable to EC5. Here, we report the rational development of a novel probe design strategy for EC5 dye, i.e., asymmetric conjugative addition at the vinylogous&#8208;methine carbon. EC5&#8208;H3via this approach is a robust probe for highly oxidative species. Its merits include an ultrahigh turn&#8208;on ratio of ca. 200&#8208;fold, and high resistance of the detection product toward ONOO&#8208;&#8208;mediated destruction. The feasibility of EC5&#8208;H3 for practical applications was showcased by in vivo biosensing of APAP&#8208;induced oxidative injuries to the liver. The high turn&#8208;on ratio and high brightness of the probe allow tissue injuries to be imaged with confocal microscopy to reveal the heterogeneity in oxidative injuries to different liver cells.</dc:description>

Here, we report the rational development of a novel probe design strategy for EC5 dye, i.e., asymmetric conjugative addition at the vinylogous-methine carbon. EC5-H3via this approach is a robust probe for highly oxidative species. Its merits include an ultrahigh turn-on ratio of ca. 200-fold, and high resistance of the detection product toward ONOO--mediated destruction. The feasibility of EC5-H3 for practical applications was showcased by in vivo biosensing of APAP-induced oxidative injuries to the liver. The high turn-on ratio and high brightness of the probe allow tissue injuries to be imaged with confocal microscopy to reveal the heterogeneity in oxidative injuries to different liver cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decoding Double Layer Dynamics for CO2${\rm CO}_2$ Electroreduction over Cu</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different regions of the electrode/electrolyte interface, such as the interfacial layer and diffuse double layer, are spectroscopically discerned by analyzing multi&#8208;dimensional time&#8208;variance within a matrix of time&#8208;resolved infrared spectra. In this way, discrete events relating to reorientation of water molecules in the double layer are elucidated, which correlate with the rapid adsorption and conversion of CO2${\rm CO}_2$ to CO.








Abstract
Understanding the nature and role of the electric double layer (EDL) at electrocatalytic interfaces and its dynamic evolution, is critical to optimizing electrochemical processes such as the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR${\rm CO}_2{\rm RR}$). Despite its postulated significant influence on CO2RR${\rm CO}_2{\rm RR}$ activity, direct spectroscopic evidence of the complex interplay between EDL structure and reaction kinetics has remained elusive. Here, we introduce Dynamic Response Spectroscopy (DRS), a novel approach that isolates spectroscopic signatures of key physicochemical features of the EDL, including the compact (interfacial) layer and the diffuse double layer based on their time&#8208;variance profiles. By analyzing multi&#8208;dimensional time&#8208;variance within a matrix of time&#8208;resolved infrared spectral data recorded during sequential potential steps, we reveal that EDL equilibration is not continuous but involves discrete restructuring events. We provide spectroscopic evidence that these sudden EDL reorganizations correlate with the rapid adsorption and conversion of CO2${\rm CO}_2$ to CO. Furthermore, we show that saturation of aqueous NaHCO3 electrolytes with CO2${\rm CO}_2$, as opposed to Ar, induces more frequent and pronounced water reorientation in the diffuse double layer, characterized by less ice&#8208;like ordering and increased randomness. These findings provide novel insights into the dynamic nature of the EDL and its synergistic role in electrocatalysis, establishing a paradigm to better understand, and thus optimize, electrochemical&#160;systems.

         <title>Catalytic Activation of Acceptor&#8208;Acceptor Bicyclobutanes Enabled by Lewis Base Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the advent of various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies, the utilization of donor&#8208;acceptor bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) as a three&#8208;atom component in (3+X) cycloaddition reactions has emerged as a highly efficient platform for constructing saturated bicyclic scaffolds that can serve as arene bioisosteres. However, the application of Lewis base catalysis in such reactions remains underexplored, and the strategy for the cycloaddition of acceptor&#8211;acceptor BCBs remains unknown. Herein, we report the first formal (4+2) cycloaddition of acceptor&#8211;acceptor BCBs, which serve as a four&#8722;atom component, for the selective synthesis of pharmaceutically valuable oxa&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes (oxa&#8208;BCHeps) enabled by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. BCBs and carbonyl compounds, such as aldehydes and ketones, with various functional groups, are well&#8208;tolerated under mild conditions, yielding oxa&#8208;BCHeps with up to 87% yield, competing with at least 5 side reactions. The versatility of this synthetic method is further demonstrated through derivatization of the (4+2) cycloadducts and late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals. The reaction mechanism and the origins of the chemoselectivity were investigated by means of density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Spring&#8208;Like Behavior in [8]Helicene Diimides: How Helical Pitch Governs Optical Anisotropy and Electronic Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helicenes, with their corkscrew&#8208;shaped geometry, have emerged as prototypical molecular springs for engineering chiral functional materials through precise structural modulation. Here we introduce the design and synthesis of [8]helicene diimides ([8]HDIs) and demonstrate that the helical pitch of their backbone can be precisely tuned by bridging the imide nitrogen atoms with alkyl chains of varying lengths (C3&#8211;C6). This approach constrains the molecular geometry to systematically control optical anisotropy, chiroptical response, and electronic communication. Remarkably, modulation of the helical pitch leads to high optical dissymmetry factors (up to 6.0&#8239;&#215;&#8239;10&#8722;2) and enhanced through&#8208;space conjugation. Furthermore, we investigate how variations in the helical pitch affect crystal packing in both enantiopure and racemic samples. Complementary quantum chemical calculations provide insights into the origins of these properties, highlighting the potential of this strategy for designing advanced chiral materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Type&#8208;I&#160;photodynamic agents can not only produce cytotoxic reactive oxygen species, but also directly damage biomolecules through electron/hydrogen transfer process, exhibiting reduced dependence on oxygen concentration in photodynamic therapy (PDT). The rational design of Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents has attracted increasing attention. This minireview provides a comprehensive overview of Type&#8208;I PDT and its advantages in treating hypoxic tumors. It systematically outlines two complementary design strategies: (i) thermodynamic modulation through molecular engineering to block the Type&#8208;II energy transfer pathway, and (ii) kinetic enhancement of electron/hydrogen transfer to favor the Type&#8208;I mechanism. Finally, key challenges in Type&#8208;I PDT are discussed, and future perspectives are highlighted to facilitate the clinical translation of Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents. We hope this review will stimulate further progress in the development of innovative PDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Mediated Charge Transfer Regulation of Inner Core Clusters in Hybrid Copper(I)&#8208;Based Halides for High&#8208;Efficiency X&#8208;ray Scintillation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu(I)&#8208;based metal halides have gained significant interests as scintillators. However, their X&#8208;ray luminescence efficiency is mainly determined by the competition between radiative organic ligands and nonradiative metal cluster&#8208;centered charge transfer. How to regulate their charge transfer pathways to enhance radiative emission is intractable challenge. Here, guided by coordination dynamics, we present a solvent mediation strategy to modulate coordination environments and intramolecular charge transfer of organic cuprous halides to achieve vibrant emissions. Mechanistic studies reveal that the coordinated clusters can efficiently absorb radiation ionization to generate electron&#8208;hole pairs and transferred to ligands for enhanced luminescence. Conversely, ligand&#8208;free structures exhibit an absence of organic&#8208;ligand&#8208;related excited states upon excitation, leading to luminescence quenching. Due to optimized metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer dynamics, 5 times enhancement of emission efficiency was achieved with a peak photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 82.14%. Correspondingly, radioluminescence was significantly improved to 2.22 and 10 times greater than that of (Lu,Y)2SiO5:Ce&#160;(LYSO)&#160;and C6H18N2Cu2Br4&#160;with a high light yield of 73881 photons/MeV (C12H28N4Cu2I2) and excellent photochemical stability. A high X&#8208;ray imaging resolution of 9.7 lp/mm was also demonstrated by the soft C12H28N4Cu2I2 screen even with the thickness of 30 &#956;m. Our study provides a solvent&#8208;mediated ligand engineering of copper halide cluster scintillators.</dc:description>

A high X-ray imaging resolution of 9.7 lp/mm was also demonstrated by the soft C12H28N4Cu2I2 screen even with the thickness of 30 &#956;m. Our study provides a solvent-mediated ligand engineering of copper halide cluster scintillators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mediating Solid Electrolyte Interphase Formation Kinetics on SiOx&#160;Anodes Using Proton Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon&#8208;based anodes offer high energy density but suffer from significant volume variations, leading to an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). To enhance SEI stability, numerous electrolyte additives have been designed to decompose on the anode and form desirable SEI components (e.g., LiF). However, their electrochemical reduction kinetics on the anode surface compete with other electrolyte components, leading to suboptimal interfacial decomposition efficiency and a less stable SEI structure. Here, inspired by bioremediation strategies in petroleum pollution treatment, we introduce a proton acceptor that reacts with fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), a commercially established additive, to generate an intermediate. Such an intermediate lowers the reduction kinetic barrier, accelerating the formation of LiF and enriching it in the inner layer of the SEI. Compared to the randomly distributed LiF structure, the resulting SEI exhibits better mechanical stability and lithium&#8208;ion conduction, effectively accommodating volume changes and mitigating stress concentration caused by local overlithiation. As a result, the electrochemical performance surpasses that of previously reported works. This intermediate&#8208;based strategy significantly improves the utilization efficiency of commercial additives, offering a practical direction for future electrolyte design.</dc:description>

         <title>HCl Intake via Nanobubbles Induces Redox Radicals for Aqueous Cl2 and H2 Production without Catalyst and Bias Applied</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bubbling is a widely used method to enhance gas hydration and dissolution in aqueous solutions. Understanding the bubble&#8208;induced interface&#8208;rich aqueous system is crucial for elucidating gas&#8208;involved solution chemical reactions, yet this area remains underexplored. Here we report the formation of aqueous Cl2 and H2 driven by nanobubbles, achieved by introducing redox&#8208;active HCl gas through a gas diffusion electrode without applying bias or loading catalysts. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) revealed that increasing HCl intake elevates the concentration of hydroxyl radical (&#10625;OH) and hydrated electrons (e&#8208;aq), more than an order of magnitude higher than that of feeding Ar alone. High&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry identified spin&#8208;trapping agent stabilized radical intermediates, including &#10625;Cl, ClO&#10625; and &#10625;H. Iodometric titration estimated the equivalent Cl2 content at approximately 18 mmol/L, while gas chromatography verified H2 formation. This study demonstrates that bubbling redox&#8208;active gases through aqueous solution can activate water reactivity, leading to the conversion of the gases themselves.</dc:description>

         <title>Fortification of FeS Clusters Reshapes Anaerobic CO Dehydrogenase into an Air&#8208;Viable Enzyme Through Multilayered Sealing of O2 Tunnels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fortification of FeS clusters in Ni&#9472;Fe CO dehydrogenase (Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans) reshapes this anaerobic enzyme into an air&#8208;viable variant through multilayered O2 tunnel sealing. The engineered enzyme retains structural integrity and catalytic efficiency in ambient air, offering a practical solution for industrial CO/CO2 bioconversion processes without the need for strict anaerobic conditions.








Abstract
The inherent O2 sensitivity of Ni&#9472;Fe carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs), crucial for rapid CO to CO2 interconversion, presents substantial challenges for industrial application. Transforming CO/CO2, a prevalent anthropogenic air pollutant, into valuable carbon chemicals either directly or through intermediate steps via biocatalytic methods offers a promising pathway to achieve net&#8208;zero emissions across industries and the environment. However, completely eliminating oxygen from industrial biotransformations, especially under ambient conditions, is exceedingly onerous. Here, we engineered variants of the CODH2 from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans (ChCODH2) with dual blocking at both the O2 entrance and near the active site, effectively sealing the tunnel against atmospheric O2 levels (20%). The O2&#8208;tunnel engineered A559W/V610H variant demonstrated a marked improvement in air stability, with a half&#8208;life of 24.6&#160;h compared to the wild type's 2.4&#160;h. Crystallographic snapshots of this air&#8208;viable variant after 24&#160;h of exposure revealed the robust integrity of the fortified FeS and NiFeS clusters. Additionally, electro&#8208;enzymatic reactions corroborated its CO/CO2 conversion capability even in ubiquitous air. These findings, which address the O2 sensitivity of anaerobic enzymes caused by O2&#8208;induced metal cluster collapse, enhance their potential for biological CO/CO2 transformations in O2&#8208;rich environments, thereby broadening their industrial viability and applicability.

         <title>Breaking Bonds at Tin(II): Reductive or Oxidative Addition?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Typically, the addition of a chemical bond to a metal centre is assumed&#9472;without question&#9472;to be an oxidative process. Here, through studies of bond addition to tin(II), we reveal a spectrum ranging from &#8216;oxidative&#8217; (Cl&#9472;Cl) to &#8216;reductive&#8217; (Be&#9472;Be) processes, with other bonds (B&#9472;B, B&#9472;H, H&#9472;H) falling between these two extremes.








Abstract
Here, the addition of H&#9472;H, Be&#9472;Be, B&#9472;B, and B&#9472;H bonds to SnII is studied by experimental and theoretical means. We report the first examples of B&#9472;B and Be&#9472;Be bond additions to a main group metal centre, along with the first example of borazine B&#9472;H bond addition to any element of the Periodic Table. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that the classification of these reactions as prototypical &#8220;oxidative&#8221; addition processes may be misleading and that a more nuanced description is warranted.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Assisted Nonradiative Processes to Couple Photothermy and Photosensitization for Solar&#8208;Driven Water Evaporation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical&#8208;assisted multiple nonradiative (NR) processes have been achieved to couple 85.05% photothermal conversion and type&#8208;I photosensitization with superoxide anion (O2&#8226;&#8722;) generation based on a well&#8208;designed near&#8208;infrared&#8208;absorbing diradical&#8208;featured croconium (CR) dendrimer, CR&#8208;(DPA)2&#8208;OMe, through &#8220;N&#8208;CR&#8221; molecular engineering strategy, bringing about a water evaporation efficiency of 92.6% and antibacterial efficacy under one sunlight for solar&#8208;driven water evaporation.








Abstract
Nonradiative (NR) processes are pivotal in engineering materials with tailored properties for energy utilization. However, their intrinsic rapidity and competitiveness pose huge challenges in on&#8208;demand manipulation. Herein, radical&#8208;assisted multiple NR processes were achieved to couple photothermy and photosensitization based on a unique near&#8208;infrared&#8208;absorbing diradical&#8208;featured croconium (CR) dendrimer, CR&#8208;(DPA)2&#8208;OMe. This dendrimer is well&#8208;designed by the direct covalent linkage between the flexible dendritic diphenylamine (DPA) and rigid diradical&#8208;featured CR units. The intrinsic diradical characteristics promote internal conversions in company with intramolecular donor&#8211;acceptor interactions, and the hyperfine coupling effect between the dimeric radical&#8208;ion pair excitons and adjacent magnetic nuclei assists intersystem crossing. Besides, the abundant intramolecular motions from the twisted and flexible dendritic diphenylamine groups facilitate vibrational relaxation and electron transfer. These processes endow CR&#8208;(DPA)2&#8208;OMe with a photothermal conversion efficiency of 85.05% and superoxide anion generation capability under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation. Thus, a water evaporation efficiency of 92.6% and antibacterial efficacy under one sunlight are obtained, comprehensively superior to previously reported organic small&#8208;molecule photothermal materials for solar&#8208;driven water evaporation. These findings highlight the importance of radicals in NR process manipulation, significantly boosting the development of organic functional materials with on&#8208;demand excited&#8208;state energy conversions.

         <title>Unveiling Roles of Nonradical Electron&#8208;Donation Pathway in Peroxymonosulfate Activation for Boosted Interfacial Radical Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study revealed a previously overlooked synergy between radical and nonradical pathway in Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Key findings included dual electron migration paths for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation: besides the electron provided by Co centers, donated electrons from nonradical participated in PMS activation. This synergy boosted reactive species generation and utilization by shortening radical attack distances.








Abstract
In conventional studies, radicals and nonradicals were often considered independent mechanisms for organic pollutant oxidation, with their potential interaction between radicals and nonradicals largely overlooked in Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Herein, Cu&#8208;Co3O4 catalysts (x&#160;wt% Cu&#8208;Co3O4/OVs) featuring bifunctional bonding centers were fabricated, which enabled simultaneous co&#8208;capture of electron&#8208;rich contaminants and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) at their interfaces. The optimized 0.75&#160;wt% Cu&#8208;Co3O4/OVs demonstrated exceptional efficiencies in degrading diverse micropollutants through synergistic oxidation pathways involving radicals and nonradical electron transfer process (ETP). Significantly, we found the unique dual electron migration pathways for PMS activation during synergistic oxidation process: besides the electron donation from Co centers, electron could be migrated via ETP from micropollutants to Co sites via heteroatomic Cu, serving as additional electron source for assisting PMS activation. In addition, synergistic oxidation pathways not only enhanced the generation of reactive species but also improved their utilization efficiency by shortening the migration distance of radicals. Such system exhibited remarkable long&#8208;term stability (up to 16&#160;h) in wastewater treatment, with its environmental applicability further validated through life cycle assessment and bio&#8208;experiments. This work uncovered a previously unrecognized synergistic interaction between radical and nonradical pathways, offering new insights into the interfacial radical&#8208;mediated oxidation behavior for advanced wastewater remediation.

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Identification of an Activity Selector for the Nitroso&#8208;Forming Activity in Bacterial Type&#8208;III Copper Enzymes</title>

         <dc:description>
Enzyme specificity defines function: aminophenol oxidase uniquely converts aminophenols into nitrosophenols, whereas tyrosinase transforms them into quinone imines. This distinction is governed by a key amino acid near the copper(A) active site. In their Research Article (e202501560), Annette Rompel et&#160;al. demonstrated that a single amino acid exchange&#8212;swapping asparagine in SgGriF with isoleucine in SzTYR&#8212;can effectively invert the enzymes&#8217; functions.

         <title>Accelerated Exciton Dissociation and Charge Transfer via Third&#8208;Motif Engineered Conjugated Polymers for Photocatalytic Circulation&#8208;flow Synthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for improved electronic properties in linear conjugated polymers was presented through the modulation of an engineered third component. Optimization of the third component significantly lowers exciton binding energy, enlarges molecular dipole moment, lowers the *OOH binding energy and creates multidirectional electron transport channels, collectively boosting the solar&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 conversion efficiency.








Abstract
Achieving effective exciton dissociation and charge transport in linear polymer photocatalysts for H2O2 photosynthesis remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we fabricated three&#8208;motif cross&#8208;linked polymers by rationally introducing a third functional component into a two&#8208;motif linear polymer, which were employed for circulation&#8208;flow photocatalytic H2O2 production. By strategically modulating the third component, we precisely tuned the electronic structure, significantly lowering exciton binding energy and enlarging the molecular dipole moment. Compared to the original linear configuration, the resulting cross&#8208;linked structure creates multidirectional electron transport channels. Combined experimental and calculation investigations demonstrate that these synergistic effects collectively promote exciton dissociation and intramolecular electron transfer. PAQ&#8208;TABPB photocatalyst with optimized third&#8208;motif accelerates oxygen&#8208;to&#8208;superoxide radical transformation by lowering the *OOH binding energy, thereby facilitating the two&#8208;step single&#8208;electron oxygen reduction pathway, attaining an exceptional H2O2 production rate of 3351&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Notably, we constructed a circulation&#8208;flow reactor for the photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2. Benefiting from improved gas&#8208;liquid mass transfer and efficient light irradiation, this high&#8208;speed flow system achieved a 5.2&#8208;fold increase in H2O2 production compared to a conventional batch reactor under the light intensity of 27&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, reaching an accumulated yield of 3125&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 with stable recyclability. This work highlights the potential of multi&#8208;component polymeric photocatalysts and circulation&#8208;flow reactors for H2O2 photosynthesis.

         <title>Engineering a Multifunctional Nanozyme Platform for Synergistic Melanoma Therapy: Integrating Enzyme Activity, Immune Activation, and Low&#8208;Temperature Photothermal Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study innovatively develops a multifunctional, multienzyme&#8208;active nanoplatform (FeCP@PDA&#8208;GOx), aimed at overcoming the limitations of traditional cancer therapies and achieving precise, efficient, and long&#8208;lasting melanoma treatment. By integrating starvation therapy, CDT, mPTT, and immunotherapy, FeCP@PDA&#8208;GOx generates a multidimensional synergistic effect while inducing ferroptosis in tumor cells. With the enzyme activities of POD, OXD, CAT, and GOx, this system significantly improves the TME and further enhances its catalytic performance through a positive feedback mechanism, thereby increasing the overall therapeutic efficacy.








Abstract
Melanoma is characterized by rapid growth and high invasiveness, resulting in an exceptionally high malignancy and a significant propensity for metastasis. Current therapeutic modalities, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, exhibit limited efficacy due to severe side effects and immunosuppressive effects. Consequently, the development of precise and effective integrated therapeutic strategies is of paramount importance. Here, we report a multifunctional and multienzyme active nanosystem (FeCP@PDA&#8208;GOx) that synergistically integrates starvation therapy, chemodynamic therapy, mild photothermal therapy (mPTT), and immunotherapy to achieve multidimensional therapeutic effects. This nanoplatform harnesses the enzymatic activities of glucose oxidase, peroxidase, oxidase, and catalase to enhance tumor microenvironment modulation and drug delivery efficiency, ultimately inducing ferroptosis in tumor cells. The system also establishes a positive feedback loop to further amplify its catalytic performance. Additionally, it effectively suppresses the expression of heat shock proteins in tumor cells, thereby augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of mPTT. Moreover, the system activates robust immune responses, suppressing lung metastasis and eliciting systemic antitumor effects to inhibit the growth of distal tumors. Experimental results demonstrate that this multifunctional nanoplatform exhibits exceptional therapeutic efficacy and safety in melanoma treatment, laying a solid foundation for the advancement of personalized medicine and intelligent therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Promoting the Rate Performances of Weakly Solvating Electrolyte&#8208;Based Lithium&#8210;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weakly solvating electrolyte&#8208;based lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries exhibit poor rate performances due to intrinsic sluggish kinetics of polysulfide oxidation to elemental sulfur with high activation polarization and reduced electron transfer number. A redox mediation strategy is proposed to promote elemental sulfur deposition and achieve high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;rate lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their theoretical energy density of 2600&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. Employing weakly solvating electrolyte (WSE) effectively alleviates the polysulfide shuttle effect and improves the cycling lifespan. However, the sulfur cathode kinetics in WSE is highly sluggish to render degraded rate performances. Herein, the sulfur cathode kinetics of WSE&#8208;based Li&#8211;S batteries is systematically investigated to help promote the rate performances in practical pouch cells. Concretely, the sluggish cathode kinetics of the previous charging process is identified as the main limitation for specific discharge capacity loss at high rates. Further polarization decoupling manifests activation polarization corresponding to polysulfide oxidation to elemental sulfur constitutes the dominant kinetic challenge. Accordingly, a redox mediation strategy is proposed to accelerate the charge&#8208;transfer kinetics of polysulfide oxidation in WSE. 3 Ah&#8208;level pouch cells cycle stably under a high rate of 0.2 C, and 5 Ah level pouch cells achieve an actual energy density of 470&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. This work deepens the comprehension of the sulfur cathode kinetics in WSE and highlights the redox mediation strategy in achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;rate Li&#8211;S batteries.

A redox mediation strategy is proposed to promote elemental sulfur deposition and achieve high-energy-density and high-rate lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are promising next-generation energy storage devices due to their theoretical energy density of 2600&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Employing weakly solvating electrolyte (WSE) effectively alleviates the polysulfide shuttle effect and improves the cycling lifespan. However, the sulfur cathode kinetics in WSE is highly sluggish to render degraded rate performances. Herein, the sulfur cathode kinetics of WSE-based Li&#8211;S batteries is systematically investigated to help promote the rate performances in practical pouch cells. Concretely, the sluggish cathode kinetics of the previous charging process is identified as the main limitation for specific discharge capacity loss at high rates. Further polarization decoupling manifests activation polarization corresponding to polysulfide oxidation to elemental sulfur constitutes the dominant kinetic challenge. Accordingly, a redox mediation strategy is proposed to accelerate the charge-transfer kinetics of polysulfide oxidation in WSE. 3 Ah-level pouch cells cycle stably under a high rate of 0.2 C, and 5 Ah level pouch cells achieve an actual energy density of 470&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work deepens the comprehension of the sulfur cathode kinetics in WSE and highlights the redox mediation strategy in achieving high-energy-density and high-rate Li&#8211;S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Benzaldoxime Synthesis by Glutathione&#8208;Modified CdS Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the secondary coordination sphere of nitrite reductase, the integration of quantum dots and glutathione (GSH) relays realizes photocatalytic benzaldoxime synthesis for the first time. GSH not only expedites hole transfer to enable selective benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde but also favors proton transfer to deliver NH2OH. The synergic orchestration of distinct chemical processes within a single reaction system paves way to valuable nitrogenous chemicals.








Abstract
Inspired by the secondary coordination sphere of nitrite reductase, we report herein the first photocatalytic benzaldoxime synthesis from NOx&#8722; (x&#160;=&#160;2,&#160;3) and benzyl alcohol. Different from introducing co&#8208;catalysts, the integration of glutathione (GSH) relay with CdS quantum dots (QDs) can effectively mediate hole transfer and facilitate selective benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde. At the same time, GSH assists continuous proton transfer to promote selective NOx&#8722; reduction and form NH2OH in situ. As a result, the synergic C&#8211;N coupling delivers a series of benzyl oximes from NOx&#8722; and benzyl alcohols with excellent yield and selectivity. Benzaldoxime synthesis proceeds at a rate of 18.7&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and TON of 52,875, accomplishing 90.6% benzyl alcohol conversion and 72.3% benzaldoxime yield, which is comparable to the best records for electrocatalytic benzaldoxime synthesis. The excellent long&#8208;term recyclability and scaled reaction to produce 0.58&#160;g benzaldoxime with a yield of 41% demonstrate efficient, atom&#8208;economic, and step&#8208;economic photocatalytic oxime synthesis via selective C&#8211;N coupling from abundant resources.

         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;molecule liposome assay for membrane permeabilization using confocal microscopy paired with a fast&#8208;flow microfluidics device is reported by Scott L. Cockroft, Mathew H. Horrocks et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202503678). Liposomes, encapsulating calcium&#8208;sensitive dye, pass through the channel aligned with the microscope. Membrane&#8208;permeabilizing agents allow calcium influx, sensitizing the dye which is detected as the liposome passes through the confocal volume. As successive liposomes pass through the volume, signals acquired indicate the permeabilising properties of the analyte.

         <title>Fast Removing Ligands from Platinum&#8208;Based Nanocatalysts by a Square&#8208;Wave Potential Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A square&#8208;wave potential (SWP) strategy is developed to efficiently remove the ligands from the surface of platinum (Pt)&#8208;based nanocatalysts in 1 min (40&#160;s), and its removal efficiency is 30 times higher than that of the traditional cyclic voltammetry cycling. The strategy is efficient and universal, which is comprehensively evidenced by physical characterizations and catalytic performance comparisons in the manuscript.








Abstract
Developing effective methods to remove ligands from the surface of nanoparticles (NPs) is crucial for obtaining surface&#8208;cleaned nanocatalysts. In this manuscript, we develop a square&#8208;wave potential (SWP) strategy that efficiently removes ligands from the surface of platinum (Pt)&#8208;based nanocatalysts within 1 min (40 s), achieving a removal efficiency 30 times higher than that of traditional cyclic voltammetry cycling. Comprehensive analyses of physical characterization and catalytic performance confirm the effectiveness of the SWP strategy. In situ electrochemical infrared and Raman spectroscopy show that the oxidation potential (1.24&#160;V) can replace the Pt&#8208;N coordination bond with a Pt&#9472;O covalent bond to form the intermediate state of Pt&#8208;O&#8208;NH2R during ligand removal, while the reduction potential (0.20 V) can detach the ligand from the surface of Pt. Moreover, the SWP strategy is versatile, extending the efficient removal of various ligands from the surface of Pt and the oleylamine ligand from Pt&#8208;based alloy nanocatalysts. The efficient removal of ligands from nanocatalysts is critical for ensuring the reproducibility of electrocatalytic results and for obtaining clean catalysts to reveal intrinsic effects in nanocatalysis.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Tuned Solid&#8208;Liquid Transition of Azo&#8208;Grafted Poly(thioctic acid) with Ultrahigh Photothermal Conversion Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azobenzene&#8208;grafted poly(thioctic acid) could undergo a reversible solid&#8208;liquid transition under green light irradiation. The light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion efficiency (LHCE) of Azo&#8208;PTA was as high as 84.9%, and the temperature could increase to above 90&#160;&#176;C within 30&#160;s of green light irradiation. Thus, several cutting&#8208;edge applications of Azo&#8208;PTA were explored, including photo&#8208;switchable adhesion, self&#8208;healing coating, and smart window.








Abstract
Functional materials with photo&#8208;regulated solid&#8208;liquid transition have garnered significant attention and found extensive applications across cutting&#8208;edge domains. However, previous photo&#8208;liquefiable behaviors of azopolymers are usually induced through UV light, which may damage the performances of the materials and is also harmful to human health. Here, a novel azopolymer (Azo&#8208;PTA) was fabricated via the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of thioctic acid (TA) and azobenzene&#8208;modified thioctic acid (Azo&#8208;TA). Interestingly, Azo&#8208;PTA could undergo a reversible solid&#8208;liquid transition under green light irradiation. The phase transition process of Azo&#8208;PTA was investigated systematically through various experimental and measurement methods. The results demonstrated that the solid&#8208;liquid transition of Azo&#8208;PTA was ascribed to the photothermal effect rather than the photochemical process. The light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion efficiency of Azo&#8208;PTA was as high as 84.9%, and the temperature could increase to above 90&#160;&#176;C within 30&#160;s of green light irradiation. Consequently, azopolymers with green light&#8208;regulated solid&#8208;liquid transition behaviors were successfully achieved. Moreover, several cutting&#8208;edge applications of Azo&#8208;PTA were explored, including photo&#8208;switchable adhesion, self&#8208;healing coating, and smart window. Our finding thus opens up a new platform for the fabrication of azopolymers with visible light&#8208;regulated solid&#8208;liquid transition.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional materials with photo-regulated solid-liquid transition have garnered significant attention and found extensive applications across cutting-edge domains. However, previous photo-liquefiable behaviors of azopolymers are usually induced through UV light, which may damage the performances of the materials and is also harmful to human health. Here, a novel azopolymer (Azo-PTA) was fabricated via the ring-opening copolymerization of thioctic acid (TA) and azobenzene-modified thioctic acid (Azo-TA). Interestingly, Azo-PTA could undergo a reversible solid-liquid transition under green light irradiation. The phase transition process of Azo-PTA was investigated systematically through various experimental and measurement methods. The results demonstrated that the solid-liquid transition of Azo-PTA was ascribed to the photothermal effect rather than the photochemical process. The light-to-heat conversion efficiency of Azo-PTA was as high as 84.9%, and the temperature could increase to above 90&#160;&#176;C within 30&#160;s of green light irradiation. Consequently, azopolymers with green light-regulated solid-liquid transition behaviors were successfully achieved. Moreover, several cutting-edge applications of Azo-PTA were explored, including photo-switchable adhesion, self-healing coating, and smart window. Our finding thus opens up a new platform for the fabrication of azopolymers with visible light-regulated solid-liquid transition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Red and Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive Organic Crystals: Molecular Design and Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over the past decade, red&#8208;emissive organic molecular crystals have advanced through molecular design (donor&#8208;acceptor structures, &#960;&#8208;conjugation) and crystal engineering to overcome aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and energy gap limitations. Featuring high quantum yields, tunable deep&#8208;red/NIR emission, and flexibility, they enable applications in flexible waveguides, lasers, and bio&#8208;integrated optoelectronics.








Abstract
Red&#8208;emissive organic materials play a pivotal role in optoelectronics, including displays, optical communications, organic lasers, and biomedicine, owing to their high penetration and low scattering properties. However, conventional polymer and thin&#8208;film emitters often face efficiency losses at long wavelengths and limited operational stability. Organic molecular crystals have emerged as promising alternatives by offering high purity, low defect density, and unique optical anisotropy. Among them, red&#8208;emissive organic molecular crystals (ROMCs) remain relatively underdeveloped compared to their blue and green counterparts. Moreover, the inherent brittleness of most crystals poses significant challenges for their integration into flexible and wearable devices. This review highlights recent advances in the design and development of ROMCs, emphasizing molecular and crystal engineering strategies to overcome photophysical limitations and impart mechanical flexibility. Emerging applications in organic lasers, optical waveguides, and bioimaging are discussed, alongside key challenges and future research directions. By bridging fundamental understanding and practical deployment, this perspective offers a comprehensive roadmap for the rational design of flexible, red&#8208;light&#8208;emitting crystalline materials for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic platforms.

         <title>Dynamic Photoacoustic Imaging of Mobile Cu(II) in Vivo via Catalytic Radical Cation Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel design strategy based on catalytic radical cation formation to develop molecular probes capable of in vivo photoacoustic imaging of mobile Cu(II) in the shortwave infrared region. We detail the development of this strategy and demonstrate its application through high spatiotemporal resolution imaging of mobile Cu(II) dynamics in the brains of Parkinson's disease model mice.








Abstract
Copper dyshomeostasis is associated with various diseases, making in vivo spatiotemporal imaging of mobile Cu(II) dynamics crucial for understanding pathophysiological mechanisms. However, imaging mobile Cu(II) dynamics remains a long&#8208;standing challenge due to the limitations of conventional probes in distinguishing between mobile and bound Cu(II). Herein, we developed a design strategy based on catalytic arylamine radical cation formation, enabling the creation of photoacoustic probes with superior sensitivity and micron&#8208;resolution imaging capabilities in the short&#8208;wave infrared region, specifically in response to mobile Cu(II). In vivo imaging of the brains of Parkinson's disease model mice revealed significant alternations in mobile Cu(II) levels within the cerebral cortex and cerebellar lobules during early disease stages, suggesting that these regions are particularly vulnerable to Cu(II) accumulation in early Parkinson's disease. These findings underscore the significant potential of these probes for investigating mobile Cu(II) dynamics and their role in physiological and pathological processes.

         <title>Adjustable Upcycling of Polyethylene Terephthalate to Biodegradable Polymer Monomers by Mn&#8208;Catalyzed Solvent Switching Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upcycling PET into biodegradable polymer monomers was achieved through solvent&#8208;switching strategy. Under the catalysis of the Mn complex, the in situ generated diol underwent selective dehydrogenative coupling in methanol, yielding lactic acid (LA) with 98% yield. When the solvent switched to tert&#8208;amyl alcohol, the diol was quantitatively oxidized to glycolic acid (GA).








Abstract
Waste plastics represent a new resource for the chemical industry. In this study, we demonstrate a solvent&#8208;switching strategy to upcycle waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into monomer terephthalic acid (TPA) and key bulk feedstocks for biodegradable polymers, such as lactic acid (LA) or glycolic acid (GA). PET undergoes rapid and mild depolymerization into its monomers TPA and ethylene glycol (EG) under the catalysis of a manganese complex. When methanol (MeOH) is used as the solvent, it undergoes selective dehydrogenative coupling with in situ generated EG, efficiently yielding TPA and LA with yields exceeding 98%. By replacing MeOH with tert&#8208;amyl alcohol (t&#8208;AmOH), PET is quantitatively converted into TPA and GA. The PET conversion mechanism was elucidated through deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments and molecular model studies. This work presents a sustainable and innovative approach for upcycling waste PET into high&#8208;value products while opening a new route to synthesize biopolymer monomers, which are essential for developing chemically recyclable and biodegradable polymers, thereby advancing the production of sustainable single&#8208;use polymer products.

         <title>Engineering a Meltable MOF to Tune Liquid Transition and Promote Coenzyme Regeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a liquid&#8211;liquid transition process, a bimetallic glassy MOF is fabricated. It has exceptional glass&#8208;forming properties, evenly distributed bimetallic ions, and a markedly higher visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photogeneration efficiency of enzymatically active NADH.








Abstract
Modulating the liquid phase of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) presents new opportunities for functionalizing glassy MOFs, expanding the fundamental science and practical application for this emerging family of materials. Herein, we report the fabrication of a bimetallic glassy MOF via a liquid&#8211;liquid transition process. This is achieved by introducing a robust Schiff base&#8211;cobalt functional group into Zn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;62, which attracts negatively charged imidazolate ligands, facilitating low&#8208;temperature melting. This ultimately leads to the formation of a bimetallic glassy MOF (Co/Zn&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62&#8208;ipy) upon melt&#8208;quenching. The material features an exceptionally high glass&#8208;forming capability, uniformly distributed bimetallic ions, and a markedly enhanced visible light photogeneration efficiency of enzymatically active nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) when compared with Co&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;62 glass. These findings offer novel insights into modulating the liquid phase of an MOF to develop functional glassy MOF photocatalysts for coenzyme NADH regeneration and other advanced applications.

         <title>Synergistic Stabilization of Pt Single Atoms by Cl and Ru for Industrial&#8208;Scale Current Density Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt single atom, synergistically stabilized by Cl ligand and Ru support, exhibits excellent stability over 1000&#160;h of PEM water electrolysis testing while drastically reducing the Pt loading as low as 10&#160;&#181;g&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Pt single&#8208;atom (SA) catalysts are considered ideal cathodic materials for PEM water electrolysis (PEMWE) due to their excellent atom utilization and tunable local coordination environment, yet their durability for practical applications remains an unresolved challenge. Herein we report the Pt SAs, synergistically stabilized by Cl&#8208;ligand and Ru nanoparticles, exhibit both high activity and durability for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A key finding is that the dynamically evolved Pt&#8211;Cl&#8211;Pt coordination structure protects Pt SAs against aggregation. Theoretical analysis reveals the unique electronic structure of Pt SAs is finely tuned through the synergistic role of Ru and Cl, resulting in a notable stabilization of Pt SAs. PEMWE with such a catalyst at an ultra&#8208;low Pt loading delivers a cell voltage of only 1.66&#160;V at a current density of 1.0 A cm&#8722;2, while maintaining the outstanding electrocatalytic and structural stability of the Pt&#8211;Cl&#8211;Pt coordination over 1000&#160;h, thus providing an application potential of SA catalysts.

         <title>AIE&#8208;Driven Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks for Solid&#8208;State Circularly Polarized Luminescence, Hydrochromism, and Water&#8208;Induced Chiroptical Enhancement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A salicylaldehyde azine&#8208;based CCOF exhibiting strong circular dichroism and solid&#8208;state circularly polarized fluorescence was constructed via chiral induction, featuring water&#8208;induced stimuli&#8208;responsive color change and chiroptical activity enhancement.








Abstract
Chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) are promising candidates for chiral optoelectronics and sensing, but their weak solid&#8208;state fluorescence and chiroptical responses often limit practical utility. Here, we introduce a novel CCOF synthesized from achiral monomers, 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarbaldehyde and hydrazine, via imine condensation with a chiral induction strategy, yielding salicylaldehyde azine units with aggregation&#8208;induced emission. Optimized catalyst and chiral inducer stoichiometry endow the framework with exceptional chiroptical properties (|gabs| = 2.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2, ellipticity&#160;&#8776;&#160;1000 mdeg). In the solid state, the CCOF exhibits intense red fluorescence (&#955;em&#160;&#8776;&#160;645&#8201;nm) with a large stoke shift and favorable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL, |glum| = 5.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2), marking the first CCOF derived solely from achiral building blocks with robust solid&#8208;state CPL. When integrated into polydimethylsiloxane, it forms flexible and semitransparent composite films suitable for CPL&#8208;based applications. The CCOF also functions as a highly enantioselective fluorescent sensor for chiral analytes, including 2&#8208;aminocyclohenanol and dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine. Furthermore, it demonstrates reversible hydrochromism, transitioning from yellow to orange (&#916;E&#160;&#8776;&#160;42.7), and water&#8208;induced chiroptical enhancement (ellipticity up to 2100 medg, |gabs| = 5.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2), achieving the highest ground&#8208;state chirality reported for CCOFs through enol&#8208;to&#8208;keto tautomerism upon water adsorption. This stimuli&#8208;responsive CCOF overcomes persistent limitations in solid&#8208;state CPL and paves the way for chiral sensing, optical displays, and responsive materials.

&lt;p&gt;Chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) are promising candidates for chiral optoelectronics and sensing, but their weak solid-state fluorescence and chiroptical responses often limit practical utility. Here, we introduce a novel CCOF synthesized from achiral monomers, 2-hydroxy-1,3,5-benzenetricarbaldehyde and hydrazine, via imine condensation with a chiral induction strategy, yielding salicylaldehyde azine units with aggregation-induced emission. Optimized catalyst and chiral inducer stoichiometry endow the framework with exceptional chiroptical properties (|g&lt;sub&gt;abs&lt;/sub&gt;| = 2.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ellipticity&#160;&#8776;&#160;1000 mdeg).

         <title>Desolvation&#8208;Induced Network Reformation and Cracking in the Single Crystals of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Frameworks Composed of Tetraazanthraquinone and Anthraquinone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A molecular&#8208;level understanding of how structural transformations induce morphological changes in organic crystals is essential for developing flexible crystalline materials. Herein, we report that two solvated hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) undergo structural transformations, giving rise to crystal crack propagation in the directions corresponding to their molecular displacements. The HOFs are composed of the tetracarboxylic acids, 4,4',4'',4'''&#8208;(5,10&#8208;dioxo&#8208;5,10&#8208;dihydropyrazino[2,3&#8208;g]quinoxaline&#8208;2,3,7,8&#8208;tetrayl)tetrabenzoic acid (TAAQ) and 4,4',4'',4'''&#8208;(9,10&#8208;dioxo&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene&#8208;2,3,6,7&#8208;tetrayl)tetrabenzoic acid (AQ), incorporating tetraazanthraquinone and anthraquinone cores, respectively. Although TAAQ and AQ have closely similar molecular geometries, their HOFs have entirely different hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks. In both HOFs, we found that specific directional hydrogen bonds cleaved, and new hydrogen bonds re&#8208;formed, resulting in quasi single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations. The direction of molecular displacement and crystal cell shrinkage were aligned parallel to the crack propagation. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying micro&#8208;macro property correlations induced by hydrogen bond cleavage and re&#8208;formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Cyclopropyl Diboronates via 1,2&#8208;Boronate Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of polysubstituted cyclopropanes has garnered considerable attention in the field of synthetic chemistry in recent years. The introduction of boron groups into cyclopropane structures enables efficient functional modification of cyclopropane frameworks through downstream derivatization of carbon&#8208;boron bonds. Herein, we report an efficient method for the rapid construction of cyclopropyl diboronates from&#160;gem&#8208;bis(boronates) and thianthrenium (TT) salts. This transformation proceeds through a 1,2&#8208;rearrangement of&#160;tetra&#8208;coordinated boron species, delivering 1,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropane diboronates in high efficiency. Subsequent borate derivatization provides access to highly diastereoselective polysubstituted cyclopropanes. This method offers a scalable and stereocontrolled approach to cyclopropane synthesis and functional diversification, expanding opportunities for the design of complex cyclopropyl architectures in medicinal chemistry, materials science, and organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiodivergent Photocatalytic Annulation for the Synthesis of gem&#8208;Difluorinated Cyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regiodivergent synthesis is a powerful strategy for expanding chemical space. Given the significance of fluorine&#8208;containing molecules in pharmaceutical sciences, a regiodivergent [3+2] cycloaddition of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropyl urea to olefins and [1.1.0]&#8208;bicyclobutanes was developed by employing cationic iridium complexes as photocatalysts under visible&#8208;light irradiation. By properly selecting a counter anion of the photocatalyst and tuning the reaction conditions, each regioisomeric, cyclic hydrocarbon with a defined gem&#8208;difluoromethylene disposition was directly assembled with high selectivity. Mechanistic elucidation revealed the critical relevance of the basicity of the photocatalyst counter anion to the regiochemical outcome. The reaction diverges depending on the intervention of deprotonation of the initially generated urea radical cation by the pairing anion to form the corresponding neutral radical; this not only governs the regioselective ring opening of the cyclopropane moiety but also modulates the relative reactivity of the two resulting terminal carbon radicals, thereby dictating the dominant pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Upcycling of Polystyrene into Phenol and Hydroquinone Derivatives by Photocatalysis and Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective upcycling of polystyrene (PS) waste into value&#8208;added aromatics has emerged as compelling strategy toward sustainable plastic valorization, drawing significant scientific and industrial interest. While most existing methods involved oxidative C&#8211;C bond cleavage predominantly yield benzoic acid, the direct conversion of waste PS into phenolic compounds remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the first example of photocatalytic upcycling of polystyrene (PS) into phenol derivatives with high chemoselectivity. This economically method proceeds under ambient conditions (1 atm air and room temperature) using an inexpensive organic photocatalyst via photooxidation&#8208;induced Hock rearrangement in a single step. The use of strong acid effectively suppresses the formation of benzoic acid, playing a critical role in high selectivity. Experimental and DFT calculations revealed that the cis configuration of neighboring phenyl rings in PS raises the barrier for hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from the benzylic C&#8722;H bond, thereby contributing to the low polymer conversion. Furthermore, the novel divergent upcycling of PS to hydroquinone derivatives was achieved by photo&#8208;electro tandem strategy. The practicality of this strategy is demonstrated by depolymerization of real&#8208;life PS using a sunlight&#8208;driven photocatalytic and electrocatalytic degradation platform, underscoring its promising potential for sustainable and scalable upcycling of PS waste.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Polymerization Enabled by Direct Transmetalation with Boronic Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction plays a pivotal role in the construction of carbon&#8211;carbon bonds, utilizing low&#8208;toxicity and readily available organoboron substrates.

         <title>Photothermal CuS as a Hole Transfer Layer on BiVO4 Photoanode for Efficient Solar Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sluggish hole transport kinetics are one of the key limitations of bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) photoanodes in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, severely impeding the attainment of high solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency. Herein, a copper sulfide (CuS) hole transfer layer (HTL) with photothermal effect is reported to markedly enhance the PEC water splitting via the synergistic action of photothermal effect and hole transfer. This is demonstrated in the BiVO4/CuS/NiFeCoOx photoanode, where the CuS layer establishes a transport channel for photogenerated holes, effectively inhibiting charge recombination and trapping.&#160;Additionally, the thermal effect induced by localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) enhances the water oxidation activity of surface NiFeCoOx cocatalyst and boosts the charge mobility. The optimized BiVO4/CuS/NiFeCoOx photoanode exhibits exceptional performance, achieving a water oxidation photocurrent density of 6.56 mA cm&#8208;2 at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE) and a STH conversion efficiency of 7.17% when connected in series with Si solar cells. Experimental analyses and density functional theory (DFT) calculations collectively reveal the pivotal role of CuS HTL in facilitating carrier separation and transport. This work highlights the potential of interfacial engineering to facilitate charge separation and transfer, providing a new strategy for the construction of photoanodes to achieve efficient water splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Electro&#8722;Oxidation of Ethylene to 2&#8722;Chloroethanol on SnO2 through Dual&#8722;Adsorbate Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrified 2&#8722;chloroethanol synthesis serves as a promising alternative to conventional ethylene oxidation with corrosive hypochlorous acid (HClO) and offers the opportunity for the sustainable pharmaceuticals production. However, the instability of locally generated HClO and the competing water oxidation largely limit the efficiency of this electrochemical process. Here we report a new reaction pathway involved in the ethylene oxidation towards 2&#8722;chloroethanol, featuring co&#8722;adsorbed chloride (*Cl) and hydroxide (*OH) species on tin dioxide (SnO2) anode. This dual&#8722;adsorbates pathway favors the efficient ethylene oxidation, giving rise to a large current density of 100 mA/cm2 for at least 50 hours and a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 82% for 2&#8722;chloroethanol product. This work opens an avenue for electrifying synthesis of important organic molecules via simultaneously modulating the adsorption of multiple active intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Electrochemistry for Direct Deoxygenative Silylation of Alcohols and Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alcohols and ketones are abundant and structurally diverse feedstocks, yet their direct transformation into organosilicon compounds remains challenging due to the difficulty in selective cleaving C&#8211;OH and C=O bonds. Here, we report an electrochemically driven deoxygenative C&#8211;Si bond formation strategy that converts alcohols and ketones directly to organosilicon compounds. The reactions operate under mild conditions without external redox reagents and sacrificial electrodes. A wide range of alcohols, including primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols, as well as ketones, are efficiently converted to the corresponding organosilane products. Overall, this study provides a step&#8208;economical, highly efficient, and synthetically versatile platform for the direct conversion of feedstock chemicals into valuable organosilicon compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Performance of Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zinc Ion Batteries via Zincophilic Solubilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogel electrolytes hold great promise in tackling severe issues facing aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, to satisfy the quest of flexible and eco&#8208;friendly batteries, developing low&#8208;cost and high mechanical durability hydrogel electrolyte remains a challenge. Here, employing the zincophilic solubilizer urea, we break the classical concentration limits of the low&#8208;cost Zn(Ac)2 salt and introduce it into the hydrogel skeleton. The &#8220;salting out&#8221; effect give the polymer chain sediments a tighter bundle and twist effect. The as&#8208;formed hydrogel electrolyte can endure 557% high elongation and 3.7 MPa compressive strength to resist repeated zinc plating/striping process and external physical stimuli. The in&#8208;situ polyurea solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer leads to thermodynamically stable anode/electrolyte interface. Utilizing the hydrogel electrolyte, the zinc anode shows high reversibility, leading to an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.93% for 150 cycles on the Zn//Cu battery. When assembled with NH4V4O10 cathode (NVO), the full battery delivers a high capacity of 253.8 mAh g&#8208;1 beyond 1000 cycles longevity at 1 A g&#8208;1. The pouch battery also shows a high capacity of 280.7 mAh g&#8208;1 at 500 mA g&#8208;1 and operate steadily for 90.13% retention after 200 cycles, and maintained a stable voltage even experienced bending and folding.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional and Radii&#8208;Matched High&#8208;Entropy Engineering Towards Locally&#8208;Regulable Metal Oxide Layers in Sodium&#8208;Layered Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered oxides, one of the most fascinating cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), have the advantages of appropriate voltage window and feasible preparation process, however, cycling stability is the biggest challenge. Element doping is the most rational strategy to address this problem, but six&#8208;coordinated octahedral radii and different radii in different valence states of these doping elements and the functions of these elements need to be taken into account. Hence, an example of P2/O3&#8208;type Na0.7Mn0.53Ni0.26Fe0.15Mg0.01V0.01Co0.01Cu0.01Zn0.01Sn0.01O2 (high&#8208;entropy layered oxides, HEO) has been designed in consideration of moderate six&#8208;coordinated octahedral radii and stabling the metal&#8208;oxygen bond. A reversible capacity of 126.9 mAh g&#8722;1 can be achieved. Even tested at 1000 mA g&#8722;1, an improved rate performance of 72.9 mAh g&#8722;1 can be observed with a capacity retention rate of 66.5% after 1000 cycles. Potential&#8208;based in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements and corresponding distribution of relaxation time profiles prove the effect of multiple elemental combination. Concomitantly, in&#8208;situ XRD results reveal the biphasic clamping reaction mechanism of HEO. Density functional theory results reveal that the multielement doping can modify the localization of electrons and enhance the structural stability. This work provides an idea of designing HEO cathode for SIBs by crystal structure modulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Embedded&#8208;type Cu Nanoparticle with Largely Enhanced Catalytic Activity and Stability Towards Methanol Steam Reforming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen production through low temperature methanol steam reforming (MSR) reaction plays a critical role in the development of new energy, but remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a Cu/Zn(Ga)Ox catalyst, which is prepared via an interface reconstruction strategy. Interestingly, this catalyst is featured with a unique mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon structure: Cu nanoparticles are embedded into the Zn(Ga)Ox substrate, which ensures a stable Zn&#8208;O&#8208;Cu+&#8208;Ov&#8208;Ga&#948;+ interface structure. The resulting Cu/Zn(Ga)Ox catalyst exhibits 99.3% CH3OH conversion with a H2 production rate of 124.6 &#956;mol gcat&#8208;1&#160;s&#8208;1 at 225 &#176;C, which is preponderant to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. Furthermore, an ultra&#8208;high catalytic stability was demonstrated through a 400 h stream&#8208;on&#8208;line test without obvious decline. Kinetic isotope analysis, in situ spectroscopy characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the MSR reaction over Cu/Zn(Ga)Ox catalyst follows formaldehyde oxidation route. The CH3O* and H2O molecule adsorb at adjacent Cu+&#8208;Ov interface (intrinsic active site) with oxygen&#8208;terminal adsorption configuration, which promotes electron transfer from d&#8208;band center of Cu to O (s,p)&#8208;band of substrate molecule.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen production through low temperature methanol steam reforming (MSR) reaction plays a critical role in the development of new energy, but remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a Cu/Zn(Ga)Ox catalyst, which is prepared via an interface reconstruction strategy. Interestingly, this catalyst is featured with a unique mortise-and-tenon structure: Cu nanoparticles are embedded into the Zn(Ga)Ox substrate, which ensures a stable Zn-O-Cu+-Ov-Ga&#948;+ interface structure. The resulting Cu/Zn(Ga)Ox catalyst exhibits 99.3% CH3OH conversion with a H2 production rate of 124.6 &#956;mol gcat-1&#160;s-1 at 225 &#176;C, which is preponderant to the state-of-the-art catalysts. Furthermore, an ultra-high catalytic stability was demonstrated through a 400 h stream-on-line test without obvious decline. Kinetic isotope analysis, in situ spectroscopy characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the MSR reaction over Cu/Zn(Ga)Ox catalyst follows formaldehyde oxidation route. The CH3O* and H2O molecule adsorb at adjacent Cu+-Ov interface (intrinsic active site) with oxygen-terminal adsorption configuration, which promotes electron transfer from d-band center of Cu to O (s,p)-band of substrate molecule. This significantly reduces the energy barrier of C&#8722;H bond cleavage in CH3O* dehydrogenation (the rate-determining step) and H2O dissociation, accounting for the extraordinarily enhanced H2 production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Enantioconvergent C&#8211;O Bond Formation for Asymmetric Cross&#8208;coupling of Allylamines and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upgrading abundant carbon dioxide (CO2) into high value organic molecules has garnered broad research interest for decades. Within this domain, catalytic asymmetric synthesis employing CO2 holds great synthetic importance. While remarkable advances have been made in asymmetric C&#8211;C bond formation using CO2 as a C1 synthon in recent years, the development of incorporation of CO2 as an oxygen source for asymmetric C&#8211;O bond construction remains elusive, presumably due to the formidable challenge of simultaneously addressing enantioselectivity control and reaction efficiency. Here, we demonstrate the first copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8211;O bond cross&#8208;coupling of allylamines and CO2 in a radical strategy. The key innovation resides in the rational and strategic conversion of C2&#8208;symmetric oxazoline ligands to their C1&#8208;symmetric counterparts, which induces additional C&#8211;N axial chirality after coordination with copper. The resultant enantioenriched fluoroalkylated 2&#8208;oxazolidones can be further transformed into diverse functional compounds, including novel chiral amino alcohols for oxazoline ligand design and a potent bioactive insecticide analogue. Detailed mechanistic investigations elucidate a radical&#8208;mediated pathway and establish the critical role of C1&#8208;symmetric ligands in achieving efficient stereochemical control.</dc:description>

         <title>Axial&#8208;N Induced Square&#8208;Pyramidal Crystal Filed of Atomically Iron Sites for Enhancing Acidic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed Fe&#8208;based catalyst represents a promising alternative to platinum for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the prevalent FeN4 configuration exhibits limited intrinsic activity in acidic media owing to its inherent instability, thereby restricting the application in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Herein, we introduce axial&#8208;N coordination to enhance the activity and stability of atomically dispersed Fe sites for acidic ORR by establishing a barrier to prevent Fe dissolution. Compared to FeN4 configuration, the axial&#8208;N ligand in the FeN5, FeN5&#8208;Fe3 and FeN2C3 configurations induces a square&#8208;pyramidal crystal field, which diminishes the spin polarization in the dz2, dxz, and dyz orbitals, and alters the electronic delocalization of Fe atom. In a 0.10 M HClO4 electrolyte, the ORR activity increases with enhanced electronic delocalization, following the trend: FeN5 &gt; FeN5+Fe3 &gt; FeN2C3 &gt; FeN4. Operando technique further reveals that the dissociation of Fe&#8208;N bond in the FeN5 configuration occurs alongside the insertion of oxygen, leading to the formation of FeN3O2 and FeN4O1 structures that could accelerate the ORR kinetics. Consequently, the FeN5 configuration shows a positive shift of 30 mV in half&#8208;wave potential compared to Pt/C and achieves a peak power of 1.2 W cm&#8722;2 at 3.2 A cm&#8722;2 in PEMFC.</dc:description>

         <title>Zwitterion&#8208;Modified NiFe OER Catalyst Achieving Ultra&#8208;Stable Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis via Dynamic Alkaline Microenvironment Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient non&#8208;precious metal electrocatalysts for industrial anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEM&#8208;WE) remains challenging, primarily due to sluggish OH&#8211; transfer from the anion exchange membrane (AEM) to catalytic sites, causing H+ accumulation and performance degradation. Herein, we developed a zwitterion&#8208;modified NiFe catalyst (z&#8208;NiFe) through gradient soaking, facilitates rapid OH&#8211; transfer across the AEM&#8208;electrocatalyst interface, effectively neutralizing the generated H+ and enhancing catalytic performance. In&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and OH&#8722; conductivity measurements reveal an alkaline&#8208;enriched surface environment, which inhibits H+ accumulation&#8208;induced chemical corrosion and enhances water oxidation performances. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis demonstrates that zwitterions stabilize adsorbed oxygen during catalysis, and reduce the overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The z&#8208;NiFe shows an ultralow Tafel slope (28.5 mV dec&#8722;1) and high activity (190 mV overpotential at 1,000 mA cm&#8722;2) in 1 M KOH. When integrated into an AEM&#8208;WE system, the z&#8208;NiFe&#8208;catalysed AEM&#8208;WE device exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.76 V at 1,000 mA cm&#8722;2 and record&#8208;breaking durability over 14,000 h, with a voltage degradation rate of 12.3 &#956;V h&#8722;1, representing a significant advancement in AEM&#8208;WE technology.</dc:description>

         <title>A Butterfly&#8208;like Fluorescent Tracker for Dynamic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optically tracking constitutional dynamics provides a time&#8208;resolved, non&#8208;invasive, and visually interpretable approach to unraveling microscopic complexity in system chemistry. Here we report a butterfly&#8208;like fluorescent tracker, featuring excited&#8208;state conformational adaptivity, capable of sensing the subtle microscopic dynamics of polymers as a ratiometric fluorescent probe. The key design is coupling the fluorophore&#8217;s conformational relaxation dynamics to microenvironmental constraints imposed by polymer structural features&#8212;such as chain length, conformation, and inter&#8208;/intramolecular interactions. By employing the fluorophore as a bifunctional initiator, we grafted two dynamic polymer chains onto its phenyl "wings", creating a single&#8208;fluorophore tracker that dynamically interacts with its environment. This system functions as a highly sensitive ratiometric probe, optically reporting microscopic polymer dynamics in real time, including polymerization kinetics, chain folding/unfolding transitions, and depolymerization processes. Systematic studies demonstrate the broad applicability of this concept across diverse polymeric systems, with distinct emission signatures enabling differentiation between systems. The probe&#8217;s ability to correlate fluorescence output with microenvironmental changes reveals its utility in both fundamental and applied contexts. We anticipate this conformationally adaptive fluorescent platform will advance research in dynamic chemistry, particularly for real&#8208;time monitoring of polymeric systems and the development of responsive materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introduction of twisted structures into low&#8208;dimensional graphene&#8208;based nanostructures has important ramifications on their inherent physical behavior. The fabrication of graphene derivatives with nonplanar characteristics remains challenging, especially for extended two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structures. Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel nonplanar [32]annulene porous carbon&#8208;based network that contains the narrowest periodic nanopores and exhibits the highest negative curvature among 2D nonplanar carbon&#8208;based nanostructures synthesized up to date. The success is driven by the dissymmetrical debromination and regioselective coupling reactions of precursor molecules on a Au(111) surface, as corroborated by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and synchrotron radiation photoemission spectroscopy (SRPES). We characterize electronic properties of the [32]annulene porous carbon&#8208;based network with the aid of scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), and demonstrate a significant hole doping induced by interfacial charge transfer between the nonplanar nanoarchitecture and the Au(111) substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorylation Regulation Promotes Bidirectional Dynamic Adaptive Interface for Achieving Stable Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unstable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces resulting from severe cathodic polyiodide shuttling, anodic parasitic corrosion reactions, and dendrite growth significantly impede the performance of zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries. Here, phosphorylation regulation is proposed to create dynamically adaptive water&#8208;lean interfaces for long&#8208;term Zn&#8211;I2 batteries. Phosphorylation reinforces the adaptive interface construction through the increased adsorption capability on the Zn anode and introduces a dynamic pH&#8208;balancing capability, while simultaneously offering extra sites for the real&#8208;time capture of polyiodide intermediates at the cathode. Consequently, extended durability (4400 h at 5 mA cm&#8208;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8208;2), boosted coulombic efficiency (99.8% for 7500 cycles), and ultralong cycling for 8000 cycles at a high loading of 10 mg cm&#8208;2 were maintained. These findings provide crucial insights into the optimization of adaptive interfaces through phosphorylation regulation for high&#8208;performance Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>A Multifunctional Polyester Nanoplatform for the Synergistic Anti&#8208;Cancer: Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy and Targeted Gene Silencing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gene therapy (GT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) present promising approaches for cancer treatment. However, GT is frequently impeded by the lysosomal capture of nucleic acids, while PDT is constrained by low oxygen levels in tumors. Herein, we reported the design of a versatile block polyester vector, BFN2, which comprises of a photosensitizer BODIPY (B), an oxygen carrying perfluorinated carbon chain (F) as well as a GSH&#8208;responsive and RNA&#8208;condensing [12]aneN3 (N) moiety. In the presence of DOPE (D) and DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;iRGD (R), BFN2 is able to carry oxygen and condense HIF&#8208;1&#945; siRNA efficiently and afford hybrid nanoparticles BFN2&#8208;DR/HIF&#8208;1&#945; siRNA@O&#8322;. These combined functionalities work together to reverse tumor hypoxia, remodel the tumor microenvironment, and allow for the efficient lysosomal escape of nucleic acids, thereby significantly boosting the efficacy of PDT and GT in solid tumors. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that the BFN2&#8208;DR/HIF&#8208;1&#945; siRNA@O&#8322; nanoplatform significantly exhibited substantial inhibitory effects in 4T1 tumors with TGI up to 87%. This research marks the first&#8208;in&#8208;class integration of such multi&#8208;modality therapeutic strategies within a single block polymeric vector, thus offering a novel perspective for developing effective oncological treatment paradigms.</dc:description>

         <title>Chlorine Radical&#8208;Mediated Photocatalytic C&#8722;C Coupling of Methanol to Ethylene Glycol with Near&#8208;Unity Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective activation of inert C&#8722;H bonds in methanol under mild conditions to synthesize high&#8208;value C2 products remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the competing high reactivity of O&#8722;H bonds. Herein, we pioneer a chlorine radical&#8208;mediated strategy to redirect the photocatalytic reaction pathway for methanol conversion toward ethylene glycol (EG). Efficient C&#8722;H bond activation is achieved by constructing a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst (ZnIn2S4/TiO2&#8208;Cl) composed of chlorinated TiO2 (TiO2&#8208;Cl) and ZnIn2S4 with efficient charge separation. Photogenerated holes in this system preferentially oxidize surface&#8208;adsorbed Cl&#8722; to chlorine radicals (Cl&#8226;). These radicals drive a thermodynamically favorable hydrogen atom transfer via hydrogen abstraction, cleaving the C&#8722;H bond of methanol to form hydroxymethyl radicals (&#8226;CH2OH). Subsequent C&#8722;C coupling of &#8226;CH2OH intermediates, synergistically combined with a self&#8208;sustaining Cl&#8722;/Cl&#8226; cycle, produces EG with exceptional selectivity (96.7%) and yield (21.6 mmol g&#8722;1), while suppressing overoxidation. In contrast, non&#8208;chlorinated catalysts predominantly utilize photogenerated holes for O&#8722;H bond cleavage under identical conditions, yielding only C1 products (HCHO, HCOOH). This work not only establishes a solar&#8208;driven approach for methanol valorization but also advances mechanistic insights into radical&#8208;mediated pathway control in heterogeneous photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming Photochemical Limitations in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Low&#8208;energy Light Driven Selective 1O2 Generation Achieved by Donor&#8208;Acceptor Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet oxygen (1O2) plays a crucial role in various photocatalytic oxidation reactions; however, achieving high&#8208;efficiency and selective 1O2 production under low&#8208;energy light remains a challenge. Herein, we present a novel donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) strategy in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to regulate the localized electronic state structures for efficient and selective 1O2 generation under low&#8208;energy light. Notably, the rationally incorporation of the negatively charged carbonyl groups into the basal plane of the COF strengthens the D&#8208;A interaction, improves light harvesting in the lower&#8208;energy region, facilitates highly selective 1O2 generation through a coupled charge&#8208;transfer mechanism. As a result, the engineered COF demonstrates exceptional photocatalytic performance in 1O2 driven advanced oxidation, enabling gram&#8208;scale production under red light, even when operating through translucent barriers. A mechanistic study revealed that the distinct 1O2 production under low&#8208;energy light is attributed to the spatially locked structure and charge localization around active centers. These features enhance strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction, promote effective charge separation and transport properties, and ultimately facilitate the activation of O2 to 1O2. This study paves the way for the development of high&#8208;performance COF photocatalysts for low&#8208;energy light&#8208;driven reactive oxygen species generation in advanced oxidation processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed 1,5&#8208;Sigma Migratory Ring Expansion of gem&#8208;Difluorodienyl Cyclopropanes and Cyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed 1,5&#8208;sigma migratory ring expansions of gem&#8208;difluorodienyl cyclopropanes and gem&#8208;difluorodienyl cyclobutanes enabled the synthesis of challenging seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered carbocycles. Key to these reactions is that gem&#8208;difluorine atoms in the substrates can assist oxidative cyclometallation and detour the difficult reductive elimination through defluorocarbenation, as supported by experiments and DFT calculations.








Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed 1,5&#8208;sigma migratory ring expansion (SMRE) of common dieneylcyclopropanes (DECPs) and dieneylcyclobutanes (DECBs) fails. But replacing the terminal CH2 group with CF2 group for both DECPs and DECBs, the resulting substrates of gem&#8208;difluorodienyl cyclopropanes (df&#8208;DECPs) and gem&#8208;difluorodienyl cyclobutanes (df&#8208;DECBs) can achieve this reaction, which has broad reaction scope and high efficiency to give seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered carbocycles with a carbonyl group. The keys to the success of this reaction are: oxidative cyclometalation becomes easier with the help of two F atoms; the metallacycle intermediate can detour the sluggish reductive elimination by defluorination to generate Rh carbene intermediate (defluorocarbenation process), which can undergo easier carbene migratory insertion and &#946;&#8208;H elimination, giving rise to the final products. Mechanistic studies via experiments and quantum chemical calculations support the proposed mechanism. The gem&#8208;difluoro ene in the substrates of df&#8208;DECPs and df&#8208;DECBs of the present SMRE reaction can be regarded as a ketene surrogate, and this strategy can be exploited in many transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions in the future.

The keys to the success of this reaction are: oxidative cyclometalation becomes easier with the help of two F atoms; the metallacycle intermediate can detour the sluggish reductive elimination by defluorination to generate Rh carbene intermediate (defluorocarbenation process), which can undergo easier carbene migratory insertion and &#946;-H elimination, giving rise to the final products. Mechanistic studies via experiments and quantum chemical calculations support the proposed mechanism. The &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoro ene in the substrates of df-DECPs and df-DECBs of the present SMRE reaction can be regarded as a ketene surrogate, and this strategy can be exploited in many transition-metal-catalyzed reactions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Bidirectional Ion Kinetic Regulator Suppressing Lithium Dendrites in Advanced Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Sand equation reveals anions' greater impact on lithium dendrite growth versus cations. Guided by this, we created a bidirectional ion kinetic regulator of Ni&#8208;HAB that chelates TFSI&#8722; into octahedral structures, achieving simultaneous control of TFSI&#8722; and Li+ migration, suppressing lithium dendrites growth. Moreover, Ni&#8208;HAB boosts SRR kinetics and blocks the shuttle effect. Ah&#8208;level Li&#8208;S pouch cells with Ni&#8208;HAB show high safety and stability.








Abstract
Liquid organic electrolytes (LOEs) are of crucial significance in secondary battery deposition processes. Based on Sand's time formula, this study proposes a novel bidirectional ion kinetic regulator concept. Verified in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs), it is demonstrated that regulating the migration of anions and cations simultaneously can effectively promote the realization of dendrite&#8208;free batteries. This bidirectional ion kinetic regulator forms octahedral complexes with TFSI&#8722;, decreasing TFSI&#8722; migration, enhancing Li+ desolvation and diffusion, and thus extending the dendrite formation time by over 25 times. Moreover, the attraction of the regulator towards solvent molecules and its improvement on the sulfur reduction kinetics effectively suppress the shuttle effect. Subsequently, the assembled Li||Li (1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 2000&#160;h), Li&#8208;Cu (99.4% of CE), and Li&#8208;S (1000 cycles at 4 C) cells deliver extremely excellent cycling stability. An Ah&#8208;level Li&#8208;S pouch cell also exhibits negligible capacity decay (50 cycles without capacity decay). This confirms the importance of regulating both anions and cations for high&#8208;safety LSBs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Promoting Targeted Delivery of Epigenetic Immunostimulants to Activate Breast Cancer Immunity via HDACs Downregulation and PD&#8208;L1 Upregulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;promoting targeted immunostimulant is designed to selectively co&#8208;deliver photosensitizer Ce6 and HDAC inhibitor TSA to breast cancer cells, thereby enhancing tumor immunogenicity and reshaping the immunosuppressive microenvironment for collective activation of anti&#8208;tumor immunity by HDACs downregulation and PD&#8208;L1 upregulation.








Abstract
The low immunogenicity and immunosuppressive phenotype of breast cancer significantly limit the effectiveness of immunotherapy. This study reveals that histone deacetylases (HDACs) are upregulated in breast cancer, while lower levels of HDACs and higher levels of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) are associated with better patient prognosis. Moreover, Trichostatin A (TSA) is confirmed to suppress HDACs and increase PD&#8208;L1 expression. Building on these insights, a self&#8208;promoting targeted immunostimulant (SPT&#8208;IS) is developed to activate breast cancer immunity by epigenetically upregulating PD&#8208;L1. SPT&#8208;IS can selectively accumulate in PD&#8208;L1&#8208;overexpressing breast cancer cells for co&#8208;delivery of Chlorin e6 (Ce6) and TSA. Notably, SPT&#8208;IS&#8208;induced epigenetic upregulation of PD&#8208;L1 creates a self&#8208;promoting tumor&#8208;targeting loop that enhances drug delivery efficiency. Besides, SPT&#8208;IS generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill tumor cells and release damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, increasing tumor immunogenicity. Additionally, the epigenetic regulation ability of SPT&#8208;IS upregulates immunomodulatory cytokines and stimulates T cell cytotoxicity for immune activation. Immunological results confirm robust immunomodulatory effects of SPT&#8208;IS, significantly enhancing tumor&#8208;infiltrating lymphocytes recruitment and proliferation, leading to notable anti&#8208;tumor efficacy. These findings highlight the potential of a self&#8208;promoting targeted strategy to enhance drug delivery and provide an epigenetic approach to boost the immune response against breast cancer.

         <title>Dual Enzyme&#8208;Responsive Polymer&#8208;Drug Conjugates Induce Diverse Cells Mutual Transcytosis to Achieve Deep Pancreatic Tumor Penetration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fibroblast&#8208;activated protease (FAP) and &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) dual&#8208;responsive polymer&#8208;SN38 conjugates achieve deep penetration into pancreatic tumors by inducing mutual transcytosis of cancer cells and cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The dual enzyme&#8208;responsive polymer&#8208;SN38 conjugates inhibit cancer progression in patient&#8208;derived xenografts (PDXs) and orthotopic xenografts of pancreatic tumors, exerting greater antitumor activity than the first&#8208;line drug gemcitabine.








Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;responsive active transporting nanomedicines have shown promise in overcoming the tumor&#8208;dense extracellular matrix barrier by inducing cancer cells&#8217; intercellular transcytosis to deliver drugs deep into solid tumors. However, nanomedicine only responsive to the cancer cell&#8208;related enzyme is not very effective in pancreatic tumors because successive transcytosis cannot be established among the cancer cells, which are scattered in a large number of cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Here are reported dual&#8208;enzyme&#8208;responsive 7&#8208;ethyl&#8208;10&#8208;hydroxycamptothecin (SN38)&#8208;polymer conjugates capable of inducing transcytosis among cancer cells and CAFs to infiltrate pancreatic tumors efficiently. The conjugates are zwitterionic for long blood circulation. Once in the tumor, the &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) overexpressed on the tumor endothelial and cancer cells, or the fibroblast&#8208;activated protease (FAP) on CAFs, can cleave the &#947;&#8208;glutamylamide or the prolylglycine dipeptide amides, producing primary amines. The cationized conjugate then induces transcytosis among cancer cells and CAFs, establishing successive intercellular transport to infiltrate the tumor. The conjugates' enzyme reactivity and overall hydrophobicity determine their cationization and transcytosis behaviors. The conjugates with high hydrophobicity and fast cationization show potent antitumor activity in pancreatic cancer patient&#8208;derived xenograft and orthotopic tumor models. This study provides an active transportation strategy to overcome the delivery barrier of tumors with rich stroma cells.

         <title>An Engineered Multivalent TMV Nanodisk Platform for Modulating Integrin Clustering and Cell Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Receptor clustering is essential for efficient signal transduction and cellular function. Here, a tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)&#8208;based platform provides a stable scaffold for clustering up to 34 ligands with defined spacing, dramatically enhancing receptor binding and signaling. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies (TMV&#8208;SPPEPS) demonstrate its ability to promote integrin clustering, driving MSC differentiation and therapeutic potential.








Abstract
Clustering of cell&#8208;surface receptors is essential for initiating signaling cascades and regulating cellular functions. Multivalent ligands with high receptor affinity offer powerful tools for manipulating these processes and advancing therapeutic strategies. However, designing easily modifiable, stable, and uniformly structured multivalent ligands remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present a novel protein&#8208;based platform derived from modified tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) coat protein, which assembles into a stable, discoid scaffold capable of displaying up to 34 ligands with evenly distributed binding sites. By introducing the T103C modification, we achieve exceptional structural stability, allowing the platform to maintain integrity across a broad pH range (5&#8211;11) and during long&#8208;term storage (up to 6 months). Using the integrin&#8208;binding peptide SPPEPS as a model, we generate a multivalent TMV&#8208;SPPEPS that exhibits a 453&#8208;fold increase in integrin affinity over the monomeric peptide and can simultaneously cluster up to seven integrins. This multivalent platform promotes integrin clustering on cell surfaces, triggering mesenchymal stem cell chondrogenesis and effectively alleviating osteoarthritis in a rat model. These results highlight the potential of the TMV nanodisk as a versatile and stable platform for controlling receptor clustering and modulating intracellular signaling in diverse biomedical applications.

         <title>Mn/TiO2 Catalysts for the High&#8208;Yield Partial Oxidation of Methane with Molecular Oxygen to a Methyl Ester</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn/TiO2 is a highly active catalyst for the conversion of methane&#8208;to&#8208;methyl trifluoroacetate using molecular oxygen as an oxidant. Different Mn/TiO&#8322; catalysts with varying properties demonstrate a correlation between Mn dispersion and reducibility, and catalytic activity. Notably, around 30% yields were obtained, confirming the effectiveness of Mn/TiO2 for the partial oxidation of methane in acid to a stable methyl ester.








Abstract
We synthesize and evaluate a diverse range of Mn/TiO2 catalysts with varying physical and redox properties for the methane&#8208;to&#8208;methyl&#8208;ester reaction using molecular oxygen in a diluted acid medium (10 wt% trifluoroacetic acid). Despite initial differences in manganese distributions, nearly all catalysts are active under the reaction conditions, and the degree of activity is partially correlated to catalyst reducibility in hydrogen temperature programmed reduction and manganese K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Under methane&#8208;limited conditions, exceptionally high product yields of up to ca. 30% are obtained. Catalysts synthesized with a co&#8208;precipitation method demonstrate the highest productivity (up to 1440&#160;&#181;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) in methane&#8208;excess conditions, and their full activity can be restored in a subsequent reaction cycle upon a mild thermal treatment. Under high conversion conditions, the co&#8208;precipitated catalyst can achieve methane&#8208;based product yields of ca. 15%. The performance of Mn/TiO2 catalysts using molecular oxygen under less corrosive conditions surpasses that of other heterogeneous catalysts.

The cover art symbolizes the transformation of the mesophilic amylase psA (red) into its cold&#8208;adapted variant psA121 (cyan) through computational linker engineering. The central swirling motif reflects a shift in temperature adaptation, driven by increased interdomain separation between the catalytic domain and the carbohydrate&#8208;binding module. This visual captures how a simple change in linker sequence enables enhanced enzymatic activity at low temperatures by modifying the conformational dynamics of bidomain enzyme amylase, as described by Zhongyue J. Yang et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202505991).

         <title>Confinement of Polyiodides by Dual&#8208;Functional Tetrazine Cathodes in Zn&#8208;I2&#160;Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc&#8208;iodine batteries offer great potential for energy storage due to their long&#8208;term cycle stability, flat voltage plateau, inherent safety, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, their performance is limited by capacity fading and low Coulombic efficiency (CE) caused by the I3&#8208; shuttle effect. In this work, we propose a molecularly engineered tetrazine derivative, 3,6&#8208;bis(2&#8208;morpholinoethyl)&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine (BMT) as a multifunctional cathode to address these challenges. BMT exhibits a reversible two&#8208;electron redox process, boosting charge storage capacity, and forms stable precipitation with I3&#8208; ions at a 1:2 stoichiometric ratio, effectively inhibiting the shuttle of polyiodide by covalent&#8208;electrostatic synergistic confinement. As expected, the BMT&#8208;based cathode exhibits a CE of 99.6% at 2 A g&#8208;1, a high specific discharge capacity of 207 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1 as well as ~100% capacity retention over 33,000 cycles at 2 A g&#8208;1, achieving a record iodine anchoring efficiency. Furthermore, the Zn&#8208;I2 pouch cell with high iodine mass loading (15.5 mg cm&#8208;2) delivers a practical cathode energy density of 145.2 Wh kg&#8208;1 and maintains 76.2% of its capacity after 800 cycles at 2 A g&#8208;1. This work presents a mechanism&#8208;driven cathode design strategy that integrates redox activity and polyiodide confinement, providing a blueprint for the development of stable iodine&#8208;based battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoconfined Polymerization Facilitates Efficient Li+ Transportation in Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) struggle with lithium dendrite growth and long&#8208;term cycling stability due to low ionic conductivity. A nanoconfined polymerization (NCP) strategy was employed to develop a composite GPE (PDA@CityU&#8208;43) comprising porous COF and linear polymers. The crosslinked polymer chains are confined within the nanopores of CityU&#8208;43 along c&#8208;direction, improving polymer distribution and filler&#8208;polymer compatibility. The PDA@CityU&#8208;43 achieves a high ionic conductivity (6.02&#205;10&#8208;3 S&#8201;cm&#8208;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) and a high Li+ transference number (0.82), which is favorable to enhance Li+ transport dynamics and induce uniform Li+ deposition. Thus, the Li||Li cell can stably operate over 6000 h at 0.1 mA cm&#8208;2 and 0.1 mAh cm&#8208;2. The Li||PDA@CityU&#8208;43||LFP demonstrates significantly improved cycling stability at 5C, a reversible capacity of 108 mAh/g after 300 cycles. The Li||PDA@CityU&#8208;43||NCM811 cells with high mass loading (~5.8 mg cm&#8208;2) exhibits 72.5% capacity retention after 100 cycles. This NCP strategy offers a new approach to designing advanced GPEs for Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;rate CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Photoreduction by Dual&#8208;proton Hydrogenation Pathway Over Pd&#8208;Anchored Oxygen&#8208;Deficient ZnO Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoreduction of CO2 into CH4 usually comprises upto eight proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer steps, greatly reducing the conversion performance. Here, we report a new dual&#8208;proton hydrogenation pathway for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion, which can condense every two proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer steps into one single step. Also, we pioneer the use of in situ synchrotron&#8208;radiation vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry to distinguish the crucial HCOOH from COOH intermediates, overcoming the limitation of in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy. Taking the synthetic Pd/ZnO&#8208;VO nanosheets as an example, synchrotron&#8208;radiation X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy discloses the Pd nanoclusters are anchored on the ZnO&#8208;VO nanosheets via building Pd&#8208;O bonds, while theoretical calculation demonstrates charge accumulation on the interfacial Pd sites. In situ spectroscopic characterizations, labelling experiments and adsorption energy calculations collectively establish CO2 undergoes stepwise dual&#8208;proton hydrogenation routes, gradually transforming into *HCOOH, *HCHO, *CH3OH and CH4, different from the traditional CO2&#8208;COOH&#8208;CH4 processes. Thus, the Pd/ZnO&#8208;VO nanosheets exhibit superior CH4 evolution rate of 257.6 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, outperforming all previously reported photocatalysts. This work unlocks an efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 pathway, largely reducing the number of reaction steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Spin State of Ni Single Atomic Center for High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single atom catalysts (SACs) have been widely investigated and regarded as the promising electrocatalysts for carbon dioxide reduction. However, studies on the impact of coordinated&#8208;nitrogen species in active center on the spin state and catalytic activity remain scarce. Herein, two single Ni atom electrocatalysts with distinct pyridinic&#8208;N and pyrrolic&#8208;N coordination through a rapid joule&#8208;heating method that preserves precursor nitrogen configurations. Magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that pyridinic&#8208;N induces a high&#8208;spin state in Ni centers, while pyrrolic&#8208;N stabilizes a low&#8208;spin configuration. The high&#8208;spin Ni&#8208;Npyridinic&#8208;C demonstrates an exceptional performance in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, achieving 98.8% CO Faradaic efficiency in H&#8208;cells and maintaining &gt;99% Faradaic efficiency at industrial current densities (&#8805;250 mA cm&#8208;2) across alkaline, neutral, and acidic electrolytes in a gas&#8208;diffusion flow cell. A maximum power density of 1.89 mW/cm2 and excellent charge&#8208;discharge cyclability also achieve in zinc&#8208;CO2 battery, further demonstrating the applicability of Ni&#8208;Npyridinic&#8208;C. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the high&#8208;spin state enhances d&#8208;orbital dispersion, strengthening hybridization with &#960;* orbital of CO2 and stabilizing *COOH intermediates, thereby accelerating CO2 activation. This study not only establishes a novel strategy for spin&#8208;state engineering through coordination control but also advances scalable electrocatalyst design for efficient carbon cycling.</dc:description>

Herein, two single Ni atom electrocatalysts with distinct pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N coordination through a rapid joule-heating method that preserves precursor nitrogen configurations. Magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that pyridinic-N induces a high-spin state in Ni centers, while pyrrolic-N stabilizes a low-spin configuration. The high-spin Ni-Npyridinic-C demonstrates an exceptional performance in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, achieving 98.8% CO Faradaic efficiency in H-cells and maintaining &amp;gt;99% Faradaic efficiency at industrial current densities (&#8805;250 mA cm-2) across alkaline, neutral, and acidic electrolytes in a gas-diffusion flow cell. A maximum power density of 1.89 mW/cm2 and excellent charge-discharge cyclability also achieve in zinc-CO2 battery, further demonstrating the applicability of Ni-Npyridinic-C. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the high-spin state enhances d-orbital dispersion, strengthening hybridization with &#960;* orbital of CO2 and stabilizing *COOH intermediates, thereby accelerating CO2 activation. This study not only establishes a novel strategy for spin-state engineering through coordination control but also advances scalable electrocatalyst design for efficient carbon cycling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Buried&#8208;Interface&#8208;Modification Strategy for Efficient Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin (Sn)&#8208;based perovskites show great potential for environmentally friendly&#160;and high&#8208;performance&#160;light&#8208;emitting diodes&#160;(LEDs). However, the development of Sn&#8208;based perovskite&#160;LEDs&#160;(PeLEDs) lags significantly behind that of lead&#8208;based&#160;perovskites. This is mainly due to&#160;the faster crystallization&#160;rate&#160;of Sn&#8208;based perovskites that leads&#160;to a higher&#160;defect density in Sn&#8208;based&#160;perovskite films,&#160;thereby serious non&#8208;radiative recombination.&#160;Here, we demonstrated a buried&#8208;interface&#8208;modification (BIM) strategy&#160;to regulate the crystallization kinetics&#160;of Sn&#8208;based perovskite films by using carboxylate&#160;as multifunctional&#160;surface modifiers. We reveal that&#160;the buried interface&#160;is critical to improve the&#160;nucleation and crystallization of Sn&#8208;based perovskite&#160;films. As a result, efficient near&#8208;infrared Sn&#8208;based PeLEDs were achieved with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of&#160;11.9%. This work suggests an efficient and elegant route to obtain&#160;high&#8208;performance Sn&#8208;based perovskite films and devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Helicity and Handedness of Polyaromatics with Isobenzofuranophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The extent of helicity in nonplanar polyaromatic materials affects their electronic, optical and chiroptical properties. However, controlling helicity in different systems typically requires different multistep synthetic approaches for each target compound, often with significant complexity, thereby limiting its applicability. Here, we introduce a helical synthon, isobenzofuranophane, with either a short or long tether, which enables late&#8208;stage helicity induction and control in aromatic frameworks. We demonstrate the applicability of this synthon by reacting it with a [5]helicene aryne precursor, where both the handedness and helicene pitch are remotely&#8208;controlled by the tether length, directly affecting the (chiro)optical properties of the helicene. The X&#8208;ray structures support these findings with up to 35&#176; torsion for a single benzene ring, demonstrating the potential of isobenzofuranophane to induce significant curvature to polyaromatic molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>An Atomically Dispersed Photocatalyst for Undirected para&#8208;Selective C&#8211;H bond Functionalizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regioselective C&#8211;H bond functionalization is pivotal in modern scientific exploration, offering solutions for achieving novel synthetic methodologies and pharmaceutical development. In this aspect, achieving exceptional regioselective functionalization, like para&#8208;selective products in electron&#8208;poor aromatics, diverges from traditional methods. Leveraging the advantages of atomically dispersed photocatalysts, we designed a robust photocatalyst for an unconventional regioselective aromatic C&#8211;H bond functionalization. This innovation enabled para&#8208;selective trifluoromethylations of electron&#8208;deficient meta&#8208;directing aromatics (&#8208;NO2, &#8208;CF3, &#8208;CN, etc.), which is entirely orthogonal to the traditional approaches. Mechanistic experiments and DFT analysis confirmed the interaction between Cu&#8208;atom and the aromatic substrate, alongside the photocatalyst's molecular arrangement, driving selective exposure of the para&#8208;selective functionalization. This strategic approach elucidated pathways for precise molecular transformations, advancing the frontier of regioselective C&#8211;H bond functionalization by using atomically dispersed photocatalysts in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationally Designed Asymmetric Pt&#8208;O&#8208;Cu Ligand to Stabilize Active Sites towards Superior Industrial&#8208;Standard Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient and durable Pt&#8208;based catalysts via interface engineering remains a critical yet challenging task for water electrolysis under high&#8208;pH conditions. Herein, we designed a unique asymmetric Pt&#8208;O&#8208;Cu ligand at the PtCu2(111)/CuO(002) heterojunction interface to promote alkaline HER kinetics. This ligand balances the adsorption and desorption of H* on the Pt site by accelerating electron transfer at the interface while enhancing the adsorption of H2O on the Cu site. Moreover, the strong d&#8208;d/sp hybridization and more delocalized d&#8208;DOS located at the Pt&#8208;O&#8208;Cu ligand enhance the interatomic interactions, which helps alleviate the dissolution and agglomeration of Pt and Cu atoms. As anticipated, the PtCu2/CuO requires ultra&#8208;low overpotentials of 10, 14 and 47 mV in, respectively, alkaline, acidic and neutral electrolytes to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Even more surprising is that the PtCu2/CuO||RuO2 dual&#8208;electrode hydrolysis cell can stably operate at a high current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 for more than 500 h in a simulated industrial environment, demonstrating significant potential for industrial applications. This work provides a new paradigm for the design of industrially relevant high&#8208;performance Pt&#8208;based alkaline hydrogen evolution catalytic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering and Predicting Thermal and pH Stabilities of Triplex DNA under Multifactorial Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triplex DNA, a critical non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid structure, plays essential roles in gene regulation, disease pathogenesis and therapeutic targeting. To unravel how environmental and sequence factors modulate triplex stability, we developed a high&#8208;throughput five&#8208;dimensional fluorescence resonance energy transfer melting&#8208;annealing (5DFRETMA) method. No less than 414 sets of buffer conditions were tested. Monotonically negative correlations were observed between thermal stability and pH, as well as between pH stability and temperature. These relationships are sequence&#8208;dependent: triplexes with higher G&#8226;C+ Hoogsteen base pair content display a higher sensitivity to pH and temperature variations. Ionic strength exerts dual effects: stabilizing the Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds in A&#8226;T base pairs while destabilizing them in G&#8226;C+ base pairs, resulting in a complex ionic strength&#8208;dependent stability diagram. Critically, as the G&#8226;C+ content increases, the relationship between triplex stability and ionic strength shifts progressively from a monotonically positive to negative dependence. We developed predictive models that not only predict thermal stability but also pioneer the prediction of pH stability under variable pHs/temperatures and ionic environments. This work advances the mechanistic understanding of triplex DNA behavior in biologically complex settings, offering tools for the rational design of gene&#8208;targeted therapeutics and synthetic biology applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Physical Properties of [n]Cycloparaphenylene Ketone (n = 6, 7, 8, and 10)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[n]Cycloparaphenylene ketones ([n]CPP&#8208;COs, n = 6&#8211;10), featuring a carbonyl group embedded in the CPP framework, were synthesized via coupling and reductive aromatization. X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT calculations confirmed their M&#246;bius topology and notable strain around the carbonyl group, also supported by size&#8208;dependent IR shifts. The CPP units elevate the HOMO energy, resulting in a &#960;&#8211;&#960;* singlet excited state (S&#8321;) instead of the typical n&#8211;&#960;* triplet. As a result, intersystem crossing is suppressed and the compounds fluoresce without phosphorescence. Molecular oxygen quenches the S&#8321; state, indicating an energy transfer process. Optical and electrochemical measurements reveal that smaller rings exhibit greater strain, red&#8208;shifted spectra, and lower oxidation potentials. These findings underscore how molecular topology and strain profoundly influence the electronic structure and excited&#8208;state dynamics, offering new insights for designing advanced &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials.</dc:description>

The CPP units elevate the HOMO energy, resulting in a &#960;&#8211;&#960;* singlet excited state (S&#8321;) instead of the typical n&#8211;&#960;* triplet. As a result, intersystem crossing is suppressed and the compounds fluoresce without phosphorescence. Molecular oxygen quenches the S&#8321; state, indicating an energy transfer process. Optical and electrochemical measurements reveal that smaller rings exhibit greater strain, red-shifted spectra, and lower oxidation potentials. These findings underscore how molecular topology and strain profoundly influence the electronic structure and excited-state dynamics, offering new insights for designing advanced &#960;-conjugated materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conformational Engineering of Solvent Molecules for High&#8208;Voltage and Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;voltage and fast&#8208;charging lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are crucial for overcoming electric vehicle range and charging limitations. However, conventional carbonate electrolytes face intrinsic limitations in simultaneously achieving compatibility with high&#8208;voltage and lithium metal anode. These limitations arise from sluggish Li+ transport kinetics and parasitic side reactions, both largely driven by excessive Li+ solvation energy inherent to carbonates. To address these challenges, we propose a conformational engineering strategy of fluorinated solvent molecules by developing a 2,2,3,3,4,4&#8208;hexafluoropentanedioic&#183;anhydride (HFPA)&#8208;derived electrolyte (HFPE). The chair conformation of HFPA synergizes with its high F/C ratio to establish a low&#8208;polarity solvation environment, effectively reducing desolvation energy barriers. In addition, the HFPA&#8208;induced ligand preference for anion aggregation contributes to the formation of anion&#8208;rich dissolved sheaths while stabilizing the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases. The engineered HFPE demonstrates accelerated interfacial ion transport kinetics with an enhanced Li+ transference number of 0.64. When paired with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes under stringent operating conditions (4.5 V cut&#8208;off voltage, 10 C&#8208;rate), HFPE&#8208;enabled cells exhibit exceptional cycling stability. Notably, industrial&#8208;scale 5.6 Ah lithium metal pouch cells employing HFPE maintain stable operation at 4.5 V, underscoring the practical viability of this conformation modulation approach. This work establishes a paradigm&#8208;shifting strategy for next&#8208;generation electrolyte design in practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Conformationally rigid bridged bicyclic scaffolds have emerged as bioisosteric replacements for planar aromatic rings. However, bioisosteric mimetics of heteroaromatic rings have been investigated less due to the challenges of incorporating heteroatoms into bicycloalkanes. Herein, we report a unified strategy to access both aza&#8208; and oxa&#8208;bicyclo [3.1.1]heptanes in a single experimental protocol from a readily accessible amino/hydroxy acid derivative under photoredox catalysis. The reaction exhibits a broad scope across a range of redox&#8208;active esters and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) and successfully provides previously inaccessible spiro&#8208; and fused&#8208;hetero&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes. Noteworthy, chiral amino/hydroxy acids derived redox&#8208;active esters could be used to access enantioenriched hetero&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes. Furthermore, the strategy has been extended to access aza&#8208;bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes, another important motif in medicinal chemistry. The functional groups introduced during the reaction serve as a synthetic handle for downstream manipulations, thus offering opportunities to build up molecular complexity rapidly. Density functional theory calculations and experimental studies support an oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism and rationalize the observed regioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Chelation&#8208;Driven Electrolyte Design for Enhanced Interface and Electrochemical Window in Aqueous Aluminum Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries have garnered significant attention owing to the abundance of aluminum resources, high theoretical specific capacity, and excellent safety. However, challenges such as electrolyte&#8208;induced water decomposition, aluminum anode corrosion, and electrode material compatibility continue to constrain their performance. In this study, we restructured the solvation environment using the chelating reagent Bis(2&#8208;methoxyethyl)amine (BMEA), achieving an expanded electrochemical window of 2.2 V and mitigating hydrogen evolution side reactions. Advanced atom probe tomography analysis confirmed that BMEA actively participates in the formation of the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI), effectively preventing aluminum surface corrosion and extending the cycle life of the aluminum anode. Employed as a BMEA&#8208;containing electrolyte in aluminum&#8208;organic batteries, the resulting Al||Tetrachloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TCB) battery delivered a high capacity of 218.0 mAh g&#8722;1 and demonstrated stable cycling over 300 cycles. This study highlights the potential of surface chelating agents in advancing high&#8208;performance aluminum batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Highly Efficient Luminescence and Multiphoton Absorption Character in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence&#160;Emitters Based on a Tetrabenzo[a,c]Phenazine Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quadrupolar architectural paradigm has been harnessed to reconcile the competing demands of molecular planarity and orbital separation, thereby facilitating the concurrent realization of multiphoton absorption and thermally activated delayed fluorescence. This molecular engineering approach endows the emitters with efficient triplet harvesting and enhanced nonlinear optical properties, advancing their potential for dual&#8208;mode applications.








Abstract
The integration of multiphoton absorption phenomenon (MPA) with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials opens new avenues for bio&#8208;optoelectronic applications. However, the development of TADF emitters that simultaneously exhibit triplet harvesting and MPA is hindered by the challenge of balancing molecular planarity, reduced orbital overlap, and large oscillator strength. In this study, we demonstrate a quadrupolar molecular design based on the tetrabenzo[a,c]phenazine (TBPZ) to accomplish efficient MPA and TADF performance. Two new TADF emitters, TBPZ2TPA and TBPZ2NP, were synthesized, featuring an electron&#8208;accepting TBPZ core and electron&#8208;donating triarylamine (TAA) units to achieve an optimal balance between TADF and MPA characteristics. Particularly, TBPZ2TPA blended film exhibits orange&#8208;red emission with a maximum at 589&#160;nm, a high photoluminescence quantum yield (&#1060;PL) of 71%, a sufficiently small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) of 0.16&#160;eV and reversed intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) of 1.3 &#215; 104 s&#8722;1. Furthermore, it demonstrated a remarkable two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) cross&#8208;section (&#963;2) of 892 GM at 780&#160;nm and an excellent 2PA brightness of 785 GM, along with evident three&#8208;photon absorption (3PA) at 1200&#160;nm. These results provide a compelling strategy for developing high&#8208;performance TADF emitters with exceptional MPA properties, enabling dual functionality for both OLEDs and high&#8208;resolution bioimaging.

         <title>Trigonal Planar Bis(carbene)Cu(I) Complexes Enable Divergent H2 Activation with H2O for Accelerated Olefin Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CuH&#8208;catalyzed olefin hydrogenation is rare compared to those of carbonyl&#8208;derived substrates. Olefin insertion into Cu&#8208;H to form Cu&#8208;alkyl is ubiquitous; however, subsequent H2 activation remains unknown to our knowledge. Herein, we investigated the transformations of &#946;&#8208;H elimination, H2 cleavage, and catalytic olefin hydrogenation in a series of linear and trigonal planar Cu(I)&#8208;alkyl complexes supported by monodentate N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and bidentate naphthyridine&#8208;bis(carbene) ligands, respectively. Contrary to unreactive linear species, trigonal planar variants promote &#946;&#8208;H elimination, hydrogenolysis, and catalytic hydrogenation of unactivated alkenes at mild temperature and H2 pressure. The rare isolation of a naphthyridine&#8208;bis(carbene)CuH monomer further affirms two predominant competing pathways for H2 cleavage of metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity at Cu(I)&#8208;alkyl or internal electrophilic substitution at Cu(I)&#8208;OH. Employing either isolated or in situ generated Cu(I)&#8208;OH complex, via protonolysis of alkyl precatalyst by adventitious water, significantly accelerated catalysis compared to that operating primarily by the metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity pathway. DFT calculations and energy decomposition analysis on the disparate &#946;&#8208;H elimination reactivity between linear and trigonal planar tert&#8208;butyl complexes and the mechanism of H2 activation at a hydroxide complex, indicate that coordination geometry at Cu(I) and properties of the naphthyridine&#8208;bis(carbene) ligand are integral to the transformations reported here.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Solvating Sites for Stable High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;anchoring strategy is proposed to regulate the solvating sites of diglyme (G2) molecular via specific anchoring agents 1,1,1,3,3&#8208;pentafluorobutane (PFB) and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE). This strategy results in an electrolyte with exceptional compatibility with both lithium metal anode and high&#8208;voltage cathode, enabling stable lithium metal battery.








Abstract
The long&#8208;lasting stability of high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) critically rely on both the cathodic and anodic stability of electrolytes, which can be enhanced by increasing the salt&#8208;to&#8208;solvent molar ratio. However, this approach is limited by solubility constraints. In this work, we introduce a dual&#8208;anchoring strategy to regulate the solvating sites of glymes via directional atomic interactions. Specifically, F&#948;&#8722;&#8211;H&#948;+ interactions transform the Li+&#8208;glyme coordination and induce more anion coordination within Li+ primary solvation sheath, whereas H&#948;+&#8211;O&#948;&#8722; interactions reduce the electron density at free oxygen sites, thus raising the oxidational potential of glyme and enhancing the overall oxidation stability of electrolytes. This strategy results in an electrolyte with exceptional compatibility with both lithium metal anode (LMA) and high&#8208;voltage cathode, enabling LMA with an ultrahigh coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.76%. Furthermore, the assembled LMBs exhibit extended lifespans, retaining 80% of their capacity under aggressive conditions: 834 and 370 cycles at 4.4 and 4.5&#160;V, respectively, for 30&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;Li||2.0&#8208;mAh cm&#8722;2 LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells and 100 cycles for anode&#8208;free Cu||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 pouch cells. This work offers novel insights into the advancement of next&#8208;generation LMBs based on ether&#8208;based electrolytes.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

The QPAF&#8208;225&#8208;10 (10% QPAF&#8208;225 in membrane) integrated quaternary ammonium &#8208;functionalized porous aromatic frameworks (QPAF&#8208;225) and sulfonated poly[2,2&#8242;&#8208;(p&#8208;oxydiphenyl)&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;biphenylimidazole] (SOPBI), forming a self&#8208;reinforcing ionic crosslinking network to achieve high proton conductivity of 174 mS cm&#8722;1 and the peak power density of 847&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 at high&#8208;temperature (200&#160;&#176;C) proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT&#8208;PEMFCs. High&#8208;density basic sites in QPAF&#8208;225 suppressed the PA leakage, illustrating 0.04&#160;mV h&#8722;1 voltage decay (904&#160;h) and robust mechanical stability. This framework&#8208;engineered strategy overcomes PA&#8208;PBI (PA&#8208;doped polybenzimidazole) membrane limitations, enabling durable HT&#8208;PEMFCs.








Abstract
In optimizing the trade&#8208;off between power density and phosphoric acid (PA) retention in PA&#8208;doped polybenzimidazole (PA&#8208;PBI) membrane for improving performance of high&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs), the self&#8208;reinforcing network of interfacial interactions of the HT&#8208;PEMs has to be deeply investigated. In this paper, a breakthrough strategy employing a quaternary ammonium (QA)&#8208;functionalized porous aromatic framework (QPAF&#8208;225) to synergistically integrate with sulfonated poly[2,2&#8242;&#8208;(p&#8208;oxydiphenylene)&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;bibenzimidazole] (SOPBI) to form the robust HT&#8208;PEM is successfully developed. The ionic interactions between the cationic QA moieties and anionic sulfonic acid groups can establish a self&#8208;reinforcing proton&#8208;conductive network, while the high&#8208;density basic sites in QPAF&#8208;225 act as the PA reservoirs and can mitigate the leakage. When benchmarked against QA&#8208;deficient PAF&#8208;225&#8211;10 (10% PAF&#8208;225 in composite membrane) composite HT&#8208;PEMs and pristine SOPBI, the QPAF&#8208;225&#8211;10 composite delivers a high proton conductivity of 174 mS cm&#8722;1 at 200&#160;&#176;C and extremely high peak power density of 847&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 of the HT&#8208;PEMFC under ultralow Pt/C loading (0.3&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) at 200&#160;&#176;C operation, which surpasses most of PA&#8208;PBI systems reported in literatures. Critically, such a membrane exhibits ultralow voltage decay rate (0.04&#160;mV h&#8722;1 over 904&#160;h at 200&#160;&#176;C) and high PA retention ability, coupled with mechanical robustness exceeding industrial durability thresholds. This work transcends conventional additives by exploiting porous aromatic framework&#8208;mediated proton channels and PA&#8208;philic motifs, establishing a material paradigm for next&#8208;generation HT&#8208;PEMs that reconciles high&#8208;power operation with long&#8208;term stability in harsh electrochemical environments.

         <title>Intracellular CO2 Capture Triggered Outperforming Biocatalytic Production of Selective Acetic Acid and Biohydrogen Housing in Porous&#8208;Organic&#8208;Nanofiber</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrofermentation platform using VJ&#8208;POP, a polycarbazole&#8208;based porous polymer, enhances intracellular CO&#8322; capture, enabling selective acetic acid (2.11&#160;g L&#8722;1) and biohydrogen production by Bacillus subtilis without genetic modification. VJ&#8208;POP improves electron transfer, CO&#8322; adsorption, and metabolic specificity, offering a scalable solution for sustainable CO&#8322; valorization.








Abstract
The increasing concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) necessitates innovative biocatalytic strategies for its utilization in sustainable chemical production. This study introduces a novel electrofermentation (EF) platform integrating polycarbazole&#8208;based porous organic polymer (VJ&#8208;POP)&#8208;coated electrodes to enhance selective acetic acid (AA) biosynthesis by Bacillus subtilis. Impressive high surface area and tailored porosity facilitate efficient CO&#8322; capture, modulate intracellular metabolic fluxes, and improve electron transfer, thereby driving product specificity. In the bioreactor equipped with VJ&#8208;POP, AA production reached 2.11&#160;g L&#8722;1 with a yield of 0.48&#160;g g&#8722;1, achieving 71% of the theoretical maximum without genetic modifications. The process also resulted in enriched biohydrogen content (52%) in the biogas (H2&#160;+&#160;CO2) composition, highlighting the synergistic effect of VJ&#8208;POP on CO&#8322; sequestration and microbial metabolism. Gene expression analysis revealed significant upregulation of ackA (acetate kinase) and pdhA (pyruvate dehydrogenase), while buk (butyrate kinase) was downregulated, ensuring metabolic selectivity toward AA. Cyclic voltammetry and impedance analysis unambiguously confirmed an interesting phenomenon of enhanced electron transfer and reduced charge&#8208;transfer resistance in VJ&#8208;POP&#8208;assisted systems. Computational analysis using density functional theory (DFT) revealed stronger binding energy for CO2 (&#8722;17.4&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1) compared to H2 (&#8722;2.5&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1), driven by a mix of van der Waals and weak electrostatic interactions for CO2 versus solely weak van der Waals&#8208;based physisorption for H2. This pioneering approach with unique investigation results presents a scalable and sustainable biocatalytic framework for CO&#8322; valorization, bridging material science and microbial electrochemical systems for selective AA and enhanced biohydrogen production.

         <title>Photochemical Conversion of Indazoles into Benzimidazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a photochemical strategy for transforming 1H&#8208; and 2H&#8208;indazoles into benzimidazoles, enabling heteroaromatic interconversion under mild conditions. This approach, grounded in a two&#8208;step mechanism of excited&#8208;state tautomerization and photochemical rearrangement, offers broad scope, high yields, and functional group tolerance, expanding the diversity of heterocycle&#8208;based libraries for fragment&#8208;based drug discovery.

Fragment&#8208;based drug discovery relies on preparing diverse libraries of advanced building blocks, often incorporating heteroaromatic motifs. Altering the core of heteroaromatics to maximize library diversity typically requires de novo synthesis of each system. This can be often challenging when specific substitution patterns are needed. Here, we introduce a photochemical strategy for the direct permutation of 1H&#8208; and 2H&#8208;indazoles into benzimidazoles. This transformation exploits the distinct photochemical properties of these heteroaromatics and proceeds under mild conditions. Through systematic experimental and computational studies, we have elucidated a two&#8208;step mechanism involving excited&#8208;state tautomerization of 1H&#8208;indazoles, followed by photochemical rearrangement of the resulting 2H&#8208;isomers. This approach demonstrates broad substrate scope, high yields, and compatibility with a variety of functional groups. This method can expand the structural diversity of heterocycle&#8208;based libraries through the concept of chemical permutation for heteroaromatic interconversion.

         <title>Chain&#8211;Chain Synergistic Hydrogel Electrolytes Regulate Zinc Ions Desolvation for Stabilized Anodes and High Operating Voltage in Flexible Zinc Ions Hybrid Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel electrolyte is composed of P(AM&#8208;SBMA) polymer chains and hydrophilic gelatin chains, which can effectively regulate the desolvation process of zinc ions, realize the rapid transference and uniform deposition of zinc ions, and stabilize the zinc anode interface. The assembled flexible zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors can operate at high operating voltages.








Abstract
To maximize the energy density output, the complementary charge storage mechanism of aqueous zinc ion hybrid capacitors (ZIHCs) is superior and advanced, but continuous water&#8208;induced side reactions and uncontrolled dendrite growth of zinc anodes remain challenging. Additionally, the optimization of the hydrogel electrolyte/electrode interface is necessary for the stability and kinetic reversibility of the flexible zinc&#8208;based energy storage device. Herein, the P(AM&#8208;SBMA) (copolymer of acrylamide AM and zwitterionic compound SBMA)/gelatin hydrogel electrolyte (PSG) with a special semi&#8208;interpenetrating network is designed based on the chain&#8211;chain synergistic regulation mechanism to regulate the desolvation of zinc ions and optimize the operating voltage of flexible ZIHCs and stabilize surface chemistry of zinc anode. The obtained PSG&#8208;5 hydrogel electrolyte widens the electrochemical stability windows (ESW) of the flexible ZIHC to 2.45&#160;V and achieves high Zn2+ transference number of 0.87 and highly reversible plating/stripping of the zinc anode. Furthermore, the corresponding flexible ZIHC exhibits a high operating voltage of 2.2&#160;V and provides a favorable energy density of 117&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 293&#160;W kg&#8722;1. This work provides useful insights for the development of efficient, flexible ZIHCs by preparing hydrogel electrolytes capable of stabilizing zinc anodes and widening ESW.

         <title>A Diazo Linker Ligand Promotes Flexibility and Induced Fit Binding in a Microporous Copper Coordination Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of three isostructural coordination networks differs only in the central part of the linker ligand. Whereas a linker comprising an azo bond enabled guest&#8208;induced structural flexibility, including induced fit behavior, networks containing linkers with hydrocarbon moieties were observed to be rigid upon exposure to the same guests.








Abstract
Flexible organic linkers represent an intuitive and effective strategy to design flexible metal&#8211;organic materials. We report herein a systematic study concerning the effect of varying the central bond of mixed pyridyl&#8208;benzoate linkers, L, upon the flexibility of three isostructural kdd topology microporous coordination networks (CNs) of formula ML2: X&#8208;kdd&#8208;1&#8208;Cu, 1 = L = (E)&#8208;4&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yldiazenyl)benzoate; X&#8208;kdd&#8208;2&#8208;Cu, 2 = L = (E)&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)benzoate; the previously reported X&#8208;kdd&#8208;3&#8208;Cu, 3 = L = 4&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ylethynyl)benzoate. As revealed by single crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and gas sorption studies, X&#8208;kdd&#8208;1&#8208;Cu, exhibited gate&#8208;opening during CO2 and hydrocarbon (C2 and C8) sorption experiments whereas the other two CNs did not. Insight into these phase transformations was gained from in situ variable&#8208;pressure and variable temperature powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), SCXRD, and modeling. Rotation of ligand 1 around the diazo bond, torsion angle changes between phenyl and carboxylate moieties, and deformation of the Cu&#8208;based rod building blocks enabled activated X&#8208;kdd&#8208;1&#8208;Cu to form new phases with C8 isomers and CH2Cl2, CH2Cl2 inducing contraction of the activated phase. Computational studies suggest that 1 enables flexibility thanks to its lower barrier of deformation versus 2 or 3. This study teaches that diazo moieties could offer a general strategy to enhance the flexibility of CNs.

         <title>Ionic Liquid Accelerates Electrochemically Driven Single&#8208;Molecule Oxidative Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microscopic configuration of a single&#8208;molecule junction was arbitrarily modulated from flat to titled using 1&#8208;hexyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (HMIMPF6). When combined with electrochemical modulation, the final upright configuration can promote the bond&#8208;forming reactions to obtain the azo molecules.








Abstract
Molecular adsorption covers a broad spectrum of chemical processes and device fabrications at solid/liquid interfaces. The unraveling of the underlying mechanisms relies on regulating molecular adsorption. However, achieving such regulation at the single&#8208;molecule level remains a challenge. Herein, we utilized a combined ionic liquid and scanning tunneling microscope break junction methods to tune single 4&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)aniline molecules gradually from the flat configuration to the upright one and found that only the upright configuration can trigger the oxidative coupling. Experimental and theoretical findings demonstrated that the ionic liquid reduced the electron density of the Au electrode, giving rise to the evolution of the interaction between molecule and electrode from the Au&#8208;&#960; dominated coupling to the Au&#8208;&#963; dominated one. This work will inspire the exploration of strategies that can control the molecular assembly, accelerate the chemical reaction, and promote the fabrication of organic devices.

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of 3D Metal Cluster&#8208;Based COFs With Record High&#8208;Connectivity for Efficient Photocatalytic H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two crystalline 3D [8&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;connected MCCOFs were synthesized by condensing Al8&#8208;8c with linear dialdehyde linkers for the first time. These AlCCOFs showed excellent photocatalytic O2&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 conversion performances, with the maximum H2O2 yield of 16794.69&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 for AlCCOF&#8208;1.








Abstract
The assembly of metal clusters with organic building units by covalent bonds to form metal cluster&#8208;based covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (MCCOFs) material is a novel strategy in reticular synthesis. However, only 2, 3, and 6 connectivity of MCCOFs have been achieved in reported structures. Developing a higher connectivity remains a great challenge in the MCCOFs due to the difficulties in introducing multiple connecting nodes to the metal cluster. In this work, two 3D [8&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;connected MCCOFs were synthesized by condensing an 8&#8208;connectivity aluminum cluster&#8208;based building block (termed Al8&#8208;8c) with linear dialdehyde linkers. Furthermore, these AlCCOFs showed efficient photocatalytic O2&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 conversion due to the suitable energy band structure, efficient photoelectron conversion capability and the AlCCOF&#8208;1 showed H2O2 photosynthetic efficiency of 16794.69&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 using water and benzyl alcohol reaction system. The in situ EPR, in situ FTIR, and DFT calculations were then performed to study the structure&#8208;function relationships on the two AlCCOFs for H2O2 photosynthesis. This work is the first report of high&#8208;connectivity MCCOFs bearing 8&#8208;connected cluster units, showing the great potential of using metal clusters to construct complicate reticular frameworks by covalent linkage.

In this work, two 3D [8&#160;+&#160;2]-connected MCCOFs were synthesized by condensing an 8-connectivity aluminum cluster-based building block (termed Al&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-8c) with linear dialdehyde linkers. Furthermore, these AlCCOFs showed efficient photocatalytic O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion due to the suitable energy band structure, efficient photoelectron conversion capability and the AlCCOF-1 showed H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthetic efficiency of 16794.69&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; using water and benzyl alcohol reaction system. The in situ EPR, in situ FTIR, and DFT calculations were then performed to study the structure-function relationships on the two AlCCOFs for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis. This work is the first report of high-connectivity MCCOFs bearing 8-connected cluster units, showing the great potential of using metal clusters to construct complicate reticular frameworks by covalent linkage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Library of Stereoregular Polythioesters for Stereocomplex Formation Enabled by Isomerization&#8208;Driven Cationic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled and racemization&#8208;free/suppressed IROPs of nine chiral five&#8208;membered thionolactones have been achieved, which allows an unprecedented access to a library of new stereoregular polythioesters. Studies on the relationship structure&#8211;stereocomplexation lead to the disclosure of two new polythioester crystalline stereocomplexes and also offer mechanistic insights into the formation ability.








Abstract
Supramolecular stereocomplexation is an important tool to advance sustainable polymers, and oxygen&#8208;containing polymers represent the most widely studied materials for stereocomplexation. However, the sulfur&#8208;containing analogues, a newly emerged class of sustainable polymers, remain essentially unexplored because of a significant challenge encountered in the synthesis of stereoregular polymers and relatively low supramolecular interaction. In this contribution, by the utilization of [Et3O]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; as a metal&#8208;free cationic initiator, controlled isomerization&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening polymerizations (IROPs) of nine examples of chiral five&#8208;membered thionolactones have been achieved with free or suppressed racemization via unique monomer&#8208;stabilized SN2 propagation mechanism, which allows an unprecedented access to a library of new stereoregular polythioesters with high isotacticities (80.0%&#8211;99.5%). The investigations into structure&#8211;stereocomplexation relationship led to the disclosure of two new polythioester stereocomplexes with high melting temperatures (117.0&#8211;161.0 &#176;C). The fundamental aspects of stereocomplex formation mechanism and critical factors that affect stereocomplexed ability have also been revealed.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Oxygen Coordination Steering *NO Hydrogenation in Nitrate Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogenation pathway of the *NO intermediate is a critical step determining the selectivity of hydroxylamine, yet current understanding remains limited. Studies reveal that the hydrogenation sites of the *NO intermediate are governed by the cobalt coordination environment. Specifically, *NO adsorbs in a bridged configuration on 4&#8208;coordinate cobalt sites, which facilitates nitrogen&#8208;site hydrogenation, whereas it adsorbs in an on&#8208;top manner on 6&#8208;coordinate cobalt sites, promoting oxygen&#8208;site hydrogenation.








Abstract
Understanding the hydrogenation behavior of *NO during electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is essential for designing catalysts with high selectivity toward ammonia (NH3) and valuable intermediates like hydroxylamine. Spinel cobalt oxides (Co3O4) are promising NO3RR electrocatalysts, yet the exact *NO hydrogenation mechanism remains unclear. Here, we integrate theoretical calculations and systematic experiments to reveal that the hydrogenation pathway is dictated by the coordination environment, which can be tuned via crystal facet engineering. Co3O4 nanoparticles enriched with (111) facets (o&#8208;Co3O4) and (100) facets (c&#8208;Co3O4) were synthesized to expose 4&#8208; and 6&#8208;coordinated Co sites, respectively. Theoretical results show that o&#8208;Co3O4 favors nitrogen&#8208;site hydrogenation (&#8727;NO&#8594;&#8727;NHO$ ^*\text{NO}\to ^*\text{NHO} $), while c&#8208;Co3O4 promotes oxygen&#8208;site hydrogenation (&#8727;NO&#8594;&#8727;NHO$ ^*\text{NO}\to ^*\text{NHO} $), leading to distinct rate&#8208;determining steps. This selectivity is experimentally supported by in situ spectroscopy, which detects the *NH2OH intermediate exclusively on o&#8208;Co3O4. Consequently, o&#8208;Co3O4 achieves superior NO3RR performance, with a Faradaic efficiency of 99.4% and an NH3 yield rate of 12.8&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 at&#160;&#8722;0.4&#160;V. This work uncovers the coordination&#8208;governed mechanism of *NO hydrogenation and establishes facet engineering as an effective strategy for directing reaction pathways in NO3RR.

         <title>Electronic Modulation and Active Site Exposure Using C60 Fullerenolamine Enable High&#8208;Performance Alcohol Oxidation on Pd Metallene Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through Pd&#8208;NH&#8322; coordination bonding, C60 fullerolamine (FA) was successfully anchored onto the Pd metallene (Pdene) surface. This surface functionalization induces an electron&#8208;deficient state in Pd through charge redistribution while simultaneously enhancing the electrochemical active surface area. The resulting electron&#8208;deficient Pd sites demonstrate optimized adsorption behavior toward ethanol oxidation intermediates. These synergistic effects endow FA&#8208;Pdene to exhibit enhanced mass activity and specific activity for ethanol oxidation compared to Pdene.








Abstract
The availability of active sites and the electronic structure of metal heterogeneous catalysts are crucial to maximize their catalytic performance. In this study, we describe a new and efficient catalyst system, C60 fullerenolamine (FA)&#8208;modified Pd metallene (Pdene), and demonstrate that the FA molecules not only increase the active sites availability but also exert an electronic effect that enhances the catalytic performance of Pdene in alcohol oxidation reactions. Specifically, FA increases the electrochemical active surface area through dispersion, while its electron&#8208;withdrawing characteristics induce an electron&#8208;deficient surface on Pdene, which facilitates the adsorption of electron&#8208;rich intermediates (OH*) and the desorption of electron&#8208;deficient poisonous intermediates (CO*). The practical significance of this modification is demonstrated by achieving a 54.5% increase in mass activity and 46.3% enhancement in specific activity for ethanol oxidation relative to Pdene. Beyond these improvements, the FA&#8208;Pdene catalyst demonstrates exceptional operational stability, superior CO poisoning resistance, and enhanced C1 pathway selectivity. An in&#8208;depth analysis utilizing in&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, coupled with density functional theory calculations, offers valuable insights into how the FA ligand modulates the mechanistic pathways involved in ethanol oxidation processes. This fullerene&#8208;mediated catalytic effect could hold the key to unlocking the potential of the metal&#8208;based system.

         <title>Atomically Engineered Acridine Derivatives Serve as Metal&#8208;Free and Self&#8208;Sensitized Catalysts for Solar&#8208;Driven CO2 to Formic Acid with High&#8208;Efficiency and Near&#8208;Perfect Selectivity</title>

We reported the design and first discovery of acridine derivatives (DADN, PXZN, and PTZN) as new&#8208;type, metal&#8208;free, self&#8208;sensitized catalysts that enabled exceptional performance in solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to formic acid.








Abstract
Achieving efficient and selective light&#8208;driven CO2 conversion to formic acid is a significant scientific challenge, particularly when utilizing purely organic, metal&#8208;free, and earth&#8208;abundant element&#8208;based molecule photocatalysts. Herein, we first reported the discovery of acridine derivatives (DADN, PXZN, and PTZN) as new&#8208;type, metal&#8208;free, self&#8208;sensitized molecule catalysts that enabled exceptional performance in solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to formic acid. Notably, the atomically engineered sulfur&#8208;containing heterocycle PTZN demonstrated unprecedented formate yield rate of 47.8&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and &gt;99% selectivity in a photocatalytic system using 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;3&#8208;ium (BI+) as proton and electron relay. The superior activity of PTZN was revealed to arise from its synergistic combination of strong CO2&#8208;binding affinity (&#8722;0.195&#160;eV), prolonged charge&#8208;separated states (11&#160;ns), and robust CO2 electronic coupling (2.51&#160;eV). Comprehensive studies including in situ electron spin resonance, in situ infrared, and transient absorption spectroscopy unambiguously unveiled a direct single electron transfer process from the excited singlet&#8208;state acridine derivatives to CO2, generating CO2&#183;&#8722;. Moreover, a hydrogen atom transfer process utilizing in situ generated BIH as a hydrogen atom carrier enabled the conversion of CO2&#183;&#8722; to formic acid. This work establishes the first demonstration of a sequential proton&#8211;electron transfer mechanism in acridine&#8208;based photocatalysis, resolving long&#8208;standing challenges in proton and electron delivery during CO2 activation.

Herein, we first reported the discovery of acridine derivatives &lt;b&gt;(DADN&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;PXZN&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;PTZN&lt;/b&gt;) as new-type, metal-free, self-sensitized molecule catalysts that enabled exceptional performance in solar-driven CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to formic acid. Notably, the atomically engineered sulfur-containing heterocycle &lt;b&gt;PTZN&lt;/b&gt; demonstrated unprecedented formate yield rate of 47.8&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and &amp;gt;99% selectivity in a photocatalytic system using 1,3-dimethyl-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-benzo[&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]imidazol-3-ium (BI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) as proton and electron relay. The superior activity of &lt;b&gt;PTZN&lt;/b&gt; was revealed to arise from its synergistic combination of strong CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-binding affinity (&#8722;0.195&#160;eV), prolonged charge-separated states (11&#160;ns), and robust CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electronic coupling (2.51&#160;eV). Comprehensive studies including in situ electron spin resonance, in situ infrared, and transient absorption spectroscopy unambiguously unveiled a direct single electron transfer process from the excited singlet-state acridine derivatives to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, generating CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#183;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, a hydrogen atom transfer process utilizing in situ generated BIH as a hydrogen atom carrier enabled the conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#183;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to formic acid. This work establishes the first demonstration of a sequential proton&#8211;electron transfer mechanism in acridine-based photocatalysis, resolving long-standing challenges in proton and electron delivery during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Maximizing Accessible Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Sites on Highly Curved Surfaces via Chemical Vapor Deposition for Boosting Multienzyme&#8208;Like Activities of Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a strategy to maximize the density of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites on highly curved surfaces, thereby enhancing active site utilization and optimizing the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). The prepared catalyst exhibits significantly enhanced multienzyme&#8208;like activities compared to conventional SACs, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in optimizing catalytic performance.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) have emerged as a highly promising class of next&#8208;generation nanozymes. However, their widespread application remains significantly restricted by low reaction activity, primarily attributed to inefficient site utilization and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we provided a novel approach to maximize accessible Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites on a highly curved surface (hFeSA) through chemical vapor deposition. This innovative catalyst demonstrated superior multienzyme&#8208;like activities compared to the conventional single iron atom catalyst (FeSA) with planar Fe&#8211;N4 sites. Specifically, for peroxidase&#8208;like activity, the hFeSA exhibited a maximal reaction velocity of 1.91&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;7&#160;M s&#8722;1, a catalytic constant of 5.78 s&#8722;1, and a specific activity of 177.5 U&#160;mg&#8722;1, which were 9.67&#8208;, 2.56&#8208;, and 9.56&#8208;fold higher than those of the conventional FeSA, respectively. Similarly, for oxidase&#8208;like activity, the hFeSA achieved a maximal reaction velocity of 2.84&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;7&#160;M s&#8722;1, a catalytic constant of 4.3 s&#8722;1, and a specific activity of 76.27 U&#160;mg&#8722;1, representing enhancements of 11.73&#8208;, 3.11&#8208;, and 12.01&#8208;fold over FeSA, respectively. These results underscore the significant advantages of hFeSA in dramatically enhancing multienzyme&#8208;like activities. Furthermore, theoretical calculations revealed that single iron atoms anchored on curved surfaces can effectively lower the energy barrier, thereby enhancing the intrinsic activity of the Fe&#8211;N4 sites and accelerating reaction kinetics.

         <title>The Crucial Role of Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Electrocatalytic Oxidative C&#9472;C Bond Cleavage in Lignin Biomass Valorization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic oxidative provides a promising alternative to cleaving C&#9472;C bond for converting lignin biomass into high&#8208;value aromatic chemicals. However, the oxygen evolution reaction usually competes in the aqueous environment. Herein, we successfully recognized that the in situ formed reactive oxygen species O2&#8722; during OER could synergize with the lignin intermediates to facilitate C&#945;&#9472;C&#946; bond cleavage, without additional exogenous oxidants.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic oxidative cleavage of the C&#9472;C bond is highly effective for converting lignin biomass into high&#8208;value&#8208;added aromatic chemicals. However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at applied oxidative potential usually competes in the aqueous environment. In this study, we found that OER does not entirely hinder the cleavage process but rather acts as a synergistic catalytic step. By using defect&#8208;rich carbon nanotubes as the electrocatalyst and combining experimental and theoretical analysis, we found that the reactive oxygen species (O2&#8722;) formed before *O2 desorption serve as the key oxygen source. These species could interact with the enolate intermediate of lignin, which facilitates the in situ production of aromatic compounds. Under the optimal potential of 0.5&#160;V versus Ag/AgCl, 98.8% of 2&#8208;phenoxyacetophenone is converted into phenol and benzoic acid via C&#945;&#9472;C&#946; bond cleavage, with yields of 62.31% and 43.42%, respectively. Additionally, the depolymerization of quasi&#8208;natural poplar lignin achieves a total monomer yield of up to 12.41&#160;wt%. This study provides new mechanistic insights into C&#945;&#9472;C&#946; bond cleavage during electrocatalytic lignin depolymerization under alkaline conditions, contributing to efficient biomass valorization.

         <title>Simultaneous Boosting of Second Harmonic Generation and Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Chiral Hybrid Metal Halides Through Enhanced Octahedral Distortion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancing octahedral off&#8208;centering distortion (D${\mathcal{D}}$) has been demonstrated to boost both second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in chiral hybrid metal halides (HMHs). A strong SHG intensity of 1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP and a high luminescence dissymmetry (glum) factor of 3.82&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 are achieved in R&#8208;SbCl6. The combined SHG and CPL performance surpasses that of previously reported chiral HMHs.








Abstract
Chiral hybrid metal halides (HMHs), characterized by their non&#8208;centrosymmetric crystal structures and exceptional photophysical properties, are promising for second&#8208;order nonlinear and linear optics, including second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). However, chiral HMHs with simultaneously strong SHG response and efficient CPL still present a challenge, due to the distinct structural and electronic requirements of these properties. Here, we report a halogen substitution strategy within inorganic octahedra to modulate the crystal structure and simultaneously enhance both SHG and CPL properties. Three pairs of chiral Sb&#8208;based HMHs are synthesized: (R/S&#8208;MBA)2IASbBr6 (MBA = &#945;&#8208;methylbenzylammonium, IA&#160;=&#160;imidazole, abbreviated as R/S&#8208;SbBr6), (R/S&#8208;MBA)2IASbBr2.8Cl3.2 (R/S&#8208;SbBr2.8Cl3.2), and (R/S&#8208;MBA)2IASbCl6 (R/S&#8208;SbCl6). The gradual halogen substitution from R/S&#8208;SbBr6 to R/S&#8208;SbCl6 significantly enhances the structural chirality of inorganic octahedra, resulting in a strong SHG response intensity of 1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP and a high luminescence dissymmetry factor of 3.82&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2. The combination of SHG and CPL performance outperforms that of previous chiral HMHs. Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that these enhancements originate from gradually increased octahedral distortions induced by halogen substitution. This work establishes a structural optimization strategy for advancing high&#8208;performance SHG and CPL in chiral HMHs, paving the way for their broader photonic applications.

An activatable near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF)/photoacoustic (PA) macromolecular probe is developed based on the optimized fluorophore scaffold with a long absorption maximum and high PA brightness. This probe enables dual&#8208;mode noninvasive, real&#8208;time in vivo monitoring of tumor&#8208;associated natural killer cells in the tumor immune microenvironment.








Abstract
Detection of tumor&#8208;associated natural killer cells (TANKs) is crucial for evaluating cancer immunotherapy because they are found to be associated with improved overall survival rate. However, existing analytical methods relying on tissue biopsy are invasive and static, restricting their capacity to deliver dynamic information. Herein, we report an activatable near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF)/photoacoustic (PA) macromolecular reporter (BhCyNK) for real&#8208;time imaging of TANKs. To optimize the PA performance, the fluorophore scaffold of BhCyNK is screened. Among four hemicyanine derivatives, BhCyS with the longest absorption maximum (&#8764;800&#160;nm) as well as the highest photothermal conversion efficiency (71.13%) and PA brightness is constructed into BhCyNK, which specifically triggers its NIRF signal (by 10&#8208;fold increase) and PA signal (by 8.3&#8208;fold increase) in the presence of a TANK&#8208;overexpressed protease. BhCyNK effectively distinguishes natural killer cells from other immune cells including T cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. The high specificity of BhCyNK enables real&#8208;time monitoring of TANKs population in the tumor of living mice amid cancer immunotherapies. The imaging results reveal that the increasing intratumoral signal of BhCyNK after combination immunotherapy correlates well with the increasing population of TANKs. Thus, this study not only reports a molecular strategy to develop efficient PA fluorophores but also provides an ideal tool for noninvasive monitoring of immune cells.

         <title>Boosting Ultra&#8208;Wide Temperature Sodium&#8208;Bromine Batteries via Chlorine&#8208;Bromine Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel sodium&#8211;bromine battery system addresses the safety and gas&#8208;related challenges of Na&#8208;Cl2 batteries and the kinetic limitations of Na&#8208;Br2 batteries. By introducing polyanionic BrCl2&#8722;, a stable two&#8208;electron redox mechanism is achieved, significantly enhancing energy density. This work elucidates the critical role of Br&#8208;Cl chemistry, offering a promising strategy for safe and efficient wide&#8208;temperature energy storage.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries operable over a wide temperature range is critical for sustainable energy storage. Sodium&#8208;chlorine (Na&#8208;Cl2) batteries show promising high theoretical energy densities but face significant safety challenges due to gaseous chlorine, particularly at high temperatures. Replacing Cl2 with liquid Br2 to construct a new Na&#8208;Br2 battery mitigates gas risks but introduces issues with sluggish reaction kinetics and high&#8208;temperature volatility. To overcome these limitations, we developed a revolutionary Na&#8208;Br(+) battery based on the activated Br+ by Cl&#8722; anions, pioneering a stabilized redox process via Br&#8722;/BrCl2&#8722; conversion. The introduction of Cl&#8722; enhances the reversibility kinetics of bromine species and facilitating the activation of Br+ through polyanions BrCl2&#8722;, enabling additional electron transfer pathways. The Na&#8208;Br(+) battery achieves impressive low polarization (0.18&#160;V) and exhibits wide&#8208;temperature functionality (&#8722;60&#160;&#176;C to 60&#160;&#176;C) with a cycle life exceeding 400 cycles. This heterogeneous halogen activation strategy addresses key gas safety limitations and advances the practicality of metal&#8208;halogen batteries.

         <title>Acidic Nitrate Electroreduction with Ultrahigh Energy Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ formed positively charged polyethyleneimine (PEI)&#8208;modified Cu under acidic conditions is reported as a catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface (CEI) for NO3&#8722; accumulation and electroreduction to NH3, with impressive half&#8208;cell energy efficiencies of 37.1% and 44.1% in 10&#160;mM and 0.5&#160;M NO3&#8722; solution (pH&#160;=&#160;1), respectively, higher than most reported values.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is an important feedstock for industry, an ideal energy carrier, and a perspective storage media for hydrogen. Recently, electrochemical nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction under acidic conditions has received considerable attention but it suffers from limited efficiency especially under low NO3&#8722; concentration. Here, we report an in situ formed positively charged polyethyleneimine&#8208;modified Cu under acidic conditions as a catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface (CEI) for electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction to NH3. Such CEI can effectively accumulate NO3&#8722; anions via static interactions and accelerate *NO hydrogenation to *NOH by weakening *NO intermediate adsorption on Cu site, thereby facilitating NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion. Such CEI delivers an increased NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 83.5% and an impressive half&#8208;cell energy efficiency (EE) of 37.1% in 10&#160;mM NO3&#8722; solution (pH&#160;=&#160;1). The NH3 FE and EE can further increase to 90.2% and 44.1% in 0.5&#160;M NO3&#8722;, respectively. The high EE of CEI surpasses previously reported catalyst performances for NO3&#8722; reduction. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of a novel NO3&#8722;&#8208;furfural battery, showcasing a self&#8208;power electrocatalytic system capable of simultaneously treating NO3&#8722; pollutants, generating value&#8208;added NH3 and upgrading biomass. This work offers valuable insights into the construction of a CEI to enhance the efficiency of NH3 synthesis.

         <title>The Doping Effects on the NIR Emission Enhancement of Gold Nanoclusters and the Application in Efficient NIR&#8208;OLED</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping effects have been clearly established based on alloy nanoclusters Au22&#8208;xCux (tBuC6H4C&#8801;C)18 (x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;6). The more Cu doped, the higher photoluminescence quantum yield. Au19Cu3 and Au17.1Cu4.9 show remarkable solution NIR emission under ambient conditions with the PLQYs at &#8764;710&#160;nm being &#8764;55% and &#8764;72%, respectively. A remarkable external quantum efficiency of &#8764;15.43% is achieved from a NIR&#8208;OLED with Au16Cu6 as the emitting layer, showing the prospect of metal NCs for potential applications in NIR&#8208;OLED.








Abstract
Metal nanoclusters (NCs) have emerged as promising near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissive materials. A series of highly red/NIR luminescent Au&#8211;Cu nanoclusters have been synthesized, Au22&#8208;xCux (tBuC6H4C&#8801;C)18 (x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;6) (Au22&#8208;xCux). Compared with the parental cluster Au22(tBuC6H4C&#8801;C)18 (Au22), doping effects have been clearly established: the more the amount of doping Cu, the higher photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Remarkable solutions for NIR emission under ambient conditions are found with Au19Cu3 and Au17.1Cu4.9, and the PLQYs at &#8764;710&#160;nm are &#8764;55% and &#8764;72%, respectively. The study on excited state dynamics of these clusters reveals that the more copper atoms doped, the slower nonradiative decay and the faster intersystem crossing rate, the higher PLQY. Surprisingly, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8764;15.43% is achieved from a NIR&#8208;OLED with Au16Cu6 as the emitting layer, showing the prospect of metal NCs in potential applications for NIR&#8208;OLED.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage C&#9472;N Bond Cleavage Enables Diversification of Multiple Resonance Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work presents a novel synthesis methodology for multiple&#8208;resonance (MR) materials. The selective carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond cleavage of MR frameworks enables the introduction of a wide range of aryl groups that are otherwise difficult to incorporate via conventional borylation methods. This late&#8208;stage functionalization approach boosts the optoelectronic properties of MR materials. As a representative example, DABNA&#8208;dimer exhibited improved EL performance.








Abstract
Recent advances in materials development for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been driven by an emerging design concept known as multiple&#8208;resonance (MR), which provides the benefits of high efficiency and color purity required for commercial OLED displays. Borylation reaction constructing MR frameworks is a key step for developing new &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems, while this reaction includes the limitation of selectivity, making it challenging to control reactions in elaborate molecular structures. Although a wide variety of MR compounds have been prepared through carefully planned synthetic schemes based on retrosynthetic analysis, these tasks typically require significant effort for each individual target. Herein, we demonstrate a successful late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy that enables structural modifications after the borylation reaction, especially in hardly accessible regions in MR structures via carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond cleavage. Our new synthetic method also allows access to new products which were never feasible before. The newly developed material, DABNA&#8208;dimer, proves the impact of late&#8208;stage functionalization on OLED characteristics. The present study serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for a diversity&#8208;orientated synthesis in the development of MR materials.

         <title>Probing the Heteroepitaxial Seeded Growth and Self&#8208;Sorting Processes of Segmented Co&#8208;Micelles with Chemically Distinct Crystalline Cores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The investigation of heteroepitaxial crysta&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) of copolymers with chemically distinct core&#8208;forming block, revealing micelle core lattices through self&#8208;assembly and lattice energy simulations, offering insights into energetic penalties and enabling screening of copolymer candidates for heteroepitaxial growth.








Abstract
The ability to produce uniform micellar nanoparticles with controlled dimension and spatially controlled functionality is a key challenge in nanoscience. Living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) of block copolymers (BCP) has emerged as an effective approach to generate uniform size&#8208;tunable core&#8208;shell micellar nanoparticles; however, most core&#8208;shell micelles generated via CDSA consist of a continuous crystalline core from BCPs with the same core&#8208;forming block. Herein, we perform insightful studies of heteroepitaxial CDSA process from chemical distinct core&#8208;forming poly(ferrocenyldimethylgermane) (PFDMG) and poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane) (PFDMS) based BCPs to produce segmented block comicelles. The heteroepitaxial growth process produced micelles with kinetically trapped crystalline cores that are thermodynamically less stable than the materials formed via spontaneous nucleation. This was rationalized by determining the previously unknown core lattice of PFDMG micelles, self&#8208;assembly experiments, and theoretical lattice energy calculations, providing an insight into the energetic penalty associated with heteroepitaxial growth. These methods for determining the theoretical core lattice energies in these BCP systems could provide a way to screen BCP candidates that can undergo heteroepitaxial growth. Furthermore, by using our newfound understanding of these micelle systems, we achieved the formation of micelles with crystalline cores that undergo self&#8208;sorting, driven by self&#8208;seeding from fragmented triblock comicellar structures.

         <title>Circumventing Scaling Relations via Gradient Orbital Coupling Promotes Ammonia Electrosynthesis on Cobalt Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy has been proposed to boost NO3&#8722; electroreduction to NH3 through constructing f&#8211;d&#8211;p gradient orbital coupling by lanthanide element doping in Co3O4 catalyst. It can tune the adsorption and circumvent scaling relations of key *H and *NO intermediates, achieving high faradaic efficiency and good stability over wide potential and nitrate range, providing a new paradigm for electrocatalyst design.








Abstract
Highly efficient electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NH3) relies on the balanced activation of various substrates including nitrate and water, but is currently hindered by the inherent scaling relations governing the adsorption of key reaction intermediates, such as *NO and *H. Herein, we develop a strategy to circumvent these limitations by introducing f&#8211;d&#8211;p gradient orbital coupling in cobalt oxide (Co3O4) through Ce doping. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the lattice strain triggered by the dopant redistributes electron density at the Co and O sites, thereby modulating the adsorption strengths of *NO and *H, which favors the production of NH3 while suppressing hydrogen evolution reaction. It exhibits a faradaic efficiency of 97.8% and a high yield rate of 3423.0&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 under alkaline conditions. Furthermore, Ce/Co3O4 catalyst shows robust performance over a wide range of nitrate concentrations (from 5 to 200&#160;mM) and excellent cycling stability. Our findings also suggest that the gradient orbital coupling approach can be extended to other lanthanide dopants (e.g., Pr and Nd), offering a broadly applicable platform to break scaling relations and improve NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 activity on cobalt catalysts.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Selective Cross&#8208;Linking of Primary and Secondary Alkyl Amines with CS2 Under Ambient Aerobic Oxidation for Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet highly effective bioconjugation strategy enables the near&#8208;perfect hetero&#8208;selective cross&#8208;linking of primary and secondary alkyl amines using CS2 under mild conditions.








Abstract
Umpolung of primary amines via isothiocyanation presents an attractive approach for cross&#8208;linking biorelevant molecules through two nucleophilic handles. However, conventional isothiocyanation reactions typically require highly electrophilic reagents or strongly oxidative conditions, rendering them unsuitable for complex molecular systems. Herein, we present a robust and nonchemist&#8208;friendly protocol for the isothiocyanation of primary alkyl amines using CS2 under ambient aerobic oxidation conditions, eliminating the need for additional promoters. These mild conditions not only ensure broad compatibility with endogenous functional groups in biorelevant molecules but also unlock a powerful new capability: selective differentiation between primary and secondary alkyl amines. Notably, the unique suppression of homo&#8208;linking for both primary and secondary amines under these conditions enables near&#8208;perfect hetero&#8208;selectivity in cross&#8208;linking two different biorelevant molecules via their abundant amino handles in a one&#8208;pot operation, offering a streamlined, thiol&#8208;independent, and small&#8208;footprint approach to biocompatible conjugation.

         <title>Molecule&#8208;Cooperative Strategy for Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transporting Layer toward Fully Printed High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cell Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dopant&#8208;free small molecule BDT&#8208;MB with high mobility is designed, and a molecular cooperative (MC) strategy was further proposed by combining with polymer D18. This strategy successfully solved the issues of unfavorable assembly behavior and solute random distribution in blade&#8208;coated small molecule hole transport layers (HTLs) caused by molecular aggregation and low viscosity. Ultimately, a printable, uniform, and ordered fiber&#8208;like morphology dopant&#8208;free HTL film facilitated record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24.46% (certified at 24.30%) and 21.04% for small&#8208;area perovskite solar cells (0.062 cm2) and large&#8208;area fully printed modules (15.64 cm2).








Abstract
Enabling large&#8208;area deposition of dopant&#8208;free organic hole transport layers (HTLs) with high reproducibility and uniformity is crucial for fully printed n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cell (pero&#8208;SC) modules. However, typical polymer hole transport materials (HTMs), with non&#8208;Newtonian fluid characteristics, show shear rate&#8208;dependent viscosity during the printing process, whereas blade&#8208;coated small&#8208;molecule HTLs often exhibit unfavorable assembly behavior and solute random distribution caused by molecular aggregation and low viscosity; these factors impose challenges on blade&#8208;coating of high&#8208;quality large&#8208;area HTL films. Here, we designed a dopant&#8208;free small molecule BDT&#8208;MB with high mobility and further proposed a molecular cooperative (MC) strategy by combining with polymer D18. The mechanism was clearly clarified that the pre&#8208;aggregated polymer D18 acted as a &#8220;seed crystal&#8221; to induce preferential face&#8208;on orientation of small molecule BDT&#8208;MB through intermolecular C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction. This strategy not only suppresses the unfavorable assembly behavior of small molecular HTMs but also overcomes the solute random distribution by tuning the solution with high and constant viscosity. It facilitates printing large&#8208;area dopant&#8208;free HTLs with high uniformity and ordered fiber&#8208;like morphology. The resultant small&#8208;area pero&#8208;SCs (0.062&#160;cm2) and large&#8208;area fully printed modules (15.64&#160;cm2) both achieved record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24.46% (certified at 24.30%) and 21.04%.

     alt="Molecule-Cooperative Strategy for Dopant-Free Hole Transporting Layer toward Fully Printed High-Performance Perovskite Solar Cell Modules"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dopant-free small molecule BDT-MB with high mobility is designed, and a molecular cooperative (MC) strategy was further proposed by combining with polymer D18. This strategy successfully solved the issues of unfavorable assembly behavior and solute random distribution in blade-coated small molecule hole transport layers (HTLs) caused by molecular aggregation and low viscosity. Ultimately, a printable, uniform, and ordered fiber-like morphology dopant-free HTL film facilitated record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24.46% (certified at 24.30%) and 21.04% for small-area perovskite solar cells (0.062 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and large-area fully printed modules (15.64 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enabling large-area deposition of dopant-free organic hole transport layers (HTLs) with high reproducibility and uniformity is crucial for fully printed &lt;i&gt;n-i-p&lt;/i&gt; perovskite solar cell (pero-SC) modules. However, typical polymer hole transport materials (HTMs), with non-Newtonian fluid characteristics, show shear rate-dependent viscosity during the printing process, whereas blade-coated small-molecule HTLs often exhibit unfavorable assembly behavior and solute random distribution caused by molecular aggregation and low viscosity; these factors impose challenges on blade-coating of high-quality large-area HTL films. Here, we designed a dopant-free small molecule BDT-MB with high mobility and further proposed a molecular cooperative (MC) strategy by combining with polymer D18. The mechanism was clearly clarified that the pre-aggregated polymer D18 acted as a &#8220;seed crystal&#8221; to induce preferential face-on orientation of small molecule BDT-MB through intermolecular C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction. This strategy not only suppresses the unfavorable assembly behavior of small molecular HTMs but also overcomes the solute random distribution by tuning the solution with high and constant viscosity. It facilitates printing large-area dopant-free HTLs with high uniformity and ordered fiber-like morphology. The resultant small-area pero-SCs (0.062&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and large-area fully printed modules (15.64&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) both achieved record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24.46% (certified at 24.30%) and 21.04%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NbGa2S4(S2): A Rare Linear [S2]2&#8722; Coordination to Niobium Resulting in Simultaneously Large SHG Effect and Giant Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare linear [S2]2&#8722; dimer coordinated to Nb4+ in NbGa2S4(S2) results in exceptional bonding flexibility, which gives rise to giant optical anisotropy, a strong second harmonic generation effect and significantly reduced thermal anisotropic expansion.








Abstract
We report a novel niobium thiogallate, NbGa2S4(S2), featuring a rare linear [S2]2&#8722; coordination to niobium, which simultaneously exhibits a strong second harmonic generation effect [1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;benchmark AgGaS2 (AGS)], a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (5.7&#160;&#215;&#160;AGS), and a giant birefringence (0.29 at 2 &#181;m, the largest among all reported 3D chalcogenides). Theoretical studies reveal that the polarizability anisotropy and hyperpolarizability are significantly enhanced due to the unique alignment of [S2]2&#8722; dimer within the crystal lattice. Additionally, the compound demonstrates exceptional chemical bond flexibility, which leads to significantly reduced thermal anisotropic expansion, one order of magnitude smaller than that of the benchmark AGS. These findings provide valuable insights for the design of next&#8208;generation functional materials with tailored optical and thermal characteristics.

         <title>Label&#8208;Free Detection of Virus&#8208;Membrane Interactions Using Surface&#8208;Enhanced Infrared Absorption (SEIRA) Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Viral binding and fusion are early steps during viral infection. Surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy enables the label&#8208;free tracking of molecular events, as the influenza A virus interacts with a host cell model membrane, providing chemical resolution for viral proteins, viral lipids, and host lipids.








Abstract
Viral binding and membrane fusion are essential steps in viral infection, mediated by viral proteins that bind to host cell receptors and facilitate the fusion between viral and host membranes. Targeting these steps for the development of new antiviral strategies requires methods that enable investigating virus&#8208;membrane interactions under in&#8208;situ conditions, while providing mechanistic insights on a molecular level. Here, we demonstrate the use of surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy combined with tethered bilayer lipid membranes (tBLMs) for the label&#8208;free detection of virus&#8208;membrane interactions, using the Influenza A/X&#8208;31 virus (IAV) as a model. Exploiting the nanometer&#8208;scale surface&#8208;sensitivity of SEIRA, we detect the vibrational fingerprint of IAV's hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein, as it specifically binds to sialic acid receptors of the ganglioside GD1a in the tBLM, mimicking the host membrane. Triggering viral fusion via a pH change, we identify structural changes of HA engaging with the host membrane model. Moreover, by constructing the tBLM from deuterated lipids, we utilize the vibrational isotope effect and distinguish between viral and model membrane, providing a basis to track lipid mixing. This approach establishes a powerful tool for spectroscopic studies of the function and inhibition of viral proteins, while still embedded in intact virus particles.

We introduce an all&#8208;in&#8208;one AM&#8208;DMF&#8208;ddRPA platform, a novel, rapid, and automated method for absolute quantitation of influenza A and B viruses. This digital microfluidics&#8208;based approach completes the entire workflow from sample preparation to digital read&#8208;out within 60&#160; minutes.








Abstract
Accurate nucleic acid quantification analysis (NQA) is crucial for disease treatment and prevention. However, existing digital NQA methods often lack sufficient automation and speed. In this study, we introduce a novel rapid and automated active&#8208;matrix digital microfluidics&#8208;based droplet digital recombinase polymerase amplification method (AM&#8208;DMF&#8208;ddRPA). This method can quantify influenza A and B viruses (IAV and IBV) within a mere 60&#160;min, covering the entire workflow from nucleic acid extraction to digital amplification, fluorescence detection, and statistical analysis. We fabricated an AM&#8208;DMF chip equipped with high&#8208;throughput electrodes and optimized its control logic. Leveraging an artificial intelligence droplet navigation algorithm, we successfully achieved motion and mixing operations of high&#8208;throughput droplets (4608 droplets, each with a volume of 0.9&#160;nL). A dual&#8208;target RPA system was designed to detect IAV and IBV, and its detection performance was fine&#8208;tuned. Experiments conducted with clinical samples revealed that this method exhibits ultra&#8208;high sensitivity for single&#8208;molecule detection, with a detection limit of 1.69 copies per reaction, and it achieved 100% concordance with qPCR results. This groundbreaking quantification technology holds tremendous promise for advancing disease diagnosis, treatment, and fundamental research.

         <title>Spin&#8208;State and Clustering Effects in Fe&#8208;Complex Negolytes for Near&#8208;Neutral Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfonate&#8208;substituted Fe complex exhibits a formal potential of &#8722;0.44&#160;V versus Ag/AgCl and an exceptional rate constant of 0.69&#160;cm s&#8208;1. Near&#8208;neutral redox flow batteries with 0.5&#160;M Fe complex show excellent stability over 300 cycles without capacity fading. It is attributed to hydrogen bonding, which reinforces Fe&#8211;ligand coordination and promotes trimeric cluster formation, in contrast to that of the hydroxyl&#8208;substituted Fe complex.









Abstract
Cost&#8208;effective redox&#8208;active materials are essential for advancing redox flow batteries (RFBs). Iron, with its abundance and suitability as a redox couple, is a promising candidate; however, achieving stable and fast redox reactions in aqueous RFBs remains a challenge. This study presents an Fe&#8208;based negolyte stabilized by a hexadentate ligand, where Fe&#8211;ligand bonds are enhanced through intermolecular interactions. The sulfonate&#8208;substituted Fe complex exhibits a formal potential of &#8722;0.44&#160;V versus Ag/AgCl and an exceptionally high rate constant of 0.69&#160;cm s&#8722;1. Near&#8208;neutral RFBs incorporating 0.5&#160;M Fe complex show excellent cycling stability, with no discernible capacity fading over 300 cycles. This performance is attributed to intermolecular hydrogen bonds that reinforce Fe&#8211;ligand coordination and promote the formation of stable trimeric clusters. Operando electrochemical Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory reveal that &#960;&#8208;backdonation from Fe(II) to the imino&#8208;phenolate moiety further stabilizes the complex after reduction. In contrast, the hydroxyl&#8208;substituted complex exhibits inferior stability due to weaker hydrogen bonding and less pronounced &#960;&#8208;backdonation. These findings underscore the importance of ligand design and intermolecular interactions in developing cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;performance redox&#8208;active materials for aqueous RFBs.

         <title>Beyond Conventional Doping: Sulfur&#8208;Induced Electronic and Interfacial Dynamics for Advanced Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study uncovers that sulfur doping simultaneously narrows the bandgap of Co3O4 and disrupts the hydrogen&#8208;bond networks of H2O within the electric double layer. This not only reduces the electron transfer barriers but also promotes H2O dissociation for nitrate hydrogenation. The &#8220;electronic&#8208;interfacial synergy&#8221; strategy presented here sets up a transformative paradigm for proton&#8208;coupled reactions.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia (NH3) offers a sustainable route for NH&#8323; synthesis and environmental remediation, yet it is hindered by sluggish kinetics due to inefficient proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes and inadequate electrocatalyst design. Conventional approaches primarily focus on the bulk electronic modulation of the electrocatalyst while neglecting interfacial water dynamics. Here, we propose a dual&#8208;functional sulfur&#8208;doping strategy in Co3O4 (S&#8208;Co3O4) to simultaneously enhance bulk conductivity and optimize interfacial proton transfer. Through innovative benzene sulfonyl chloride blocking experiment, in situ spectroscopic analyses, and kinetic isotope effect studies, we reveal that sulfur doping narrows the bandgap of Co3O4 to enhance bulk charge transport while disrupting rigid hydrogen&#8208;bond network of water in the electric double layer; the weakly hydrogen&#8208;bonded H2O reduces the dissociation barrier and facilitates proton supply for nitrate hydrogenation. The proposed &#8220;electronic&#8208;interfacial synergy&#8221; strategy establishes a transformative paradigm for designing electrocatalysts in PCET&#8208;driven reactions, advancing sustainable energy conversion and environmental applications.

         <title>Flexible&#8208;Linked Oligomeric Acceptors: Precise Synthesis and Enhanced Photovoltaic/Mechanical Properties for Stretchable Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three oligomeric acceptors with progressively increasing molecular weights, named 2YF&#8208;Br (3649&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1), 4YF&#8208;T (7222&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1), and 6YF&#8208;BT (10&#160;953&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1), were precisely synthesized. Remarkably, the optimized molecular weight of the acceptors simultaneously achieved enhanced photovoltaic efficiency, thermal stability, and mechanical robustness. The acceptor with the largest molecular weight (6YF&#8208;BT) facilitated the highest crack&#8208;onset strain (25.92%) and the exceptional device stretchability (strain at PCE80%&#160;=&#160;35%).








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs) are among the most promising technologies for wearable power applications. However, the development of electron acceptors that simultaneously meet the demands for high performance and mechanical stretchability remains a significant challenge. In this study, we creatively synthesized three oligomeric acceptors with flexible linkers (2YF&#8208;Br, 4YF&#8208;T, and 6YF&#8208;BT) and achieved both high efficiency and mechanical robustness in IS&#8208;OSCs. Benefiting from an improved fibrous morphology and excellent charge dynamics, rigid OSCs based on 4YF&#8208;T demonstrated a superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.76%, outperforming devices based on 2YF&#8208;Br and 6YF&#8208;BT. Additionally, the thermal stability of rigid OSCs progressively improved with increasing molecular weight, from 2YF&#8208;Br to 6YF&#8208;BT. Furthermore, the enlarged molecular weight of the acceptors significantly enhanced mechanical stretchability, with crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) values of 16.11%, 20.62%, and 25.92% for 2YF&#8208;Br, 4YF&#8208;T, and 6YF&#8208;BT, respectively. Importantly, as molecular weight increased, the mechanical robustness of IS&#8208;OSCs also improved, with 6YF&#8208;BT&#8208;based devices achieving remarkable stretchability (strain at PCE80%&#160;=&#160;35%). This study introduces a new class of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight acceptors with well&#8208;defined structures, paving the way for the advancement and practical application of IS&#8208;OSCs in wearable electronics.

         <title>Thio&#8208;Tetracosulene: A Highly Twisted Molecular Plectoneme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thio&#8208;tetracosulene, the first macrocyclic aromatic compound (MAC) with a plectonemic configuration, has been synthesized by sulfur fluorine annulative substitution. Distinct from topological knot&#8208;, or M&#246;bius&#8208;type MACs which rely on the connection pattern to induce chirality, the asymmetric structure of thio&#8208;tetracosulene is generated and stabilized by the tendency of a macrocycle in distress to reduce unfavourable strain. 








Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of thio&#8208;tetracosulene 3, a highly twisted chiral macrocycle constructed via sulfur fluorine annulative substitution from a cyclometaphenylene derivative. It is the first macrocyclic aromatic compound with a plectonemic configuration, and the structure is unambiguously confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study. The two enantiomers of 3 can be resolved to investigate their chiroptical properties. In contrast to the known topological knot&#8208;, or M&#246;bius&#8208;type macrocycles which induce chirality by specific connection patterns, the asymmetric structure of 3 is formed and maintained by the tendency of a ring in distress to reduce unfavorable strains.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Mediated Photoreversible Switch Between 2D and 3D Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting weak hydrogen bonds and solution processability of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), reversible switch between two&#8208;dimensional and three&#8208;dimensional HOF is realized by light&#8208;triggered ring&#8208;open/close isomerization of diarylethene unit. Lanthanide is loaded into the HOF and utilized as a security ink, enabling the photoreversible conversion of visible/invisible information patterns.








Abstract
In photoresponsive crystalline porous materials, the light&#8208;driven reversible topological transformation is of particular interest, as it can cause an overall change in structure and lead to more drastic switch in material properties, but remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;OF) self&#8208;assembled by photochromic diarylethene (DAE) and tetrakis(4&#8208;amidiniumphenyl)methane (TAM) via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds. Light irradiation drives isomerization of DAE, and the internal strain generated during photoisomerization is released through dissolution and recrystallization, which are accompanied by the breaking and reestablishment of hydrogen bonds. Benefit from the weak and reversible nature of hydrogen bonds as well as the good solution processability of HOFs, solution&#8208;mediated reversible switch between 3D and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) HOF is achieved by ring&#8208;open/ring&#8208;close photoisomerization of the DAE moiety controlled by remotely alternating UV and visible light irradiation. Loading lanthanide complex into HOF enables DAE photoisomerization&#8208;controlled photochromic fluorescence resonance energy transfer process between the lanthanide and DAE moiety, resulting in reversible luminescence on/off switch in the host&#8208;guest, capable of intelligent anti&#8208;counterfeiting in a noninvasive manner.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Caged Hydrocarbons as Arenes Bioisosteres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality plays a crucial role in the biological interactions, safety, and effectiveness of drugs. The increasing use of caged hydrocarbons as bioisosteres for planar benzene moieties in drug design has heightened the need for asymmetric catalysis strategies to produce chiral caged molecules. This minireview showcases recent progress in this rapidly growing research field. 








Abstract
The utilization of caged hydrocarbons as bioisosteres for arenes, especially the phenyl ring, in bioactive compounds has resulted in significant enhancements in potency, solubility, and metabolic stability. These improvements highlight the potential of C(sp3)&#8208;rich polycyclic scaffolds as a promising motif for the development of drug candidates. However, this strategy has also increased the structural complexity of these molecules, posing synthetic challenges in controlling the chirality of caged and highly decorated bioactive scaffolds. Over the past two years, remarkable progress has been achieved in catalytic asymmetric methodologies for the synthesis of caged hydrocarbons, significantly advancing their utility in chiral drug discovery and development. This minireview provides a comprehensive summary of recent breakthroughs in the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral caged hydrocarbons, encompassing bicyclo[n.1.1]alkanes, cubanes, and related three&#8208;dimensional scaffolds. Additionally, we highlight the intriguing applications of enantiomerically pure caged hydrocarbons in biological studies.

&lt;p&gt;Chirality plays a crucial role in the biological interactions, safety, and effectiveness of drugs. The increasing use of caged hydrocarbons as bioisosteres for planar benzene moieties in drug design has heightened the need for asymmetric catalysis strategies to produce chiral caged molecules. This minireview showcases recent progress in this rapidly growing research field. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The utilization of caged hydrocarbons as bioisosteres for arenes, especially the phenyl ring, in bioactive compounds has resulted in significant enhancements in potency, solubility, and metabolic stability. These improvements highlight the potential of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-rich polycyclic scaffolds as a promising motif for the development of drug candidates. However, this strategy has also increased the structural complexity of these molecules, posing synthetic challenges in controlling the chirality of caged and highly decorated bioactive scaffolds. Over the past two years, remarkable progress has been achieved in catalytic asymmetric methodologies for the synthesis of caged hydrocarbons, significantly advancing their utility in chiral drug discovery and development. This minireview provides a comprehensive summary of recent breakthroughs in the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral caged hydrocarbons, encompassing bicyclo[n.1.1]alkanes, cubanes, and related three-dimensional scaffolds. Additionally, we highlight the intriguing applications of enantiomerically pure caged hydrocarbons in biological studies. It is anticipated that this minireview will inspire further advancements in the enantioselective synthesis of these pharmaceutically valuable caged hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structurally Engineering Multi&#8208;Shell Hollow Zeolite Single Crystals via Defect&#8208;Directed Oriented&#8208;Kinetics Transformation and Their Heterostructures for Hydrodeoxygenation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A defect&#8208;directed oriented&#8208;kinetics transformation strategy is developed to prepare multi&#8208;shell hollow aluminosilicate ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite (MFI) crystals with single&#8208;crystalline feature, hierarchical macro&#8208;/mesoporosity, controllable shell number, and high structural stability. The resultant multi&#8208;shell hollow Ni&#8208;loaded ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite catalysts exhibit significantly enhanced catalytic activity in the hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid into liquid fuels.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline multi&#8208;shell hollow porous materials with high compartment capacity, large active surface area, and superior structural stability are expected to unlock tremendous potential across diverse critical applications. However, their synthetic methodology has not yet been well established. Here, we develop a defect&#8208;directed oriented&#8208;kinetics transformation approach to prepare multi&#8208;shell hollow aluminosilicate ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite (MFI) crystals with single&#8208;crystalline feature, hierarchical macro&#8208;/mesoporosity, controllable shell number, and high structural stability. The methodology lies in the creation of zeolite precursors consisting of multiple inhomogeneous layers with gradient&#8208;distributed defects along the [100] and [010] directions and irregularly discrete defects&#8208;rich regions along the [001] direction via continuous epitaxial growth. Subsequently, the locations with more defects could be preferentially etched to form voids or mesopores, meanwhile oriented recrystallization interconnects the nanoshells into a unified architecture along the [001] direction. Benefiting from the easily accessible bifunctional metal/acid sites and the capability for reactant accumulation, the resultant multi&#8208;shell hollow Ni&#8208;loaded zeolite catalysts show significantly enhanced catalytic activity in the hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid into liquid fuels. The insight gained from this systematic study will facilitate the rational design and synthesis of diverse multi&#8208;shell hollow structured single&#8208;crystalline porous materials for a broad range of potential applications.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Umpolung Difluoroalkylation of Imines Enables General Access to &#946;&#8208;Difluoroalkylated Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed umpolung difluoroalkylation of Imines has been developed. By inverting the polarity of imines, this approach enables the coupling of various readily accessible difluoroalkyl bromides and iodides. The rapid fluorine replacement of bioactive molecules by the efficient synthesis of difluorinated analogs of key amine moieties present in these molecules, including amphetamine, using the current approach, demonstrates the promising potential of this protocol in advancing drug discovery and development.








Abstract
Fluoroalkylated amines play a pivotal role in medicinal chemistry, yet the general and efficient synthesis of &#946;&#8208;difluoroalkylated amines remains elusive. Here, we developed a nickel&#8208;catalyzed umpolung strategy that enables the difluoroalkylation of 2&#8208;azaallyl anions generated from aliphatic and aromatic imines, effectively overcoming the previous limitations. By inverting the polarity of imines, this strategy allows for the coupling of a variety of readily accessible difluoroalkyl bromides and iodides. This approach is characterized by its high efficiency, broad substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and ease of synthesis. The rapid modification of bioactive molecules by the efficient synthesis of difluorinated analogs of key amine moieties present in bioactive molecules, including amphetamine, using the current approach shows the promising potential of this protocol in advancing drug discovery and development.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral 1&#8208;Aryl Isoquinolines via De Novo Isoquinoline Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient synthesis of axially chiral 1&#8208;aryl isoquinolines through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation/annulation of aromatic imines with alkynes is reported. An enantioselective de novo isoquinoline ring formation is involved in this process. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies revealed the turnover&#8208;limiting step of the reaction and the origin of enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Axially chiral heterobiaryl moieties serve as core skeletons for bioactive molecules, chiral ligands, and organocatalysts. Enantioselective de novo formation of the heteroaromatic ring is one of the most straightforward approaches to access enantioenriched heterobiaryls. Herein, an enantioselective de novo construction of isoquinolines by rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation/annulation of aromatic imines with alkynes is disclosed. This approach is operationally simple, allowing for rapid access to a variety of axially chiral 1&#8208;aryl isoquinolines in excellent yields and enantioselectivity (up to 98% yield and 99:1 er). The synthetic application of the current method was demonstrated by functional group transformations and suitability for millimolar&#8208;scale reactions. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies revealed the turnover&#8208;limiting step and provided insight into the origin of the enantioselectivity for this reaction.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput DFT&#8208;Assisted Design of Electrode for Efficient High&#8208;Temperature Electrochemical Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>

This work demonstrates the efficiency and feasibility of the high&#8208;throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculation framework and the role of dopants with various oxidation states for the high&#8208;temperature electrochemical dehydrogenation reaction in energy and environment devices. 








Abstract
Protonic ceramic electrolysis cell (PCEC) is a promising technique to enable efficient dehydrogenation reactions for producing valuable chemicals, but is still limited by the lack of stable electrocatalysts to achieve efficient O&#9472;H/C&#9472;H dissociation. In this work, upon high&#8208;throughput first&#8208;principles calculations, Ba(Zr,Co,Fe,M)O3&#8208;based (M represents dopants) perovskite is formulated, and oxygen vacancy formation energy (&#916;Evf${{\Delta}}E_{\mathrm{v}}^{\mathrm{f}}$) and hydration energy (&#916;Ehydr) are taken as two key performance indicators to screen potential PCEC electrode materials derived from this category. Trivalent doping elements, particularly Y, Yb, Er, and Tm, achieve a good balance between &#916;Evf${{\Delta}}E_{\mathrm{v}}^{\mathrm{f}}$ and &#916;Ehydr. Experiments further validate that the BaZr0.125Co0.375Fe0.375Tm0.125O3&#8722;&#948; showed impressive dehydrogenation reaction activity, with faradaic efficiency as high as 98.90% in water electrolysis, and outstanding ethane conversion rate (67.60%) and ethylene yield (62.62%) for ethane dehydrogenation reaction at 700 &#176;C.

     alt="High-Throughput DFT-Assisted Design of Electrode for Efficient High-Temperature Electrochemical Dehydrogenation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrates the efficiency and feasibility of the high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculation framework and the role of dopants with various oxidation states for the high-temperature electrochemical dehydrogenation reaction in energy and environment devices. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protonic ceramic electrolysis cell (PCEC) is a promising technique to enable efficient dehydrogenation reactions for producing valuable chemicals, but is still limited by the lack of stable electrocatalysts to achieve efficient O&#9472;H/C&#9472;H dissociation. In this work, upon high-throughput first-principles calculations, Ba(Zr,Co,Fe,M)O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based (M represents dopants) perovskite is formulated, and oxygen vacancy formation energy (&#916;Evf${{\Delta}}E_{\mathrm{v}}^{\mathrm{f}}$) and hydration energy (&#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;hydr&lt;/sub&gt;) are taken as two key performance indicators to screen potential PCEC electrode materials derived from this category. Trivalent doping elements, particularly Y, Yb, Er, and Tm, achieve a good balance between &#916;Evf${{\Delta}}E_{\mathrm{v}}^{\mathrm{f}}$ and &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;hydr&lt;/sub&gt;. Experiments further validate that the BaZr&lt;sub&gt;0.125&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.375&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.375&lt;/sub&gt;Tm&lt;sub&gt;0.125&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; showed impressive dehydrogenation reaction activity, with faradaic efficiency as high as 98.90% in water electrolysis, and outstanding ethane conversion rate (67.60%) and ethylene yield (62.62%) for ethane dehydrogenation reaction at 700 &#176;C. The computational approach can be applied to the rational design of novel electrode materials for other electrochemical reactions in energy and environment devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated Lithium Recovery From Spent LiFePO4 Stabilizes Ferricyanide Catholyte for Durable Zinc&#8208;Ferricyanide Flow Batteries</title>

Redox&#8208;mediated lithium recovery from spent LiFePO4 batteries enables high&#8208;solubility catholytes (up to 1.74&#160;M [Fe(CN)6]4&#8315;) for ultra&#8208;stable alkaline zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow batteries. This dual&#8208;function strategy integrates sustainable lithium recycling with advanced energy storage, achieving enhanced cycling stability and energy density.








Abstract
The scarcity of lithium resources and the increasing volume of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) exacerbate the imbalance between lithium supply and demand. The development of efficient recovery strategies of valuable lithium ion (Li+) from spent LIBs and their subsequent utilization presents both significant opportunities and challenges. Here, we propose an innovative approach for Li+ recovery from spent lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries (LFPs) and its subsequent utilization in alkaline zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow batteries (AZFFBs). Utilizing a redox&#8208;mediated reaction, we achieve exceptional Li+ recovery efficiency from spent LFPs. Furthermore, the recovered Li+ in solution leads to the elevated ionic strength in the electrolyte, enhancing the concentration of [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; to a remarkable level of 1.74&#160;M. Utilizing the above catholyte, an AZFFB cell demonstrates the cycling life extending to 11&#160;000 cycles with a degradation rate as low as 0.00019% per cycle and 0.09% per day at a current density of 120&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This study introduces a straightforward and efficient protocol that eliminates additional intermediate processes, achieving effective Li+ recovery from spent LFPs and subsequent utilization in flow batteries. The resulting AZFFB exhibits high energy density and long lifespan, positioning it as a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage solutions.

         <title>Hopping Diffusion in Wiggling Nanopore Architecture of MOF Enabling Synergistic Equilibrium&#8208;Kinetic Separation of Fluorinated Propylene and Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address a critical challenge in electronic specialty gas (ESG) purification, we herein present a zirconium&#8208;based MOF with &#8220;wiggling pore geometry&#8221; featuring alternating narrow apertures and enlarged cavities. This architecture establishes an equilibrium&#8208;kinetic synergistic separation mechanism: narrow windows (nw) kinetically hinder C3F8 diffusion (DC3F6/DC3F8&#160;&#8776;&#160;450), while F&#183;&#183;&#183;H interactions in cavities thermodynamically favor C3F6 adsorption.








Abstract
The separation of octafluoropropane (C3F8) from hexafluoropropylene (C3F6) is an industrially important yet challenging process due to their similar physicochemical properties and stringent purity demands in industrial applications. Herein, we address this task through precise pore architecture in a zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Zr&#8208;PMA), which exhibits unique &#8220;wiggling nanopores&#8221; with narrow windows and large cavities. The narrow windows act as diffusion barriers, selectively restricting C3F8 transport, while the large cavities provide strong adsorption sites for C3F6, enabling an equilibrium&#8208;kinetic synergistic separation. This dual functionality results in a &#8764;450&#8208;fold difference in diffusion rates and exceptional kinetic selectivity for C3F6 over C3F8, as demonstrated by adsorption isotherms, time&#8208;resolved kinetics, and dynamic breakthrough experiments. Theoretical calculations coupled with in situ spectroscopy elucidate the pore geometry&#8208;dependent hopping diffusion mechanism responsible for the separation. This work establishes wiggling pore geometry as a versatile paradigm for advanced adsorbents targeting energy&#8208;efficient separations of structurally similar fluorocarbon mixtures.

         <title>Optimizing the Selectivity of CH4 Electrosynthesis from CO2 Over Cuprates Through Cu&#9472;O Bond Length Descriptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selectivity descriptor based on Cu&#9472;O bond length was established to screen highly selective cuprates toward CH4 electrosynthesis. This descriptor revealed that CH4 selectivity exhibited a volcano&#8208;shaped correlation with the Cu&#9472;O bond length, with the optimal value accessible at &#8764;1.951&#160;&#197;. Using this descriptor, three new cuprates were predicted, demonstrating better performance compared to the reported Cu&#8208;based catalysts in acidic electrolytes.








Abstract
Precisely controlling the nature of Cu&#9472;O bond in Cu&#8208;based oxide catalysts and understanding its correlation with CH4 electrosynthesis (from CO2) for selectivity optimization is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, taking a specific type of cuprates structured with CuO4 square&#8208;planar motifs as the platform, we report a selectivity descriptor of Cu&#9472;O bond length for screening highly selective catalysts toward CH4 electrosynthesis. We establish the descriptor by systematic investigations of several proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept cuprates. Their Cu&#9472;O bond lengths are precisely controlled ranging from 1.944 to 1.970&#160;&#197; and these bonds remain stable in CH4 selectivity evaluation. Our investigations demonstrate that the CH4 selectivity exhibits a volcano&#8208;type dependence on the Cu&#9472;O bond length, and the optimized value is accessible at about 1.951&#160;&#197;. This could be attributed to the optimal (neither too strong nor too weak) *CO adsorption created by the moderate Cu&#9472;O bond length, facilitating *CO hydrogenation. Furthermore, utilizing this descriptor, we predict three highly selective cuprates for CH4 electrosynthesis, with superior selectivity that is near the top of the volcano plot. And importantly, in an acidic electrolyte (pH&#160;=&#160;1), they outperform the reported catalysts, achieving CH4 selectivity of up to 61.7% at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Based Signal Circuit for Self&#8208;Regulated Bidirectional Communication in Protocell&#8208;Living Cell Communities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intercellular communicating protocell with feedback loop was designed for self&#8208;regulating signal transmission in protocell/living cell community. This DNA&#8208;empowered protocell provides a bottom&#8208;up access route toward synthetic cellular systems with abilities for programming desired cellular behaviors.








Abstract
Developing synthetic biology tools to control cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell signaling can provide new capabilities to engineer cell&#8208;cell communication and program desired cellular behaviors.

         <title>Enhanced Luminance of Pentaazaphenalene&#8208;Based Delayed Fluorescence Emitters by Breaking Forbidden Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly developed 1,3,4,6,9b&#8208;pentaazaphenalene (5AP) based emitters with donor and acceptor units have succeeded in converting nonemissive 5AP to highly luminescent emitters by breaking the forbidden transition. These emitters exhibited photoluminescence quantum yields exceeding 80% and 90%; both are the highest among the 5AP derivatives reported to date.








Abstract
1,3,4,6,9b&#8208;pentaazaphenalene (5AP) derivatives are of growing interest because of their potential for exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence and inverted singlet&#8211;triplet excited state properties. However, a major challenge has been the nonemissive nature of 5AP. This study reports a donor&#8208;5AP&#8208;acceptor&#8208;type molecular design for converting nonemissive 5AP into highly emissive molecules. The newly designed molecules, 2,5&#8208;di(1&#8208;pyrrolidino)&#8208;7,9&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)&#8208;1,3,4,6,9b&#8208;pentaazaphenalene (Pyr&#8208;5AP&#8208;CF3) and 2,5&#8208;di(1&#8208;pyrrolidino)&#8208;7,9&#8208;bis(4&#8208;benzonitrile)&#8208;1,3,4,6,9b&#8208;pentaazaphenalene (Pyr&#8208;5AP&#8208;CN), exhibited delayed fluorescence and achieved high photoluminescence quantum yields of 83.5% and 90.6%, respectively, in solid films. These values dramatically exceed those of previously reported 5AP derivatives with only 8% or less. Furthermore, Pyr&#8208;5AP&#8208;CF3 and Pyr&#8208;5AP&#8208;CN exhibited the fastest radiative decays and the narrowest emission spectra among all the 5AP based materials reported to date. This study provides a promising solution to the nonemissive nature of 5AP, leading to the development of a class of highly luminescent materials for future organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Beyond Structure: Methylation Fine&#8208;Tunes Stability and Folding Kinetics of bcl2Mid G&#8208;Quadruplex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of a single 5&#8208;methylcytosine into a G&#8208;rich sequence originating from the B&#8208;cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) gene promoter affects both the folding kinetics and thermodynamics of the two G4 structures and thus plays a crucial role in regulating G4 folding pathways, which has significant implications for the control of gene expression.








Abstract
Cytosine methylation, a key epigenetic modification in the regulation of gene expression, raises intriguing questions about its role in the formation and thermodynamic stability of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures. We investigated the impact of the 5&#8208;methylcytosine residue (Cm) on the well&#8208;characterized bcl2Mid G4 structure that forms in a GC&#8208;rich region of the B&#8208;cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) gene promoter, which influences its expression. Using solution&#8208;state NMR and biophysical techniques, we discovered an unexpected sequence&#8208;specific effect of Cm on the folding kinetics of bcl2Mid G4. Specifically, substituting cytosine at position C6 with C6m&#160; slows down G4 folding kinetics and influences the equilibrium between major and minor structures in the presence of K+ ions. Notably, the increased population of the minor structure enabled the characterization of its previously unidentified topology. Additionally, the presence of a single Cm residue induces local structural rearrangements in the major G4 structure and decreases its thermodynamic stability. Furthermore, we found that the zinc finger 3 motif of the Sp1 transcription factor preferentially binds to the minor G4 structure. These results suggest that Cm not only influences G4 polymorphism but may also regulate interactions with transcription factors, potentially affecting the regulation of gene expression.

         <title>Interfacial H&#8208;bond Network/Concentration Fields/Electric Fields Regulation Achieved by D&#8208;Valine Anions Realizes the Highly Efficient Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A D&#8208;valine anion interfacial layer reversely regulates the interfacial H&#8208;bond network and the interfacial concentration/electric fields, which realizes the synchronous occurrence of inhibition (suppressing H+ migration by disrupting the interfacial H&#8208;bond interaction and restraining the anion depletion layer formation) and optimization effects (homogenizing the interfacial Zn2+ flow and electric field). 








Abstract
Uncontrolled mobile anions and proton transport result in many issues, including interfacial anion depletion, irregular multiphysics fields fluctuations, space charge layer&#8208;induced interfacial Zn dendrites, and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which seriously exacerbates the cycling stability of zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, this work constructs an efficient D&#8208;valine anion interface structure to reversely regulate the Zn2+/H+ dynamic chemistry and unlocks the multiple regulation effects of this anionic interface by investigating interfacial proton transport and complex concentration/electric fields distribution of Zn anode through dynamic in&#8208;situ spectroscopy analysis, static energy calculations, and molecular dynamics simulation. We unravel core factors affecting complicated interfacial HER processes and the generation of the space charge layer. This anionic interfacial layer severs proton hopping transport by rupturing the initial water&#8211;water hydrogen bond, which effectively restrains uncontrolled HER processes. Further, the anion&#8208;immobilized interfacial layer accelerates Zn2+ transfer to optimize the interfacial concentration fields. Also, the anionic interface restrains the formation of the anion depletion layer by relieving rapid Zn2+ ions exhaustion and strengthening the uniformity of interfacial electrical field distribution, which suppresses space charges&#8208;induced Zn dendrite growth. Consequently, Zn||Zn symmetric cells deliver an ultralong cycle life of 4150&#160;h. Importantly, the multiple regulation effects enable Zn||I2 cells exhibit long&#8208;term stable life.

In their Research Article (e202503745), Jiawei Zhu and co&#8208;workers report a selectivity descriptor based on Cu&#9472;O bond length for screening highly selective cuprates toward CH4 electrosynthesis. This descriptor reveals that CH4 selectivity exhibits a volcano&#8208;shaped correlation with the Cu&#9472;O bond length, with the optimal value accessible at &#8764;1.951&#160;&#197;. Using this descriptor, three new cuprates are predicted, demonstrating better performance compared to the reported Cu&#8208;based catalysts in acidic electrolytes.

The air&#8208; and water&#8208;stable Ni(0) complex [Ni(PFPh2)4] is obtained via a unique in&#8208;situ reduction and fluorination mechanism from [Ni(MeCN)4](BF4)2 and Ph2P(&#9552;O)&#9472;PPh2, incorporating typically unstable fluorophosphine ligands. In their Research Article (e202506271), Schirin Hanf et al. demonstrated its utility as a robust Ni(0) source, and showed its superior catalytic activity in coupling reactions compared to the conventional [Ni(COD)2].

The cover artwork, designed by Helen Allmendinger, visualizes a novel synthetic pathway and the first crystallographic characterization of the [cyclo&#8208;P5]&#8722; anion in the solid state. Although this compound is spectroscopically known since the 1980s it was so far prepared and handled only in solution. By complexing the alkali metal cation with [2.2.2]cryptand, the resulting salts of the [cyclo&#8208;P5]&#8722; are found to be surprisingly stable in the solid state as reported by Christian M&#252;ller et&#160;al. in their Communication (e202505853).

In their Research Article (e202501930), Guohua Zhao and co&#8208;workers report a novel strategy utilizing the self&#8208;optimizing restructuring behavior of MOFs to construct cation vacancies, which effectively suppresses excessive O&#9472;O bond cleavage during oxygen activation. This strategy promotes the 2e&#8722; pathway for H2O2 production (right) over the 4e&#8722; pathway generating H2O (left). By employing a solid&#8208;state electrolyte cell, direct synthesis of ultrahigh&#8208;concentration H2O2 aqueous solution (&gt;8 wt%) is achieved.

         <title>Manipulation of Chemistry and Biology with Visible Light Using Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;Substituted Azobenzenes and Azonium Ions</title>

Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;Azobenzenes (TOABs) in broad daylight: in recent years, TOAB photoswitches became indispensable tools for all&#8208;visible&#8208;light manipulation of chemistry, biology and materials. This review explores their unique photochemical properties, design and synthetic approaches, offering support in choosing a TOAB for a given application.








Abstract
Molecular photoswitches are used for precise and reversible control over the properties and function of chemical, biological and material systems, offering exceptional spatiotemporal control. Their current development focuses on enabling operation with non&#8208;damaging and deep tissue penetrating visible/near&#8208;IR light. In this context, tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted azobenzenes and azonium ions play a leading role, thanks to their unique photophysical properties and easily modifiable structure. However, it is only recently that synthetic approaches to those sterically demanding systems have been established and their structure&#8208;photochemistry relations have been understood to provide general rules for their tuning to a given application. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of this family of molecular photoswitches, providing an analysis of their photophysical properties, followed by a discussion of the available synthetic methodologies. Finally, we showcase the versatility of tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted azobenzenes and azonium ions for enabling light&#8208;control in biological and material sciences, providing multiple insights for future applications.

In this context, tetra-&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-substituted azobenzenes and azonium ions play a leading role, thanks to their unique photophysical properties and easily modifiable structure. However, it is only recently that synthetic approaches to those sterically demanding systems have been established and their structure-photochemistry relations have been understood to provide general rules for their tuning to a given application. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of this family of molecular photoswitches, providing an analysis of their photophysical properties, followed by a discussion of the available synthetic methodologies. Finally, we showcase the versatility of tetra-&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-substituted azobenzenes and azonium ions for enabling light-control in biological and material sciences, providing multiple insights for future applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Chemistry in Functional Hydrogel Coatings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this comprehensive overview of research progress in functional hydrogel coatings, the interfacial mechanisms between hydrogel coatings and substrates are discussed, and the preparation methods with their respective advantages and disadvantages for hydrogel coatings are summarized. Finally, the challenges in terms of large&#8208;scale preparation, long&#8208;term stability, and multifunctionality are outlined, and a glimpse into future opportunities is offered. 








Abstract
Functional hydrogel coatings can endow the underlying substrate with excellent surface properties, such as anti&#8208;fouling, anti&#8208;fogging, anti&#8208;bacterial, anti&#8208;abrasion, lubrication, and controllable drug delivery, while hardly changing the mechanical properties of the substrate. Through elaborate interface engineering, hydrogel coatings with high interfacial toughness and controllable thickness have been successfully constructed on different substrate surfaces for widespread applications. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the current research progress in functional hydrogel coatings and the associated interfacial chemistry. First, the interfacial interactions and mechanisms between hydrogel coatings and substrates are discussed. Next, the preparation methods for hydrogel coatings are systematically summarized, with a focus on the involved critical chemical groups/reactions and their respective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we highlight the challenges from the perspective of large&#8208;scale preparation, long&#8208;term stability, and multifunctionality, and provide a glimpse into future opportunities, hoping to promote the transformation of functional hydrogel coatings from foundational research to industrial applications.

         <title>Supramolecular Gels as Active Tools for Reaction Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique combination of environments within gels, self&#8208;assembled from low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators, offers the ability to control reactivity in new ways, achieving unique reaction outcomes, leading to the emerging concept of supramolecular gels as nanoreactors. Smart chemical engineering methods enable the use of such gels to fabricate materials and devices potentially capable of transforming the way synthesis is done.








Abstract
Supramolecular gels, assembled from low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators (LMWGs), are fascinating soft materials for use in synthesis, combining aspects of hetero&#8208; and homogeneous systems. The unique combination of environments within a gel offers the ability to control reactivity in new ways. For example, self&#8208;assembly into a gel network can modify the reactivity of catalytic sites on the LMWG. Controlling the assembly of multiple LMWGs can result in integrated gels with orthogonal activities that could not normally coexist. Enzymes encapsulated within self&#8208;assembled gels can exhibit superactivity, extending their use into solvent media more appropriate for organic synthesis. Highly reactive species, such as ligand&#8208;free nanoparticles or moisture/air&#8208;sensitive organometallics, can be protected within the unique environment of a supramolecular gel, facilitating their use in ambient conditions, potentially opening up the use of such species to nonspecialist researchers. Beyond fundamental chemistry, performing reactions in gels leads to the emerging concept of gels as &#8220;nanoreactors&#8221;. Smart chemical engineering methods are enabling the fabrication of materials and devices for use in a variety of synthetic workflows, potentially transforming the way synthesis is done. In summary, this review provides an overview of key concepts and signposts the way toward future developments of gels as active tools for reaction engineering.

         <title>Bioinspired Cationic Antimicrobial Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review about membrane active cationic polymers with antimicrobial properties. A focus is laid on polymeric architecture, stimuli&#8208;responsive antimicrobial polymers, as well as synergistic effects of polymers, and other compounds. 








Abstract
Antibiotics are an essential tool of modern medicine, which is critically endangered by the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Without effective antibiotics, a number of medical advancements from the last century are in jeopardy, threatening our global public health and leading to a high death toll. To counteract this development, new therapeutic strategies, that are insusceptible to resistance development have to be established. Among them, antimicrobial polymers (AP)s are a promising class of materials. Their mode&#8208;of&#8208;action is highly unspecific as they kill bacteria by membrane permeabilization or precipitation of intracellular components. As such, it is unlikely for APs to be affected by AMR. This review highlights recent advances in AP design and understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships of these cationic macromolecules. One spotlight is on the polymeric architecture and how it influences AP bioactivity. A second highlight is stimuli&#8208;responsive APs and their potential to increase AP selectivity. Moreover, synergistic effects, e.g., between polymer and antibiotics are reviewed. The last focus is on in vivo applications of APs, which could pave a way toward clinical applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Ion Transport in Ultrathin 3D Covalent Organic Framework Nanofluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work well manipulates the ion transport in nanoconfined channels by employing 3D covalent organic frameworks (3D&#8208;COFs). Owing to their continuously interpenetrated pathways and well&#8208;ordered pore arrangements, 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics demonstrated high ionic flux and cation selectivity. Toward osmotic energy applications, 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics output an ultrahigh power density of 1238.2&#160;W m&#8722;2 under a 500&#8208;fold salinity gradient.








Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency ion transport is essential for both biological and nonbiological processes, including the regulation of cell homeostasis, energy conversion, and mass transfer in chemical industry. Nanofluidic channels are considered ideal platforms for delicate control of ion transport in their unique nanoconfinement, yet currently reported 1D and 2D nanofluidics are subjected to elevated transport resistance due to discontinuous and random channels. Here, we engineer ultrathin, 3D covalent organic framework (3D&#8208;COF) nanofluidics featuring continuously interpenetrated pathways and well&#8208;ordered pore arrangements, demonstrating superior ion conductance. The energy barrier for ion transport across 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics is exceptionally low, suggesting ultrafast and low&#8208;resistance ion movements. Theoretical calculations indicate that 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics facilitate group adsorption to anions, leading to high energy barriers for anion mobility, thus enhancing ion selectivity and high&#8208;throughput cation transport. In osmotic energy applications, 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics achieve a power density of 217.7&#160;W m&#8722;2 with artificial seawater and river water, potentially scalable to 1238.2&#160;W m&#8722;2 under a 500&#8208;fold salinity gradient. The proposed 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics offer new avenues for desalination and ion/molecular separation.

         <title>Functionalized Cyclic Poly(&#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids) via Controlled Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of O&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel catalytic system consisting of a lanthanum complex with a sterically bulky ligand and a manganese silylamide has been developed to prepare high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (&gt;100&#160;kDa) stereoregular cyclic polyesters and block copolyesters with narrow molecular weight distributions (&#393; &lt;&#160;1.1) and unique physical properties.








Abstract
Linear poly(&#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids) are important degradable polymers, and they can be efficiently prepared by ring&#8208;opening polymerization of O&#8208;carboxyanhydrides with pendant functional groups. However, attempts to prepare cyclic poly(&#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids) have been plagued by side reactions, including epimerization and uncontrolled intramolecular chain transfers or termination, that prevent the synthesis of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight stereoregular cyclic polyesters. Herein, we report a scalable method for the synthesis of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (&gt;100&#160;kDa) stereoregular functionalized cyclic poly(&#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids) by means of controlled polymerization of O&#8208;carboxyanhydrides using a catalytic system consisting of a lanthanum complex with a sterically bulky ligand and a manganese silylamide. Additionally, using this system, we could readily prepare cyclic block poly(&#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids) by means of sequential addition of O&#8208;carboxyanhydrides. The obtained cyclic polyesters and their cyclic block copolyesters exhibit distinctive physicochemical properties&#8212;including elevated phase transition temperature, improved toughness, and reduced viscosity&#8212;compared to their linear counterparts.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Photoswitchable Covalent Ligands for the &#946;2&#8208;Adrenoceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure&#8208;based design of a covalent photoswitchable ligand for the &#946;2&#8208;adrenergic receptor, a therapeutically relevant GPCR, is described. This tool facilitates the modification of the intrinsic activity of the protein by light. Computational analysis of its mechanism of action suggests that the photoswitch takes place within the binding pocket. 








Abstract
The &#946;2&#8208;adrenergic receptor (&#946;2AR) is a critical target for the treatment of airway diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To better understand its mechanism of action and study its dynamics, photoswitchable ligands provide a distinct advantage due to their ability to be activated with high spatiotemporal control. In this study, we developed a series of molecular tools featuring different combinations of pharmacophores, covalent warheads, and linker lengths. These compounds were characterized using highly specific assay protocols to evaluate their covalent binding capabilities, with the goal of identifying optimal covalently&#8208;bound photoswitches. Among these, the covalently&#8208;bound photoswitchable receptor agonist 6 exhibited a significant functional switch. To gain deeper insight into the binding thermodynamics and kinetics of this molecular tool, as well as the molecular determinants involved, we performed metadynamics (MetaD) simulations and analyzed their results using a Markov State Model (MSM) obtained by applying the Maximum Caliber (MaxCal) principle to the MetaD&#8208;derived free energies. These studies suggest that photoswitching of compound 6 occurs within the binding pocket of the &#946;2AR. Consequently, compound 6 holds promise as a valuable tool for investigating &#946;2AR activation kinetics and dynamics with high accuracy, thereby facilitating high&#8208;resolution biophysical studies.

         <title>Development of an Automated Workflow for Screening the Assembly and Host&#8211;Guest Behavior of Metal&#8208;Organic Cages Towards Accelerated Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An automated experimental workflow to accelerate the discovery of metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs), which is often hindered by slow, manual approaches, has been developed. Automation of the synthesis, characterization, and analysis, is supported by computational modelling to rationalize the experimental outcomes, and development of a host&#8211;guest assay elucidated trends in MOC binding behavior.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) are a class of self&#8208;assembled materials with promising applications in chemical purifications, sensing, and catalysis. Their potential is, however, hampered by challenges in the targeted design of MOCs with desirable properties. MOC discovery is thus often reliant on trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approaches and brute&#8208;force manual screening, which are time&#8208;consuming, costly, and material&#8208;intensive. Translating the synthesis and property screening of MOCs to an automated workflow is therefore attractive, to both accelerate discovery and provide the datasets crucial for data&#8208;led approaches to accelerate MOC discovery and to realize their targeted properties for specific applications. Here, an automated workflow for the streamlined assembly and property screening of MOCs was developed, incorporating automated high&#8208;throughput screening of variables pertinent to MOC synthesis, data curation and automated analysis, and development of a host&#8211;guest assay to rapidly assess binding behavior. Computational modelling supplemented this automated experimental workflow for post priori rationalization of experimental outcomes. This study lays the groundwork for future large&#8208;scale MOC screening: from a relatively modest screen of 24 precursor combinations under one set of reaction conditions, 3 clean MOC species were identified, and subsequent screening of their host&#8211;guest behavior highlighted trends in binding and the identification of potential applications in molecular separations.

         <title>Efficient Semitransparent Organic Solar Modules with Exceptional Diurnal Stability Through Asymmetric Interaction Induced by Symmetric Molecular Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The symmetric molecular structure of 4FY has been shown to induce an &#8220;asymmetric molecular interaction&#8221;, which promotes a higher degree of molecular packing than in Y6. The asymmetry&#8208;driven molecular interactions can be leveraged to fabricate large&#8208;area semitransparent organic solar modules that are efficient and stable under realistic operating conditions. 








Abstract
The symmetry&#8208;breaking design strategy of nonfullerene acceptor can improve the performance of semitransparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs). However, no report exists on the &#8220;asymmetric molecular interaction&#8221; induced by symmetric molecular structure in nonfullerene acceptors. Herein, we showcase that 2D fluorophenyl outer groups in symmetric 4FY promote dipole&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly through asymmetric molecular interactions, resulting in a tighter packed structure than Y6 with the same symmetric geometry. Such unique properties lead to high&#8208;performance layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer OSCs, accompanied by simultaneously reduced energy and recombination losses and improved charge&#8208;related characteristics. ST&#8208;OSCs based on PCE10&#8208;2F/4FY achieve notable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.81%, average visible transmittance of 45.43%, and light utilization efficiency (LUE) of 4.91%. Moreover, exceptional diurnal cycling stability is observed in the ST&#8208;OSCs based on PCE10&#8208;2F/4FY with much prolonged T80 up to 134&#160;h, which is about 17 times greater than the reference PCE10&#8208;2F/Y6. Lastly, we fabricate highly efficient semitransparent organic solar modules based on PCE10&#8208;2F/4FY (active area of 18 cm2), which shows PCE of 6.78% and the highest LUE of 3.10% to date for all&#8208;narrow bandgap semitransparent organic solar modules. This work demonstrates that asymmetry&#8208;driven molecular interactions can be leveraged to fabricate large&#8208;area ST&#8208;OSCs that are efficient and stable under realistic operating conditions.

         <title>Sprayed Microdroplets Architect a Polyoxometalate Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micron&#8208;sized droplets promote rapid nucleation of metal&#8208;oxo clusters, forming polyoxometalates within sub&#8208;millisecond timescales, an outcome unattainable in the bulk phase under similar conditions, while avoiding the traditional use of corrosive chemicals, acids, and heat.








Abstract
Although many past attempts have utilized micron&#8208;sized droplets for breaking and forming organic bonds, their potential in promoting inorganic bond formation reactions remains largely unexplored. We report a promising approach to synthesizing a tungsten&#8208;based Lindqvist&#8208;type polyoxometalate (POM) in various organic and aqueous microdroplets under ambient conditions, eliminating the traditional need for hazardous or corrosive chemicals and high&#8208;boiling solvents. When aerosolized, a simple tungstate (WO42&#8722;) solution spontaneously produces a metal&#8208;oxo cluster (W6O192&#8722;), a valuable POM with broad applications, achieving yields up to 99% in less than a millisecond. Mass spectrometric detection of reactive intermediates unraveled the nucleation mechanism in microdroplets, leading to the formation of polyoxotungstate, which was then further characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Empirical observations collectively suggest that rapid solvent evaporation and subsequent enrichment of reactants in the confined volume of microdroplets likely facilitate the growth of the POM through partial solvation at the air&#8211;liquid interface.

         <title>Effect of Alternating Polarity in Electrochemical Olefin Hydrocarboxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alternating polarity (AP) is a powerful tool for controlling selectivity in olefin hydrofunctionalization, but this use is underdeveloped. Using electrochemical olefin hydrocarboxylation as a model, we highlight how AP controls product selectivity, yield, and material decomposition. It hinders overreduction, limiting dicarboxylation and electrode passivation, and facilitates a unique electrochemical&#8211;chemical&#8211;chemical (ECC) mechanism.








Abstract
The electrochemical generation of radical anions from feedstock olefins offers a selective and efficient route for synthesizing commodity chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors via hydrofunctionalization. Traditional methods for electrochemical olefin hydrofunctionalization, for example, hydrocarboxylation, rely on anion intermediates and follow an electrochemical&#8211;chemical&#8211;electrochemical&#8211;chemical (ECEC) mechanism involving olefin reduction, carboxylation, further reduction, and protonation. Enhancing terminal carboxylate selectivity often requires a proton source, reducing functional group tolerance and favoring proton reduction over olefin reduction. Alternating polarity, a nascent technique in organic electrochemistry, can improve product selectivity by influencing electron transfer rates and electrode surface species. Herein, we report the use of alternating polarity to selectively generate radical anions from styrene derivatives, using electrochemical hydrocarboxylation as a model. This approach shifts the mechanism to an electrochemical&#8211;chemical&#8211;chemical (ECC) pathway, where the final step involves hydrogen atom transfer. We showcase how alternating polarity modulates product selectivity, yield, and material decomposition, offering new insights into how alternating polarity can advance olefin functionalization by enabling more controlled and selective reaction pathways.

         <title>DNA Framework&#8208;Ensembled Aptamers Enhance Fluid Stability in Circulating Tumor Cells Capture for Tumor Treatment Evaluation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a tetrahedral DNA framework (TDF) engineered multivalent aptamers (TEAn) with programmable ligands size and configuration, enabling high&#8208;efficiency capture of CTCs and accurate monitoring of clinical treatment progress. The precisely structured TEAn ensures the size&#8208;matching and cooperative hybridization with epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) clusters on cell membrane.








Abstract
The recognition and binding via receptor&#8208;ligand interactions on cell membranes often weaken in complex environments, such as whole blood samples from cancer patients, making disease diagnosis and treatment evaluation unfavorable. Constructing multivalent ligands with sufficient fluid stability in complex environments remains a challenge. Herein, we develop a tetrahedral DNA framework (TDF) ensembled multivalent aptamers (TEAn, n = 1&#8211;3) with programmable ligands size, enabling efficient capture of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and accurate monitoring of clinical treatment progress. The precisely structured TEAn ensures the size&#8208;matching and cooperative hybridization with epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) on cell membrane. Compared to traditional aptamer approach, the dissociation constants (Kd) of TEA3 exhibits &#8764;20&#8208;fold growth in serum due to its precise size and rigid DNA framework. This high&#8208;affinity interaction significantly enhances capture efficiency by improving fluid stability of TEAn and magnetic beads complex in complex environment. In addition, this CTC detection strategy is applied for clinical tumor treatment evaluation and progress monitoring in liver cancer patient samples, achieving an accuracy of &#8764;83.3% in classifying patients as complete or partial responses (CR/PR). Overall, this strategy will strongly promote potential clinical application of DNA framework for cancer diagnosis and disease progression monitoring.

         <title>A Photoactivatable Plasma Membrane Probe Based on a Self&#8208;Triggered Photooxidation Cascade for Live Cell Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we establish a new photoswitching concept called self&#8208;triggered photooxidation cascade (STPC). Rhodamine dyes have mild photosensitizing properties that enable subsequent photoactivation and photobleaching of a leuco&#8208;rhodamine plasma membrane probe. Upon laser irradiation in the visible range, we successfully performed live SMLM (Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy), allowing to image the plasma membrane at the nanoscale.








Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution imaging based on the localization of single emitters requires a spatio&#8208;temporal control of the ON and OFF states. To this end, photoactivatable fluorophores are adapted as they can be turned on upon light irradiation. Here, we present a concept called self&#8208;triggered photooxidation cascade (STPC) based on the photooxidation of a plasma membrane&#8208;targeted leuco&#8208;rhodamine (LRhod&#8208;PM), a non&#8208;fluorescent reduced form of a rhodamine probe. Upon visible light irradiation the small number of oxidized rhodamines, Rhod&#8208;PM, acts as a photosensitizer to generate singlet oxygen capable of oxidizing the OFF state LRhod&#8208;PM thereby switching it to its ON state. We showed that this phenomenon is kinetically favored by a high local concentration and propagates quickly when the probe is embedded in membrane bilayers. In addition, we showed that the close proximity of the dyes favors the photobleaching. At the single&#8208;molecule level, the concomitant activation/bleaching phenomena allow reaching a single&#8208;molecule blinking regime enabling single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy for super&#8208;resolution of live cellular membranes and their thin processes including filopodia and tuneling nanotubes.

         <title>Selective Leaflet&#8208;Anchored DNA Nanoprobes for Simultaneous Monitoring of Juxta&#8208;Plasma Membrane Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fusogenic nanoliposomes were developed to effectively anchor amphiphilic DNA tetrahedral probes onto the inner leaflet of the cell membrane. By combining this strategy with the direct anchoring of amphiphilic probes on the outer leaflet, precise functionalization of both membrane leaflets could be achieved, thereby enabling simultaneous monitoring of both the inner and outer juxta&#8208;plasma membrane environments. 








Abstract
The cell membrane functions as a bidirectional interface that coordinates the selective transport of substances and information between the interior and exterior of the cell. Simultaneous monitoring of both the inner and outer local environments surrounding this lipid bilayer is crucial for elucidating various cellular activities but significantly challenged by the lack of technologies capable of precisely engineering biosensing probes on both membrane leaflets. In this work, by developing fusogenic nanoliposomes with high cell fusion efficiency, we successfully anchored amphiphilic DNA tetrahedral probes onto the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. By integrating this with the direct anchoring of amphiphilic probes on the outer leaflet, we achieved precise functionalization of both leaflets of the cell membrane, thus enabling simultaneous monitoring of localized targets within their respective juxta&#8208;plasma membrane environments, avoiding signal contamination caused by the optical diffraction limit. Using selectively dual&#8208;leaflet&#8208;anchored tetrahedral DNAzyme probes, we revealed that the transmembrane ion channel SLC41A1 synergistically modulated the influx of Na+ and the efflux of Mg2+ in live cells. With a modular design, this membrane&#8208;anchored DNA nanoplatform can be readily extended for the study of bilateral interface&#8208;dominant cellular processes, shifting the paradigm toward a more localized and subtle perspective.

With a modular design, this membrane-anchored DNA nanoplatform can be readily extended for the study of bilateral interface-dominant cellular processes, shifting the paradigm toward a more localized and subtle perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Square Planar Ru(iPr2PCH2CH2NH)2 and its Role in Fast and Selective Catalytic Amine&#8211;Borane Dehydropolymerization to Form High Molecular Weight Polyaminoboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Square planar Ru(II), Ru(iPr2PCH2CH2NH)2 is the first species formed on simple dehydrohalogenation of RuCl2(iPr2PCH2CH2NH2)2 using tBuOK, a pre&#8208;catalyst system that promotes very fast and selective amine&#8211;borane dehydropolymerization to form high molecular weight polyaminoborane. 








Abstract
Addition of tBuOK to orange RuCl2(iPr2PCH2CH2NH2)2 forms the pink, square planar, Ru(II) complex Ru(iPr2PCH2CH2NH)2. This is an active catalyst (ToF 250&#160;s&#8722;1) for the dehydropolymerization of H3B&#183;NMeH2 to give high molecular weight polyaminoborane, [H2BNMeH]n (Mn&#160;=&#160;138&#8201;700&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1) at low loadings (0.03 mol%). An induction period observed is due to the initial formation of a hydroxy&#8208;hydride species, Ru(iPr2PCH2CH2NH2)2(OH)(H), prior to fast turnover.

         <title>Acridine&#8208;Substituted&#8208;Centronucleus Nonfullerene Acceptors Enables Organic Solar Cells with Over 20% Efficiency with Low Nonradiative Recombination Loss</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three small&#8208;molecule acceptors, AQx, AQx&#8208;o&#8208;Ac, and AQx&#8208;m&#8208;Ac, were designed and synthesized, differing in their acridine substitutions. AQx&#8208;m&#8208;Ac demonstrates minimal static disorder, reduced nonradiative energy loss, and enhanced crystallization, culminating in a PCE of 18.64% in PM6:AQx&#8208;m&#8208;Ac OSCs. Incorporating AQx&#8208;m&#8208;Ac as a third component into the PM6:eC9 blend elevated the PCE of the optimal ternary system to 20.28%.








Abstract
In this work, we propose a novel strategy of introducing luminescent acridine units for central nuclear substitution in quinoxaline&#8208;based acceptor molecules (named AQx&#8208;o&#8208;Ac and AQx&#8208;m&#8208;Ac) to enhance their photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY), which can effectively improve the electroluminescent quantum efficiency (EQEEL) of OSCs and thereby suppress &#916;Enr. In addition, the substituted acridine unit accelerates molecular aggregation and optimizes molecular crystallization, effectively alleviating the static disorder of acceptor molecules and facilitating charge extraction and transport in OSCs. As a result, the PM6:AQx&#8208;m&#8208;Ac binary OSCs achieve an excellent PCE of 18.64% with an exceptionally low &#916;Enr of 0.166&#160;eV. To the best of our knowledge, a &#916;Enr of 0.166&#160;eV represents the lowest value reported for OSCs achieving PCEs over 18&#160;%. Finally, the acceptor AQx&#8208;m&#8208;Ac is incorporated into PM6:eC9 blend as the third component, and the optimal ternary device produces a superior PCE of 20.28%. This work highlights the potential of promoting luminescence for suppressing nonradiative energy loss and charts a viable path for upcoming breakthrough in high&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaics.

         <title>A Method for Constructing Nucleosome Arrays with Spatially Defined Histone PTMs and DNA Damage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work advances methodology by addressing challenges in mimicking the complex in vivo spatial relationships of histone acetylation and DNA damage. The combination of an abiotic/enzymatic hybrid catalyst system (ABEHCS) and the plug&#8208;and&#8208;play method has constituted a versatile platform to construct nucleosome arrays with precise histone acetylation and DNA damage patterns. 








Abstract
DNA damage repair mechanisms, such as base excision repair (BER), safeguard cells against genotoxic agents that cause genetic instability and diseases, including cancer. In eukaryotic nuclei, DNA within nucleosome arrays is less accessible to repair factors than naked DNA owing to the structural constraints of chromatin. Histone acetylation is crucial for loosening the chromatin structure and facilitating access to damaged DNA, yet its effects&#8212;particularly in histone globular domains&#8212;on BER in nucleosome arrays remain unexplored. Herein, we employ an abiotic/enzymatic hybrid catalyst system (ABEHCS) and a plug&#8208;and&#8208;play strategy to regioselectively introduce histone acetylation and deoxycytidine&#8208;to&#8208;deoxyuridine DNA damage. This approach enables the construction of nucleosome arrays with diverse spatial configurations of histone acetylation and DNA lesions, similar to those found in living organisms. Our findings reveal that H3K56 acetylation in the histone globular domain enhances BER efficiency mediated by UDG and APE1 in nucleosome arrays, contingent upon the spatial relationship between H3K56Ac and the DNA damage site.

         <title>Application of Molecular Ferroelectric in Photocatalytic Selective Oxidization of C(sp3)&#9472;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular ferroelectric CuCl4&#8208;[R&#8208;MPA] (MPA = &#946;&#8208;methylphenethylamine) achieves a remarkable 104&#8208;fold enhancement in alkane oxidation activity compared to BaTiO3, with a turnover number (TON) of 6286 under light and ultrasound. Its built&#8208;in electric field enables efficient charge separation, while synergistic effects drive reactive oxygen species generation, highlighting its promising application in photocatalysis.








Abstract
Molecular ferroelectrics utilize metal nodes and organic groups as catalytic active sites, with the surrounding ferroelectric polarization significantly enhancing catalytic activity and showcasing tremendous application potential. However, their application in photocatalysis remains underexplored. This study presents the first investigation of the molecular perovskite ferroelectric CuCl4&#8208;[R&#8208;MPA] (MPA = &#946;&#8208;methylphenethylamine) as a photocatalyst for alkane oxidation. Under the combined effects of light and ultrasound, this catalyst exhibited a notable turnover number (TON) of 6286&#160;&#177;&#160;491, which is 104 times higher than that of inorganic ferroelectrics like barium titanate (BaTiO3). The molecular ferroelectric exhibits excellent recyclability, good functional group tolerance, and broad substrate applicability. Mechanistic studies indicate that the built&#8208;in electric field within the molecular ferroelectric facilitates the separation of photo&#8208;generated charge carriers, thereby enhancing its ferroelectric photocatalytic activity. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results further reveal that the synergistic effects of light and ultrasound effectively generate reactive oxygen species. These findings underscore the unique advantages of molecular ferroelectrics compared to rigid inorganic counterparts, including their distinctive structural features and finely tunable catalytic performance, highlighting their potential for developing homogeneous, precisely active sites and efficient photocatalysts. This research lays the foundation for the broader application of molecular ferroelectrics in the field of photocatalysis.

However, their application in photocatalysis remains underexplored. This study presents the first investigation of the molecular perovskite ferroelectric CuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-[R-MPA] (MPA = &#946;-methylphenethylamine) as a photocatalyst for alkane oxidation. Under the combined effects of light and ultrasound, this catalyst exhibited a notable turnover number (TON) of 6286&#160;&#177;&#160;491, which is 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; times higher than that of inorganic ferroelectrics like barium titanate (BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The molecular ferroelectric exhibits excellent recyclability, good functional group tolerance, and broad substrate applicability. Mechanistic studies indicate that the built-in electric field within the molecular ferroelectric facilitates the separation of photo-generated charge carriers, thereby enhancing its ferroelectric photocatalytic activity. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results further reveal that the synergistic effects of light and ultrasound effectively generate reactive oxygen species. These findings underscore the unique advantages of molecular ferroelectrics compared to rigid inorganic counterparts, including their distinctive structural features and finely tunable catalytic performance, highlighting their potential for developing homogeneous, precisely active sites and efficient photocatalysts. This research lays the foundation for the broader application of molecular ferroelectrics in the field of photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>New Transferrin Receptor&#8208;Targeting Conjugate Effectively Delivers DNA to Mouse Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel RNA aptamer targeting the transferrin receptor (TfR), conjugated with DSPE lipid, which achieves remarkably efficient brain uptake, reaching brain&#8208;to&#8208;serum ratios as high as 6.5. Through fluorescence imaging and polymerase&#8208;chain reaction analyses, we verify that this new conjugate successfully delivers a substantial amount of DNA oligonucleotide to the brains of Balb/cJ mice and demonstrates effectiveness in a human blood&#8211;brain barrier cell line model. 








Abstract
Delivery across the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) is one of the most challenging tasks for modern biopharmaceutics. Many attempts have been taken, with only low delivery efficacies achieved so far. We report a new transferrin receptor&#8208;targeting (TfR) RNA aptamer conjugated to DSPE lipid that leads to an unprecedented effective uptake in the brain, with brain&#8208;to&#8208;serum ratios up to 6.5 in mice. This result is superior to recently published values of &lt;&#160;1 for antibody conjugates and nanovesicles, pointing to a successful combined effect of the increased lipophilicity and TfR targeting with the new RNA aptamer that our conjugate provides. Using fluorescence whole body imaging, polymerase&#8208;chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we confirm that the new conjugate delivers high amounts of DNA oligonucleotide to brains of Balb/cJ mice, and it is effective in human cells. There is no acute toxicity as verified with histopathological assessment of mice organs. The combination of properties demonstrated by our new conjugate makes it a highly potent delivery tool that can be applied in therapy of brain diseases incl. glioblastoma, neurogenerative diseases, and a broad range of brain infections.

         <title>A Capping&#8208;assisted Strategy for Synthesis of Glass&#8208;like Carboxylate&#8208;based Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct synthesis strategy depending on capping effect was proposed for preparing glass&#8208;like coordination polymers for the first time. The prepared glassy coordination polymers possessed excellent mechanical properties and fraction resistance comparable with ceramics and plastic&#8208;like resilience.








Abstract
The direct preparation of glass&#8208;like carboxylate&#8208;based coordination polymers (CPs) possessing continuous internal structure and transparency is challenging due to the lack of control on coordination kinetics and subsequently the range of order. Herein, a capping&#8208;assisted strategy was presented to control the molecular assembly during the metal&#8208;ligand coordination in the solution and to inhibit the long&#8208;range of order hence building glass&#8208;like CPs (g&#8208;CPs) mimicking the polymerization process. 1,3,5&#8208;benzene tricarboxylate (BTC) ligand was used to connect the copper cations (Cu2+) into metal&#8208;organic complexes of different Cu: BTC ratios (metal&#8208;organic pool) in presence of an excess of triethyl amine as a capping agent. Concentrating the Cu&#8208;BTC complexes and further drying under mild conditions induced the decapping process which triggered the random crosslinking between the free carboxylate and Cu2+ to form a boundary&#8208;free continuous internal structure. The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;BTC g&#8208;CP exhibited an approximately similar fine structure like its crystalline counterpart (HKUST&#8208;1), which facilitated solvent and thermal&#8208;induced crystallization. Due to the internal structure continuity, the g&#8208;CP possesses ceramic&#8208;like hardness and wear resistance and plastic&#8208;like resilience. This capping&#8208;assisted strategy has been successfully extended to Ni&#8208;BTC and Fe&#8208;BTC systems under mild conditions and thus presenting a general method for the formation of glass&#8208;like carboxylate&#8208;based CPs.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Controlled, Sequential Self&#8208;Sorting of Supramolecular Assemblies in Model Protocells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox reaction&#8208;mediated transient deactivation strategy has been employed to achieve sequential self&#8208;sorting of supramolecular structures in solution and inside model protocells&#8212;an unprecedented architecture in the field.








Abstract
Self&#8208;sorting of cellular components is essential for maintaining order and function in living systems, enabling complex processes to operate seamlessly. Emulating such self&#8208;sorting in synthetic self&#8208;assembly, however, has conventionally relied on structural or chirality mismatches of monomers yielding self&#8208;sorted systems under thermodynamic conditions. In contrast, reaction&#8208;coupled, kinetically controlled self&#8208;assembly, ubiquitous in biological systems, is critical for achieving spatiotemporal characteristics. Extending this principle to temporally self&#8208;sorted synthetic assemblies is key to developing multi&#8208;component biomimetic systems. Herein, we present a strategy towards this direction, to achieve sequential self&#8208;sorting of supramolecular assemblies through differences in the chemical&#8208;reactivity of monomers, coupled to redox&#8208;reactions. This approach exploits the distinct redox potentials of monomers to achieve precise temporal&#8208;control over self&#8208;sorting, while inherent structural mismatches among monomers ensure the kinetic stability of self&#8208;sorted state. Reduction reactions transiently disrupt their assemblies into dormant inactive monomeric states, while subsequent kinetically controlled reassembly occurs via reversible oxidation reactions. Finally, utilizing this sequential self&#8208;sorting, we aim to mimic multicomponent cellular self&#8208;organization by demonstrating the kinetically controlled growth of self&#8208;sorted structures in the presence of model protocells, using lipid vesicles as compartments. Although spatial&#8208;distribution remains non&#8208;selective, the dormant monomeric states facilitate monomer encapsulation and the unprecedented stepwise&#8208;formation of self&#8208;sorted assemblies within model protocells.

         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed group&#8208;exchange strategy has been developed for the direct conversion of aromatic lactones into cyclic hemiboronic acid bioisosteres. Scope evaluation and product derivatization experiments demonstrate broad functional&#8208;group compatibility and the synthetic value of this strategy. Furthermore, the application of this methodology to the rapid modification of lactone cores in bioactive molecules underscores its practical utility.








Abstract
Bioisosteric replacement is an important strategy in drug discovery and is commonly practiced in medicinal chemistry; however, the incorporation of bioisosteres typically requires laborious multistep de novo synthesis. The direct conversion of a functional group into its corresponding bioisostere is of particular significance in evaluating structure&#8208;property relationships. Herein, we report a functional&#8208;group&#8208;exchange strategy that enables the direct conversion of aromatic lactones, a prevalent motif in bioactive molecules, into their corresponding cyclic hemiboronic acid bioisosteres. Scope evaluation and product derivatization experiments demonstrate the synthetic value and broad functional&#8208;group compatibility of this strategy, while the application of this methodology to the rapid remodeling of chromenone cores in bioactive molecules highlights its utility.

This study successfully developed three distinct 3D extended D&#8208;A COFs with a pyr topology by employing a newly designed intrinsic D&#8208;A type building block. Among these, the A&#8208;D&#8208;A structured COF stands out due to its multiple charge transfer channels in 3D space, resulting in an enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate. This finding provides valuable insights into designing extended D&#8208;A constructs within 3D frameworks to optimize photocatalytic performance. 








Abstract
The development of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs) has emerged as a promising strategy for enhancing photocatalytic performance. Although most studies have concentrated on 2D COFs, research into their 3D counterparts remains limited. In this study, we rationally designed and synthesized a carbazoyl dicyanobenzene derivative (TBFCC) as an intrinsic D&#8208;A building block. By selecting TAPA, TAPB, and TAPT as the donor, acceptor&#8208;&#960;, and acceptor donors, respectively, we synthesized three distinct D&#8208;A&#8208;extended COF materials: D&#8208;D&#8208;A, A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;A, and A&#8208;D&#8208;A. Among these, 3D&#8208;TAPT&#8208;COF, featuring an A&#8208;D&#8208;A structure, exhibited the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 31.3&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, surpassing most previously reported 3D COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. This superior performance is attributed to its A&#8208;D&#8208;A configuration, which provides multiple charge transfer pathways in 3D space, overcoming the electron transport limitations inherent in 2D COFs. Consequently, this feature facilitates efficient separation of photogenerated charges within the framework and reduces carrier recombination, thereby optimizing photocatalytic efficiency.

         <title>Decoding the Chemical Language of Ribosomally Synthesized and Post&#8208;Translationally Modified Peptides from the Untapped Archaea Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>

Secondary metabolites (SMs) are essential across all life domains, yet those originating from the Archaea domain remain poorly understood. Here, the systematic genome mining and the pioneering heterologous expression of archaeal SMs have revealed the chemical landscape of archaeal lanthipeptides, showing both canonical and non&#8208;canonical forms. These lanthipeptides exhibit antagonistic activity and activate the host's motility, likely shaping the archaeal community and mediating environmental adaptation.








Abstract
Chemical communication is crucial in ecosystems with complex microbial communities. However, the difficulties inherent to the cultivation of archaea have led to a limited understanding of their chemical language, especially regarding the structure diversity and function of secondary metabolites (SMs). Our in&#8208;depth exploration into the biosynthetic potential of archaea has unveiled the previously unexplored biosynthetic capabilities and chemical diversity of archaeal ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Through the first application of heterologous expression in archaeal SM discovery, we have identified 24 lanthipeptides, including a distinctive type featuring diamino&#8208;dicarboxylic termini. It highlights the uniqueness of archaeal biosynthetic pathways and significantly expands the chemical landscape of archaeal SMs. Additionally, archaeal lanthipeptides demonstrate antagonistic activity against haloarchaea, mediating the unique biotic interaction in the halophilic niche. They showcase a new ecological role of RiPPs in enhancing the host's motility by inducing the rod&#8208;shaped cell morphology and upregulating the archaellin gene expression, facilitating the archaeal interaction with abiotic environments. These discoveries broaden our understanding of archaeal chemical language and provide promising prospects for future exploration of SM&#8208;mediated interaction.

         <title>Enhancing Efficiency and Stability of Inverted Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells via Multi&#8208;Functionalized Molecular Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We specifically introduced a 4&#8208;BBA molecule into the perovskite film to form a multifunctional bridging structure anchored with the SAM layer, which passivated Pb2+ ion defects and regulated crystallization of the perovskite film, enhancing interfacial contact and releasing residual strain. The resultant f&#8208;PSCs achieved a high PCE of 25.30% (25.13% certified) with a record VOC of 1.21&#160;V. 








Abstract
Inverted flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) are promising candidates for mechanical photovoltaic applications due to their ease of preparation, lightweight, and portability. However, the weak interface connections, residual strain, and the nonradiative recombination loss among adjacent layers are critical challenges that restrict f&#8208;PSCs development. To address these issues, a functionalized molecule with multiple hydrogen bond acceptors, 4&#8208;Carboxyphenylboronic acid (4&#8208;BBA), is designed in the perovskite precursor for modulating perovskite crystallization, which achieves uniform and stress&#8208;relaxation perovskite film and forms a robust bridging structure anchored at the buried interface. Theoretical calculation and experimental results show that the C&#9552;O group passivates Pb2+ with I&#8722; vacancy defect through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions, reducing trap&#8208;assisted recombination. Furthermore, the designed 4&#8208;BBA is preferentially deposited at the buried layer interface between the perovskite and substrate, forming hydrogen bonds with the self&#8208;assembled monolayer via B&#9472;OH bonds, creating a mechanically stable bridge between the layers. As a result, the power conversion efficiency of the champion f&#8208;PSC reached 25.30% (25.13% certified). And the f&#8208;PSC open&#8208;circuit voltage set a record of 1.21V. Importantly, the unencapsulated f&#8208;PSC using 4&#8208;BBA retains 95.3% of its original performance after 5000 cycles at a bending radius of 10mm, demonstrating extraordinary bending stability.

         <title>Oxidative Rearrangements of the Alkaloid Intermediate Geissoschizine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
19E&#8208;geissoschizine is a key precursor in the biosynthesis of monoterpene indole alkaloids such as strychnine, ibogaine, and vinblastine. Using enzymatic assays and gene silencing, three CYPs were identified from C. roseus that oxidize this compound to four alkaloid scaffolds: strychnos, sarpagan, akuammiline, and mavacurane. Mutational analysis reveals how active&#8208;site changes fine&#8208;tune product specificity, highlighting nature's strategy for metabolic diversity.








Abstract
Plants can generate structural diversity by enzymatic rearrangement of a central intermediate. 19E&#8208;geissoschizine is one such chemically versatile intermediate that plays a central role in the biosynthesis of monoterpene indole alkaloids such as strychnine, ibogaine, and vinblastine. Here we report how 19E&#8208;geissoschizine undergoes oxidative transformations to generate four distinct alkaloid scaffolds through the action of three biosynthetic enzymes. Using in vitro enzymatic assays and gene silencing, we demonstrate how these three cytochrome P450 enzymes in the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus transform 19E&#8208;geissoschizine into strychnos, sarpagan, akuammiline&#8208;type, and mavacurane&#8208;type alkaloids. We use mutational analysis to show how minimal changes to the active site of these similar enzymes modulate product specificity. This work highlights how substrate reactivity and enzyme mutations work synergistically to generate chemical diversity.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrotrifluoromethoxylation of Aromatic Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of optically pure benzyl trifluoromethoxy (OCF3) compounds remains a challenging task. Here, we present the first enantioselective intermolecular hydrotrifluoromethoxylation reaction between aromatic alkenes and TFMS, catalyzed by chiral salen&#8208;Co complexes. This approach efficiently yields a variety of chiral benzylic&#160;trifluoromethoxy compounds with 75%&#8211;99% ee.








Abstract
The construction of optically pure benzyl trifluoromethoxy (OCF3) compounds continues to present challenges due to limited enantioselectivity&#8208;control or the necessity for OCF3&#8208;containing substrates in the only two previous reports. Herein, we have developed a salen&#8208;Co&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrotrifluoromethoxylation reaction involving aromatic alkenes and trifluoromethyl arylsulfonate (TFMS). This method effectively produces a range of chiral benzyl trifluoromethoxy compounds with enantiomeric excesses ranging from 75% to 99%.

     alt="Cobalt-Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrotrifluoromethoxylation of Aromatic Alkenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of optically pure benzyl trifluoromethoxy (OCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) compounds remains a challenging task. Here, we present the first enantioselective intermolecular hydrotrifluoromethoxylation reaction between aromatic alkenes and TFMS, catalyzed by chiral salen-Co complexes. This approach efficiently yields a variety of chiral benzylic&#160;trifluoromethoxy compounds with 75%&#8211;99% ee.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The construction of optically pure benzyl trifluoromethoxy (OCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) compounds continues to present challenges due to limited enantioselectivity-control or the necessity for OCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-containing substrates in the only two previous reports. Herein, we have developed a salen-Co-catalyzed enantioselective hydrotrifluoromethoxylation reaction involving aromatic alkenes and trifluoromethyl arylsulfonate (TFMS). This method effectively produces a range of chiral benzyl trifluoromethoxy compounds with enantiomeric excesses ranging from 75% to 99%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;Based Galvanic Potentiometric Sensor for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Serotonin Signaling Under Psychosocial Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphorothioate aptamer&#8208;based galvanic redox potentiometric sensor (aptGRP5&#8208;HT) with enhanced sensitivity and selectivity enables real&#8208;time monitoring of serotonin in a mouse model of psychosocial stress. It reveals, for the first time, a distinct correlation between serotonin release and social hierarchy, with higher serotonin levels in dominant mice.








Abstract
Psychosocial stress, a pervasive factor in mental health disorders, is tightly linked to serotonin (5&#8208;HT) dysregulation. Real&#8208;time electrochemical monitoring of 5&#8208;HT in vivo is challenged by interference from vitamin C (Vc) and biofouling, requiring invasive pretreatments. We present a self&#8208;powered aptamer&#8208;engineered galvanic sensor (aptGRP5&#8208;HT) that integrates phosphorothioate aptamers with a redox potentiometric mechanism, achieving 21.5&#8208;fold higher selectivity and 98.3&#8208;fold enhanced sensitivity against Vc over conventional sensors while resisting electrochemical biofouling. The aptGRP5&#8208;HT operates in complex biological environments without pretreatment, enabling direct monitoring in a rodent psychosocial stress model. Using this tool, we uncover a neurochemical signature of social hierarchy: high&#8208;ranking mice exhibit elevated 5&#8208;HT release in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), with region&#8208;specific correlations to neuronal activity&#8208;reduced spontaneous firing in the mPFC and increased activity in the DRN. This work resolves long&#8208;standing challenges in neurochemical sensing and establishes aptGRP5&#8208;HT as a transformative platform for probing brain function and stress&#8208;related disorders.

         <title>Self&#8208;Optimized Reconstruction of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Introduces Cation Vacancies for Selective Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cation vacancy engineering was employed to tune the electronic and surface structures of the materials, thereby inhibiting further O&#9472;O bond breakage, which leads to excellent 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance under industrial current density for continuous output of ultra&#8208;high H2O2 concentrations in excess of 8 wt%. This work is expected to provide illuminating insights for the development of efficient 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction pathway represents a green production process that has gained increasing importance. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of efficacious catalysts to attain high activity under industrial current density. In this study, we present a strategy for cation vacancy generation through metal&#8211;organic frameworks self&#8208;optimized reconfiguration for the efficient electrosynthesis of H2O2 under industrial current densities in solid&#8208;electrolyte cell. The ZIF&#8208;ZC91@Co(OH)2&#8208;VCo electrocatalyst exhibits significant H2O2 selectivity of 97.8%, and the H2O2 productivity is up to 24.53&#160;mol&#160;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 with a direct and continuous output of &#8764;3.36 wt% H2O2 aqueous solutions under industrial current density (400&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2). Impressively, the ZIF&#8208;ZC91@Co(OH)2&#8208;VCo possesses superb long&#8208;term durability for over 220&#160;h and can output H2O2 aqueous solution with a concentration of &#8764;8.03 wt% in the pilot experiment. Theoretical calculations confirm that the introduction of modest cation vacancies optimizes the adsorption strength of *OOH intermediate and reduces both thermodynamic and kinetic barriers, thus balancing the selectivity of the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction. This work provides valuable insights into the rapid, eco&#8208;friendly synthesis of H2O2 and the rational design of highly active catalysts.

         <title>Integrating Ambient Ionization Mass Spectrometry Imaging and Spatial Transcriptomics on the Same Cancer Tissues to Identify RNA&#8211;Metabolite Correlations</title>

         <dc:description>
Innovations in spatial omics have advanced disease research, but spatial transcriptomics (ST) and spatial metabolomics remain separate. We present a novel method integrating DESI&#8208;MSI spatial metabolomics and Visium&#8208;ST on the same tissue sections while preserving RNA quality and data integrity. Applied to breast and lung cancer tissue, this approach reveals new metabolite&#8208;transcript correlations in cancer regions, enhancing spatial multi&#8208;omics discoveries. 








Abstract
Innovations in spatial omics technologies applied to human tissues have led to breakthrough discoveries in various diseases, including cancer. Two of these approaches&#8212;spatial transcriptomics and spatial metabolomics&#8212;have blossomed independently, fueled by technologies such as spatial transcriptomics (ST) and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). Although powerful, these technologies only offer insights into the spatial distributions of restricted classes of molecules and have not yet been integrated to provide more holistic insights into biological questions. These techniques can be performed on adjacent serial sections from the same sample, but section&#8208;to&#8208;section variability can convolute data integration. We present a novel method combining desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI&#8208;MSI) spatial metabolomics and Visium spatial transcriptomics on the same tissue sections. We show that RNA quality is maintained after performing DESI&#8208;MSI on a tissue under ambient conditions and that ST data is unperturbed following DESI&#8208;MSI. We demonstrate this workflow on human breast and lung cancer tissues and identify novel correlations between metabolites and mRNA transcripts in cancer&#8208;specific tissue regions.

         <title>Regiospecific Halogenation Modulates Molecular Dipoles in Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, through regiospecific bromination on a helical 7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazole&#8208;based SAM (CbzNaph) featuring a stronger dipole, we study the properties related to intrinsic stability, electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution, and changes in the molecular dipole of the derived SAM molecules. Bromination at the chemically inert sites of 7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazole (JJ26) helps maximize molecular dipole while maintaining superior intrinsic stability. Together with the dense assembly promoted by enhanced intermolecular interactions and synergistic effects of stronger crystallinity, JJ26 efficiently modulates the work function (WF) of indium tin oxide (ITO) and enhances the stability of SAM under external pressure. The OSC device adopting JJ26 demonstrates significantly improved performance, achieving an efficiency of 19.35% along with notably enhanced stability. 








Abstract
Halogenated carbazole&#8208;derived self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) are promising hole&#8208;extraction materials in conventional organic solar cells (OSCs). While halogenation helps optimize the molecular dipole, intermolecular interactions, and energetics of SAM, the highly polarizable carbon&#8208;halogen bonds can be reactive and prone to photocleavage depending on their regiochemistry. Herein, we study the regiospecific properties, including the intrinsic stability, electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution, and changes in molecular dipole of the brominated SAM molecules by brominating a helical 7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazole&#8208;based SAM (CbzNaph) featuring a stronger dipole. Additionally, a correlation between the intrinsic molecular stability and the derived SAM surface stability is established to determine the performance and stability of the OSCs. Notably, the bromination at the chemically inert sites of 7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazole (JJ26) helps maximize molecular dipole while maintaining superior intrinsic stability. Together with dense assembly promoted by the synergistically enhanced intermolecular interactions and crystallinity, JJ26 can efficiently modulate the work function (WF) of indium tin oxide (ITO) and enhance the stability of SAM under external stress. Consequently, the JJ26 derived OSC shows significantly improved performance, achieving an efficiency of 19.35% along with notably enhanced stability. This work shows that the precise modulation of the regiochemistry of SAM molecules is critical for improving their quality and derived device performance.

The OSC device adopting JJ26 demonstrates significantly improved performance, achieving an efficiency of 19.35% along with notably enhanced stability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halogenated carbazole-derived self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are promising hole-extraction materials in conventional organic solar cells (OSCs). While halogenation helps optimize the molecular dipole, intermolecular interactions, and energetics of SAM, the highly polarizable carbon-halogen bonds can be reactive and prone to photocleavage depending on their regiochemistry. Herein, we study the regiospecific properties, including the intrinsic stability, electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution, and changes in molecular dipole of the brominated SAM molecules by brominating a helical 7&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-dibenzo[&lt;i&gt;c,g&lt;/i&gt;]carbazole-based SAM (CbzNaph) featuring a stronger dipole. Additionally, a correlation between the intrinsic molecular stability and the derived SAM surface stability is established to determine the performance and stability of the OSCs. Notably, the bromination at the chemically inert sites of 7&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-dibenzo[&lt;i&gt;c,g&lt;/i&gt;]carbazole (JJ26) helps maximize molecular dipole while maintaining superior intrinsic stability. Together with dense assembly promoted by the synergistically enhanced intermolecular interactions and crystallinity, JJ26 can efficiently modulate the work function (WF) of indium tin oxide (ITO) and enhance the stability of SAM under external stress. Consequently, the JJ26 derived OSC shows significantly improved performance, achieving an efficiency of 19.35% along with notably enhanced stability. This work shows that the precise modulation of the regiochemistry of SAM molecules is critical for improving their quality and derived device performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Predator&#8211;Prey Behavior of Droplets Propelling Through Self&#8208;Generated Channels in Crystalline Surfactant Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline layer is formed by an amphiphilic decylamine surfactant at the air/water interface. Aldehyde&#8208;containing ester oil droplets self&#8208;propel by consuming amines from the crystalline layer, thereby generating open channels along which myelin&#8208;forming amphiphile droplets chase and ultimately catch the aldehyde droplets in a predator&#8211;prey analogy.








Abstract
Motile droplets provide an attractive platform for liquid matter&#8208;based applications and protocell analogues displaying life&#8208;like features. The functionality of collectively operating droplets increases by the advance of well&#8208;designed (physico)chemical systems directing droplet&#8211;droplet interactions. Here, we report a strategy based on crystalline surfactant layers at air/water interfaces, which sustain the propulsion of floating droplets and at the same time shape the paths for other droplets attracted by them. First, we show how decylamine forms a closed, crystalline layer that remains at the air/water interface. Second, we demonstrate how aldehyde&#8208;based oil droplets react to decylamine in the crystalline layer by forming an imine, causing the droplets to move through the layer while leaving behind an open channel (comparable to &#8220;Pac&#8208;Man&#8221;). Third, we introduce tri(ethylene glycol) monododecylether (C12E3) droplets in the crystalline layer. The crystalline layer suppresses the motion of the C12E3 droplets, however, the aldehyde droplets create surface tension gradients upon depletion of surfactants from the air/water interface, thereby driving Marangoni flows that attract the C12E3 droplets as well as the myelin filaments they grow: Causing the C12E3 droplets to chase, and ultimately catch, the aldehyde droplets along the channels they have created, featuring a predator&#8208;prey analogy established at an air/water interface.

         <title>Mn(II)&#8208;Based Hybrid Halide Ionogel Scintillator Film for Large&#8208;Area and High&#8208;Resolution X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a versatile approach for the rapid synthesis of luminescent Mn(II)&#8208;based hybrid halide ionogels (Mn&#8208;IG) by in situ forming zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides during monomer polymerization. The Mn&#9472;IG exhibits high transparency (with transmittance approaching 90% at 550&#8211;1100&#160;nm) and uniform, high&#8208;efficiency emission. Leveraging its processability, we have fabricated an 18&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;12&#160;cm scintillating film and successfully achieved large&#8208;area and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging. This simple and rapid synthesis method on ionogels paves the way for the low&#8208;process preparation of large&#8208;area scintillators and also opens up a new avenue for the in situ construction of uniform 0D halide&#8208;polymer composites.








Abstract
Functionalized ionogels have attracted significant attention in chemical design of new materials and versatile applications, which are formed by polymer network as a matrix with introducing ionic liquids containing characteristic units as a dispersion medium. Here, we present an universal scheme to rapidly synthesize luminescent ionogels through the in situ formation of zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides during the polymerization of monomer. In particular, Mn(II)&#8208;based hybrid halide ionogels (Mn&#9472;IG) were formed by incorporating [C20H20P]+ cations and [MnBr4]2&#8722; anions into the polymer network structure. Thanks to the amorphous nature of Mn&#8208;IG and the homogeneous distribution of self&#8208;trapped [MnBr4]2&#8722; light&#8208;emitting units with [C20H20P]+ cations, Mn&#9472;IG exhibits high transparency (nearly 90% transmittance at 550&#160;nm&#8208;1100&#160;nm) and homogeneous highly&#8208;efficient emission. Taking advantage of its processability, we fabricate an 18&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;12&#160;cm scintillation film and successfully realize large&#8208;area and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging. The straightforward and rapid synthesis method on such ionogels paves the way for the low&#8208;process&#8208;demand preparation of large&#8208;area scintillators, and also opens up new routes for the in situ construction of uniform 0D metal halide polymer composites.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling of Arylthianthrenium Salts with (Hetero)aryl (Pseudo)halides via Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing complex arylthianthrenium salts and readily available (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halides as starting materials, in conjunction with hypoboric acid as a reductant, structurally diverse (hetero)biaryl motifs can be rapidly synthesized via palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction. Key to this advance is the selective and mild borylation of arylthianthrenium salts, followed by a conventional SMC (Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling) reaction with aryl halides.








Abstract
Herein, we present a cross&#8208;coupling reaction of arylthianthrenium salts at a late stage with diverse (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halides under reductive conditions, in which a palladium(0) catalyst differentiates between two aryl electrophiles based on the different rates of oxidative addition of arylthianthrenium salts and aryl halides for selective umpolung. A measured near&#8208;zero Hammett rho value is consistent with oxidative addition of the arylthianthrenium salts to palladium(0) being insensitive to substituent effects, which enables reaction with structurally and electronically diverse arylthianthrenium salts. In addition, we show the robustness of this method by coupling of two complex fragments that would otherwise be difficult to access in a single step.

         <title>Reductive Catalytic Fractionation of Lignocellulose Toward Propyl&#8208; or Propenyl&#8208;Substituted Monomers and Mechanistic Understanding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>

Removal of the C&#947;&#9472;OH in methanol solvolyzed lignin followed by simultaneous cleavage of C&#945;&#9472;OH and &#946;&#9472;O&#9472;4 bond enables valorization of native lignin in biomass toward prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl (79.6% selectivity) and propyl (81.7% selectivity) substituted monomers under N2 and H2 atmosphere, respectively.








Abstract
Reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) is a promising technology that can selectively extract lignin in biomass and depolymerize it. Here, we prepared one low Ru loading catalyst (Ru0.8/C) for RCF of biomass to selectively produce different lignin oils (both monomers and oligomers) under different reaction atmospheres. The yield of phenolic monomers reached 46.0wt.% (rich in 4&#8208;propylguaiacol and 4&#8208;propylsyringol) in the RCF of birch wood under high H2 pressure and using methanol as the solvent. But, under N2 atmosphere the dominant monomers shifted to 4&#8208;(prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl)guaiacol and 4&#8208;(prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl)syringol (79.6% selectivity) with 35.8wt.% yield of total monomers using the same catalyst. The developed catalyst can also transform native lignin in other biomasses such as pine and corn stover. Mechanistic investigation using different model compounds and deuteration indicates that removal of the C&#947;&#9472;OH in methanol&#8208;extracted lignin fragments occurred before obtaining the monomeric lignin fragment, and the C&#945;&#9472;OH and &#946;&#9472;O&#9472;4 bonds were then cleaved simultaneously to form 4&#8208;(prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl) substituted monomers. The results are distinct from the reported mechanism that the precursors of the propyl and prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl substituted monomers are monolignols with removal of the C&#947;&#9472;OH at the monomeric level. Thus, this work provided novel insights into the reaction pathway of (native) lignin depolymerization.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) is a promising technology that can selectively extract lignin in biomass and depolymerize it. Here, we prepared one low Ru loading catalyst (Ru&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;/C) for RCF of biomass to selectively produce different lignin oils (both monomers and oligomers) under different reaction atmospheres. The yield of phenolic monomers reached 46.0wt.% (rich in 4-propylguaiacol and 4-propylsyringol) in the RCF of birch wood under high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure and using methanol as the solvent. But, under N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere the dominant monomers shifted to 4-(prop-1-enyl)guaiacol and 4-(prop-1-enyl)syringol (79.6% selectivity) with 35.8wt.% yield of total monomers using the same catalyst. The developed catalyst can also transform native lignin in other biomasses such as pine and corn stover. Mechanistic investigation using different model compounds and deuteration indicates that removal of the C&lt;sub&gt;&#947;&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;OH in methanol-extracted lignin fragments occurred before obtaining the monomeric lignin fragment, and the C&lt;sub&gt;&#945;&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;OH and &#946;&#9472;O&#9472;4 bonds were then cleaved simultaneously to form 4-(prop-1-enyl) substituted monomers. The results are distinct from the reported mechanism that the precursors of the propyl and prop-1-enyl substituted monomers are monolignols with removal of the C&lt;sub&gt;&#947;&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;OH at the monomeric level. Thus, this work provided novel insights into the reaction pathway of (native) lignin depolymerization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Novel Tandem Reaction System for High&#8208;Concentration Acetic Acid Production from Methane and Oxygen</title>

This study developed a plasma&#8208;thermo&#8208;catalytic tandem system, optimizing plasma processes in a self&#8208;designed reactor to achieve 68.0% methane conversion and 5.2&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1 methanol concentration. A hydrophobic ReRh/ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;S catalyst minimized byproduct effects, enabling 52.0% acetic acid selectivity and 1.3&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1 concentration, three orders of magnitude higher than traditional methods, meeting industrial criteria and advancing efficient methane utilization. 








Abstract
Directly converting methane into high&#8208;value products like CH3COOH poses significant challenges owing to the kinetic limitations of C&#9472;H activation and C&#9472;C coupling in traditional single&#8208;catalysis methods. This work systematically studied the compatibility and effectiveness of plasma and thermocatalytic tandem systems. By optimizing the plasma process in a self&#8208;designed dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor, we enhanced methane conversion (68.0%), methanol concentration (5.2&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1), and CO selectivity (56.9%), while preventing carbon deposition and CO2 formation. In subsequent thermocatalysis, we developed the stearic acid&#8208;modified ReRh/ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;S hydrophobic catalyst to avoid the separation of methanol and CO from the mixture and minimize the influence of by&#8208;products (e.g., H2O). This innovative approach achieved 52.0% CH3COOH selectivity and 1.3&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1 concentrations, three orders of magnitude than traditional methods, meeting the preliminary industrial criteria. This study demonstrates the potential of tandem catalysis, offering valuable insights for the efficient utilization of methane and other challenging catalytic reactions.

         <title>Superfast Protein Desulfurization Triggered by Low&#8208;Energy Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical strategy of low&#8208;energy visible light&#8208;induced desulfurization (LEnVLD) has been developed to enable superfast and clean desulfurization under exceptionally mild conditions. The utility of LEnVLD was demonstrated through the clean desulfurization of a wide range of peptide and protein substrates, and its convenience and robustness facilitated the application of LEnVLD in versatile reaction scenarios such as solid&#8208;supported desulfurization and flow chemistry&#8208;based desulfurization.








Abstract
The combination of transthioesterification&#8208;based ligation of thiol&#8208;derived amino acids and the post&#8208;ligation desulfurization has greatly expanded the scope of modern chemical protein synthesis. Here, we report a new strategy of low&#8208;energy visible light&#8208;induced desulfurization (LEnVLD) that enables superfast and clean protein desulfurization (half life =&#160;1.7&#160;s) with improved reaction selectivity compared to the previous methods. The LEnVLD method can be easily carried out under very mild conditions using only a catalytic amount of fluorescent dye and household flashlight (ca. 5&#160;W) irradiation, eliminating the need for any pyrophoric reagent, thiol additives, or excessive radical initiators, and its practicality was demonstrated by the fast and high&#8208;yielding desulfurization of more than 30 peptide and protein substrates bearing a variety of sensitive functional groups (e.g., Thz, N&#8208;alkylated maleimide, and thioester). Moreover, the convenience and robustness of LEnVLD enable its extension to versatile reaction scenarios (e.g., solid&#8208;supported desulfurization and flow chemistry&#8208;based desulfurization) that would enhance the practical capability of chemical protein synthesis.

         <title>Tandem Biocatalysis to Generate Hydrogen Sulfide and Promote Endogenous Antioxidant Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy where we integrated spatially and temporally controlled catalysis in one system to promote antioxidant response is reported. We developed a glycoconjugate that is cleaved sequentially by &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (&#946;&#8208;gal) and 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST) to produce potent antioxidants persulfide and hydrogen sulfide, and this compound was found to mitigate inflammation in an animal model.








Abstract
Promoting cellular protective responses during oxidative stress conditions through the generation of antioxidant persulfide (RS&#8208;SH) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has tremendous therapeutic potential. Here, we report a bioinspired glycoconjugate, a candidate for tandem biocatalysis and generates persulfide/ H2S in response to oxidative stress. The glycoconjugate is cleaved by &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, an enzyme that is expressed during oxidative stress; the product of this reaction is a substrate for 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST), an enzyme that is involved in persulfide/ H2S biosynthesis. The catalytic systems are orthogonal to one another, and the glycoconjugate is efficiently cleaved by these enzymes to generate the potent antioxidant glutathione persulfide as well as H2S. We demonstrate the efficacy of this conjugate in mitigating inflammation in the brain in an animal model. Together, using rationally designed substrates and fully catalytic steps, we leverage tandem biocatalysis to direct the generation of persulfide/ H2S, and promote cells&#8217; own antioxidant response.

         <title>Plastic from CO2, Water, and Electricity: Tandem Electrochemical CO2 Reduction and Thermochemical Ethylene&#8208;CO Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new system of generating entirely CO2&#8208;generated abiotic polymers by integrating electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) and organometallic polymerization catalysis is presented, having an overall CO2&#8208;to&#8208;polymer conversion of 14% and current&#8208;to&#8208;polymer efficiency of 51%. A strategy for tuning the product composition obtained from eCO2R by combining different electrocatalysts is introduced. CO&#8208;ethylene copolymerization activity in the presence of potential poisons from eCO2R is retained.








Abstract
Converting CO2 into industrially useful products is an appealing strategy for utilization of an abundant chemical resource. Electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) offers a pathway to convert CO2 into CO and ethylene, using renewable electricity. These products can be efficiently copolymerized by organometallic catalysts to generate polyketones. However, the conditions for these reactions are very different, presenting the challenge of coupling microenvironments typically encountered for the transformation of CO2 into highly complex but desirable multicarbon products. Herein, we present a system to produce polyketone plastics entirely derived from CO2 and water, where both the CO and C2H4 intermediates are produced by eCO2R. In this system, a combination of Cu and Ag gas diffusion electrodes is used to generate a gas mixture with nearly equal concentrations of CO and C2H4, and a recirculatory CO2 reduction loop is used to reach concentrations of above 11% each, leading to a current&#8208;to&#8208;polymer efficiency of up to 51% and CO2 utilization of 14%.

In this system, a combination of Cu and Ag gas diffusion electrodes is used to generate a gas mixture with nearly equal concentrations of CO and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and a recirculatory CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction loop is used to reach concentrations of above 11% each, leading to a current-to-polymer efficiency of up to 51% and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization of 14%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spherical Nucleic Acids&#8208;Directed Cryosynthesis of Manganese Nanoagents for Tumor Imaging and Therapy</title>

DNA&#8208;templated theranostic manganese nanoparticles synthesized under liquid nitrogen show features of magnetic resonance imaging, gene silencing, and chemodynamic therapy for tumors.








Abstract
DNAzyme&#8208;based theranostic nanotechnologies that can respond to specific tumor pathophysiological parameters hold great promise for tumor diagnostics and effective treatments. However, their clinical translation is hindered by insufficient intracellular availability of essential metal cofactors required for DNAzyme activation. To overcome this limitation, we developed a temperature&#8208;controlled synthesis strategy for fabricating multifunctional DNA&#8208;templated manganese carbonate nanoparticles (DtMnP). The process involves three critical phases: (i) spherical nucleic acid hybrids, DNAzyme&#8208;functionalized AuNPs, serve as scaffolds for spatially controlled Mn2+ deposition through phosphate coordination, initiating heterogeneous nucleation of MnCO3; (ii) rapid liquid nitrogen freezing induces nanoparticle growth along DNA templates; and (iii) lyophilization&#8208;mediated structural stabilization enables convenient long&#8208;term storage. The DtMnP exhibits pH&#8208;responsive dissolution, releasing 90% of Mn2+ within 60&#160;min under tumor microenvironment conditions (pH 5.5). The released Mn2+ ion enables dual functionality: (i) superior magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast of MCF&#8208;7 xenograft models with enhanced biosafety, and (ii) synergistic therapeutic efficacy through DNAzyme&#8208;mediated EGR&#8208;1 gene silencing (60% mRNA downregulation) combined with Mn2+&#8208;catalyzed Fenton reactions generating cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (45% apoptosis in MCF&#8208;7 cells). The cryo&#8208;encapsulated DtMnP exemplifies a flexible and efficient approach for integrating various functional components into a single nanoparticle for tumor theranostic applications.

         <title>Nitrogen Insertion via Asymmetric Condensation and Chirality Transfer: A Stereodivergent Entry to Cyanocyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of cyanocyclopropanes is achieved via asymmetric nitrogen insertion into prochiral cyclobutanones. Key mechanistic steps involve an organocatalyzed asymmetric condensation followed by chirality transfer via an intercepted Neber rearrangement. The reaction can be conducted in a one&#8208;pot, stereodivergent manner, allowing access to all possible cyclopropane isomers with precise control of stereochemistry.








Abstract
The condensation of prochiral cyclobutanones and diphenylphosphinyl hydroxylamine is achieved under Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. Interestingly, the competing aza&#8208;Baeyer&#8211;Villiger reaction is completely suppressed and the axially chiral oxime esters can be isolated in excellent yield and selectivity (up to 96% yield, up to 97:3 er). Computational analysis highlights the crucial role of the Br&#248;nsted acid in facilitating a successful condensation. Building on the inherent reactivity of the corresponding oxime esters, a one&#8208;pot protocol toward cyanocyclopropanes was discovered, which establishes two consecutive stereocenters. This unusual ring contraction is triggered by strong base and permits an axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality transfer with good enantiospecificity (up to 98% es). Fine&#8208;tuning the reaction parameters enables stereodivergent access to both diastereomers of the cyanocyclopropanes, and the utility of this method is demonstrated through the formal synthesis of the drug tasimelteon.

         <title>Highly Selective Oxygen Electroreduction to Hydrogen Peroxide on Sulfur&#8208;Doped Mesoporous Carbon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertically aligned sulfur&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon spheres achieve outstanding 2e&#8315;&#8208;ORR performance with &gt;99% H&#8322;O&#8322; selectivity, &#8722;3.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8315;2 current density, and 25&#160;mol&#160;g&#8315;&#185;&#160;h&#8315;&#185; yield. The sp2/sp3 hybrid network synergized with S&#8208;induced charge redistribution creates electron&#8208;deficient hotspots for *OOH stabilization, combining metal&#8208;like efficiency, chemical robustness, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. This structural&#8211;electronic paradigm opens a new way for sustainable H&#8322;O&#8322; electrosynthesis.








Abstract
As a paradigm&#8208;shifting material platform in energy catalysis, precisely engineered ordered mesoporous carbon spheres emerge as supreme metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts, outperforming conventional carbon&#8208;based counterparts through synergistic structural and electronic innovations. Herein, we architecturally design vertically aligned cylindrical mesoporous carbon spheres with atomic&#8208;level sulfur doping (S&#8208;mC) that establish unprecedented performance benchmarks in the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR) to hydrogen peroxide. Systematic comparative studies reveal that the S&#8208;mC catalysts achieve exceptional H2O2 selectivity (&gt;99%) and activity at current density of &#8722;3.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal&#8208;free catalysts in current density. Impressively, the optimized S&#8208;mC electrocatalyst in a flow cell device achieves an exceptional H2O2 yield of 25&#160;mol&#160;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. The carbon matrix's unique sp2/sp3 hybrid network coupled with S&#8208;induced charge redistribution generates electron&#8208;deficient hotspots that selectively stabilize *OOH intermediates, as evidenced by in situ spectroscopic characterization and DFT calculations. This structural&#8211;electronic synergy endows the carbon framework with metal&#8208;like catalytic efficiency while maintaining inherent advantages of chemical robustness and cost&#8208;effectiveness. The marriage of S&#8208;doping engineering with mesoscopic pore architecture control opens a new way for developing efficient carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen selective reduction to H2O2.

         <title>Short Lifetime Radical Metal Cluster Scintillator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first luminescence radical cluster was constructed with open&#8208;shell luminescent radical ligands. The spin&#8208;allowed doublet emission endows it with 100% exciton utilization and a short radiation decay lifetime on the nanosecond scale, making it suitable for high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging without residual images.








Abstract
Metal clusters, an emerging class of scintillator materials, have attracted much attention owing to their inherently high X&#8208;ray absorption, mild synthesis conditions, low toxicity, strong luminescence, and large Stokes shift. However, the decay lifetime of metal clusters is usually on the order of microseconds, which is unfavorable for safety inspection, nondestructive testing, and medical imaging. Here, the open&#8208;shell luminescent radical ligand was used to construct the first radical cluster scintillator Cu2I2(L)4. The spin&#8208;allowed doublet emission of Cu2I2(L)4 theoretically enabled 100% exciton utilization and exhibited a short radiation decay lifetime on the nanosecond scale. Cu2I2(L)4 can be fabricated into a flexible scintillator screen for X&#8208;ray imaging, achieving a high resolution of 30.7&#160;LP mm&#8722;1. More importantly, the Cu2I2(L)4 scintillator screen has no residual images during X&#8208;ray imaging. This work reports the first luminescent metal cluster with a radical ligand and presents a new strategy for constructing short lifetime X&#8208;ray scintillators.

         <title>A Powerful Regulator to Enhance Electrocatalytic Reaction Kinetics and Thermodynamics: The Ordered Hetero&#8208;Nanowire</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ordered hetero&#8208;nanowire (NW) regulator is presented, which simultaneously couples the merits of the kinetics and thermodynamics in electrocatalysis. The periodical arrangement enables the formation of the local electric field to improve mass transfer kinetics, accounting for a significant boost in MOR performance. In addition, the hetero&#8208;NWs undergo the energetically favorable non&#8208;CO pathway, which is not susceptible to the invasion of toxic carbonaceous intermediates and thus ensures long&#8208;term durability for MOR.








Abstract
Optimizing the thermodynamics of electrode reactions is a valid strategy for achieving superior electrocatalysts for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). However, as the catalyst downsizes to the nanoscale, the influence of mass transfer kinetics is pronounced in improving electrocatalytic activity. Herein, an ordered hetero&#8208;nanowire (NW) regulator that couples the virtues of kinetics and thermodynamics is reported. Finite element analysis demonstrates that the periodic arrangement of hetero&#8208;NWs could construct a uniform electric field, promoting the precise mass transfer of reactant molecules and accelerating the electrode reaction kinetics for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). In addition, the microscopic electronic structure effect of the well&#8208;defined catalyst weakens the bonding interaction toward toxic carbonaceous intermediates, which meanwhile strengthens the adsorption of hydroxyl species, critically contributing to enhanced MOR durability. The wide generality of this regulator has been confirmed by a series of as&#8208;prepared ordered hetero&#8208;NW catalysts, which show prominent electrocatalytic performance, including relatively high mass activity, superior CO resistance, and long&#8208;term stability. Therefore, this work reveals the importance of the tandem effect of kinetics and thermodynamics in electrocatalysis, which provides valuable insights for developing customized and highly efficient catalysts for extensive applications.

         <title>A 3D Hybrid Perovskite Ferroelastic with Triclinic&#8208;to&#8208;Cubic Phase Transition Boosts Temperature/Pressure Dual On/Off Switchable Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D hybrid perovskite ferroelastic shows both temperature&#8208; and pressure&#8208;triggered m3&#175;mF1&#175;$m{\mathrm{\bar{3}}}m{\mathrm{F}}{\mathrm{\bar{1}}}$ phase transitions at 296&#160;K and critical pressure of 0.3&#160;GPa, which enables the temperature/pressure dual stimuli induced on/off switching of birefringence between birefringence&#8208;active state in anisotropic ferroelastic P1&#175;$P{\mathrm{\bar{1}}}$ phase and birefringence&#8208;inactive state in isotropic paraelastic Fm3&#175;m$Fm{\mathrm{\bar{3}}}m$ phase. Such a dual&#8208;stimuli switchable birefringence is unprecedented.








Abstract
Birefringent crystals have gained enormous attention for decades due to their unique ability to manipulate polarized light. However, achieving the fascinating on/off (active/inactive) switchable birefringence under external stimuli in crystals remains a huge challenge, and the stimuli employed have been constrained predominantly to temperature. Here, through H/F substitution, we designed a 3D hybrid double perovskite ferroelastic [C3H5FNH2]2[(NH4)Fe(CN)6] (1&#8208;F), which undergoes a m3&#175;mF1&#175;$m {\mathrm{\bar{3}}}m{\mathrm{F}}{\mathrm{\bar{1}}}$ ferroelastic transition at 296&#160;K, with the highest possible orientation states of 24 among ferroelastic crystals. Notably, the ferroelastic phase transition of 1&#8208;F can also be triggered by pressure with a low critical pressure of &#8764;0.3&#160;GPa. More importantly, 1&#8208;F shows the unprecedented temperature/pressure dual stimuli&#8208;induced on/off switching of birefringence between the birefringence&#8208;active state in the anisotropic triclinic ferroelastic P1&#175;$P{\mathrm{\bar{1}}}$ phase and the birefringence&#8208;inactive state in the isotropic cubic paraelastic Fm3&#175;m$Fm{\mathrm{\bar{3}}}m$ phase during the m3&#175;mF1&#175;$m{\mathrm{\bar{3}}}m{\mathrm{F}}{\mathrm{\bar{1}}}$ ferroelastic transition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of dual stimuli&#8208;induced switchable birefringence in crystals. Our work paves a new way for the switching of birefringence and sheds light on the further exploration of switchable birefringence in ferroelastics.

         <title>Discovery and Biosynthesis of Celluxanthenes, Antibacterial Arylpolyene Alkaloids From Diverse Cellulose&#8208;Degrading Anaerobic Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure and biosynthetic origin of the enigmatic &#8220;yellow affinity substance&#8221; (YAS) from the anaerobe thermophile Clostridium thermocellum (now: Acetivibrio thermocellus) were elucidated. YAS is a complex of unusual antibacterial arylpolyene alkaloids (celluxanthenes) that are produced by various cellulolytic anaerobes.








Abstract
Cellulose degradation by anaerobic bacteria plays an eminent role in the global carbon cycle and is a critical step in biofuel production. The anaerobic thermophile Clostridium thermocellum (now: Acetivibrio thermocellus) is particularly efficient at breaking down biomass and produces a &#8220;yellow affinity substance&#8221; (YAS), a pigment that has been implicated in signaling and conferring higher affinity of the cellulosome to YAS&#8208;loaded cellulose. However, the nature and biosynthetic origin of YAS have remained elusive. Here, we show by isolation and structure elucidation that YAS is a complex of unusual arylpolyene alkaloids (celluxanthenes). Stable isotope labeling experiments reveal all biosynthetic building blocks for celluxanthene assembly. Through a targeted gene deletion, we identify the celluxanthene (cex) biosynthesis gene cluster and propose a biosynthetic model in which an arylpolyene generated by an iterative type I polyketide synthase (PKS) undergoes a head&#8208;to&#8208;head fusion with a tryptophan&#8208;derived ketoacid to form a tetronate. Genome mining and metabolic profiling revealed that diverse cellulolytic anaerobes harbor cex gene loci and produce celluxanthene congeners. Celluxanthenes show antibiotic activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria including clinically relevant strains. This study solves the long&#8208;standing enigma surrounding the nature of YAS and lays the groundwork for elucidating the precise biological roles of these intricate pigments.

         <title>N&#8208;(Acyldithio)Saccharin: Design, Synthesis and Applications in Catalytic Enantioselective Disulfuration/Amination of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;(Acyldithio)saccharins are a novel class of highly electrophilic disulfurating reagents. Beyond enabling the disulfuration of diverse N&#8208;, S&#8208;, and Cnucleophiles, the reagents facilitate the catalytic enantioselective disulfuration/amination of unactivated alkenes. The resulting &#945;&#8208;chiral disulfide products can be readily converted into various chiral sulfur&#8208;containing compounds.








Abstract
We have designed and successfully synthesized N&#8208;(acyldithio)saccharin, which is a highly electrophilic, bench&#8208;stable, and user&#8208;friendly disulfurating reagent. This reagent can undergo reactions with diverse N&#8208;, S&#8208;, and C&#8208;nucleophiles at room temperature. In most cases, no additional catalyst is required, and the desired disulfides were readily obtained in moderate to excellent yields. With this reagent, late&#8208;stage disulfuration of pharmaceuticals and biomolecules was readily accomplished. For the first time, catalytic enantioselective disulfuration/amination of unactivated alkenes was achieved using this reagent. A series of chiral disulfides were obtained with high enantioselectivities and yields. The chiral disulfide products can be readily further transformed into chiral sulfonyl fluoride, chiral thiol, and structurally diverse disulfide products. Furthermore, we have evaluated the electrophilic reactivity of a series of disulfurating reagents based on density functional theory calculations, verifying the high reactivity of N&#8208;(acyldithio)saccharin both experimentally and theoretically.

         <title>Vacancy and Dopant Co&#8208;Constructed Active Microregion in Ru&#8211;MoO3&#8722;x/Mo2AlB2 for Enhanced Acidic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ru&#8208;doped low crystalline&#8208;crystalline MoO3&#8722;x/Mo2AlB2 hybrid material was designed. The region containing Ru atom and/or O vacancy is innovatively defined as the active microregion. The Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Mo bonds with shorter bond lengths provide satisfactory preconditions for the electronic structure modulation of O atoms. The &#8710;GH* of electron&#8208;rich O atoms is close to 0, which can effectively enhance the catalytic activity of HER.








Abstract
Accurate identification of catalytic active regions is crucial for the rational design and construction of hydrogen evolution catalysts as well as the targeted regulation of their catalytic performance. Herein, the low crystalline&#8208;crystalline hybrid MoO3&#8722;x/Mo2AlB2 with unsaturated coordination and rich defects is taken as the precursor. Through the Joule heating reaction, the Ru&#8208;doped MoO3&#8722;x/Mo2AlB2 catalyst is successfully constructed. Building on the traditional view that individual atoms or vacancies act as active sites, this article innovatively proposes the theory that vacancies and doped atoms synergistically construct active microregions, and multiple electron&#8208;rich O atoms within the active microregions jointly serve as hydrogen evolution active sites. Based on X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis and first&#8208;principles calculations, there is a strong electron transfer among Ru atoms, Mo atoms, and O atoms, leading to extensive O atoms with optimized electronic structure in the active microregions. These O atoms exhibit an H* adsorption free energy close to zero, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution. This work provides a brand&#8208;new strategy for the design and preparation of electrocatalytic materials and the systematic regulation of the local electronic structure of catalysts.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Competitive Adsorption Sites Tailoring Unlocks Efficient Hybrid Conversion Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>

Entropy&#8208;driven competitive adsorption modulation in perovskite electrocatalysts enables hybrid conversion Zn&#8211;air batteries that couple sustainable energy storage and green chemical synthesis.








Abstract
Hybrid conversion Zn&#8211;air batteries (HC&#8208;ZABs) epitomize a typical integrated energy storage and conversion device that advances green chemistry and reduces carbon emissions. However, balancing efficiency and selectivity of electrocatalytic cathodic reactions remains the bottleneck in such batteries. Herein, we address this issue by designing a high&#8208;entropy perovskite, La0.6Sr0.1Ca0.1Rb0.1Y0.1CoO3 (HE&#8208;LCO), which outperforms conventional perovskites in offering enhanced electrocatalytic activity, better selectivity, and outstanding stability for cathodic benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction (BAOR). Combined spectroscopy characterizations, operando measurements, and theoretic calculations reveal that the entropy&#8208;driven modulation of the second coordination sphere in HE&#8208;LCO balances the adsorption of nucleophile benzyl alcohol and OH&#8722;, while inhibiting competing oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Based on this rationalized HE&#8208;LCO electrocatalyst, HC&#8208;ZABs realized efficient energy storage and benzoic acid production, boasting a long lifespan of 900 cycles at 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 6.7 mAh cm&#8722;2 per cycle. Further, practical ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;scale HC&#8208;ZABs demonstrated a 62.8% energy efficiency improvement and an average benzoic acid yield of 0.85&#160;g per cycle, highlighting the potential of this integrated device for simultaneous sustainable energy storage and green electrochemical synthesis.

         <title>A Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8208;Type Two&#8208;Dimensional Poly(Arylene Vinylene) for Efficient Electron Transport and Sensitive Chemiresistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type two&#8208;dimensional poly(arylene vinylene) has been developed, exhibiting a narrow optical band gap and a unique electron&#8208;dominating transport with high charge carrier mobility toward ultrasensitive chemiresistors.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conjugated polymers and their layer&#8208;stacked 2D conjugated covalent organic frameworks, such as 2D poly(arylene vinylene)s (2D PAVs), are emerging as promising polymer semiconductors for electronics and photocatalysis. However, achieving narrow optical band gaps and efficient electron transport remains a significant challenge for this class of materials to enhance the device's performance. Here, we report a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;type 2D PAV (2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT, where TBDT&#160;=&#160;thienyl&#8208;benzodithiophene and IT&#160;=&#160;s&#8208;indacene&#8208;1,3,5,7(2H,6H)&#8208;tetraone) synthesized via an Aldol&#8208;type 2D polycondensation approach. Notably, 2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT benefits from an effective intralayer donor&#8211;acceptor effect, exhibiting an optical band gap of 1.15&#160;eV, the smallest among the reported 2D conjugated polymers. Density functional theory calculations reveal a unique electron&#8208;dominating transport for 2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT, with a strongly dispersive conduction band minimum and, thus, a small effective mass for electrons half that for holes. Additionally, terahertz spectroscopy measurements indicate a high charge mobility of 26&#160;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at room temperature for the powder sample. Given the high electron&#8208;deficiency of 2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT for facile electron injection from hazardous gases and the high&#8208;mobility electron&#8208;dominating transport in the material, we further fabricate chemiresistors from 2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT, showing ultrasensitive SO2 analyte detection with limit of detection of 0.088&#160;ppb, significantly surpassing the reported chemiresistive SO2 sensors.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Metalated 1D Perylene Diimide Carbon&#8208;Organic Framework for Enhanced Photocatalytic &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#9472;H Activation and CO2 Reduction</title>

A one&#8208;dimensional ABC&#8208;stacking covalent organic framework (PP&#8208;COF), integrating perylene diimide (PDI) as a photosensitizer and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline as a metal&#8208;coordination site, was synthesized. Post&#8208;synthetic cobalt metalation afforded PP&#8208;COF&#8208;Co, which enhanced single oxygen (1O2) generation and electron&#8208;hole pair separation, significantly boosting its photocatalytic performance in &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#9472;H activation and CO2 reduction.








Abstract
The photocatalytic activation of inert C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds in saturated aza&#8208;heterocycles provides a direct and efficient route to high&#8208;value &#945;&#8208;amino amides but remains challenging due to intrinsically high bond dissociation energies. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;metalated, one&#8208;dimensional ABC&#8208;stacking covalent organic framework (PP&#8208;COF&#8208;Co), integrating perylene diimide (PDI) as a photosensitizer and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline as a metal coordination site. Cobalt metalation significantly enhances photocatalytic efficiency, enabling the &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#9472;H carbamoylation of saturated aza&#8208;heterocycles with yields of up to 91%, far surpassing its non&#8208;metalated counterpart (59%). This enhancement arises from the synergistic interplay between the PDI units and cobalt centers, which promote electron&#8208;hole pair separation and enhance singlet oxygen (1O2) generation. Moreover, PP&#8208;COF&#8208;Co exhibits a 57&#8208;fold increase in photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity compared to its pristine analogue. This work highlights the critical role of metalation in modulating charge dynamics within COF&#8208;based photocatalysts and offers insights into the development of next&#8208;generation materials for sustainable catalysis.

Post-synthetic cobalt metalation afforded &lt;b&gt;PP-COF-Co&lt;/b&gt;, which enhanced single oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) generation and electron-hole pair separation, significantly boosting its photocatalytic performance in &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;H activation and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photocatalytic activation of inert C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;H bonds in saturated &lt;i&gt;aza&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycles provides a direct and efficient route to high-value &#945;-amino amides but remains challenging due to intrinsically high bond dissociation energies. Herein, we report a cobalt-metalated, one-dimensional ABC-stacking covalent organic framework (&lt;b&gt;PP-COF-Co&lt;/b&gt;), integrating perylene diimide (PDI) as a photosensitizer and 1,10-phenanthroline as a metal coordination site. Cobalt metalation significantly enhances photocatalytic efficiency, enabling the &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;H carbamoylation of saturated &lt;i&gt;aza&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycles with yields of up to 91%, far surpassing its non-metalated counterpart (59%). This enhancement arises from the synergistic interplay between the PDI units and cobalt centers, which promote electron-hole pair separation and enhance singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) generation. Moreover, &lt;b&gt;PP-COF-Co&lt;/b&gt; exhibits a 57-fold increase in photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction activity compared to its pristine analogue. This work highlights the critical role of metalation in modulating charge dynamics within COF-based photocatalysts and offers insights into the development of next-generation materials for sustainable catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

1,2&#8208;Azaborines serve as building blocks to enantiomerically enriched &#948;&#8208;aminoboronic esters through the development of the first enantioselective hydrogenation of a boron&#8208;containing heteroarene.








Abstract
We describe herein an iridium&#8208;catalyzed highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation of 1,2&#8208;azaborines to access &#948;&#8208;aminoboronic esters of potential biological importance. This method represents the first enantioselective hydrogenation of a boron&#8208;containing heteroarene and features diverse substitution patterns and wide scope. The synthetic utility of our method was demonstrated by the synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;phenibut and the formal synthesis of (+)&#8208;3&#8208;PPP and fluvirucinine A1.

Abstract
Primary arylamines are the most pivotal class of organic motifs in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, ligands and natural products. Ammonia (NH3) is an ideal nitrogen source in terms of reactivity, atom economy, and environmental compatibility. Despite significant progress in the synthesis of primary arylamines, the development of a general method for rapid access to diversely functionalized primary arylamines is still urgent and necessary. Herein, we developed a method for the direct synthesis of primary arylamines through electrochemical amination of aryl halides with NH3. Notably, the weak nucleophilic reagent NH3 was directly used as an ammonia surrogate, allowing for efficient conversion of carbon&#8208;halogen bonds to diverse primary arylamines with good functional group tolerance. A broad scope of functionalized primary arylamines has been achieved in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergent Carbosilylation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Coupling Reactions</title>

A regiodivergent nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbosilylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes using aldehydes and silylboranes has been developed, with ligand control influencing the reaction pathway. The employment of triethylphosphine promotes 4,3&#8208;addition selectivity, whereas using (2&#8208;biphenyl)dicyclohexylphosphine leads to 4,1&#8208;addition selectivity.








Abstract
The regiodivergent carbosilylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes presents a formidable challenge due to inherently complex selectivity control over multiple potential reaction pathways. Here, we report a ligand&#8208;controlled, regiodivergent carbosilylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with aldehydes and silylboranes, achieving unprecedented site&#8208;selectivity using nickel catalysts with distinct phosphine ligands. The use of triethylphosphine promotes 4,3&#8208;addition selectivity, while employing (2&#8208;biphenyl)dicyclohexylphosphine facilitates 4,1&#8208;addition selectivity. This method displays excellent regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, as well as a broad substrate scope and substantial functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies indicate that the ligand choice is crucial for directing the reaction pathway and stabilizing &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;nickel intermediates. Our protocol provides a practical and efficient approach to synthesizing valuable functionalized allylsilanes, which are important in various synthetic applications.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the CO2&#8208;Assisted NO Electrochemical Deoxygenation and Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy utilizing CO2 to assist NO electroreduction has been proposed to enhance NH3 synthesis performance. The primary reason for this enhancement is that *CO and *COOH (produced from CO2 reduction) facilitate the deoxygenation of *NO and the hydrogenation of *N, respectively.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic NO reduction to NH3 holds significant potential for pollutant treatment and resource recovery. Herein, we report that the introduction of CO2 on octahedral oxide&#8208;derived copper (o&#8208;OD&#8208;Cu) significantly enhances the electrochemical reduction of NO to NH3. With 10% NO in a CO2 environment, the Faradaic efficiency for NH3 production in a flow cell remains around 80% over a wide current density range from 20 to 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. At a current density of 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, the yield can reach up to 1403.9&#160;&#181;mol&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, which is 3.71 times higher than without CO2 and surpasses the performance reported in similar literature. Moreover, even at a low concentration of 1% NO, the Faradaic efficiency can reach a maximum of 70.11% at a current density of 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. In situ investigations and theoretical calculations revealed that, in the coexistence of NO and CO2, the NO reduction pathway involves a unique route wherein *CO and *COOH, produced from CO2 reduction, can respectively promote the deoxygenation of *NO and hydrogenation of *N by acquiring O atoms from *NO and providing H atoms for the sustained hydrogenation of *N, thereby accelerating the conversion process of NO to NH3.

Vanadium and aurintricarboxylic coordination nanoparticles generate singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals specifically triggered by acidic H2O2 via dual&#8208;Russell reaction and Fenton&#8208;like reaction while depleting glutathione. Significantly, adenosine triphosphate induces VAP NPs aggregation, strengthens hydrogen&#8208;bonding network, and accelerates proton/electron transfer, thereby amplifying ROS level to co&#8208;activate ferroptosis and apoptosis.








Abstract
Compared to the intractability of traditional apoptosis, the vulnerability exposed by cancer cell metabolic reprogramming provides an advantage for ferroptosis treatment. Herein, we developed vanadate and aurintricarboxylic acid coordination nanoparticles (VAP NPs) that synergistically trigger dual cell death pathways. This nanoplatform leveraged dual&#8208;Russell mechanisms and Fenton reactions to generate singlet oxygen/hydroxyl radicals in the tumor microenvironment (TME) while depleting glutathione via vanadium redox cycling, thereby silencing glutathione peroxidase 4 and modulating the Kelch&#8208;like ECH&#8208;associated protein 1 (KEAP1)/nuclear factor erythroid 2&#8208;related factor 2 (NRF2)/heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) axis. Notably, TME&#8208;overexpressed adenosine triphosphate (ATP) acted as a biochemical catalyst, accelerating the transfer of protons and electrons during reactive oxygen species generation to amplify therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, VAP NPs could achieve outstanding efficacy for intrinsically stimulated synergy of ferroptosis and apoptosis in tumor therapy. This study provides reference for revealing the new function of ATP in enhancing the regulation of redox metabolism.

         <title>Self&#8208;Compartmented Electrolyte Design for Stable Cycling of Lithium Metal Batteries under Extreme Conditions</title>

Self&#8208;compartmented electrolyte: A novel electrolyte concept utilizing LiTDI enables a high&#8208;concentration, anion&#8208;rich interfacial region and a low&#8208;concentration bulk electrolyte. This unique design simultaneously enhances interfacial stability and ion transport kinetics in high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Electrolyte is the key component dictating lithium battery performance, especially under extreme conditions such as fast cycling and low temperatures. However, conventional electrolyte design principles, which generally rely on a homogeneous mixture of solvents, salts, and functional additives, fail to simultaneously meet the requirements for both anodic/cathodic interfacial stability and bulk ion&#8208;transport kinetics in lithium metal batteries. Herein, we present a self&#8208;compartmented electrolyte design methodology. Lithium 4,5&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;ide (LiTDI), featuring the ability to selectively self&#8208;assemble on the cathode/electrolyte interface, compartmented the electrolyte into a heterogonous one. Close to the cathode side, LiTDI could induce an interfacial high&#8208;concentration region, where the anion&#8208;rich solvation structure facilitates the formation of a stable cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI). In the bulk, the electrolyte maintains a low concentration with low viscosity, ensuring fast ion transport and superior rate performance. Li||NCM811 cells achieve over 500 stable cycles with 80.3% capacity retention and deliver 169.3&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at a 10C discharge rate. Under low&#8208;temperature conditions (&#8722;20&#160;&#176;C), the cells maintained outstanding stability over 700 cycles at 0.5C charge/discharge, achieving capacity retention of 96.6% and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.2%. This work provides a new electrolyte design paradigm, addressing the critical challenges of LMBs for high&#8208;voltage and low&#8208;temperature applications.

         <title>Switchable Closed&#8208;Shell and Open&#8208;Shell Biradical States in Bis&#8208;Palladium Complexes of Tetrathiadodecaphyrin via Coordination Rearrangement</title>

         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;Pd(II) complexes of a figure&#8208;eight tetrathiadodecaphyrin, featuring different coordination modes (NNCS&#9472;Pd versus NNCC&#9472;Pd) and electronic states (closed&#8208;shell versus open&#8208;shell biradical), have been prepared. The two complexes exhibit noteworthy photoacoustic (PA) response to the first and second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;I/II) range, respectively, and are interconvertible through a one&#8208;electron redox involving a reversible metal coordination rearrangement.








Abstract
A figure&#8208;eight tetrathiadodecaphyrin (1), featuring two porphyrin&#8208;like sub&#8208;pockets separated by central carbazolylenes was synthesized. Metalation of the thiaporphyrinoid ligand with Pd(OAc)2 produces two distinct bis&#8208;Pd(II) complexes with different coordination environments. Complex 2, adopting an {NNCS} metalation mode, exhibits a closed&#8208;shell electronic structure, whereas complex 3, with an {NNCC} coordination environment, exists as a ligand&#8208;centered organic biradicaloid with two magnetically independent spins (S&#160;=&#160;1/2). Biradical formation is attributed to single&#8208;electron transfer from each ligand sub&#8208;pocket to the Pd(II) center accommodated in a d8 square&#8208;planner coordination geometry. Notably, the complexes are interconvertible through doubly one&#8208;electron redox processes, demonstrating a reversible metal coordination rearrangement via thiophene ring flipping within a porphyrinoid framework. This work establishes the first example of such tunable metal coordination, offering a precise strategy for modulating closed&#8208;shell and open&#8208;shell biradical states. In addition, while complex 2 displays intense absorption and photoacoustic responses to the first near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;I) light in water after encapsulation within nanoparticles, the nanocomposites encapsulating biradicaloid 3 exhibits enhanced responsiveness in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region.

         <title>Structural Basis of Sequential Enantioselective Epoxidation by a Flavin&#8208;Dependent Monooxygenase in Lasalocid A Biosynthesis</title>

Lsd18 is a flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase from Streptomyces lasalocidi that performs two enantioselective epoxidations during lasalocid A biosynthesis. X&#8208;ray crystal structures of Lsd18 bound to a substrate and product analogue illuminate how this enzyme performs multiple epoxidations on the same substrate molecule and how it controls stereoselectivity.








Abstract
Polyether polyketides are a structurally diverse group of natural products known for their antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities. Lasalocid A is a canonical natural polyether produced by the soil bacterium Streptomyces lasalocidi. In lasalocid A biosynthesis, a polyene polyketide intermediate is converted into a bisepoxide by the flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase enzyme Lsd18. Remarkably, Lsd18 acts on two distinct C&#9552;C groups in the substrate molecule, forming two (R,R) epoxides. We have determined the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of Lsd18 in the substrate&#8208;free, substrate&#8208;bound, and product&#8208;bound forms. Our work has revealed that Lsd18 has an extra&#8208;large substrate&#8208;binding pocket that allows the polyene to adopt different conformations within the enzyme pocket. This feature enables Lsd18 to epoxidate both of the C&#9552;C groups. Additionally, a subpocket located near the Lsd18 active site controls stereoselectivity by dictating which face of the C&#9552;C group is placed next to the flavin. Molecular understanding of how Lsd18 transforms a polyene into a bisepoxide during lasalocid A biosynthesis lays the foundation for the production of designer polyethers for drug development.

We disclose a site&#8208;selective Cu&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation of azetidines promoted by difluorocarbene insertion at low temperature, enabling access to a variety of functionalized &#947;&#8208;lactams and a therapeutic agent for diabetes (40 examples). This skeletal expansion strategy provides a distinct disconnection approach to synthesize medicinally relevant five&#8208;membered heterocycles.








Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Lactams are privileged five&#8208;membered pharmaco&#8208;phores in numerous bioactive compounds, but access to these motifs typically relies on cycloaddition/substitution chemistry involving activated substrates or CO carbonylations under harsh conditions. Here, we report a new route to functionalized &#947;&#8208;lactams through formal carbonylation of azetidines under nonprecious metal catalysis. The method leverages a copper&#8208;stabilized difluorocarbene to promote site&#8208;selective insertion followed by in situ hydrolysis to unmask the lactam group. In contrast to most difluorocarbene reactions that cause ring cleavage of saturated heterocycles in the presence of heat, the present system operates at a low temperature and retains the integrity of the cyclic structure. Synthesis of various drug&#8208;like lactams and a therapeutic agent for diabetes highlights utility.

         <title>Ionized Water Facilitates the Sustainable Radical&#8208;Mediated Reduction of CO2 to Multi&#8208;Carbon Hydrocarbons and Oxygenates</title>

Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of water generates radicals (H2O&#8226;+, &#8226;OH, e&#8315;aq, &#8226;H) that reduce CO2 to C1&#9472;C6 hydrocarbons and oxygenates. e&#8315;aq activates CO2 into CO2&#8226;&#8315;, while &#8226;H enables hydrogenation. Oxidative radicals recycle oxygenates back into CO2&#8226;&#8315;, sustaining a sustainable network. This process demonstrates ionized water as a reactive matrix for abiotic organic synthesis. 








Abstract
The abiotic synthesis of organic compounds from CO2 and water under prebiotic conditions is a fundamental yet unresolved challenge in understanding the origins of life. Here we demonstrate a radical&#8208;mediated pathway for reducing CO2 to C1&#8210;C6 hydrocarbons and oxygenates driven solely by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of water, mimicking early Earth environments. Using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), 17O/13C isotope labeling, and femtosecond transient absorption, we identify ionized water&#8208;derived radicals (H2O&#8226;+, &#8226;OH, e&#8315;aq, &#8226;H) as the key redox mediators. e&#8315;aq acts as a super&#8208;reductant (&#8722;2.9&#160;V) to activate CO2 into CO2&#8226;&#8315;, while &#8226;H enables sequential hydrogenation. Critically, oxidative radicals (H2O&#8226;+ and &#8226;OH) recycle recalcitrant oxygenates (formate and oxalate) back into active CO2&#8226;&#8315;, sustaining a dynamic radical network. This process generates a diverse library of organic compounds, including methane, ethylene, and C6 dimethyl succinate, via radical assembly mechanisms spanning hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT), self&#8208;coupling, and cross&#8208;coupling. By integrating experimental validation with prebiotic simulations (formate&#8208;mediated redox modulation), we resolve the paradox of inert CO2/H2 activation in primordial environments and establish water not merely as a solvent but as a reactive matrix directing abiotic organic synthesis.

         <title>An Immediate Bacterial&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Thio&#8208;Naphthalene Diimide: A Real&#8208;Time NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Anti&#8208;Bacterial</title>

A supramolecular thio&#8208;naphthalene diimide can be immediately reduced to a supramolecular radical anion by bacteria, leading to a NIR&#8208;II absorption. This strategy effectively raises the reduction potential, thereby greatly boosting the reduction speed. This approach has been used as a real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II photothermal anti&#8208;bacterial and opens new horizons for bio&#8208;responsive agents.








Abstract
A new kind of supramolecular thio&#8208;naphthalene diimide (SNDI) which can be immediately reduced as supramolecular radical anion by bacteria is reported. The introduction of thiocarbonyl effectively elevates the reduction potential of SNDI, largely increasing the bacteria&#8208;response speed in hypoxia. It selectively distinguishes the bacteria with high and low reduction ability in real time. The host&#8211;guest complexation of SNDI and cucurbit[7]uril can enhance radical anion quantum yield, ensuring intense NIR&#8208;II absorption and realizing high photothermal conversion. The real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II photothermal anti&#8208;bacteria is successfully carried out. This development will enrich the design of bio&#8208;responsive agent with promising future towards actual application.

         <title>Theory&#8208;Guided Design of Surface&#8208;Enhanced Ni&#8211;Mn Diatomic Site Catalysts for Efficient Seawater Electrolysis via the Degradation of High Ionization Potential Organic Pollutants</title>

This study innovatively constructs a dual transition metal atoms catalytic system through the strategic anchoring of Ni and Mn atoms on oxygen&#8208;doped boron nitride (O&#8208;BN), achieving breakthrough performance in simultaneous high ionization potential pollutant degradation and hydrogen evolution for marine energy applications under light condition.








Abstract
In response to energy shortages and hard&#8208;to&#8208;degrade chemical pollution, especially high ionization potential (IP) organic pollutants, this study developed a novel photoelectrocatalyst, Ni&#8208;Mn@OBN, for degrading IP pollutants in seawater and generating hydrogen. Incorporating Ni&#8211;Mn dual atoms into an O&#8208;doped boron nitride (OBN) framework, Ni&#8208;Mn@OBN, shows excellent stability and HER performance. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis revealed its low Gibbs free energy change (&#916;GH* = 0.03&#160;eV) for HER, outperforming Pt (111). Achieving an ultralow overpotential of 43.8&#160;mV at 500&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 under AM 1.5G, simulated light surpasses commercial Pt/C catalysts. High IP pollutants enhance hydrogen evolution rates, indicating a synergistic effect. Theoretical calculations elucidated the interplay between seawater electrolytes and high IP values on the photoelectrocatalytic performance. Ni&#8208;Mn@OBN demonstrated excellent stability and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 3.72%, offering a sustainable solution for marine pollution control and clean energy production.

         <title>Octalenobisterphenylene and Its Diradical Dianionic Cyclodimer: Synthesis, Structural Analysis, and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terphenylene dimer B, a fragment of the metallic (4,6,8)biphenylene network, with pronounced reactivity and strain was prepared from biaryl A by successive closures of four four&#8208;membered and two eight&#8208;membered rings. The treatment of B with sodium metal induced cyclodimerization, yielding a diradical dianion [(Na+)2(B&#8226;&#8211;)2] through a presumed radical&#8208;anion&#8208;mediated mechanism. The two spins in [(Na+)2(B&#8226;&#8211;)2] exhibit negligible mutual interaction.








Abstract
Octalenobisterphenylene 1 (also known as terphenylene dimer) was synthesized from 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;substituted biaryl by tert&#8208;butyllithium&#8208;mediated cyclization followed by oxidative coupling. This one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol facilitated the successive formation of four four&#8208;membered and two eight&#8208;membered rings. Treatment of 1 with sodium metal, followed by crystallization from THF, yielded the remarkable diradical dianion [(1&#8226;&#8211;)2]2&#8722;, where the two molecular halves are connected by four &#963; bonds. The cyclodimerization is driven by the pronounced reactivity and strain of the central six&#8208;membered ring within the [3]phenylene subunit. The structure and diradical nature of [(Na+)2(1&#8226;&#8211;)2] were confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallography, DFT computations, and 1H NMR and ESR spectra. These investigations revealed that the two spins, one on each molecular half, exhibit minimal mutual interaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Octalenobisterphenylene &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; (also known as terphenylene dimer) was synthesized from 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;-tetraaryl-substituted biaryl by &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyllithium-mediated cyclization followed by oxidative coupling. This one-pot two-step protocol facilitated the successive formation of four four-membered and two eight-membered rings. Treatment of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with sodium metal, followed by crystallization from THF, yielded the remarkable diradical dianion [(&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, where the two molecular halves are connected by four &#963; bonds. The cyclodimerization is driven by the pronounced reactivity and strain of the central six-membered ring within the [3]phenylene subunit. The structure and diradical nature of [(Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] were confirmed through X-ray crystallography, DFT computations, and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR and ESR spectra. These investigations revealed that the two spins, one on each molecular half, exhibit minimal mutual interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Data&#8211;Knowledge&#8208;Dual&#8208;Driven Electrolyte Design for Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium Ion Batteries</title>

A data&#8211;knowledge&#8208;dual&#8208;driven framework is proposed for mining high&#8208;temperature fast&#8208;charging electrolytes, integrating high&#8208;throughput calculation, machine learning, and experimental verification. The screened ethyl trimethylacetate&#8208;based electrolyte strengthens Li&#8208;ion batteries performance at 4.0 C and 45 &#176;C by thermostable solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase. 








Abstract
Electric vehicles (EVs) starve for minutes&#8208;level fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), while the heat gathering at high&#8208;rate charging and torridity conditions has detrimental effects on electrolytes, triggering rapid battery degradation and even safety hazards. However, the current research on high&#8208;temperature fast&#8208;charging (HTFC) electrolytes is very lacking. We revolutionized the conventional paradigm of developing HTFC electrolytes integrating with high&#8208;throughput calculation, machine&#8208;learning techniques, and experimental verifications to establish a data&#8211;knowledge&#8208;dual&#8208;driven approach. Ethyl trimethylacetate was efficiently screened out based on the approach and enabled batteries to work under high temperatures with distinctly restricted side reactions. A stable and highly safe fast&#8208;charging (15&#8208;min charging to 80% capacity) cycling without Li plating was achieved over 4100 cycles at 45 &#176;C based on 181&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 pouch cells, demonstrating the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in this field.

         <title>An Enzymatic Platform for Aniline Synthesis Through Oxidative Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocatalytic platform for aniline synthesis, based on the oxidative amination of readily available cyclohexanones, has been reported. Engineered variants exhibit broad substrate compatibility, enabling the synthesis of 40 structurally diverse secondary and tertiary anilines with conversions of up to 91%. Mechanistic studies revealed that directed evolution enhanced enzyme performance in imine desaturation while suppressing phenol formation.








Abstract
Aniline motifs are commonly found in natural products and synthetic molecules. While chemists have developed numerous methods for constructing C(sp2)&#9472;N bonds, their biocatalytic counterparts in nature are primarily limited to P450&#8208;based protein machineries. To address this limitation, we developed a biocatalytic platform for aniline synthesis based on oxidative amination of cyclohexanones. Through directed evolution of a flavin&#8208;dependent enzyme PtOYE, we identified several protein catalysts (e.g., OYE_G3 and OYE_M3) that exhibited activity across a broad array of substrates, enabling the preparation of 40 different secondary and tertiary anilines with various substitution patterns in up to 91% GC conversion. Mechanistic investigations revealed the improved kinetic performance of the evolved variants on the desaturation of imines. Additionally, mutations introduced through protein engineering further reduced the propensity for phenol formation. This enzymatic platform represents a highly promising application of flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes, showcasing their great potential in organic synthesis and drug development.

         <title>Cathodic Hydroxide Ions Induce Tetrose Formation during Glycolaldehyde Electroreduction to Alcohols: A Potential CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Carbohydrate Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The glycolaldehyde electrolysis mechanism to alcohols and tetroses is comprehensively studied. Novel insights on the role of glycolaldehyde in the late stages of the overall CO2 reduction reaction pathways to ethanol and ethylene glycol on copper are presented. We demonstrate for the first time that C4 sugars (47.2% maximum conversion) can be produced in the electrochemical cell under ambient conditions due to the hydroxide ions produced on the cathode.








Abstract
The electrochemical synthesis of organic compounds from CO2 can potentially alleviate climate change by hampering the atmospheric accumulation of greenhouse gases. The production of carbohydrates from CO2 reduction will have promising applications for the manufacturing of valuable, multi&#8208;carbon compounds that are traditionally produced from the petrochemical or agricultural industries. In this work, we analyzed the copper&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical reduction of glycolaldehyde, a commonly observed trace CO2RR product that has been previously proposed as an intermediate for alcohol formation. We determine that glycolaldehyde is not the main intermediate on polycrystalline copper&#8208;based electrocatalysts that selectively produce ethanol. In an unbuffered electrolyte, the cathodic hydroxide ions produced induce the coupling of glycolaldehyde to tetroses in the solution phase, yielding a maximum glycolaldehyde&#8208;to&#8208;sugar conversion of 47.2% under ambient conditions. Using in situ infrared spectroscopy coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that glycolaldehyde reduction to alcohols proceeds via adsorption of its enol tautomer, &#951;2(C,C)&#9472;CHOH&#9552;CHOH. Our findings not only shed light on the C2 alcohol formation pathways during CO2RR, but also imply that a CO2 electrolyzer can potentially produce C4 carbohydrates via CO2 reduction to glycolaldehyde followed by C&#9472;C coupling in the solution phase, with only a high local pH needed to drive the tetrose formation step.

         <title>DNA Nanotubule&#8208;Based Nanodevices with ATP&#8208;Responsive Gating for Direct Cytosolic Delivery of Nucleic Acids and Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>

Schematic illustration of two pathways for macromolecular therapeutics delivery: nanoparticle&#8208;adopted endocytosis (left) and DNA nanotubule&#8208;mediated cytosolic delivery (right). By bypassing conventional endocytic routes, the nanotubules directly transport substantial payloads, including nucleic acids and proteins, across the plasma membrane. 








Abstract
Delivering biomacromolecules to the cytosol remains a formidable challenge, as these molecules are predominantly sequestered within endosomes after endocytosis. The limited efficacy of current delivery systems in promoting reliable endosomal escape underscores the need for innovative strategies. Here, we report a DNA origami nanotubule to construct transmembrane delivery nanodevices with size&#8208;selective gating and ATP&#8208;responsive channel activation. By integrating unilamellar vesicles as large storage compartments, these nanodevices can encapsulate a wide range of macromolecules, including small interfering RNA, messenger RNA, plasmid DNA, and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes. By bypassing traditional endocytic pathways, the nanotubules enable the delivery of substantial payload quantities directly across the plasma membrane. This approach provides a promising platform for delivering macromolecular therapeutics into the cytosol, advancing gene therapy strategies, and broadening their biomedical applications.

         <title>Photovoltaic Absorber &#8220;Glues&#8221; for Efficient Bifacial Selenium Photovoltaics</title>

A glue&#8208;bonding strategy using high&#8208;viscosity molten selenium (Se) as an adhesive is reported to bond two fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses, creating bifacial solar cells without magnetron sputtering. The Se cells exhibit a bifaciality factor of 90.1%, with efficiencies of 8.61% under 1&#8208;sun with an albedo of 0.3 and 26.17% under 1000&#8208;lux indoor illumination with an albedo of 0.8.








Abstract
Bifacial solar cells hold great potential for achieving higher power output than conventional monofacial devices by harvesting solar irradiance from both their front and rear surfaces. However, almost all currently reported bifacial devices typically require a sputtered rear transparent conducting oxide electrode, which can damage the underlying layers due to plasma effects during the deposition process. Here, we report a glue&#8208;bonding strategy that uses a high&#8208;viscosity photovoltaic absorber slurry&#8212;in the case of molten selenium (Se)&#8212;as the adhesive to bond two charge&#8208;transport layer&#8208;deposited commercial fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide glasses, directly creating bifacial solar cells without the use of magnetron sputtering. We find that molten Se exhibits relatively high viscosity, high stability, and Newtonian fluid characteristics, facilitating film formation using this strategy. The resulting bifacial Se solar cells exhibit a bifaciality factor of 90.1%, surpassing all types of conventional thin&#8208;film solar cells. These cells achieve efficiencies of 8.61% under 1&#8208;sun illumination with an albedo of 0.3 and 26.17% under 1000&#8208;lux indoor illumination with an albedo of 0.8, with no efficiency loss after 1000&#160;h of ambient storage.

Synopsis: Heating the trinuclear Ti dinitrogen complex [{TiCp*(&#181;&#8208;Cl)}3(&#181;3&#8208;&#951;1:&#8201;&#951;2:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;N2)] 1(Cp*&#160;= &#951;5&#8208;C5Me5) leads to the cleavage of N&#8801;N bond, forming a tetranuclear titanium nitride cluster [{TiCp*}4Cl(&#181;&#8208;Cl)3(&#181;3&#8208;N)2] 2. Complex 2 reacts with pinacolborane, leading to the formation of N&#8208;B bond derivatives [{TiCp*(&#181;&#8208;NBpin)Cl}2]. When treated with pyridine or DMAP, complex 2 was dissociated to form a bent trinuclear Ti nitrido complex. 








Abstract
Heating the readily available trinuclear Ti dinitrogen complex [{TiCp*(&#181;&#8208;Cl)}3(&#181;3&#8208;&#951;1:&#8201;&#951;2:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;N2)] 1(Cp*&#160;= &#951;5&#8208;C5Me5), originally reported by C. Y&#233;lamos and J. Jover, in benzene at 80&#160;&#176;C leads to the cleavage of N&#8801;N bond, forming a tetranuclear titanium nitride cluster [{TiCp*}4Cl(&#181;&#8208;Cl)3(&#181;3&#8208;N)2] 2. The structure of 2 was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Kinetics study and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the energy barrier for the NN bond cleavage in the transformation from 1 to 2 is about 26&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1. Complex 2 exhibits reactivity toward various electrophiles, producing a range of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds in the presence of air, while concurrently regenerating Ti(IV) salts. Furthermore, complex 2 reacts with pinacolborane, leading to the formation of N&#8208;B bond derivatives [{TiCp*(&#181;&#8208;NBPin)Cl}2] 3. When complex 2&#8211;15N is treated with pyridine or 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), it dissociates to form a bent trinuclear Ti nitrido complex [{TiCp*}3Cl3(L)2(&#181;&#8208;15N)2] 4&#8208;L (L&#160;=&#160;py or DMAP).

         <title>Electrostatic Potential Matching in an Anion&#8208;Pillared Framework for Benchmark Hexafluoroethane Purification from Ternary Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>

The electrostatic potential matching in the anion&#8208;pillared SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu realizes effective anchoring of CF3CH2F and CF3CHF2 through multiple supramolecular interactions, exhibiting the highest CF3CH2F and CF3CHF2 adsorption capacity as well as unprecedented CF3CH2F/CF3CF3 and CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 selectivity, thereby achieving benchmark separation of ternary CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 mixture. 








Abstract
One&#8208;step purification of CF3CF3 from ternary CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 mixture is crucial since its vital role in the semiconductor industry. However, efficient separation of chemically inert CF&#8323;CF&#8323; remains challenging due to the difficulty in creating specific recognition sites in porous materials. In this work, we report the first example of anion&#8208;pillared MOFs to the separation of fluorinated electronic specialty gases, utilizing the unique electrostatic potential matching in the bipolar pores of SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu to realize a benchmark CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 separation. SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu exhibits the highest CF3CH2F and CF3CHF2 adsorption capacity at 0.01&#160;bar, as well as the highest CF3CH2F/CF3CF3 and CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 IAST selectivity. Additionally, high&#8208;purity (&#8805; 99.995%) CF3CF3 with record productivity (882.9&#160;L kg&#8722;1) can be acquired through one&#8208;step breakthrough experiment of CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 (5/5/90). Theoretical calculations further reveal that the coexistence of electronegative SiF62&#8722; and partially electropositive H sites promotes SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu to effectively anchor CF3CH2F and CF3CHF2 through multiple supramolecular interactions.

         <title>Dimensionality Reduction of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Monolayers for Enhanced Electrocatalysis</title>

Dimensionality reduction of 3D MOFs into 1.8&#8208;nm&#8208;thick monoMOF maximizes catalytic site exposure and enhances CO2 electroreduction. The cobalt(II)&#8211;porphyrin&#8208;embedded monoMOF&#8208;Co achieves 93% CO Faradaic efficiency (versus 51% for 3D_MOF&#8208;Co) at &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus RHE, with a 10,600&#160;h&#8722;1 turnover frequency and 47&#8208;hour stability in near&#8208;neutral electrolyte, demonstrating superior electron/mass transfer through dimensional engineering.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are potential candidates for electrocatalysis due to their well&#8208;defined, tunable structures, and ability to incorporate diverse active sites. However, their inherent insulating nature restricts electron transfer from electrode to remote active sites, leading to diminished catalytic performance. In this work, we present a novel strategy to overcome this limitation by reducing 3D MOFs (3D_MOFs) into monolayered MOFs (monoMOFs) with a thickness of &#8764;1.8&#160;nm, maximizing the exposure of catalytic sites to the electrode and enhancing electrocatalytic performance. We designed and synthesized a monoMOF incorporating cobalt(II)&#8211;porphyrin sites in the linker (monoMOF&#8208;Co) for CO2 electroreduction. After being grafted onto graphene oxide, the monoMOF&#8208;Co exhibited a peak faradaic efficiency for CO production (FECO&#160;=&#160;93%), surpassing the performance of a 3D_MOF incorporating the same porphyrin&#8211;Co&#8208;based linker (3D_MOF&#8208;Co, FECO&#160;=&#160;51%). Additionally, monoMOF&#8208;Co achieved a turnover frequency of 10&#160;600 h&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and maintained stability over 47 h in a near&#8208;neutral aqueous solution. In situ spectroscopic studies further confirmed the distinct electric field environment in the Stern layer between monoMOF&#8208;Co and 3D_MOF&#8208;Co. Furthermore, similar enhancement effects of monoMOFs over 3D_MOFs were observed in the nitrate and oxygen electroreduction reactions, highlighting the broader applicability of monoMOFs in electrocatalysis.

         <title>Engineering Bodipy&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Full&#8208;Spectrum Photocatalysis in Amide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three highly&#160;stable bodipy&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (BMOFs) were synthesized by treating dicarboxyl&#8208;functionalized bodipy ligands with Zr&#8208;oxo clusters. Featuring the distinct bodipy scaffold in the framework, these BMOFs displayed high reactivity in heterogenous photocatalytic C&#9472;H bond&#160;activation of N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines to access amides under visible light.








Abstract
Developing photocatalysts that can efficiently utilize the full solar spectrum is a crucial step toward transforming sustainable energy solutions. Due to their light absorption limitations, most photo&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are constrained to the ultraviolet (UV) and blue light regions. Expanding their absorption to encompass the entire solar spectrum would unlock their full potential, greatly enhancing efficiency and applicability. Here, we report the design and synthesis of a series of highly stable boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (bodipy)&#8208;based MOFs (BMOFs) by reacting dicarboxyl&#8208;functionalized bodipy ligands with Zr&#8208;oxo clusters. Leveraging the acidity of the methyl groups on the bodipy backbone, we expanded the conjugation system through a solid&#8208;state condensation reaction with various aldehydes, achieving full&#8208;color absorption, thereby extending the band edge into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) and infrared (IR) regions. These BMOFs demonstrated exceptional reactivity and recyclability in heterogeneous photocatalytic activities, including C&#9472;H bond activation of saturated aza&#8208;heterocycles and C&#9472;N bond cleavage of N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines to produce amides under visible light. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of BMOFs in photocatalysis, marking a significant leap forward in the design of advanced photocatalytic materials with tunable properties.

         <title>Building a Confluence Charge Transfer Pathway in COFs for Highly Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide from Water and Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>

This work not only provides new insights into the design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) by modulating charge transfer pathways to boost H2O2 photosynthesis but also paves the way for practical application of COF photocatalysts to generate H2O2 for water decontamination.








Abstract
Sunlight&#8208;driven photosynthesis by covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from water and air without using sacrificial reagents is a promising H2O2 fabrication approach but is still restricted by the insufficient charge separation and sluggish 2e&#8722; water oxidation process. Herein, we provide a facile strategy to simultaneously improve charge separation and water oxidation in COFs via confining the charge transfer pathways from two diversion ones to a confluence one through regulating the site of nitrogen in bipyridine. Combining in&#8208;situ characterization with computational calculations, we reveal that compared to COF&#8208;BD1 containing two diversion charge transfer pathways, the charge transfer pathway in COF&#8208;BD2 is confined to a confluence due to the electron&#8208;deficiency effect of nitrogen, which greatly accelerates the intermolecular and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transfer. Via effectively reducing the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining water oxidation reaction (WOR), the subsequent water oxidation process to produce the key *OH intermediate in COF&#8208;BD2 is also greatly facilitated, boosting the yield of H2O2 (5211&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) from water, oxygen, and light without sacrificial agents or additional energy consumption. We further demonstrate that H2O2 can be efficiently produced by COF&#8208;BD2 in a broad pH range, in real water, and in an enlarged reactor using natural sunlight for water decontamination.

         <title>Boron Doping&#8208;Induced Ultrahigh Ce3+ Ratio in Amorphous CeO2/GO Catalyst for Low&#8208;Concentration CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel strategy to synthesize amorphous CeO2/GO with an exceptionally high Ce3+ ratio of 85.7% through B&#8208;doping. The resulting amorphous structure reduces the band gap, enhances charge separation efficiency, and significantly boosts diluted CO2 photocatalytic activity. The material achieves remarkable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion rates of 249.33&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1(under 15% CO2) and 103.4&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1(under 1% CO2) with 100% selectivity, highlighting its potential for sustainable CO2 conversion. 








Abstract
Direct utilization of diluted CO2 enables sustainable CO2 conversion into valuable products, with reduced CeO2 emerging as an attractive candidate due to its exceptional redox flexibility. The catalytic efficacy of CeO2 is intimately tied to the electronic structure of 4f, yet the persistent challenge lies in maintaining a high and stable concentration of Ce3+. In this study, we propose a symmetry&#8208;breaking&#8208;induced amorphization strategy to achieve an exceptionally high Ce3+ ratio by B doping, which facilitates the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ in amorphous CeO2. First&#8208;principles calculations and infrared spectroscopy reveal that B doping with three excess electrons induces the formation of planar triangular B&#8211;O&#8323; units by disrupting the original high&#8208;symmetry Fm3&#175;m$Fm\bar 3m$ structure of CeO2, facilitating the spontaneous transition to the amorphous phase. Electronic structure analysis confirms that even a modest 7.5% B doping can significantly elevate the Ce3+ ratio to 85.7%. The resulting amorphous B&#8208;doped CeO2/GO shows a remarkable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion rate of 249.33&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1(under 15% CO2) and 103.4&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1(under 1% CO2), with 100% selectivity in both cases. This performance highlights how amorphization stabilizes defect states, making amorphous CeO2/GO with high Ce3+ an effective material for CO2 photoreduction and addressing key challenges in CO2 capture and utilization.

&lt;p&gt;Direct utilization of diluted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enables sustainable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion into valuable products, with reduced CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emerging as an attractive candidate due to its exceptional redox flexibility. The catalytic efficacy of CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is intimately tied to the electronic structure of 4&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;, yet the persistent challenge lies in maintaining a high and stable concentration of Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. In this study, we propose a symmetry-breaking-induced amorphization strategy to achieve an exceptionally high Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ratio by B doping, which facilitates the reduction of Ce&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; to Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in amorphous CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. First-principles calculations and infrared spectroscopy reveal that B doping with three excess electrons induces the formation of planar triangular B&#8211;O&#8323; units by disrupting the original high-symmetry Fm3&#175;m$Fm\bar 3m$ structure of CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, facilitating the spontaneous transition to the amorphous phase. Electronic structure analysis confirms that even a modest 7.5% B doping can significantly elevate the Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ratio to 85.7%. The resulting amorphous B-doped CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/GO shows a remarkable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO conversion rate of 249.33&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;(under 15% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and 103.4&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;(under 1% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), with 100% selectivity in both cases. This performance highlights how amorphization stabilizes defect states, making amorphous CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/GO with high Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; an effective material for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction and addressing key challenges in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture and utilization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling the Catalytic Potential of Facet Heterojunctions in Platinum Alloys for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition of octahedral PtNi nanoparticles (NPs) to a truncated structure enriches the diversity of catalytic sites. The edge sites, featuring facet heterojunctions, leverage geometric and ligand synergies to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and optimize the adsorption of oxygenated intermediates, leading to superior performance in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).








Abstract
Ensuring high&#8208;quality activity of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) while mitigating the degradation of Pt&#8208;based alloy catalysts remains challenging. A platinum&#8208;skinned truncated octahedral PtNi alloy with (100)/(111) facet heterostructures is synthesized through a low&#8208;temperature thermally driven etching strategy, demonstrating exceptional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability. The heterostructure of the Ptskin&#8208;PtNi(111) facet destabilizes the *OOH intermediate and promotes the preferential O&#9472;O bond cleavage, leading to the optimization of ORR pathway. A linear correlation between the generalized coordination number (CN&#175;$\overline {{\mathrm{CN}}} $) and &#916;G*OH demonstrates that the facet hetero&#8208;sites optimize the adsorption of *OH to the theoretically optimal state through ligand and geometric effects. The optimized PNZC&#8208;5A160 catalyst exhibits enhanced ORR activity (2.97 A mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#160;V vs. RHE) and superior H2&#8208;O2 single PEMFC performance [mass activity (MA) of 0.5 A mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9 ViR&#8208;free; peak power density of 1.42&#160;W cm&#8722;2, exceeding the U.S. Department of Energy 2025 targets. After accelerated stress tests, the loss in MA at 0.9 ViR&#8208;free and in potential at 0.8 A cm&#8722;2 is only 8% and 3.7&#160;mV, respectively, due to the enhanced binding of subsurface Pt and Ni to surface Pt atoms through Pt skin, thereby inhibiting the dissolution of Pt and Ni.

         <title>Antibacterial Siderophores of Pandoraea Pathogens and Their Impact on the Diseased Lung Microbiota</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genome mining of environmental and pathogenic Pandoraea species identified a conserved NRPS gene cluster and led to the discovery of novel siderophores, pandorabactins, which exert their antibacterial activity by depleting iron from competitors. Bioinformatic analysis of sputum from cystic fibrosis patients coupled with bioassays indicates that pandorabactins outcompete other bacteria in sequestering iron and have an impact on the diseased lung microbiota.








Abstract
Antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria of the genus Pandoraea, frequently acquired from the environment, are an emerging cause of opportunistic respiratory infections, especially in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. However, their specialized metabolites, including niche and virulence factors, remained unknown. Through genome mining of environmental and clinical isolates of diverse Pandoraea species, we identified a highly conserved biosynthesis gene cluster (pan) that codes for a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembling a new siderophore. Using bioinformatics&#8208;guided metabolic profiling of wild type and a targeted null mutant, we discovered the corresponding metabolites, pandorabactin A and B. Their structures and chelate (gallium) complexes were elucidated by a combination of chemical degradation, derivatization, NMR, and MS analysis. Metagenomics and bioinformatics of sputum samples of CF patients indicated that the presence of the pan gene locus correlates with the prevalence of specific bacteria in the lung microbiome. Bioassays and mass spectrometry imaging showed that pandorabactins have antibacterial activities against various lung pathogens (Pseudomonas, Mycobacterium, and Stenotrophomonas) through depleting iron in the competitors. Taken together, these findings offer first insight into niche factors of Pandoraea and indicate that pandorabactins shape the diseased lung microbiota through the competition for iron.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of Ultra&#8208;Incompressible Beryllium Tungsten Nitride Pernitride BeW10N14(N2)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first ternary transition metal pernitride was synthesized in a high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;pressure approach starting from W2Be4N5. The structure features not only the rare structural motif of BeN6 octahedra but also dinitrogen anions. DFT calculations reveal ultra&#8208;incompressible and metallic behavior of the new compound.








Abstract
For the activation of nitrogen and its reduction to ammonia, transition metals are crucial in biological as well as industrial processes. So far, only a few binary transition metal compounds with nitrogen dimer anions are known, whereas a ternary compound has remained undiscovered as yet. Here, we report on the synthesis and properties of the first ternary transition metal compound, namely, BeW10N14(N2), which exhibits dinitrogen anions. It was synthesized in a high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;pressure approach from W2Be4N5. The crystal structure, elucidated with synchrotron radiation, unites WN7 capped trigonal prisms with intriguing BeN6 octahedra and (N2)&#8208;anions. Elastic and electronic properties of the title compound were corroborated by DFT calculations, revealing simultaneous ultra&#8208;incompressible and metallic behavior. The synthesis and investigation of the first ternary transition metal nitride with dinitrogen units opens the door to a new field of research on nitride and pernitride chemistry.

         <title>Crystalline Silagermenides as Powerful Synthons: Unraveling &#960;&#8208;Bonding and Lone Pair Effects in the Multiple Bonds of Heavier Main Group Analogs of the Vinyl Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acyclic silagermenides are synthesized through a straightforward desilylation process. Their electronic properties are explored using DFT calculations, revealing a high&#8208;lying and polarized Si&#9472;Ge &#960; bond. Reactions with electrophiles lead to nucleophilic substitution at the Si atom, giving germylene intermediates, which then undergo further transformation into unique main group compounds and unprecedented metal complexes.








Abstract
Compared to common vinyl anions, their heavier heteronuclear analog, silagermenides [R2Si&#9552;GeR]&#713;, remain exceedingly rare. Herein, we present a systematic investigation of silagermenides, synthesized via a straightforward desilylation route. We delve into the bonding characteristics, revealing a weak, polarized Si&#9472;Ge &#960; bond with a significant nonbonded lone pair character at the &#946;&#8208;Si position. This &#946;&#8208;Si exhibits predominantly nucleophilic behavior, while the &#945;&#8208;Ge position demonstrates subtly electrophilic tendencies, despite the presence of a vinylic, formally anionic Ge atom. This leads to the formation of silagermenide complexes in an unprecedented &#951;2 coordination mode, as well as various silagermenes and germylenes with unconventional substituents. We also document the facile cleavage of the ambiphilic Si&#9552;Ge double bond, resulting in the transfer of a formal doubly reduced silylene and a formal germyliumylidene. Our findings expand the understanding of heavier main group analogs of the vinyl anion, with important implications for their synthesis and reactivity.

&lt;p&gt;Compared to common vinyl anions, their heavier heteronuclear analog, silagermenides [R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&#9552;GeR]&#713;, remain exceedingly rare. Herein, we present a systematic investigation of silagermenides, synthesized via a straightforward desilylation route. We delve into the bonding characteristics, revealing a weak, polarized Si&#9472;Ge &#960; bond with a significant nonbonded lone pair character at the &#946;-Si position. This &#946;-Si exhibits predominantly nucleophilic behavior, while the &#945;-Ge position demonstrates subtly electrophilic tendencies, despite the presence of a vinylic, formally anionic Ge atom. This leads to the formation of silagermenide complexes in an unprecedented &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; coordination mode, as well as various silagermenes and germylenes with unconventional substituents. We also document the facile cleavage of the ambiphilic Si&#9552;Ge double bond, resulting in the transfer of a formal doubly reduced silylene and a formal germyliumylidene. Our findings expand the understanding of heavier main group analogs of the vinyl anion, with important implications for their synthesis and reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Circumtetracene: Unraveling Structure&#8208;Property Relationships of Circumacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable circumtetracene derivative has been successfully synthesized and isolated in crystalline form. A comparison of its electronic properties (both experimentally and by theoretical calculations) with those of previously reported circumacene analogues, led to elucidation of a significant transition in the electronic structure from a closed&#8208;shell global aromatic to a singlet open&#8208;shell local aromatic configuration upon &#960;&#8208;extension.








Abstract
Circumacenes have garnered significant interest in both fundamental science and nanoelectronics due to their unique electronic structures. However, their synthesis and investigations into the structure&#8211;property relationships present considerable challenges. In this work, we report the successful synthesis and characterization of a stable circumtetracene derivative in crystalline form. For comparison, a new circumanthracene derivative was also prepared. The electronic properties of both compounds were systematically investigated using both various experimental techniques and theoretical calculations. It was found that circumtetracene exhibits a dominant local aromatic nature with small open&#8208;shell diradical character, while circumanthracene displays a closed&#8208;shell global aromatic character. Both compounds show amphoteric redox behavior with narrow energy gaps. The dication of circumtetracene and the dianions of circumtetracene and circumanthracene can be obtained experimentally through chemical oxidation and reduction, all displaying intense NIR absorptions. Furthermore, the electronic properties of these derivatives were compared with those of previously reported circumacene analogues, revealing a transition in electronic structure from closed&#8208;shell global aromatic to singlet open&#8208;shell local aromatic configurations upon &#960;&#8208;extension. This work provides a comprehensive exploration of the structure&#8208;property relationships within the circumacene series, offering valuable insights for the design and synthesis of novel multizigzag&#8208;edged nanographenes with tunable electronic properties.

         <title>A Bench&#8208;Stable Fluorophosphine Nickel(0) Complex and Its Catalytic Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein present the synthesis of a bench&#8208;stable Ni(0) complex, [Ni(PFPh2)4], stabilized by vastly underexplored fluorophosphine ligands. The application of [Ni(PFPh2)4] in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura and Kumada&#8208;Tamao&#8208;Corriu cross&#8208;coupling reactions as well as in Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig C&#9472;N bond formation reactions, indicates its promising potential as alternative to conventional Ni(0) sources.








Abstract
We herein present a fluorophosphine&#8208;based nickel(0) complex [Ni(PFPh2)4] (1), which is highly stable in air and water. [Ni(PFPh2)4] can be obtained from a one&#8208;pot reaction of [Ni(MeCN)4](BF4)2 with Ph2P(&#9552;O)&#8211;PPh2, involving a unique in situ reduction of Ni(II) to Ni(0) and a simultaneous fluorination by the BF4&#8722; anion. This complex does not only incorporate a nickel center in the zero&#8208;oxidation state, resulting from a Ni(II) precursor, but also includes fluorophosphine ligands, which typically disproportionate immediately in solution. The application of [Ni(PFPh2)4] as highly stable Ni(0) pre&#8208;catalyst in combination with additional phosphine ligands, such as dppf (1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene), in various coupling reactions uncovers its high catalytic activity and versatility, which is superior to [Ni(COD)2] (COD&#9552;cycloocta&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene) as conventional Ni(0) source.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Reversible Hydrogen Storage of Sodium Cyclohexanolate/Phenoxide Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar&#8208;driven reversible hydrogen storage of sodium cyclohexanolate/phenoxide pair demonstrated 99.9% conversion and selectivity in both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation via photocatalysis without external heating. The synergy between high&#8208; and low&#8208;frequency light enhances the overall performance, i.e., low&#8208;frequency light provides heat, while high&#8208;frequency light facilitates the desorption of product from the catalyst surface.








Abstract
Reversible hydrogen storage is a key challenge for the implementation of hydrogen energy, with dehydrogenation being particularly difficult because of its endothermic nature, slow kinetics, poor selectivity, etc. Solar energy&#8208;driven hydrogen uptake/release represents an interdisciplinary approach that provides an effective solution to those problems. Herein, we report the solar&#8208;driven reversible hydrogen uptake of 4.9&#160;wt.% over sodium cyclohexanolate/phenoxide pair, achieving over 99.9% conversion and selectivity in both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation via photocatalysis without external heating. Notably, the initial dehydrogenation rate reaches 23.4 mmolH2gcat&#8722;1h&#8722;1${\mathrm{mmo}}{{{\mathrm{l}}}_{{{{\mathrm{H}}}_2}}}{{{\mathrm{g}}}_{{\mathrm{cat}}}}^{ - 1}{{{\mathrm{h}}}^{ - 1}}$ that is ca. 2 orders of magnitude higher than thermocatalysis. The superior photocatalytic performance stems from the synergy between high&#8208; and low&#8208;frequency light, i.e., low&#8208;frequency light mainly provides heat, high&#8208;frequency light drives the desorption of product from the catalyst surface. This approach offers a path toward a sustainable solar&#8208;driven hydrogen energy system.

         <title>Modification of [2.2]Paracyclophanes via Cobalt/Salox&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Electrooxidative or Photoredox C&#9472;H Acyloxylation and Alkoxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient protocol with an excellent s&#8208;factor for the preparation of chiral [2.2]paracyclophanes through cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#9472;H oxygenation was developed. This approach leverages traceless electrons or oxygen to replace traditional stoichiometric metal oxidants, facilitating the reaction under mild conditions with broad scope.








Abstract
Chiral [2.2]paracyclophanes (PCPs) have widespread application in asymmetric catalysis and materials science. However, enantioselective C&#9472;H activation of PCPs remains elusive and challenging due to steric hindrance, which differs significantly from conventional aryl C&#9472;H bonds. Herein, we present a cobalt/Salox&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dehydrogenative C&#9472;H acyloxylation and alkoxylation of racemic PCPs with carboxylic acids and alcohols under electrooxidative or photoredox conditions. This innovative approach leverages traceless electrons or oxygen to replace traditional stoichiometric metal oxidants, allowing the reaction to proceed under mild conditions. The method enables the efficient synthesis of oxygenated optically enriched PCPs, achieving yields of up to 50% with 99% ee, as well as up to 49% yields and 99% ee for the recovered starting materials, resulting in exceptional s&#8208;factors of up to 1057. The reaction exhibits a broad scope, accommodating a diverse array of carboxylic acids, including complicated natural products and pharmaceutical molecules. This strategy not only provides an efficient route for synthesizing optically enriched PCP compounds but also highlights the potential of electrooxidative and photoredox methodologies in asymmetric C&#9472;H activation reactions.

         <title>Unprecedented &#8220;off&#8208;pathway&#8221; [2+2] Cycloaddition&#8208;Retroelectrocyclization Reaction Between an Unsymmetric Alkyne and Tetracyanoquinodimethane</title>

         <dc:description>
The widely used [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclization reaction between tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) and an activated alkyne has been shown to occur&#160;with &#8220;inverted&#8221; regiochemistry to give exclusive formation of an unexpected regioisomer. A combined experimental and theoretical study helped unravel the peculiar reaction mechanism underlying the regioselectivity switching.








Abstract
In recent years, the [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) reaction between electron&#8208;rich alkynes and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes has emerged as one of the most effective synthetic routes to prepare a large variety of molecular and polymeric electron donor&#8211;acceptor systems. Besides its simplicity, fast rate, and high yield, this reaction may also display complete and predictable regioselectivity, as in the case when tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) is used in combination with unsymmetric, activated alkynes. Here, we report the first example of a [2+2] CA&#8208;RE reaction between TCNQ and an aniline&#8208;activated alkyne following an &#8220;inverted&#8221; regiochemistry, thus leading to the exclusive formation of an unexpected regioisomer in contrast to the expected one. A combined experimental and theoretical study helped us to unravel the peculiar reaction mechanism underlying the regioselectivity switching.

         <title>Remote Spin&#8208;Center Shift Enables Activation of Distal Benzylic C&#9472;O and C&#9472;N Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A remote spin&#8208;center shift process that involves 1,n&#8208;radical translocation followed by elimination of a leaving group has been developed to enable distal benzylic C&#9472;O and C&#9472;N bond activation. By this process, a 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;boryl radical promoted radical deoxygenative and deaminative functionalization of free benzylic alcohols and simple benzylic amines to afford a wide range of alkylated products.








Abstract
A spin&#8208;center shift (SCS) is a radical process that commonly involves a 1,2&#8208;radical shift along with the elimination of an adjacent leaving group by a two&#8208;electron ionic movement. The conventional SCS process is largely limited to 1,2&#8208;radical translocation, while a remote SCS event involving 1,n&#8208;radical translocation over a greater distance to enable distal bond functionalization remains largely underexplored. Herein, we report the boryl radical&#8208;promoted distal deoxygenation and deamination of free benzylic alcohols and simple benzylic amines, respectively, through a remote SCS event. The reaction was initiated by the addition of a 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;boryl radical to the carbonyl oxygen atom of a benzoate or benzamide. Then, radical translocation took place across the aromatic ring to promote benzylic C&#9472;O or C&#9472;N bond cleavage. The resulting radical intermediate subsequently coupled with various alkenes to afford a wide range of alkylated products. The proposed mechanistic pathway was supported by experimental investigations.

         <title>Acyclic Quaternary Stereocenters via Catalytic Asymmetric Cross&#8208;Couplings with Unactivated Alkyl N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective synthesis of compounds featuring an acyclic quaternary stereocenter was achieved through an iron&#8208;catalyzed alkylation reaction using unactivated alkyl N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHP) esters. The efficiency of this sterically demanding construction is dictated by an outer&#8208;sphere C&#9472;C bond formation mechanism, with enantioselectivity regulated by a cooperative triple catalysis system that integrates photoredox, chiral Lewis acid, and iron catalysis.








Abstract
While significant advancements have been made in creating quaternary stereocenters (all&#8208;carbon substituents) within cyclic frameworks, generating acyclic quaternary stereocenters poses a more formidable task due to increased conformational flexibility. Herein, we report an enantioselective synthesis of compounds containing acyclic quaternary stereocenters through an iron&#8208;catalyzed alkylation reaction between an acyclic tertiary alkyl source and an unactivated primary alkyl source. This method not only facilitates the rapid construction of sterically hindered motifs but also effectively enhances the saturation level of the molecule. Key to this method is an outer&#8208;sphere C&#9472;C bond formation mechanism, where enantioselectivity is governed by a cooperative triple catalysis system that combines photoredox, chiral Lewis acid, and iron catalysis. A series of compounds featuring acyclic quaternary stereocenters is produced under mild reaction conditions, and various transformations are presented to illustrate the potential applications of this approach. A comprehensive mechanistic study supports the crucial SH2 (bimolecular homolytic substitution) mechanism.

         <title>Alcohol Activation by Benzodithiolylium for Deoxygenative Alkylation Driven by Photocatalytic Energy Transfer</title>

1,3&#8208;Benzodithiolylium cation was identified as an alcohol&#8208;activating reagent for energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;driven deoxygenative radical alkylation, avoiding electron transfer. Photocatalytic deoxygenative coupling reactions of alcohols with diverse oxime carbonates involving selective C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond construction are presented, including energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;driven carboimination of alkenes, energy transfer (EnT)/nickel dual&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening cross&#8208;coupling, and cyclization cross&#8208;coupling. 








Abstract
The 1,3&#8208;benzodithiolylium (BDT) cation was identified as an efficient hydroxyl&#8208;activating reagent for the photocatalytic deoxygenative radical functionalization of alcohols in the absence of any electron transfer process. A series of unprecedented photocatalytic energy transfer (EnT)&#8208;driven deoxygenative radical coupling reactions of alcohols with bifunctional oxime carbonates have been developed based on the activation by BDT. Nickel&#8208;catalyzed radical sorting followed by C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond construction facilitates the heteroselective cross&#8208;coupling of two distinct alkyl radicals originating from parallel radical relays. These reactions allow the versatile synthesis of diverse nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules, including amino acid derivatives, imines, nitriles, and pyrrolines, by using ubiquitous alcohols as regiodefined alkyl building blocks.

         <title>Oligoether Chain Engineering in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Enhancing Transport Pathways and Oxygen Reduction Activity for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligoether chain engineering in covalent organic frameworks with hydrophilic ethylene oxide&#8208;based structures enhances mass diffusion and facilitates the formation of OOH* intermediate in the oxygen reduction reaction, leading to accelerated reaction kinetics and high selectivity for the two&#8208;electron pathway in hydrogen peroxide production.








Abstract
Oligoethers with various numbers of ethylene oxide (EO) units, known for their flexibility, electronegativity, and hydrophilicity, can be leveraged to construct complex molecular architectures with broad applicability. In this study, we present the synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) incorporating oligoethers with EO segments of varying lengths (2D&#8208;COF&#8208;EOs) to explore the role of EO units in modulating the two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway for electrocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. By embedding hydrophilic EO side chains into the hydrophobic frameworks, intermolecular interactions are promoted through hydrogen bonding, leading to the self&#8208;assembly and spatial aggregation of these side chains. The high crystallinity of the COFs facilitates orderly stacking of the skeleton, creating hydrophilic nanoscale transport channels that enhance ORR kinetics. Among the synthesized COFs, 2D&#8208;COF&#8208;EO1, which contains one EO group, exhibits a remarkable H2O2 production rate of 5820&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity of 89.2%. Theoretical calculations and in situ electrocatalytic experiments reveal that the elongation of the EO units significantly alters the electronic structure of carbon atoms adjacent to oxygen atoms, lowering the energy barriers associated with the formation of OOH* intermediates and thus promoting the 2e&#8722; ORR pathway.

     alt="Oligoether Chain Engineering in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Enhancing Transport Pathways and Oxygen Reduction Activity for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oligoether chain engineering in covalent organic frameworks with hydrophilic ethylene oxide-based structures enhances mass diffusion and facilitates the formation of OOH* intermediate in the oxygen reduction reaction, leading to accelerated reaction kinetics and high selectivity for the two-electron pathway in hydrogen peroxide production.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oligoethers with various numbers of ethylene oxide (EO) units, known for their flexibility, electronegativity, and hydrophilicity, can be leveraged to construct complex molecular architectures with broad applicability. In this study, we present the synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) incorporating oligoethers with EO segments of varying lengths (2D-COF-EOs) to explore the role of EO units in modulating the two-electron (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway for electrocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) production. By embedding hydrophilic EO side chains into the hydrophobic frameworks, intermolecular interactions are promoted through hydrogen bonding, leading to the self-assembly and spatial aggregation of these side chains. The high crystallinity of the COFs facilitates orderly stacking of the skeleton, creating hydrophilic nanoscale transport channels that enhance ORR kinetics. Among the synthesized COFs, &lt;b&gt;2D-COF-EO&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, which contains one EO group, exhibits a remarkable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 5820&#160;mmol g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR selectivity of 89.2%. Theoretical calculations and in situ electrocatalytic experiments reveal that the elongation of the EO units significantly alters the electronic structure of carbon atoms adjacent to oxygen atoms, lowering the energy barriers associated with the formation of OOH* intermediates and thus promoting the 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR pathway. This work offers valuable insights into optimizing COFs with different EO units for efficient 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR-based electrocatalytic processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decatungstate&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Pathways for Sustainable and Cleaner Recovery of Precious Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient photocatalytic recovery of precious metals from waste catalysts is achieved using decatungstates ([W10O32]4&#8722;) and advanced solvent control, enabling a &#8764;100% platinum recovery efficiency with sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly methods.








Abstract
The recovery of precious metals from waste streams is crucial for sustainable resource utilization but remains hindered by traditional methods involving high toxicity, energy consumption, and environmental pollution. Here, we present a photocatalytic strategy employing hydrothermally synthesized decatungstate ([W10O32]4&#8722;) homogeneous ion catalysts to achieve simultaneous oxidation and reduction of precious metals under ambient conditions. This innovative approach integrates solvent&#8208;controlled reaction pathways, enabling efficient dissolution and recovery of precious metals from diverse waste sources, including electronic waste (e&#8208;waste), platinum membrane electrodes, and platinum&#8208;containing catalysts. The decatungstate catalyst exhibits exceptional performance, with an apparent quantum yield of 0.027%&#8212;nearly double that of commercial TiO2 (0.014%)&#8212;and achieves recovery efficiency of 80%&#8211;100% for platinum, surpassing 21 tested photocatalysts. The process adheres to a solid&#8208;phase dissolution model and remains against ionic interference. Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations corroborate experimental UV&#8211;vis spectra, while electron&#8208;hole pair analyses elucidate atomic and molecular contributions to photocatalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) further validates the thermodynamic feasibility of the reaction pathways. By combining high efficiency, ambient operational conditions, and scalability, this work establishes decatungstates as a sustainable benchmark for green precious metal recovery, addressing the limitations of traditional methods and advancing innovation in resource circularity.

         <title>Towards High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Organic Batteries via Using I&#8722;&#8208;Based Active Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;organic battery (Zn//HATN@CMK&#8208;3 battery) is developed by using an I&#8722;&#8208;based active cathodic electrolyte. Benefiting from the high redox potential of the I&#8722;/I0 redox couple, the Zn//HATN@CMK&#8208;3 cell harvests a high average discharge voltage (0.75&#160;V vs. Zn/Zn2+) and outstanding cycling stability at a high mass&#8208;loading (10&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
Organic cathodes possess inherent structural diversity and fast redox kinetics, showing great application prospects in aqueous Zn batteries. Nevertheless, most of the reported organic cathodes display low average working voltage resulting in poor energy density. Herein, diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c] phenazine (HATN)@CMK&#8208;3 composite is utilized as cathode for aqueous zinc battery, which combines the Zn2+ and H+ co&#8208;storage and I&#8722;/I0 conversion by introducing I&#8722;&#8208;based active additive into 0.5&#160;M Zn(OTf)2 electrolyte. The in situ/ex situ analyses and computational studies disclose that HATN@CMK&#8208;3 with C&#9552;N groups not only stores Zn2+ and H+ ions at low potential but also acts as a substrate to promote the conversion reaction of I&#8722;/I0 at high potential. Accordingly, the Zn//HATN@CMK&#8208;3 cell delivers a high average voltage of 0.75&#160;V, prominent long&#8208;life (10&#160;000 cycles) and, high energy density (198&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1). Remarkably, under high mass loading (10&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) or low&#8208;temperature conditions, the cell still achieves decent capacity and cycle stability.

We report the first bis(pinacolato)diboron&#8208;enabled Ni&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective reductive [3&#160;+&#160;2] annulation of &#946;&#8208;bromoenones with alkynes, providing convenient access to synthetically valuable chiral five&#8208;membered cyclic tertiary alcohols via axial chirality transfer to central chirality. A broad substrate scope, late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules, and diverse transformations highlight the utility of this reaction.








Abstract
Chiral five&#8208;membered cyclic tertiary alcohols are important structural motifs in functional materials, pharmaceuticals, and bioactive molecules. Hence, developing efficient methodologies for synthesizing compounds featuring these privileged scaffolds represents a crucial pursuit within synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present a regio&#8208; and enantioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed strategy for the reductive [3&#160;+&#160;2] annulation of &#946;&#8208;bromoenones with alkynes, providing convenient access to chiral five&#8208;membered cyclic tertiary alcohols with high levels of regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivity via axial chirality transfer to central chirality. The utilization of an environmentally sustainable bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2) is crucial for the success of this asymmetric reductive cyclization reaction. Simultaneously, the mild reaction environment greatly enhances functional group compatibility. This has been demonstrated by the broad substrate scope, late&#8208;stage functionalizations of bioactive compounds or drug molecules, and subsequent transformations. Amongst, it is worth emphasizing that these functionally enriched chiral five&#8208;membered cyclic tertiary alcohols can efficiently participate in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions to synthesize enantioenriched polycyclic and heterocyclic molecules, thereby further validating the significance of introducing a cyclopentadiene skeleton. The preliminary mechanistic studies revealed the mode of action of B2pin2 in mononuclear Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reductive [3&#160;+&#160;2] annulation reactions and density functional theory (DFT) calculations clarified the origin of the experimentally observed regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.

A charge&#8208;separated, self&#8208;healing, crystalline, porous organic salt with multiple optimizing synergistic electropositive and electronegative sites is reported for benchmark short&#8208;chain alkyne/alkene separation with record selectivity.








Abstract
The separation of trace alkyne (C2H2/C3H4) impurities from alkenes (C2H4/C3H6) is a significant but challenging process to produce polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 and C3H6. Herein, we reported an optimally designed charge&#8208;separated organic framework, crystalline porous organic salt (CPOS&#8208;1), with confined polar channels for highly efficient alkyne/alkene separation. CPOS&#8208;1 exhibits excellent stability, remarkably high C2H2 (18.4&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1) and C3H4 (20.9&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1) uptakes at 0.01&#160;bar and 298&#160;K, and benchmark C2H2/C2H4 (25.1) and C3H4/C3H6 (43.9) separation selectivities for 1/99 alkyne/alkene mixtures. The practical alkyne/alkene separation performance was completely identified by breakthrough&#8208;column experiments under various conditions with excellent cycle stability and high alkene productivities (C2H4: 216.6&#160;L&#160;kg&#8722;1; C3H6: 162.4&#160;L&#160;kg&#8722;1). Theoretical calculations indicated that pore aperture in CPOS&#8208;1 acts as a tailored single&#8208;molecule trap, where alkynes are captured by multiple synergistic electropositive and electronegative sites, thus enhancing alkyne recognition. Furthermore, the ease of rehealing facilitates its practical application, transcending the limitations of the metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs).

&lt;p&gt;The separation of trace alkyne (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) impurities from alkenes (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) is a significant but challenging process to produce polymer-grade C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.

In this scientific perspective, we intend to provide a coherent framework for the field of magnetocatalysis by highlighting opportunities associated with the use of magnetic fields to activate catalysts. A particular focus will be placed on magnetically induced catalysis, providing an overview on current advances and identifying scientific and technical challenges on the path toward a widespread use of this technology in research and industry.








Abstract
The rapidly growing importance of electrification in the chemical industry opens room for disruptive innovations regarding energy input into catalytic processes. Energy efficiency and dynamics of renewable energy supplies represent important challenges, but the design of catalytic systems to cope with such new frameworks may also stimulate the discovery of new catalyst materials and reaction pathways. In this context, many opportunities arise when catalysts are activated in a rapid, localized, and energy&#8208;efficient manner. Among the various concepts to achieve adaptivity in catalysis, magnetic induction heating applied directly at the catalyst or in vicinity of the active site has gained increasing attention recently. In this Scientific Perspective, we provide a coherent framework to the emerging field of catalysis using magnetic fields&#8212;and in particular alternating current magnetic fields&#8212;to activate catalytic materials and define it as magnetically induced catalysis. Promising approaches and selected examples are described to illustrate the scientific concept and to highlight its broad potential for innovation in catalysis from laboratory to industrial scale.
